There is no good reason why the first report of Mr. James A. Garfield of the Bureau of Corporations should be receivedwith either ecstasy or terror . It is a sober document , telling a plain tale . It describes a condition - which all honest men deplore , and suggests a remedy which rational men will discuss without falling into hysterics Mr. Garfield does not profess to have found the philosopher 's stone of the Trust quQation His report is simply a modest but careful piece of work , bristling with statistics and fortified by legal citation , which forcibly calls attention to the need of doing something , to regulate corporations engaged in interstate commerce , and propounds a method of going to work to do it . His plan is eminently one to be debated in calmness like his own . What are its merits ? What are its defects ? First among its good points we place its advance over the earlier crude notion of President Roosevelt , that the one thing needful was to discriminate delicately between " good " and " bad " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the latter to be put under the ban . But this was the dictum of a sentimental social reformer . Mr Garfield is a lawyer , and knows that law must deal with overt acts , not with the hidden soul . Accordingly , his classifications are legal , not moral . He would not have Congress or the President undertake to read the hearts of men carrying on commerce between the States , or to scrutinize their motives , but would have laws drafted to cover a'l corporations in a given class . This is the practical spirit of the lawmaker , as opposed to the vague longings of a millennial dreamer , and as such is to be welcomed . We shall hear no more of fanciful distinctions between good and bad Trusts The one question for all is , Do they or do they not violate the law ? Another high merit of the scheme of control advocated by Commissioner Garfie 'd is that it is presumptively Constitutional . The proposal to compel corporations doing an interstate business , or engaged in foreign commerce , to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grant of power to Congress to ' regulate " interstate and foreign commerce . Congress may impose such conditions as it chooses . It may tax at will . Whether wise or not , the plan is apparently lawful . It is not one of those ' happy-thought improvisations which collapse under the weight of legal precedent and Constitutional guarantees . To compel corporations to obtain a Federal charter would be doubtfully constitutional ; but to make them submit to a kind of franchise tax , as a preliminary to the right to conduct interstate or foreign commerce , is seemingly within the powers granted to Congress It is something to get a plan which does not at once cash its - brains out against the wall the Constitution , or does not depend upon that almost impossible thing , th adoption of a Constitutional amendment . But while thus praising Mr. Garfiel for sticking so closely to what is within Congressional power , we are by no means so confident as he appears to be of Congressional wisdom His plan is only an outline . It scarcely touches oetails . Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Corporations affirms that a statute enacting his ideas would have to cover such diverse and ' difficult topics as " offering securities to the general public " ; " affecting labor conditions in two or more States " ; " affecting prices of goods or raw materials in two or more States " ; as well as " lack of- personal responsibility of managers , improper use of stock as a kind of currency , lack of proper publicity as to terms of organization , over-capitalization , etc " It is a formidable list . Before Congress gets through the whole of it , and frames each item nicely into a general law , we think a good deal of water will have flowed under the bridge . The license to do business is to be granted , or sold , only when certain " requirements " are met ; but the entire crux lies in formulating those requirements Supposing that Congress finally lays them down in a comprehensive statute , other difficulties will immediately arise . Mr Garfield frankly admits as much . His eyes are not shut to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or holding companies in all the States where they desire to operate Most serious obstacle of all , the courts may intervene to limit the application of the law or defeat its intent by judicial decision . The Commissioner confesses that the ' opinion of the Supreme Court in the Knight case ( 156 U S , 1 ) is " apparently opposed " to the proposition that Congress may grant a " power to produce " as a means of effectively regulating interstate commerce . Into this legal question it is not for us to go The Supreme Court , as now constituted , might modify the principle laid down in the Knight case , which was , for the rest , very narrowly defined , ' and could not be extended beyond the actual facts therein involved . But it is evident that judicial review may be looked to , in all this matter , as a remedy for demonstrated injustice ; while if it is a question , as some excited commentators assert , of extinguishing overnight the rights of forty-five States , why , there are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevent that outrage . That the public mind in this country is feeling after some kind of national control of corporations which are national in their activities , we think no intelligent observer will dispute . Commissioner Garfield does not overstate the general ' dissatisfaction with existing laws and practices . Some corrective will be applied , and we must cast about to find one that is both just and efficient . Merely as an aid in this quest , the Garfield report is of great value It contains no panacea . It will not save Congress the need of racking its brain t hit upon the best method . Tremendous labor will have to be done before practical scheme of Federal control of corporations is worked out into a law able to run the gantlet of the courts . But Commissioner Garfield has collected materials and suggested a proceduawhich will lighten the toil of others ; and his plan should be sensibly considered and , if possible , perfected by sensible men . THE PAINS OF ECONOMY . A condition , not a theory , is confronting the Administration at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Treasury . " Every day 's dispatches multiply evidence of the worry which it is causing . There are many determined utterances about keeping down the appropriations , but , as Mark Twain said of talk about the bad weather , " in spite of it all , nothing is done . " Yes , something is done . In a burst of retrenching heroism , it has been decided to cut out of the army bill the $3,000,000 , or so , which " the annual manoeuvres " cost . This will be hard on the foreign ? military attaches , who will now have to go elsewhere to make their education in the art of war complete There are also rumors that the River and Harbor bill must be kept small if it is to escape a Presidential veto . A limit of $20,000,000 is said to have been fixed . Consequently , the committee will report a bill carrying only $12,000,000 , knowing that it will infallibly be log-rolled up to $20,000,000 at least . In all this rather ineffectual talk about being rigidly economical , the idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a Government to economize . Nor is it alone our own rulers who confess themselves helpless . The fated increase of public expenses is the theme of publicists and finance ministers in all countries Recurring deficits make no difference They call for new loans , or new taxes , never for a severe cutting down of the bills . Baron von Stengel informed the Reichstag that Germany 's financial outlook was " dismal " ? he would have to borrow $70,000,000 to get on at all ; yet he was confident that any reduction of expenditures was out of the question . Similarly , Austen Chamberlain , the British Chancellor of the Exchequer , and M. Bouvier , Finance Minister of France , report mounting outlay , but argue from it , not the need of pruning estimates , but of levying added taxes Now , why is it that there are no steps backward from the lion 's den of public extravagance ? In private life , a man whose affairs are embarrassed does not argue ( unless he is a fool ) that he can not possibly lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been accustomed he simply has to have . He gives up his carriage , dismisses superfluous servants . It is only all-powerful , governments that are not strong enough to retrench . The reason is largely political . Democracy has its way of fastening leeches upon the Treasury as surely as any Grand Monarque . The total appropriations represent legislation for a multitude of diverse political interests , all of them possessed of more or less power , and each of them ready to resent any diminution of its meat , in due season . They gather , in body or in spirit , about the President and the Secretary of the Treasury and the Chairmen of the Appropriations Committees , and say . " You propose to cut down expenses , do you ? You want to abolish sinecures , cut off unnecessary clerkships , and dry up the usual flow of public money into our districts ? Well , what we ask is how you expect to carry elections or get a majority in Congress for your pet measures if you treat us that way ? " Economy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not so absolutely beyond the reach of public administrators as we are told . If they were both frank and resolute , they could effect savings They must , it is true , have a mind above the taunt of cheese-paring . It is better to pare the cheese than let the mice devour it Many a paring makes a cheese . But the most important thing for those responsible for the Treasury to remember is that it is policy which fixes - expenditure , and that the true way to be economical is to modify or abandon extravagant policies . The glaring policy of extravagance at Washington to-day is that of the big navy . This is dimly perceived by the Republican leaders desirous of keeping the deficit from looking offensively corpulent . At their gathering in a House committee room the other day , to discuss ways and means of keeping down the appropriations , one of them said bluntly to the Chairman of the Naval Committee , " What is the use of the rest of us trying-to save ? Every dollar of our economies will instantly be swallowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is making its way , we are glad to see , and it is announced that a decided effort is to be made to hold the naval appropriations far below the estimates . The result will be looked for with interest . It will furnish an excellent test of the President 's sincerity in his avowed desire for economy . There can be no sound reason for spending on the navy to-day three times or four times as much as we did six years ago . The huge increase proclaims - either pure luxury or justified alarm . But there is not a cloud on our internaitiolaul torizou , The Presi dent himself glories in our peaceful relations with all the great Powers . Arbitration treaties all round bespeak the happiest state of affairs . War with England is unthinkable , and with France or Germany almost equally so . But no other nation has a navy with which ours is not more than adequate to cope The proposed new battleships are not necessary , and , with a big deficit staring us in the face , should be cut out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Dooley may be right in saying that President Roosevelt interprets the simple life to mean a tremendous navy , but economy certainly does not mean it . THE SENTIMENT TO WHICH LAW-SON APPEALS . The professional financiers who are indiscriminately lumped together in the term " Wall Street " are unable to comprehend the popular interest in Thomas W. Lawson 's articles on " frenzied finance " On the other hand , the unsophisticated millions who devour these lurid tales of greed ? and gold , are indignant that anybody should speak cynically or flippantly of a truly penitent stock-jobber . Your banker or insurance-company president dismisses Lawson with the contemptuous comment that whatever in his stories is true has long been known , and that what is new is false . " Lawson , " they say , " is obviously a blackguard ; he confesses to complicity in swindling operations ; he is possibly a blackmailer . Let him pass . " But he still remains an obstinate fact to be reckoned with . More than one sincere communication has reached us deploring our lack of faith in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work in his own way . " they plead ; " the leaSt you can do is to respect his motives and let him alone . " This popular view of Lawson has its roots in certain large social and political sentiments that are but dimly apprehended in that part of Manhattan Island lying south of City Hall . Our complacent capitalists have heard faintly and from far off the wild talk of Populists and Socialists about the money devil ; but they set this down as the raving of ignorance and hysteria The Populists and Socialists , however , have simply formulated into a political creed and voiced from the platform an unrest and distrust widespread among laborers , farmers , shopkeepers , and persons of narrow incomes throughout the country . These men and women have seen our captains of industry accumulate enormous fortunes with a speed which is to them inexplicable except on the plausible theory of dishonesty . These plain people know that stocks are watered in the most shameless fashion in enterprises that remain solvent ; and the the most barefaced swindling has been practised in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example from a thousand Poor men and women have put their slow savings into companies presumably directed by men of intelligence and probity  --  the Amalgamated Copper , for instance  --  and have seen their petty provision for the future disappear in a night . Somebody has got away with that money ; nobody is prosecuted by our fearless district attorneys The question of the duped a enraged investor is , " Who is the thief ? " Lawson is ready with an answer . The answer comes , too , in the nick of time . The United States is now recovering from an extraordinary speculative debauch . Pretty much everybody , East and ? West , was " taking a little flyer " in Steel , Copper , or what not When the bubble burst , ? there was the inevitable weeping and - wailing and gnashing of teeth . The people who fared worst were often those who could least afford losses , the extreme outsiders , who hung off till the last and were then seized by the fever of gambling and went in at the top of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the prey of their own folly , but of the machinations of the money-power They have hitherto been vaguely guessing concerning the details of the diabolical crime ; but Lawson supplies the missing data with gratifying fulness . His descriptions of the panic-stricken Addicks , with eyes as dull as those of a dead fish , his account of blackmailing receiverships , of juggling with the judiciary , of buying the votes of five States , his charges of absolutely insatiate and conscienceless rapacity , fit in with the preconceived theories , and confirm the darkest suspicions of the unfortunates who were fleeced . More significant than Lawson him-self , who may soon be a spent rocket , is this sentiment to which he has made such a successful appeal . The people whoare convinced that our laws are out of joint are  --  if we may judge by the recent Socialist vote ? an increasing class In a period of general prosperity they are quiescent ; in the pinch of hard times they muster enough strength to be formidable in our politics For this element the Lawson articles are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Northwest remarked last summer : " Every grafter in Wall Street is against Roosevelt , and con-sequently we 're for him " President Roosevelt was fortunate in having the financial support of Wall Street and the . votes of those who hate it ; but again in the future , as frequently in the past , there will be a sharp cleavage in poli-tics . When that crisis arrives , such pamphlets as " Frenzied Finance , ' it skilfully circulated , may wreck a con-servative party Bryan 's phrase about crucifying labor upon a " cross of gold " shook the whole fabric of our credit because men 's minds were prepared to names and influence to speculations that may properly be characterized as " frenzied , " just so long will " Down with the grafters of Wall Street ! " be a potent battle-cry , just so long will the utterances of a Lawson be flame to the flax . The enemies , then , which our great financial institutions , our railways , our insurance companies , and our banks , have chiefly to fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When the Goths and Vandals prepare a descent upon our " vested interests , " their most terrible weapons will be drawn from the armories of New York , Boston , and Philadelphia . The men who ? have promoted the vast and bottomless undertakings into which a credulous public has poured its dollars , are the real begetters of the Populistic and Socialistic parties . From the victims of their rapine , when the day of political judgment dawns , they may expect no quarter . RIIM AND POLITICS . The presentment of the grand jury finding that the Liquor Dealers ' Association raised a large fund for the corruption of the last New York Legislature can surprise no one who is familiar with the connection , here and elsewhere , betwcen rum and politics. - For many years the liquor interests , like the railway interests , have followed the policy of keeping the LegiAlature in good humor . Through affiliations , now with Tammany , now with the rural Democracy , and now with the Republican machine , the liquor dealers have managed to secure at each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Assemblymen . To this nucleus of defenders they have from time to time , as occasion has re-quired , added recruits either by direct bribery or by forming log-rolling combinations on bills , , of all kinds . In this dirty business , partisan lines have largely been obliterated ; for when the pinch has come , Republicans have vied with Democrats in subserviency to the traffic in drink . Men who suppose that by amending or abolishing the Raines law , or by any other legislative enactment , we shall heal or even plaster over this open sore , have little knowledge of the history of the liquor question For hundreds or years alcohol and the vices which it nourishes have vexed Christendom , especially its municipalities . In 1635 , to give one example from a ' thousand , Lord Keeper Coventry denounced ale-houses as " one of the greatest pests " of London , and indeed of England . Seventy years later , Defoe called tippling a " national vice " and spoke of it in terms which are entirely applicable to-day . To deal with an evil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tradition , so and no license have all been tried , and have , in one point or another , failed . In several of the Maine cities a system of fines has established virtual license under nominal prohibition . In some country districts of the same State liquor is sold under practically no restraint except the slight Federal tax . But , whatever the law , the situation has from time immemorial been the worst in the congested portions of large cities . We may , however , take courage from noting certain slow but steady remedies at work . One of the most potent of these is the growth of common knowledge as to the disease and crime caused by drink , and a consequent improvement in public bentiment on this point . It can no longer be said , as it was two centuries ago , that drunkenness is " a well-bred vice . " The Squire Western of Tom Jones , ' though no longer a credible character , is not an incongruous figure in Fielding 's broad canvas . But the days of three and four-bottle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and comparatively young men testify that , within the range of their memory , habits of drinking have improved . At Washington open drunkenness , especially among men in official station , is less frequent than it was one or two generations ago . Education of the masses is the one vital process ; for excise laws and their administration can never rise permanently above the existing state of opinion . Next to an understanding of the exact truth in regard to excessive drinking , the most important step forward is a general comprehension of the fact that no law can operate , with equal efficiency in country and city , in the small city and the large , or in different parts of the same city . The regulations which are useful in Cobleskill and Schenevus may be preposterous in Schenectady and Albany . The hours of closing which are natural for Newburgh or for the wholesale district of New York are a formidable difficulty in the Tenderloin or the Bowery . The varying character of the population , say from the Italian quarter to the Jewish quarter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sine qua non , then , for an intelligent consideration of the subject at Albany is a willingness to recognize these widely discrepant conditions . The rural lawmaker must be made to see that his personal , religious , or local prejudices . can not be enacted into laws that are universally applicable . Since each community is plagued by its own peculiar troubles , each community must enjoy a greater liberty to cure itself . An extension of local option is , then , imperative  --  power absolutely to prohibit the sale of liquor in certain dis tricts as well as power to fix hours of sale on week-days and Sundays . The amendment of the Raines law will be urged upon the Legislature that is soon to convene . As to the desirability of changes , there can not be two opinions among well-informed people ? to-day the term " Raines-law hotel " has become a synonym for a particularly offensive house of prostitution . But any movement for reform is in danger of spending itself , as so many previous efforts have done , against the granite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ win stronger support for the principle of local option . This in itself is a somewhat disheartening task . But , with local option as the wedge , the people who are striving for temperance can begin to make headway . BEGGING AS A PINE ART . The blessedness of giving is a topic so universally dwelt on at the Christmas season that one is reluctant to mention the kind of giving that is not at all blessed . Yet the two articles on the life of New York beggars which have appear ed in Everybody 's Magazine , at least gain the emphasis of contrast . Written by Theodore Waters , they purport to be an account of a sojourn for six weeks among professional mendicants . As a narrative of personal experience this may be more or less embroidered , but it does contain a deal of curious information about the ways of the profession and its rewards . There is no longer a Beggars ' Trust in New York , it appears , and other statutes than the Sherman law must be resorted to if the evil is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view of an outside observer , there are many features about beggary which appear to make at one of those callings in which closely centralized control would be particularly desirable . There is , doubtless , every morning in the pockets of four million New Yorkers a pretty definite sum which can be coaxed out of them by the right sort of pathetic appeal . There are almost a dozen different types of beggars , each one 's misfortune calculated to touch a different class of hearts . If anything like the maximum possible return is to be secured every day , sound economic principles demand that the mendicants be distributed so as to appeal to the largest number of citizens , and that each one be assigned to a district where his peculiar talents may be most effective . It was on this theory that a one-legged young man named Kempton formed his organization a few years ago . While it flourished , according to Mr. Waters 's narrative , not only were beggars posted scientifically , ? with due regard to the psychology of the particular crowds likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " lookout " as a safeguard against police interference , and roundsmen were sent out every hour to collect the receipts . This " Trust " when An operation was composed- of adepts , and no - annual report ever disclosed what were its profits . Mr. Waters was an amateur , and did business with no accessories other than a bandaged hand ; but , after an , hour of holding out his hat-in mute appeal , he had $1.17 in nickels and cents . Where a beggar has been clever enough to offer something far removed from the hackneyed starving children or boiler explosions , his rewards begin to approach those of the masters in any other branch of art . A young man who simulated palsy with horrifying verisimilitude , was - arrested one day after crawling from Fourth to Sixth Avenue , a journey so agonizing that it took him three hours . Yet the physical and nervous strain of the performance were well paid for , since his receipts in those two blocks amounted to $28 One gray-bearded " wheezer " who bent over a broken-down hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture of dejection beyond the Power of a painter to put on canvas , was found , on investigation , to be the owner of a row of houses in Hoboken . There was real genius in the " crust-throwing " act invented by a German and brought to this country by a French beggar , in which the operator first throws a crust into the mud of the streets and , a minute later , rushes out , picks it up from under the horses ' feet , and gnaws it ravenously until the attentions of kind-hearted spectators are so insistent that he needs to use both hands to take in the money they offer him Or , for horrible fascination , what picture could equal that of the Wall Street beggar who sat on the curb with his hat in one hand and his glass eye in the other Some of these men accomplish , in the open air , in broad daylight , and at close range , as perfect an illusion as the best actor can secure with all the advantages of makeup and lighting . - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those of Louis Paulian , who a number of years ago tried begging in Paris under a variety of disguises . His first essay in asking alms , which was in a church porch , netted 13 sous in 14 minutes , at the end of which time a gendarme tried to arrest him , not because he was begging , but because he looked " peculiar . " From this it would seem that , for an inexperienced mendicant , Stuyvesant Square in New York is about twice as profitable a post as the Church of Saint Germain-des-Pres in Paris . Yet , if the average remuneration is smaller and the field more crowded , the variety and flexibility of method and Perfection of organization make up for it . " There exists , " wrote- M Paulian , " an association of young Protestant girls who have had the kindly idea of joining together and subscribing to buy flowers , which they take to poor girls who are ill . If these flowers went only to the poor sick girls ; how heartily I should applaud the effort ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beggar world to know that this is not the case . As soon as the association of which I speak became known , there was found by the side of it , and naturally unknown to it , another association , whose mission it was to trade upon the first ; and so it comes about that flowers destined to cheer the garret of a poor sick girl , or to adorn the tomb of a little child , are sold in the evening at the doors of night restaurants . " People give to street beggars from a variety of motives Some men adopt the regular policy of giving five cents to every applicant , trusting that some of the money may go into worthy pockets . Others say to themselves , " This man is doubtless an impostor , but he is nevertheless cold and hungry . " The investigations of Mr. Waters show , however , that a penniless man , even if not entirely deserving , can be not only saved from hunger and cold for a night or two , but maintained in missions and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need of help who make the most of the opportunities for securing it . HIDE AND SEEK IN THE EAST . The unconfirmed report of the presence of a Japanese fleet off Singapore has called attention to the gravity of the naval problem confronting Admiral Togo . Should he await the arrival of Admiral Rozhestvensky 's vessels in Sumatran waters or in Formosan ? Or should he attempt to intercept the Russians in the Indian Ocean ? These questions must have occupied him and the Tokio General Staff ever since definite news of the departure of the - Baltic armada reached Japan . Upon Togo and his officers rests now the whole issue of the war . A naval failure will inevitably mean the breakdown of the entire Japanese campaign and the instant imperilling of Oyama 's great army . Hitherto the naval tactics called for have been simple enough , requiring merely a stringent blockade of two ports and the attacking of the enemy whenever he issued forth . It has now become a question of strategy . Everything depends upon the judgment and foresight of the Japanese commanders . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sampson , though a vastly more difficult one . In both cases the attacking forces cross long stretches of ocean and may head for one of several ports of refuge , neutral and friendly Togo and Kamimura have now to seek to divine the plans of their adversaries , and must endeavor not merely to locate them , but to locate them under circumstances favorable to the Japanese  --  if possible with exhausted coal bunkers , or at a distance from a harbor of refuge , or off their guard . For the odds are so much against the Mikado 's sailors that they must choose the best possible time and setting for an engagement , while bearing in mind once more the necessity of saving some of their ships for future eventualities The advantage of greater mobility is theirs . The readiness with which Togo has taken advantage of the mistakes of his enemy lends considerable color to the report that there ds a flying squadron off Singapore . Tho Russian fleet , unmindful of past experience , is proceeding to the East in three sections . The largest and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be passing Cape Town ten days ago , and should now be in the neighborhood of Delagoa Bay , or of Madagascar , to which island many colliers are believed to have been sent The second squadron , under the command of Rear-Admiral Folkersam , has Passed through the Suez Canal with the exception of two cruisers , the Oleg and the Dnieper , which are trailing after , and is probably well on its way to the Seychelles or the Chagos Islands , at one of which it is expected that the whole fleet will unite . Even here there is a difference of opinion among the experts , for there are some who look for a rendezvous at Minicoy , only a few hundred miles west of Colombo . Moving at the rate of sixteen knots an hour , the Japanese auxiliary cruisers reported in Singapore on Thursday should be off Colombo by Monday morning , and here they would be within three days ' steaming of Chagas , and still nearer to Minicoy . The Japanese fleet , described as consisting of two first-class and two second-class cruisers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroyers , would more than match Folkersam 's squadron were they to meet . The latter consists at present of two battleships , the Navarin and the Sisson both no longer modern ; three fine new cruisers , the Zhenitehug , Izumrucl , and AInzaz ; and one older one , the Svietlana , which is still a very respectable ship . Could these vessels be defeated and destroyed before their ? meeting with Rozhestvensky the whole naval outlook would be changed , and lus force of five Powerful battleships and four cruisers would seem comparatively easy antagonists for Togo , who has , it must be remembered , but one other battleship if Kamimura is off with two . Should the Japanese decide to await the Russians and risk all on one encounter between both fleets at their full strength , there are several places where they paid lie in wait for their prey . So sound an expert as Mr. Henry W Wilson , the well-known English writer on naval strategy , believes that the Russians will certainly head for Saigon , 3,200 miles distant from Chagos by way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore friendly . To do so they must pass through the Straits of Sunda , where they could easily be blocked . At Saigon , Rozhestvensky would be within 3,400 miles of Vladivostok , by way of the Izu Isles and the Tsugaru Straits This would be the most dangerous part of his journey . It he is allowed to reach Saigon unmolested save by scout ships , he must prepare to fight for the rest of his voyage . If he should go by way of Formosa , the Japanese would be battling in their own waters . If he chose to go north of Borneo and south of the Philippines , which would very much increase the distance , Rozhestvensky would have to coal at sea or under the lee of some island , and he s'ill could not approach Vladivostok ' without having to pass through one of three straits  --  the Tsugaru , those of Korea , or of La Pe-rouse at the northern extremity of Japan . The latter are on the edge of the ice-line . Obviously , it will be at best a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sail-power the search problem before Togo would have been still more difficult , since ships could then keep the sea for months without going near a port . Now waiships must seek a harbor in order to replenish their bunkers , coaling at sea 1. ot yet being a secure procedure . By so doing , they reveal to the world their whereabouts , unless they choose the few remote harbors still unconnected by a cable or telegraph with the outer world . There are several of these in the Malay archipelago in which the Russians may seek a flying base without fear of being molested by Holland . The attitude of the neutral Powers will have a vital influence upon Japan 's fate , for there are strong doubts in some quarters as to the Baltic fleet 's ability to reach the East if all countries should be as prompt to insist on the letter of international law as were Germany at Kiaochou and the United States when the Lena arrived at San Francisco . As for the time of the final conflict , there is naturally a wide difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ March as the period of his arrival in Japanese waters If Admiral Togo plays a waiting game , this date should not be far amiss . So diverse a fleet , so badly manned , and so encumbered with auxiliaries of every description , must needs move at a snail 's pace . THE POETRY OF ARABIA AND THE BALLAD PROBLEM . To all appearance , I said , in a ten-minute paper read before the Section of Semitic Languages , at the St . Louis Congress of Arts and Science , the bearing ' of the poetry of Arabia on the ballad problem has never received adequate , or possibly any , recognition The Arabists are few indeed who have passed beyond the philological and historical stages to an aesthetic appreciation of the material of their labors . Some even , excellently well read in early Arabic poetry , have asserted flatly that it held no interest as poetry for us , and could be regarded only as a source for sociology and history . Others , upon whom its haunting cadences and vistas of feeling and vision have in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weakness in the presence of the great crowd ' of cold philologiane and historians The Ruckerts and Lyalls are few , the ' grammarians and sociologists are many . Nor do the students of " comparative literature , " to use the new-fangled term , seem yet to have discovered Arabia for themselves . To them , the name suggests first , and possibly last , the ' Arabian Nights , ' with which it never had anything ' to do . No FitzGerald has made an Arabian poem classical and compelled the attention of the civilized world . And against the assaults of any stray littdrateur whose curiosity may have been aroused , the barriers are as unyielding as the deserts themselves . To most ' languages a very few months ' work will give an entrance , and , the entrance once forced , the garden of poetry lies open  --  at least it will be plain what manner of garden and what wealth of promise are there . But Arabic yields itself with no such lightness . Many are the mountain ranges to be crossed ; long and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent on a grammar of bewildering subtlety , a vocabulary of utter strangeness and overwhelming abundance , and a range of ideas which conceal their common ' humanity behind veils of novel circumstance . Assuredly , no one with a light heart " got up " Arabic . Yet again , a great and evidently most misleading confusion lies in the very name . We say Arabian , we say Arabic , the two may be absolutely separate . It is safe to assert that the greater part of the Arabic literature has been written by men in whose veins was scarcely any drop of Arabian blood , and who lived under conditions and in a form of life as separate from those of Arabia as these from ours . The medieval monk in Ireland , who wrote in Latin of a kind , was hardly less a Roman or Italian than the author in central Asia or Persia , Syria . North Africa , or Spain , who wrote in Arabic was an Arab . Placed in the desert , there would have been no great difference in their strangerhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same in both cases . Muhammad and his successors sent and led the Arab tribes in their great raid which made them masters from the Atlantic ' co Samarcand . After the raid came the Muslim empire , in which , after a century or two , the Arabs ' themselves had little or no part. , They vanished into the new peoples or drifted back into Arabia . The official language of the new empire remained a kind of Arabic , thanks to the Qur'an and the whole system of Islam . So there were left two things . there was still Arabia , leading its simple , solitary life much as before Muhammad stirred it to action , and there was the people of Islam , of multifarious nationalities and sects , speaking in its homes multitudinous ' tongues , but using - officially and for professed literature a distant descendant of the language of Arabia From the latter come what are so commonly and erroneously called Arabian literature , philosophy , science , theology  --  thought and learning generally . To the former , the present sub Ject , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arabian in the true sense , carry ing on the blood , the traditions , the customs and life , ' the literary ideals , forms , and methods of the Arabian peninsula and race from uncounted centuries . For the student of comparative literature or the folk-lorist , the people of Islam writing in Arabic is an amorphous and gigantic jumble of unkindred races , foreign to one another as to all inheritances and ideas which are unlinked with their faith . Their popular literatures are as diverse in spirit and in form as they well could be ; what holds of one of them can never safely be predicated of another . There unite them only the Qur'an and the sciences which spring from it , their Arabic language , and their artificial Arabic-written literature  --  in part a distant and ' lifeless ' imitation of the forms of the desert ; in part a product , almost ' equally lifeless , of their common scholastic method in science and philosophy . To Arabia itself , then , and to the Arab people in its own home must the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the true Arabian poetry . The phenomena which they will meet there are strange enough . Of the beginnings of Arabian poetry we know nothing ; they must lie with the beginnings of the Arab race . The curtain rises with the appearance of Muhammad , and from that point we can trace backward some hundred and fifty years The Arabs show themselves producing a poetry that is singularly popular in origin and idea , singularly highly developed and polished , and singularly rich . Grimm 's ballad formula , " Das Volk dichtet , " holds most exactly of them , but in a different sense There is no anonymity , but there is a broad generality of authorship . Of great poets the number was undoubtedly small , but the poetic gift was Widely spread . Verses of a kind seem to have been on the lips of all , though to build the lofty , monumental qasida , or ode , called for the acknowledged poet . Their poetry , too , as has been well said , answered absolutely to Matthew Arnold 's definition , and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with life at every turn , and we , reading it , find again in it the true days and nights of the desert . Our best commentaries on the old poems are the records of present-day wanderings there Further , we have in it the strange phenomenon of a literature as perfectly popular in origin and use as our ballads , which yet obeys rigid norms of metre , rhyme , and form , and has crystallized into narrow conventionalities of structure It is true it is not literature in the precise sense . These verses were chanted and sung , stored in the memory , and passed from lips to ears . Not till after the time of Muhammad , when the need of interpreting the Qur'an and fixing the structure of classical Arabic had arisen , were they finally reduced to written form . Before that they existed in stray copies such as those which the gleernen of medimval . Europe carried as their guides , and of which one is our only source for ' Aucassin et Nicolette . ' They were sung as our ballads were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the perfection and finish of their aesthetic structure equalled that of the lyrics of the most polished and artificial ages . In the steppes and wadis of the desert seemed to spring spontaneously the elaborate blossoms of gardens and hothouses . Yet this , it is to be remembered , held of their structure only In reality and life and earnestness they were no hothouse product They sprang in free air and sun , they knew the winds and rains of life , sedulous care surrounded them , but it was from hands hard and smooth with the sword-hilt and the spear , the care of men and warriors , of no singers of idle songs and players with metres and rhymes It is precisely there that their fruitful paradox lies for the student of literatures But into a characterization in the broad of the poetry of the ' Arabian desert , it is unnecessary here to go The English reader can turn to Sir Charles Lya11 's translations in his ' Ancient Arabian Poe try ' ? brilliant alike for scholarship and poetic art  --  published in 1885 , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' recently published Mr. Blunt has shown neither the scholarship nor the patient care of Sir Charles Lyall , but he has -a first-hand knowledge of the desert which has pointed his renderings Again , though this poetry can be traced only to some century and a half before Muhammad , it is very certain that it had existed in essential likeness for uncounted generations earlier . Such hill flowers , as they blossom , so they fade , the memories of men cease to carry beyond limited years ; only the accident that the immediately pre-Muhammadan growth was preserved in the herbarium of the early Muslim students of the classical language has saved it for us It is true that Muhammad and Islam itself seem to have been but features in an Arabian renaissance , that Muhammad was one of its poets , spoiled by some strange inheritance and environment for art and beauty , and transformed into an Old Testament prophet ; that he then , in turn , made the . great Arabian movement what the West has known at . But who can tell how many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had blossomed and died again , as the generations passed ? So , at least , has been the after history . In the records of Arabic literature but a few generations after Muhammad , the names of new Bedawi poets ' cease to appear . The old poets became inviolable classics , but the desert and its life turned for the Muslim mind to memories only . Caravans must needs traverse its wastes , but its peoples are thought of only as robbers , terrible in courage , untamed and untamable Yet , all the time , the old traditions were being carried on , and poems were being produced in the same unchanging moulds . This is plain from what we find there now . In the course of last century the desert was opened again to Europe by stray adventurers . In the fifties , Wallin brought back from his epoch-making journey some poems which were published in the Zeitseicrift of the German Oriental Society ( vols. v , vn ) Later , Wetzstein , German consul at Damascus , made collections and lectured on contemporary Arabian poetry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1867-68 and thereafter . Count Landberg also made very extensive collections , which , like those of Wetzstein , are still unpublished . But our most precise and widest information is undoubtedly due to the late Professor Seem in his posthumous ' Diwan aus CentralaraMen . ' Through this precious volume it be- ' comes abundantly clear that the poetry of Arabia of to-day is the same in all essen tials as the poetry of Arabia before Muhammad . From the sixth to the twentieth century the stream has flowed unchanging . The metres , the forms , the ideas , the types are all the same . Certainly , the Arab of to-day is not living through a great literary age , as was the Arab of the time of the Prophet , but if his is a day of smaller things , the smaller things are still the same His poems are produced partly in stately and elaborate metres and in a vocabulary of art which is a poetical lingua franca recognized over the whole peninsula , partly , but to a much less degree , in the simpler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancient period and now , as then , both forms of poetry are thoroughly popular in audience and in scope Thus the poetry of the desert , while retaining the old forms ' , has not separated itself from the later life ; there have been , indeed , few ' changes in outward conditions to need such a transference The use of the bow may have been lost and that of firearms have come sparingly in its place , but the Arab reivers still ride on the raid in the old fashion . And as they ride , they sing to their camels . to their comrades , and against their foes , and the tribal poets sing of them in ever-renewed odes Then these , in their turn , sink from the memories and are forgotten , and others come in their places . Like the endless generations , so unending are their songs , ever in contact with life and ever an the old moulds . But most significant of all in its bearing on the ballad problem is one outstanding characteristic : the Arabian poet , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subjective art . He can sing only of his own emotions , all has to pass through the alembic of his feeling and be reproduced as it affected him He can tell no objective story , as one without , seeing and relating what he sees , he must be in the action , and what he tells us of it is what has come to him himself . Thus , a description of warriors in battle array is wrought for us out of his own pride or fear at the spectacle . The surge and swing of a charge is pictured through what he said to his soul when the shouting line rushed on . Nature , too , we know only because the stars shone brightly on his desert path or mocked in their slow march his sleepless eyes , or because the little spots of verdure and flashing pools after rain were a joy to him and gave him thoughts such and such . A ballad , then , in our sense , was impossible to him . He was not a maker , a w.nris , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so shet'ir , the Arabic word for poet , means The event was little ; the man who saw it , understood it , told what came to him from it , was all . And so these Arabian songs were never anonymous . If the name of the author by chance has been lost to tradition , there stands at the head some formula , " There said a man of Taghlib , " or " There said one unnamed " Some one must have said it , for it tells the emotion of some one . Western ballads tell events , who tells them is of no moment . The ballad stands as a record which might have been made equally well by any one who saw the fact . And , therefore , the identity of the teller bears no stress After he has sung his song , another may take it and sing it with equal aesthetic right . The name of that first singer , maker of it ' as he was , is lost , and the song is the in heritance of the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is , flatly impossible And this can not but raise the final question , whether it is not rather in the objectivity of our Western ballads than in their popular use or any hypothetical communal origin that we are to find the clue to their anonymity .
