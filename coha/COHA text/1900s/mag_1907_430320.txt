 | THIS department of the magazine is devoted , in a general way , to the physical and spiritual health of the household and the individual . In accord with this plan is the discussion of certain problems presented by subscribers in the January issue , and considered at some length in the March number . Readers are cordially invited to refer vexed questions of health and happiness to this department . Large space is devoted to the remarkable work in behalf of happiness and health now being done at Emmanuel Church in Boston . The purpose and character of this movement were briefly outlined in our March issue by one of the promoters thereof , Rev. Samuel McComb , D. D. , his article being the first official statement of the work to appear in print . We offer herewith two articles from the pens of Rev. Drs . Worcester and McComb , respectively , the originators and conductors of the movement . For the benefit of readers who did not see Rev. Dr. McComb 's article last month , it should be explained , in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between religion and sound medical theory and practice for the cure of nervous disorders and the promotion of good morals and good cheer . Scores of people have been cured , some in a marvelous way , and hundreds of the weary and heavy-laden have thrown off their burdens and taken a new lease of life . Back of this movement , as advisers to the clergymen , is a board of leading physicians . Members of the families of a number of prominent Boston doctors have been sent to Emmanuel church for treatment . It seems to Good Housekeeping that this union of religion with sound science , ? the latest and surest of the world 's knowledge ? is the most tremendous alliance yet made for the benefit of suffering humanity . That clergymen and lawyers so recognize it is shown by the fact that centers for work of this kind are being established in Chicago , Providence , Rhode Island , and other places . Good Housekeeping has been chosen by Rev. Drs . Worcester and McComb as the periodical through which the good news shall be spread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in establishing centers in introducing the work in their churches or districts . The Editor welcomes correspondence and will render all possible assistance . What this movement may mean to the humanity and the church , is not difficult to reckon ; we believe it is destined to revitalize the Christian church , which has waited many centuries for an opportunity to emulate the service of the Master in healing the sick . What it may mean to physicians , or the medical profession , is a subject so large and so new that another month must pass before we can give adequate consideration to it . @# I AM going to speak on some of the most important stages in a moral recovery . What distinguishes the work we are trying to do is its religious and ethical character . We do not aim at keeping a mental and physical repair shop , at relieving this or that symptom , or at giving you merely temporary relief . What we do desire to do is to make you better men and women , and to help you to build up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only disease , but enslaving habit and every form of moral evil . Now I need not tell any intelligent person that this can not be done in a day . That is why we neither look for nor desire sudden spectacular " cures . " Such recoveries are like immediate conversions ; they are seldom permanent . For my part , I would rather depend on a more quiet , gradual upbuilding of the moral and physical life , and this requires time . Our bad habits are often of long standing . They have written their record upon our conscious and unconscious memories . They have impressed themselves upon our brain , our spinal cord and our whole nervous system , and these records are not to be obliterated by one stroke of the sponge . Yet only this week a woman , who had suffered for two years from prostration , intense nervousness and insomnia , said to me : " This method is so easy and so simple that it makes me laugh . " I said to her : " Did you never hear Jesus say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light " ? " Yes , " she said , " I have heard it , but I never believed it . " It is wonderful that the most advanced scientific thought of our day should be the means God has chosen to lead us to a clearer perception of the value of our religion , but it is so . Psychology and physiology are restoring to us faith in the sr.  | healing miracles of Christ which criticism threatened to undermine . Better comprehension of the nature of Christ 's mighty works has only strengthened our faith in them . The calm , earnest , believing , unselfish type of character created by Jesus is now generally recognized as the type best able to resist hysteria , insanity and disease . Therefore , we are able to gain two bases for our work , one religious and one scientific , each of which supports and helps the other . Before we can profit by this or by any other moral treatment , we must try and examine ourselves , in order that we may know what is amiss in us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be painful , but it is necessary . Once at least we must stand face to face with our own soul . We must not fear to look fairly and squarely at every evil sore . We must not turn away our eyes from the impurity , the cowardice , the unreasonable fear , the cruelty , impatience , anger and despair that lurk within us . Why should we deceive ourselves as to our real condition ? Why should we be willing to go through life with an enfeebled personality full of fear , full of distrust , when with so little effort we may be free ? One gloomy , morose person can ruin the atmosphere of the entire home . Have we any right to play this sad part , to depress and discourage others when we might make them happy ? So , dear friends , I recommend one earnest , honest , self-examination , but let us not linger over it too long . Nothing is more dangerous or more futile than morbid brooding over the past . Let the dead bury their dead and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great transformation comes not by sadly meditating on the past , but by bravely beginning a new life . That is where so many persons fail . They see their own shortcomings . They believe in a general way in the grace and the promises of God . But they fail to improve , they can not even make a beginning , simply because they can not make the necessary connection between God 's fullness and their emptiness . There must be some point of contact between the Divine Spirit and our spirit , and that contact takes place in the will . Take an extreme case of alcoholism or of a person addicted to morphine or cocaine . If a man earnestly desires to break the habit that is ruining him , he can be wonderfully helped by suggestion , sleeping or waking . Instead of a frightful struggle , relapses , agonizing suffering , the recovery in perhaps six cases out of ten is easy and permanent . But to be helped at all he must help the helper . He must earnestly desire to be delivered , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by this means is impossible . So it is with all other normal diseases . If the first step is self-examination , the second Is an act of faith , an earnest resolve to be well . How many persons have I seen during the past few weeks who are sick simply because they can not make up their minds to be well . They can not stop pitying themselves and rehearsing in their minds the sad and bitter details of their illness . But these thoughts are poison , virulent poison to your whole system . They awaken you like pistol shots at night , and make you sad and irritable by day . Friends , I can not tell you too often , it is your fears , your sad thoughts , your repinings , your irritable complaints that are making you ill . For those thoughts do not arise without their physical concomitants . They set your weary nerves to jangling , they throw the most tired cells in your poor brains into convulsive , harmful activity . That is why it is so bad for you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That is why many experienced physicians will not permit their nervous patients to receive visits from their friends ; not that the sight of a friendly face is injurious , but that such visits lead to conversation about suffering and disease . If you should cease to repine , and take refuge in God , your nerves would soon grow calm , your anguish would disappear , and your wasted body would soon take on the form and vigor of health . But I can almost hear some of you saying ? does not this doctrine , after all , rest on a fundamental misapprehension ? Are you not putting the cart before the horse , and substituting the cause for the effect ? What is really the matter with me is that my body is out of health , and my brain and nerves are one torturing discord . When I was well and slept all night , I was happy enough . I had no bad thoughts , I did not complain ; but now I can not help complaining because my sufferings are greater than I can bear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy when every fact of my physical and moral life makes me unhappy and drives me to despair . It is true , dear friends , I do make this demand of you , but I make it not to mock you , but because there is no other way . I know that soul and body are both real things , as we count reality . I know that they are bound together by ten thousand ties , and that for every event in the one , there is an event  | in the other , and that for every wound in the one the other bleeds . But in the treatment of disease there is this difference : whereas the state of the body can be directly changed and radically improved through the action of the mind , it is usually difficult and often impossible to control the mind through the body and in these diseases it is the normal and mental symptoms that are dangerous . If you will tell me of a drug that will correct evil habits , bring peace to the conscience , or expel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bottle of that medicine for every one of our patients before I go to bed to-night . Rest and hygiene can do much , but the beneficial action of medicine in this field is very limited . Bromide is a mild sedative , often useful as a palliative , but it works no cure . Trianol may give us a needed night 's sleep , but it will not dispel insomnia . And when we come to a more powerful narcotic like morphine we are dealing with a dangerous poison that invariably claims a heavy penalty for any temporary relief it may afford us . Nor is it true to say that faith in God , peace of mind , freedom from corroding care are impossible even in acute diseases , provided the patient still enjoys the possession of his faculties . Lastly , dear friends , Patience ! Rome was not built in a day , and do not let yourselves be discouraged if your first earnest efforts to be well and free are not at once crowned with success . I told you at the beginning this thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially in sickness , is an art , and like other arts it must be cultivated . And yet when we compare the few earnest efforts it will cost to place your feet on the rock of peace and salvation , with the weary years many of you have already spent in combatting disease , the time seems short and the effort slight . i beg you to believe that I am not speaking to you of a peace which I have not found and which I have not seen take possession of many another . The thought of a loving and all-powerful God , above us , within us , all around us Who desires our health and happiness , of a God who has means to dispel our anguish which He incessantly employs , is a thought which can give us help greater than our greatest deed . This , then , is the way : self-examination , faith , courage , perseverance . Let me ask you to try this way , assuring you that if you try earnestly you will succeed . This is our first meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to begin the new life ? Would it not be well to say this very night , I will be well , . I will be free , I will overcome ? Morbid Fears and Their Cure By Rev. Samuel McComb , D.D . Associate Director of the Class for the Moral Treatment of Nervous Disorders Emmanuel Church , Boston FEAR is one of our most elemental and primitive of emotions . It is common to all animals , even the lowest in the scale of psychic life . Without it no organism could survive . It is the great education power both in the brute and in man . Indeed some of the grandest discoveries and inventions of science are the product of fear because they are designed to prevent those violent arid imperative calls for adjustment to sudden emergencies ? calls which tend to disable the very activity which they excite . To fear aright means to increase one 's chances of survival , whereas to fear wrongly is to weaken the forces that make for selfpreservation . There can be no doubt that we inherit the instinct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Every mother and every nurse knows the instinctive fear of falling shown by the infant on the knee . In this tendency and in the babe 's power of clutch , biologists see a survival of the time when man was an arboreal animal and when he put his young to sleep on the branches of trees or on ledges of rock . Within limits , then , fear as a primary instinct is eminently useful . As Dubois , the French specialist , puts it : " It is the cry of alarm uttered by sentinels the instant they perceive the approach of danger . The psychic emotion takes hold of the guard-house , and clears it for action by virtue of its motor reactions . These are the last manifestations of which the lookers-on are conscious , and which perceived at the same time by the soldiers , are bound to stir up in them more agitation and add still further to their excitement . " Yet this is only half the truth . If it is an advantage to the animal organism , it is also a disadvantage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scarcely wounded by small shot , fall to the ground as though struck by lighting , panting with wide open mouth . Then again many animals run away through fear when running away can do them no good , nay , sometimes when their efforts to escape land them in a worse peril . " We might almost say , " remarks a great psychologist , " that nature had not been able to frame a substance which should be excitable enough to compose the brain and spinal narrow and yet which should not be so excited by execp-  | tional stimulation as to overstep in its reactions those physiological bounds which are useful to the conservation of the creature . " With the development of mind , fear covers a larger area and takes on a great variety of forms . The conditions that generate it are manifold . Very often fear is created by the perception of some object associated with painful experiences in the past . A lady who witnessed the terrible Johnstown disaster told me that even now a splash of water throws her into a painful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ psychological fact : " A burnt child dreads the fire . " The very sight of the fire affrights him even before the remembrance of his former painful experience recurs to him : the powers of perception have been modified by the burns which he felt when he first touched the flame . Another cause of fear is the mere suddenness with which an impression is made upon the senses . Some strong men are scared almost to death by a sudden peal of thunder , though reason assures them that it is harmless . Then again , any phenomenon that is out of harmony with normal every day existence produces frights . To see a ghost is to experience something that violates the ordinary sequences of life . We are suddenly called upon to adjust ourselves to a new , unparalleled event , and yet the very novelty , the utter strangeness of the experience paralyzes all the faculties whereby adjustment might be made . How can we adjust ourselves to the presence of a ghost ? The thing is impossible . Fear is our portion : in its presence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the fretful porcupine . " When we take a comprehensive glance at life we see that man is born to a heritage of fear . I remember that one of the greatest miseries of my childhood was fear of the dark ; and to punish a child by shutting him up in a dark closet is in many instances to commit a cruel and senseless crime . Victor Hugo when he tells in Les Miserables of how little Cosette was sent out alone at night to fetch water from a spring in the wood , says , " she felt seized by the black enormity of Nature . It was not only terror which possessed her ; it was something more terrible even than terror . " How may this fear of the dark be cured , or at least mitigated ? Only by patience , gentleness and wisdom . In the first place , all nurses who tell stories totheir young charges of Raw Head and Bloody Bones should be vigorously suppressed as persons highly dangerous to the common weal . In the next place , the child should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by touching the various objects learn that darkness is simply our inability to see things . A few suggestions administered in- a firm voice to the child when asleep will be found to be of the greatest value . Let the suggestions be repeated two or three times a week and in a month or so the . child will have lost his dread . Finally , all morbidity of imagination should be checked , and the child 's mind strengthened and developed by simple , practical , scientific reading . With the growth and development of the body , these childish fears gradually disappear in the vast majority of cases . They disappear , however , only to be supplanted by others . Who can classify the fears of the grown man or woman ? They are as multitudinous as are their desires . Perhaps what a woman fears most is wrinkles , and so she worries herself over endless devices to ward off the fatal enemy , forgetting that the proper cultivation of her soul is the only means with which anything more than animal beauty may be won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now , up to a certain point , this fear is a good one ; it is an incentive to action . Beyond that point it is an evil and works only harm . No public speaker , for example , can ever reach a high degree of mastery over an audience who is not , to some extent nervous ; yet over-nervousness confuses thought , paralyzes speech , and spells failure . Hence the men of business or of art must not let his fears conquer his judgments : he must by self-discipline turn his fears into a steadying and solemnizing , influence which may act as a re-enforcement to his active powers . Men are bound to fear , but they should not merely fear . The good man in the presence of a moc temptation is afraid and by his fear wins the victory ; the fool , not knowing that there in any thing to fear , falls struck through with a dart . Perhaps the three most prevalent fears are fear of poverty , fear of disease , and fear of death . All of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fear of poverty in the sense of utter want ought to lead to action with a view to securing one 's personal independence . A morbid fear of poverty , on the other hand , is a curse makes hard the heart , shuts the ear to the cry of distress , and degrades the whole man into a self-centered , grasping . money-grabber . The true correction to  | such a dread is to recall the experience of good and wise men . What saith the Psalmist ? " I once was young and now am old ; and never yet have I seen the righteous forsaken or his seed begging bread . " And what saith the Master ? " Seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you . " An equally widespread fear , especially among younger people , is fear of disease . Says Stanley Hall : " Dread of diseases , which is often intense and secret , is greatly increased ( in youth ) and may become a causative factor , so that if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adolescence it can do much . " Perhaps the greatest cause of this fear is too much attention to passing sensations . This is a common characteristic of neurasthenic persons . A Might palpitation of the heart is so magnified by attention being fixed on it that the patient imagines he is about to swoon away : another individual hears of a friend who has died from some liver disease and at once he dreads lest the same fate overtake himself . Some persons are afraid of being afraid . This particular fear is known among medical men as phobophoi . Now it is a well-established fact that fear of disease has a tendency to generate the thing feared . Some years ago a cruel experiment was tried upon four Russian criminals condemned to die for political offenses . The cholera was raging at the time in Russia and the criminals , while ignorant of the fact , were made to occupy beds in which persons had recently died with the disease . Although thus exposed to the contagion , not one of them exhibited the least symptom of the malady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in beds that had been occupied by persons who had been sick with the cholera . But , in fact , the beds were entirely new , and had never been used by any one . Their fear proved to be a more powerful influence than the contagion , for three out of the four took the disease in its most fatal form , and died in four hours after the attack . This incident was reported , shortly after its occurrence , in the London Medical Times . It shows the dangerous character of fear of this type , and points to the true remedy . Morbid thoughts can be driven out only by other and healthy ones . Substitute for the fear the thought of some duty not yet achieved , or the thought of the divine presence which is near us alike in our going out and in our coming in . Cultivate that condition of mind which , conscious of God 's fatherly regard , feels safe in his hands , and is willing to meet good or evil as he wills it . Then evil ceases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The mind that has become morbid plays strange and fantastic tricks . Many persons are afflicted with the horrible dread that they may lose their reason . It is impossible to calculate the amount of suffering this fear causes . And yet it ought to be emphatically stated that very rarely does the thing feared- come about , and those who suffer from this obsession may safely disregard it . There is a class of well-defined " phobias , " as they are called with which nerve sufferers are plagued : " monophobia " or fear of being alone ; " claustrophobia , " or fear of closed in spaces ; a " goraphobia " or fear of crowds or of broad open spaces ; " insomniaphobia , " or fear of not going to sleep ; and many others . I know a clever and keenwitted man who can not leave a room by any other door than the one by which he entered ! Should he inadvertently , do so he must forthwith return and correct his mistake . One great remedy for all these and similar mental miseries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought , by reading , by speaking aloud , with whatever he desires to realise , so that this becomes the dominant idea , and in many instances the nervous fear will pass away . The best time to apply auto-suggestion is in a semi-wakeful state , either when about to fall asleep or when awaking from sleep . There is one fear which is absolutely universal : it is the fear of death . This fear is generally supposed to be an attribute of animal life alone , and even of only the higher forms of animal existence . In reality it is strongly developed through organic nature , even to the lowest forms of vegetable life . The plant distorts its leaves that it may reach the light of the sun . the wounded tiger makes one last effort against its foes , and as for man , " The weariest and most loathed worldly life That age , ache , penury and imprison-ment Can lay on nature , is a paradise To what we fear of death . " For the meanest as well as the greatest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And yet , powerful though death is , there is one force more powerful still , and that is love . We need a continuous force within us , strong enough to mold our thoughts , to  | train the power of the will so that death shall seem to us what it seemed to the men of the early Christian ages . " There is no fear in love ; but perfect love casteth out fear , because fear hath punishment ; and he that feareth is not made perfect in love .
