txt Gov . ODELL has been re-elected , but with an exemplary reduction of plurality which shows him to be weaker than his party . Had the vote in the State of New York reflected no more than the general diminishment of Republican strength as shown in other States . Gov . ODELL would have been elected by the highest plurality claimed for him in the estimates of his sanguine managers . But he has lost nearly 100,000 of his plurality of two years ago , and has in fact narrowly escaped defeat . No Governor of New York within a generation has been elected by so slender a plurality . There is only the shadow , not the substance . of a triumph for Gov . ODELL in his re-election . It is technically a victory , but actually a warning and a rebuke . He needed the lesson : we hope it will do him good . With the opportunity cf his great office , Gov . ODELL should have been stronger , not weaker , than his party . Had he been entirely faithful to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has been known to all men that he has throughout his term been a politician in office . He has sought personal and party advantage without too nice a regard for duty and the public interest . For political ends he attempted to usurp a dangerous control over the judiiary . The people have resented that . For political ends he has grasped the control of the State hospitals and charitable institutions . That has been resented . His party should have joined with the Democrats in the renomination of Judge GRAY . The Governor went with his party in that matter , and the re-election of Judge GRAY is a rebuke to him , to PLATT , and to the Republican machine . His attitude toward the improvement of the canals has been ambiguous , if not secretly hostile . That has counted for something in the chastisement that has befallen him . Public distrust , moreover , was aroused by his unsatisfactory reply to the charge that he was financially interested in a Newburg grocery from which State supplies were purchased . - All these weaknesses , errors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public judgment of him has been unfavorable . Instead of entering upon his second term with a renewed vote of confidence and a justified hope that some higher ambition might be gratified , the result of yesterday 's voting must be held to indicate that his political career will come to an end when he goes out of office . It is scarcely possible for him by ' any exhibition of diligence and faithfulness or by any degree of excellence in administration to reverse the estimate of him recorded by the people yesterday . He was a perilously weak candidate in his second canvass . His party will not have the hardihood to present him to the people for a third time . To ex-Gov . HILL the people of the State have also administered a rebuke ? it is too late to speak of warnings in his case . He has lost to his party the great State of New York . which he plainly might have won . With Judge PARKET ? . or Mr. SHEPARD as the candidate , an awakening canvass of the State would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Democratic victory would have been achieved . Mr. CoLpa was by no means a strong candidate . He was a weak one . But if he could so nearly overcome Mr. ODELL 'S former plurality of 111,000. unquestionably a strong candidate , having in a high degree the confidence of the people , would have reversed the figures altogether . Mr. COLER , moreover , was weighed down by the deadly coal mine plank . For that affront to the intelligence and the convictions of the electors Mr. HILL must ba held responsible . The plank could not have been made a part of the platform without his assent . That alone was quite enough to defeat the party . Mr. HILL has missed his opportunity : stupidly missed it  --  and it is to the last degree doubtful whether he will ever have another . He has done much service to the party by his work of reorganization , by the assiduous toil which has lifted it out of the ditch in which COLER left it . We know of no other Demo. crat in the State who could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Can immense misfortune for the party that the labor could not have been more wisely , more intelligently guided .
