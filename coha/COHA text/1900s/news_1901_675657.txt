txt Does a conference deferred make the heart of a boss sick ? This is a question of contemporaneous human interest . Only a few days ago in Washington Senator PLATT , in the intervals of announcing the punishment he and Senator DEPEW would administer to the President in case Col. SANGER 'S name was sent to the Senate , remarked that there would be a State constabulary law passed at Albany before the close of the session , and his confidants in the press hastened to add that there would be a conference at the Fifth Avenue Hotel yesterday , at which the matter would be arranged . Now it turns out that there is to be no conference , that the Governor will come no nearer than Newbqrg , that all the leaders in the Legislature have discovered subsequent engagements and will not come to New York . Mr. PLATT , when questioned on the subject yesterday , was reserved , not to say cross , and declined to say more than that there " might " be a Constabulary bill passed . As a political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trust that there is something more to it than comedy . It has been a bad thing for the State of New York that Mr. PLATT has had so much power in the Republican Party as he has had . He has , made a bad use of it . It is true that the people themselves are to blame , and that he could not have used the control he has secured if they had chosen to forbid it . But he has , and long has had , a great talent for organizing the selfish interests of men and factions in such a manner as to sway their actions , and he has been favored by the absence of a sound and healthy opposition party . With Tammany in this city , and with the paralyzing influence of Bryanism throughout the State , Mr. PLATT has been required only to get the mastery of his own party organization in order to retain his power . There has been little danger of revolt when there was no decent opposition to turn to . The result has been costly and discreditable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold of Mr. PLATT is really weakened , or that Gov . ODELL is really determined to assert his own rights and to contest the supremacy of the Senator . But the signs in connection with the Constabulary bill certainly point that way .
