If an old judge of Chancery were to sum up this case , he would begin by saying that it never should have been taken into court . It is the kind of personal squabble which is occasionally aired in public , but which the principals , especially if they are high in office , should scrupulously hide from the gaze of the curious . Many of the letters should obviously not even have been written ; the thought of publishing them should have filled all parties to the controversy with dismay . The President truly says that this rushing into print with private correspondence is " a peculiarly ungentlemanly thing , " although he thereupon proceeds to quote personal letters of Mrs. as well as Mr. Storer . Mr. Storer and his wife displayed shocking taste  --  the point of diplomatic propriety never seems to have occurred to them  --  and the lamentable thing is that Mr. Roosevelt did not concede them a monopoly of it . By such a course his personal and official dignity would have been much better conserved . As it is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhibition of official manners , The correspondence is out , however , and attentive reading of it shows that , on the merits ( of the public controversy ( as distinct from the personal wrangling ) some points are scored by each side Mr. Roosevelt is able easily to put Mr. Storer in the wrong in the matter of the letter to " Dear Bellamy " of January 29. 1904 . It was not a condonation of the Vatican intrigues , as Mr Storer asserted ; the President clearly proves that the " closed incident " was a different affair altogether . In other respects , the President comes off badly . His indiscretion was amazing He writes a letter to Mrs. Storer , which he himself afterwards confesses was filled with imprudences , and in it says to her , " While I would not like to have this letter published , you are most welcome to show it to any one you see fit . " That was the letter in which he railed at " Protestant fanaticism . " In another one , he paid his respects to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such phrases at the disposal of a woman like " Dear Maria , " was giving dynamite to a child for a plaything It was not long before Mr. Roosevelt was alarmed to hear that Rampolla had copies of his letters . At once he wrote in a tremor to Mrs Storer , " I did what I ought not to have done in writing you that letter . . . . Can you not reclaim any copy of my letter ? " Afterwards this grew into a demand . " I must-ask you to return to are all of my letters in which I have spoken on any of these ecclesiastical subjects . " But the mischief had already been done . The President 's angling for the Catholic vote also appears unpleasantly in this correspondence His admiration for Archbishop Ireland was plainly mingled with hope of political support . " You may be interested to know , " he writes from Albany in 1900 to Catholic Mrs. Storer , " of the large percentage of Cgtholics . . - whom I have placed upon the various important commissions in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had " accumulated an enormous quantity of Catholic intimacy . I do not think it is exactly support ; it is rather a desire to be supported . " With all this , it is not strange that Mr. Storer came to imagine that the President 's interest in the promotion of Archbishop Ireland was largely political , or that he should have written anxiously in 1904 : " In 1896 and 1900 we got perhaps more than half of the votes of the members of my Church . Are we going to keep them ? " The worst single blow that the President gets in this unhappy dispute is where he directly raises an issue of personal veracity . Mr. Storer had asserted that , . in 1903 , at Oyster Bay , " the President said to me that if I went to Rome he would like to have me see the Pope , and say to him in person that the Archbishop was his friend , and that he would be pleased to hear that he had received the honor of prdmotion to the Cardinalate . " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " not only an untruth , but an absurd untruth . " Mr. Storer , however , has a corroborating witness  --  no less a person than Archbishop Ireland himself . The Archbishop wrote to Mrs. Storer of an interview which he had , shortly after , with ? Mr. Roosevelt at Oyster Bay , and exe illicitly declared : The President said to me , " Mr. Storer has told you what I said to him about you , Archbishop ? " I replied , " I do not remember ? " " About his going to Rome9 " I said , " No " " Well , " he said , " I told him I would not write a letter to the Pope asking for honors to you , but I said that he could go to Rome and say , lava rocs , to the Pope how much I wish you to be Cardinal , and how grateful I personally would be to him for giving you that honor " The whole is a mournful affair . If the President has any more of this dirty linen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made to sit on the cover . A democratic people is not too.fastidious , but it does want those whom it honors to observe the common proprieties of private and public life . The incident may give fresh reason to apply to the President the description which Froude his " Cmsar " of the younger ever suspected him of dishonesty or corruption But his excellences were not of the retiring sort . He carried them written upon him in letters for all to read , , asa testimony to a wicked generation . . And no one was permitted to differ from him without being guilty rather of a crime than of a mistake . THE POOR OLD CONSTITUTION . In his annual message , President Roosevelt recommended two Constitutional amendments ; and many persons are complaining that the Constitution is as worn out as the stockings of Martinus Scriblerus , or at any rate requires as much patching . In the last Atlantic , Dean Melville M. Bigelow , of the Boston University Law School , holds that the Constitution does not permit the successful prosecution of corporation criminals . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " he alleges that it " turns the prosecution into n mock suit " His position is not unlike that of the editors of the Yale Review , who asked , in their November issue , the question : Have we not reached the point at which we should frankly acknowledge that some details of the Constitution are no longer adapted to modern conditions , and instead of pursuing the demoralizing policy of changing it by construction , should openly and distinctly consider the ques , lon of amendment ? There 's the preliminary rub . Even granting that Constitutional amend-meats may be desirable , the difficulty of Securing them is practically insuperable . It took the great passion of the Civil War to carry through the last ones ' adopted , and reasonable men have given up hope of seeing others written into the organic law , unless some new national emergency , or agony , shall furnish the pen The elaborate machinery of amendment , or repeal , was intended to provide against too easy change ; and it does so effectually and , we think , wisely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other day , to his fellow-Southerners who have been prophesying smooth things about getting the Fifteenth Amendment repealed . He told them with great plainness of speech that ; if they were sincere in their glib talk , they - were living in a fool 's paradise , since there were practical as well as moral obstacles in their way which they could not possibly surmount . Even in so powerful and popular a movement , as that for the direct election of United States Senators , the tendency is now all away from a Constitutional Amendment , and in the line of political remedy By making Legislatures in practice merely agents to record the will of the people in the election of Senators , like the Electoral College in the election of President , the Country may go directly to the desired result without the long struggle and hope deferred of an attempt to amend the Constitution . This fertility of political resource in the American people , so often shown in making the old form fit the new need , is one of the consolations we may have in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But even making no allowance for that , is our plight so grievous as some would have us think ? Are the faults of which people complain so much in the Constitution itself , as in the failure of Congress to make full use of the powers granted by the Constitution ? No Constitution is self-executing . It is " the laws made in pursuance thereof " that do the business . And if the Federal statutes do in any respect fail of the great purpose " to establish justice , " we should apply to law-makers before calling upon Constitution-tinkers. - There seems to be no doubt , for example , that penal legislation by Congress could be made to meet the defects in the Federal prosecution of crime to which Dean Bigelow refers . Congress can define the crime , and fix its punishment . It can bestow jurisdiction ; provide for the expediting of eases ; extend or refuse immunity to witnesses . Weaknesses which are found in the statutes enacted one year , can be cured the next . Thus we have had the imprisonment clauses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the benevolent Senator from West Virginia was positive in 1903 that no convictions could be had if the guilty were liable to go to jail , to jail some men have since gone under that law . They have found that the Constitution of the United'States was not a worn-out and motheaten document , It is , of course , for the purpose of obtaining uniform legislation throughout the States on the subjects of labor in fadtories , education technical and general , child labor , marriage and divorce , and so on , that the chief demands for Constitutional amendment arise . But the eager amenders overlook three things ' ( 1 ) the great advantage of the varied and experimental laws of the separate States ; ( 2 ) the fact that differences in social and economic conditions may warrant differences between State laws ; and ( 3 ) the power we have of coming to practical agreement and efficient uniformity without depriving the States of their local control . It is now common to call State laws " a chaos of ( conflicting statutes " ? to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislation , like Prof. A. V Dicey , still think of , them as most valuable and instructive . It is a cock-sure legislator who should want his notions made universally binding , without first giving them a trial , in different forms , in different localities . And the penchant for making all Americans exactly alike would , if given free scope , destroy that deep unity under surface variety - which has hitherto been our glory . Our ideal of national education , for example , is not that of the French Minister of Public Instruction , whom Matthew Arnold ' interviewed , and who drew out his watch and said : " At this moment , every child in France is studying dee imal fractions . " As even President Roosevelt admits , referring to laws regulating the labor of children and of women : " Each State must ultimately settle the question in its own way . " This does not mean , however , that we may not have humane movements and associations , overlapping State boundaries , and endeavoring to work out a national consensus of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Many such exist , and their influence is daily widening . In congresses for divorce reform , and conferences for the protection of children , and other bodies of the kinds there really lies more hope of permanent moral and legal betterment than in all the plaints about a Constitution outworn . - TEE TARIFF AND TAXES . The more one thinks of President Roosevelt 's suggestion of new taxes , the more ' unfortunate does it seem that he had nothing to say about the abolition of old ones . Historically and logically , the income tax goes with the remitting of tariff taxes . This was the rationale of Mr. Gladstone 's famous first budget of 1853 . He struck off a large number of existing taxes . They were oppressive , in that , like the soap-tax , for example , they bore more heavily upon the poor than the well-to-do . Other taxes fettered trade . To enable him to remove them , while lightening the load of taxation in other ways , was Gladstone 's great object in imposing the income tax . He plainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unequal taxes , and at the same time for expanding commerce Such was also , roughly , the purpose of the income tax in our own tariff of 1894 . The aim was to lift the load of indirect and demoralizing tariff taxes ; to strike off as many as possible of the tariff chains upon industry and trade ; and to make good the resulting deficit in the revenue by levying an income tax . Viewed in that light , the process is rational . It makes the income and inheritance taxes appear , not as a socialistic device to reduce " swollen fortunes , " but as a means - of cutting away swollen privileges  --  bloated monopolies built up under the tariff . In the hands of a thoroughgoing tariff-reformer , the proposal of such taxes has a direct relation to the legitimate ends of Government at which he aims . Congressman James Breck Perkins of this State , for instance , who has introduced a bill for a national inheritance tax , had before declared himself , Republican though he is , strongly in favor of tariff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a taxer , and of sagacity as a statesman . On the other hand , the levying of any new taxes without the repeal of some existing , and without careful adjust ment of fiscal policy to the needs of the country 's trade , would be unwise from every point of view . The people are already overtaxed . The Treasury surplus is too large , whether considered as so much money locked up , or as a temptation to extravagant appropriations With the Secretary estimating a surplus of $58,000,000 in the next fiscal year , on the basis of present law , it would be preposterous to enact new taxes to swell it . That there are vast unused resources of taxation at the disposal of the Federal Government is obvious . They fairly invite to a readjustment , with an eye to relieving the people who are most pinched , and to removing every needless weight from manufactures and commerce . If we had a system under which a Finance Minister could make a scientific budget , looking widely over the sources of revenue and drawing only upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fitting taxes nicely to the demands of trade , the situation which We offer would appeal mightily to a financial genius . One like Turgot or Stein or Gladstone would jump at the chance to reform our taxation , seize our trade ' opperinnities , ' and increase our general well-being , all at one stroke . Powerful external reasons , if we are not moved by the inherent injustice of some of our tariff taxes , impel us to take their revision promstly in hand . Something- has got to be lone to avert a tariff-war with Germany . Secretary Root is fully alive to that danger . If our experts whom he has sent over to confer with the German authorities , report that the only way out is for us to take a hack here and the ' e at the sacred Dingley schedules , are the stand-patters to go on saying us nay ? Then there is the new Canadian tariff , now before Parliament . It is to have a " preferential " rate of duty for goods coming from Great Britain ; an " intermediate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn , lay only moderate tariff taxes on Canadian goods ; - and finally the general tariff much like the existing . That there is in this a hint of retaliation against the United States is plain ; but there is also a clear invitation to us to make tariff reductions of our own , and to secure the benefit of the intermediate rates in Canada . That this would mean a large increase in Canadian trade is admitted by the protectionists across the border . They are , by the way , after the fashion of their kind , disappointed that Minister Fielding did not make the general tariff higher , so that manufacturers now in this . country would be compelled to locate their factories in Canada . From the silence of the message , it would seem that President Roosevelt is blind to the tariff signs of the times . But the vigorous movement in Congress , within his own party , to have an extra session called in the spring for the purpose of trimming our tariff sails betimes to the winds that will soon be blowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a President who talked tariftteform pretty vigorously in 1902 , until he found that other issues could be worked to greater political advantage , he may yet , it is to be hoped , see how his plans for direct taxation require sweeping modification of the indirect and unjust tariff taxes , and some day send to Congress his long-suppressed tariff message . GEOGRAPHY AND DIPLOMACY . The British Foreign Office decided , a short time ago , to abandon geography as one of the required examination subjects for entrance into the diplomatic and foreign service . In commenting on this action , Sir Edward Grey , the Foreign Secretary , is reported to have said that , " although a knowledge of geography is no doubt very useful , it is a subject with which men of general education are generally acquainted , and which is easily acquired after'entry into the service . " Against , this view , Sir George Goldie , President of the Royal Geographical Society , vigorously protests in a letter to the London Times . To show how vague the geographical ideas even of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A good many years ago a territorial arrangement with France was in discussion , and I was invited to consider it , The French proposals appeared to the Foreign Office satisfactory On examination I found that they were expressed , as might have been expected , in longitudes reckoned from the meridian of Paris , while the map with which our Foreign Office were considering the proposals was made in Germany and reckoned its longitudes from the meridian of Greenwich The arrangement in question was never completed What particular motive Sir Edward Grey may have had for dispensing with more than ordinary geographical knowledge in his . subordinates , aside from that of economy , is hard to tell . Possibly he may have felt that as England had appropriated about all the desirable vacant spaces of the earth , the study of geography was no longer necessary to further Imperial interests But even from a more serious standpoint , it is quite possible to justify the attitude of the British Foreign Office , while admitting that the position taken by the president of the Royal Geographical Society has also much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the importance of expert geographical knowledge , especially in such matters as colonial policy and administration , and will always be ready to call in ' specialists , like Sir George Goldie , to solve their problems for them  --  problems which they would not dare to trust to the trained diplomatist whose personal information , with all best intentions , can not be more than " general " The " general " ideas of the ordinary man concerning the earth on which he lives , outside of the stretch of country between his home and his office , are not such as to inspire confidence . The exaggerated stories of Englishmen in New York , who , in the morning , plan to run over to St. Louis for lunch , have their basis in fact . And there is an equal amount of truth in Mark Twain 's story of the distinguished scientist from New Zealand who once visited Yale University . The news of his coming set that institution in a flutter . The visitor must be received and dined and talked to about his native land ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of himself on New Zealand . So he called up in succession the teachers of geography , of geology , of astronomy , ci moral philosophy , of fine arts , etc. , and all pleaded ignorance of everything but a rather distinct impression the , t New Zealand was somewhere near Australia and that there was a bridge to cross . Irresponsible individuals do not alone sin in this way . An English encyClopmclia , ' still in course of publication , speaks of an American statesman who " was born in Rhode Island and represented that island in the United States Senate " ; " and Brockhaus 's " Konversations-Lexikon , " which is regarded as the very rock of cyclopeedic truth ' , in its map illustrating the distribution of animal life in North America , represents alligators as gayly sporting in the Ohio in the vicinity of Louisville . Whether the illusion was due to the neighborhood of the Kentucky shore , is not certain . To most of us , indeed , the earth is still as flat as though Columbus had never sailed from Palos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shock There are the Philippines , which we persist in regarding as lying just a step or two beyond Hawaii There is South America , which , instead of lying decently south of North America , as its name would imply , persists in sticking out absurdly eastward into the Atlantic Ocean , so that a brick hurled due south by an enraged giant at Tampa , would skim right over Panama and plump into the Pacific . There is the Panama Canal itself , with Its eastern terminus lying west . of its western terminus . There is Cuba , which we instinctively locate somewhere southeast out in the Atlantic , though Havana lies nine degrees west of the meridian of New York . To base diplomatic negotiations on such general " knowledge , " Sir Edward Grey would probably admit to be unsafe . The difficulty , moreover , from the point of view of international politics , is intensified by the fact that nowadays it is not actual geographical distance that counts , but time , The Sues Canal , for the statesman , upset the geography @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done ; and , of course , the Panama Canal will do the same . What use is there in studying geography if the nearest way to Rio Janeiro from New York is by way of London ? The diplomatiits , in- all negotiations where geographical relations enter , as , for instance , in the disposition of boundary disputes , and the like , will have to depend on the expert . For him a sufficient working rule is that all territory producing gold , rubber , coal , or nitrates lies on our side of the disputed line . To determine what that line should be , one can always dig up a favorable early map or survey , or claim that the frontier runs along the crests of a mountain range instead of the actual watershed , or that it coincides with an old caravan route . FERDINAND BRUNETIERE The unexpected death Sunday of Ferdinand Bruneti6re takes off the sturdiest fighter in a field regarded of serious importance in France , though little appreciated elsewhere . Literary criticism in Germany is likely to be either metaphysical or purely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if not with resentment . The critic has a nasty fashion of caring more for truth than for easy enjoyment , and , like the madman who dreamt himself in the theatre , we prefer to revel in the mind 's gratisszmus error . But in France , until recently at least , literature has been considered a part of life , and the ideas of books are debated with violent enthusiasm The old battle of the classicists and romanticists- has become a part of history , and Gautier 's Met rouge , worn at the representation pt " Hernani , " is almost as famous as the red flag of the Commune . The contest in which " Brunetiere played so valiant a part was only a continuation of that earlier debate . Romanticism had given birth to a numerous brood  --  naturalism , impressionism , and a. swarm of lesser isms , already fading tram memory . One and all , they were a rebellion against the principle of authority , which in England Pope had summed up in his.oft-quoted coupletLearn hence for ancient rules a just esteem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Sir Joshua Reynolds had developed at length in his lectures on . art French classicism , in the mouth of Boileau , preached nature as vociferously as any modern naturalist ; but it believed that the office of art was to discriminate what was good and bad in nature , and that the great masters of antiquity - had once for all shown the way in this principle of selection . Hence - the rules ? ' the unities , the often-erroneous -Aristotelianism , the epic law , and all the pro . digious critical structure of . Le Bossu and his British followers . Now , naturalism simply repudiated the principle of selection , and so undermined the basis of authority . ' Whatever is in nature , is good ; it is the duty of the artist to imitate whatever he sees without laying upon the world any standard of moral and esthetic values . By the inevitable law of contradiction , such a man as Zola even came to a sort of inverse selection , and gloated over all that had been aesthetically prohibited . Arid naturalism is only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be called  --  of impressionism . Man is the measure of all things , said the sophists of old , and their representatives , the impressionists of to-day ; what one man thinks and feels is as good as what any other man thinks and feels , and any thought of a man is as good as any other thought . And here , too , by the same law of contraries , impressionism has gone to the opposite pole . In place of the man whose taste has been trained to distinguish and select , such disguised impressionists as Tolstoy set up the illiterate peasant as the ultimate criterion of art , and such a writer as Andreyev professedly finds the bonds of sympathy between man and man , and the theme of art , in the cruel , bestial instincts that humanity had been supposed to eliminate In France , impressionism had , and has , its critical champions Renan was the high pontiff of the school , and his dissolving influence has , until recently , been enormously , powerful - for evil , not only in literature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jules Lemaitre and Anatole France were the accomplished leaders , and never was the revolt from authority , the sophistry of moral indifference , the refinement of milversal doubt , promulgated with such suavity and distinction Despite their principles , both were scholars of trained taste , so that their doctrine captivated the public and never shocked . Their very grace made them the more dangerous . Against them and against what they stood for , M Brunetibre waged a relentless and bitter war . Seeing the danger in rebellion , he fell , himself , into the opposite extreme , and raised authority into an idol of oppression . The office of criticism , he said , is to praise u hat is personally distasteful to us  --  a hard saying and one that explains much in his later career . For it must be admitted that M. Brunetiere , the brave fighter , was , after all , half in the wrong himself . To raise the banner of pure authority to-day is to proclaim the battle lost in advance . It is in literature as in religion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place of the authority of written codes , we need to have pointed out and explained to us those unwritten laws which are founded in Man himself , and Of TWO . the rules of the fathers are but the imperfect formulation Unless a teacher , whether of religion or literature , can compel us to recognize the authority of those who have found a unity of taste and morals in the higher plane of our humanity , his enemy the impressionist will bring us to discover that common ground in a lower sphere . - With all his protests , the skepticism of the hour had so far invaded M Bruneti  --  re 's mind that he was unable to perceive and trust this inner law of authority . As a consequence , he grew with age more and inure dependent on the mere voice of the past . He became a professed reactionary , and a servant of the Church . In his later years he turned the Revue des Deux Mondes , of which ' he was editor , into a powerful organ in support of Rome and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States after his visit among us in 1897 He discovered that the providential mission and historical significance of this- country had been to Protect the Canadian Catholics against the oppression of British Protestantism ! As a literary critic , he had lost in grace by his reactionary step  --  grace , indeed , was never strong in him  --  and stiffened in his dialectic combativeness . It is too early to forecast positively his place in the future , but one may conjecture that , after the lapse of a little time , he will not he much read . His ideas , so far as they are valid , will gradually be taken over into the common body of criticism  --  his theory of the evolution of the genres has already attained such a position  --  while his lack of charm and personal magnetism will weigh down his own essays . Yet his name will be remembered and honored as of one who fought a good fight . We can not close without remarking en the singular propriety that brought M Brunetiere , the over-zealous apostle of authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that converted Anatole France , the arch-impressionist , into an adherent of Socialism LITERARY ALLUSION . Prof. William Lyon Phelps of Yale has brought up again an old complaint ? that modern youth are painfully ignorant of the Bible as a piece of literature . The stories of freshmen unable to explain the simplest Biblical allusion in Tennyson or Browning , not to say Dryden and Shakspere , are endless The incidents are amusing or depressing , according as one takes them . But the inquiries of our professors of English might , we think , ' profitably be extended into other tracts of youthful literary ignorance . The Bible is only one ? of the masterpieces of the language with which our lusty young collegians Wellla be found not to hq en epeaking terms . Try them with an ordinary quotation or phrase from Shakspere , and you will see on too many faces the look of dismay , combined with indignation , which all students feel entitled to exhibit when the professor asks a question to which he has not first supplied the answer . Like John Quincy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something strange , " and think that his " uncommon words " sound " very affect-ed ' In fact , the perils of literary allusion seem all the time to be thickening . We talk of the desirability of getting an occasional " literary feller " into public life , but how if we put him there and he makes speeches all adrip with literature , only to be misunderstood and misreported An experience of this sort has more than once befallen Augustine Birrell since he became Minister for Education As such , he has to do a good deal of speaking in the Commons and out ; and , of course , being Mr. Birrell , his mouth he can not ope without there slips , if not a trope , at any rate a poetical citation or memory , or a reference to what some writer has said . Frequently , these things miss fire terribly with his audience or the reporters . Recently , for example , Minister Birrell was speaking of Chinese labor , and said that , if Goethe 's word was true that this world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This alone was too much for one London paper , which attributed to him the rather flat remark that the British are " large landed proprietors in South Africa . " But Mr. Birrell went on to say that , granted a largo ownership in a hell upon earth , it was their duty to improve their property ; and he added that they must not be afraid " the characters of hell to trace . " He had in mind , of course , the lines in Gray 's " Bard " . Give ample room and verge enough The chmacters of hell to trace . But how does the reader suppose his allusion got into print ? Why , the British public was told , in one report , that it " must not be afraid the cracks of hell to face " !
