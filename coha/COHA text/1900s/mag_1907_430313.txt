WHEN , on August 31 , 190 ( 3 , 1 steered southward through Bering Strait , on board the Gjoa , the earliest dream of my childhood had been realized . At the conclusion of a period of three years my little craft had accomplished the Northwest Passage , being the first vessel to sail safely between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans through the arctic seas . One of the important scientific results obtained was as follows : on a sledge expedition on King William Land , in June , 1905 , a sensitive declinatorium showed the magnetic pole to be north of the observation place , while immediately afterward the needle turned , showing the magnetic pole to be to the south . This proves that the magnetic pole has no immediate situation . The mathematical working out of nineteen months of unbroken magnetic registrations in Gjoa Harbor will , I hope , give further enlightenment concerning this subject . The struggles of nations for centuries , Sir John Franklin 's lamentable fate , and the succeeding rush of search and relief expeditions had in childhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such undertakings ; and in considering the scheme for an expedition through the Northwest Passage I clearly saw that such an undertaking contained a problem the solving of which would eclipse the aforesaid exploit : I mean the relocation of the north magnetic pole . The English admiral , Sir James Clark Ross , defined in 1831 the position of the magnetic pole , performing it with in/ struments which according to modern standards would be primitive and crude . The science of to-day demanded an exact location of the magnetic pole , and I consulted on the matter Professor Dr. George von Neumeyer , Director of the Deutsche Seewarte in hamburg , who is considered the first expert in the world on questions pertaining to magnetism . This was in 1900 . Dr. Neumeyer pronounced it of the highest importance that an absolutely exact knowledge of the position of the north magnetic pole should be acquired ; and similar opinions were expressed by many other eminent scientists , among whom I may mention Professor L. A. Bauer , Director of the Department of Terrestrial Magnetism in the Carnegie Institute at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expedition should start , its first and most important object should be to relocate the north magnetic pole . If in conjunction with this I could also sail through the Northwest Passage , I felt I should have solved a problem which had long baffled the efforts of many arctic explorers . In this fashion was formulated the scheme for the future Gjoa expedition . When Ross , in 1831 , made his famous voyage to Boothia Felix and located the magnetic pole , he did it solely with the aid of a travelling equipment of instruments , the results being naturally of a corresponding degree of exactness . During the last half-century the progress of the world has been , as we know , very great in all directions , and not the least so in the construction and manufacture of scientific instruments . The German Professor Eschenhegen has done much to simplify magnetic self-recording instruments of observation , and has made it apossible for them to be transported and erected at any point desired . The sloop Gjoa ? a vessel 73 feet long . 20 feet beam , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 47 tons net burden ? was built in Norway , in the Hardanger district , in 1872 . Originally not intended for the arctic , she subseuently drifted into the sealing trade . and for several years sailed from Tromso in that capacity .  |p660  On my purchase of her I had her entire fittings removed , and strengthened her with a number of stout wooden and iron beams and cross-ties ; and with other necessary improvements she also received an outside sheathing of two-inch oak planking , reaching from the keelson to the water-line . Finally I put in a petroleumengine of thirty-nine indicated horsepower , with a two-bladed propeller , such as is customary in vessels intended for arctic waters . A special apparatus was placed near the man at the tiller , enabling him to control the engine , to start or reverse it as occasion required , and this proved invaluable and of almost constant necessity after we had entered the ice . The engine was also fitted to hoist sails and anchor , run the pump , and haul in the deep - sea lead - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ useless through the shallow waters of the Northwest Passage . The propeller , I should explain , was only to be considered in the light of an auxiliary , the sails being intended as the principal motive power of the vessel , as indeed they were throughout the voyage . My provisions consisted mainly of tinned foods , which were packed in tinlined cases of uniform size , copper nails being used in their construction , so that the empty wooden cases might be utilized in the building of the magnetic observation stations without affecting the magnetic needle . In this way I solved a problem which had long puzzled me , my vessel being too small to carry an extra load of building materials . The plan proved to be a perfect one . With the empty wooden boxes filled with sand we constructed not only excellent observation stations , hut also comfortable dwellings , which did excellent service and surpassed all expectations . The wearing apparel for the members of my expedition consisted of pure woollen underclothing , with outside garments of reindeer and sealskin . With regard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the carding of the wool to the completion of the product , thereby guarding against adulteration , and securing a superior make of warm garments for my people . Our tents were made after a pattern invented by my friend Dr. Frederick A. Cook , of Brooklyn , and myself , and may be said to have contained the results of  |p661  our experiences with the Belgian antarctic expedition , of which we both were members during the years 1897-99 . These tents , which somewhat resemble those of the Eskimo , were intended for the use of two persons , were built of light duck , and could be pitched by one man even when a gale was blowing . My crew was naturally selected with the utmost care . Second in command was Lieutenant Godfred Hansen , of the Danish navy , a young man twentyseven years of age . Besides executing the astronomical work and the geological surveys , he also superintended the taking of photographs . For three and a ' half years we shared a cabin whose dimensions were six by nine feet , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightest friction , except that of a purely physical nature . Anton Lund , of Tromso ? a man of many years ' experience in the sealing trade ? was the first mate of the Gjoa . His judgment and knowledge of arctic conditions served us many a good turn during the expedition . Our first engineer was Peder Ristvedt , of Sandsyser ? a sergeant in the Norwegian army . Iie superintended the meteorological observations , and acted hi turn as blacksmith , instrument-maker , watch-maker , and Jack of all trades . The second mate , Helmer Hansen ? a native of the Yesteraal islands ? was also an experienced sealer , whose practical knowledge of dog driving and management , as well as the fact that he was a good man on snow-shoes , ski , and with the gun , was of great assistance to us on many occasions . The second engineer , Gustav Juel Wiik , took part in the magnetic observations , and his conscientious work in all the scientific records brought home by the Gjoa will , I hope and believe , prove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only one of the original members of the expedition who did not return , , with us ; he was attacked by pneumonia during the last week of March ; 1906 , and on the 31st of that month died in our winter quarters at King Point , where he lies buried . He was a resident of Horten . The cook , Adolf Linstrom , had served in the same capacity on heard the Fram , and had consequently several years ' experience in arctic culinary art . Besides attending to the punctual serving of our meals , he made complete collections of zoological and botanical specimens , which it is hoped will prove of value and interest to those specific branches of science . It may sound almost incredible when I state that our small vessel contained provisions and ammunition for five years . Nevertheless such was the case ; and the Gjoa brought back with her considerable quantities of nearly every kind of provisions and stores , despite the fact that I gave some ice-bound balers at Herschel Island some 2500 pounds of flour . For fuel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 7 000 gallons of refined petroleum of the highest grade . Of this we still had about thirty per cent . left on our arrival at San Francisco . Guncotton , ice - saws , extra tine and strong hawsers , several hundred volumes of books and many games to help while away the time during the long arctic nights , as well as everything else necessary to a well-equipped arctic expedition , completed our outfit on board the Gjoa . The games for some reason or other were never taken into use by the members of the expedition , but were eagerly accepted by our many Eskimo friends , who became quite adepts at some of them . On the stroke of midnight on June 16-17 , 1903 , our lines were cast off from the pier at Christiania , where we were lying , and the Gjoa started forth on her voyage of adventure . It was very dark , and inky clouds hung low in the sky , while the rain poured down on our deck and upon the few friends and relations who had come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brothers went with me as far as Werder lighthouse , where the tug dropped our hawser , and all returned to Christiania . Five weeks of mostly contrary winds passed by without incident , until we sighted Cape Farewell , the southernmost point of Greenland . There the first ice was encountered ; and later , along the west coast of Greenland , we entered it several times in order to capture seal , and were fortunate in securing a considerable supply of food for ourselves and our dogs . Of these we had six , all of which had made the voyage before on  |p662  board the Fram with Captain Sverdrup . July 25 saw us at anchor at Godhavn , on Disco Island , where the Royal Danish Trading Company had deposited some petroleum , sledges , kayaks , and the like for us , and given us permission to buy some more dogs . I had already the preceding year corresponded with Herr Dongaard Jensen , Inspector for North Greenland , respecting the purchase of some dogs , and that genial and obliging gentleman had met my request @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me and trained . for sledge-driving . Two of my original six dogs had already died on ' board , and we lost in this way ten dogs during the first winter . In Godhavn we landed our instruments and put up our first observation station , taking throughout our stay there magnetic and astronomical observations . On August 8 we entered Melville Bay , feared alike , and for good reason , by whalers and arctic travellers . Previous to our arrival the whaler Vega , in which Baron Nordenskjold made the Northeast Passage , had been nipped and destroyed by pressure , and other whalers had lost their rudders and been damaged in various ways . In a thick fog , through partly open ice , we succeeded , thanks chiefly to the small size of our vessel , in creeping through many narrow lanes . Forty miles south of Cape York we suddenly emerged from the fog , and the imposing mountains of that vicinity , capped with ice and snow , burst upon our vision , just as if the curtain of a theatre had been suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tee-fields , which at first sight appeared to be completely packed , but upon closer inspection divulged a narrow lead to the west , just wide enough for the Gjoa to enter . Our hopes centred in penetrating the ice-pack to the socalled North Water , the other side of Cape Dudley Didges ? a place where the Scotch whalers usually go for open water at this time of the season ? and we succeeded beyond our expectation . Cameras were now put into operation and snapshots taken in all directions . At 7 P.m. on August 15 we discerned Nautical miles are meant in this article .  |p663  Dalrymple Rock in the distance ? a point where two Scotch whaling captains , Milne and Adams , had deposited a considerable amount of stores for our expedition . Near to this place we met with a great surprise : a number of shots were fired off behind some large hummocks , and suddenly five kayaks shot into sight , the first two flying the Danish and the Norwegian flags . The kayaks proved to contain the leader of the Danish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bold companion Herr Knut Rasmussen , with three Eskimos . They had seen us from a distance , and had come out to tell us that the depot at Dalrymple Rock was in good order ; whereupon they furthermore acted as our pilots and showed us the spot , where , as there was no harbor , I was forced to anchor the Gjoa in an exposed position oil the coast . In spite of the late hour we immediately set to work to load , rigging a derrick on a protruding ice-foot , and with its aid lowering all the packages into our boats . Our guests lent a willing hand at this tiring and difficult task , and thereby enabled us to finish it at two o'clock in the morning of August 17 , when we weighed anchor and sailed with our friends to their camp among the Eskimo on Saunder Island . Herr Mylius Eriksen made me a very valuable present in the shape of four Eskimo dogs ? two puppies and two fullgrown ones ; the former developed into very useful animals . We started away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of steam , and after picking our course in a zigzag direction between gigantic formations of ice , we emerged into open water in Baffin Bay . The Gjoa was now loaded to the gunwales. and it was lucky for us that calm weather prevailed , until we had passed Baffin Bay and entered Lancaster Sound , where we occasionally encountered narrow streams of ice , which , however , did not impede our progress . On August 22 we anchored outside Beechey Island , which has a sad and unenviable reputation as the scene of Sir John Franklin 's first winter quarters , where years afterwards were discovered the first traces of the tragic fate of that expedition . It was with sorrow that we reerected some of the fallen headstones . Northumberland House , on this island , is a building once put up by the British government and provided with a stock of clothing , provisions , coal , and other stores , in the hope that Franklin 's party  |p664  might hit upon it and thereby be succored , possibly saved . I found that it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into and destroyed . The building itself was in ruins , with the remains of a boat lying outside . The magnetic needle was now no longer reliable , though not yet totally incapacitated . During two days spent at Beechey Island we completed a series of magnetic observations which plainly indicated the position of the magnetic pole as being to the south of the island . On August 24 we therefore started southward towards the supposed area of the magnetic pole , and through a dense fog found our course , still by the aid of the compass , into Peel Sound ? a further proof that the needle was still of some use . At Prescott Island , however , the efficiency of the compass ceased , and we were compelled to navigate by the heavenly bodies whenever they appeared through the fog , which prevailed most of the time . We made our way along the west coast of Boothia Felix between the shore and the ice , outside the point where Ross observed and located the north magnetic pole in 1531 ? a point which from all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most difficult in the Northwest Passage , because of the density of the pack . We were , however , pleasantly surprised by open water and a stiff breeze , with high seas . Unluckily on September 1 we grounded , and were compelled to throw overboard the greater part of our deck cargo , including several tons of dog-food ; this helped us to float the vessel again , and we proceeded through shoal and dangerous waters until the afternoon of September 9 , when we anchored in Petersen Bay , on the southeast coast of King William Land . Saturday , September 12 , we stood into " Gjoa Harbor " ? a small landlocked cove at the head of Petersen Bay , and here we remained for nearly two years . The Gjoa was moored to the cliffs , and a conveying-rope passed from our masthead to an anchor placed on shore , at the spot which we had chosen for our storehouse . All the provisions were then run ashore on this rope , the wooden packing-cases removed , and the tin linings numbered and placed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which we expected to use them . With one of our three mainsails we then built a canvas house over the stores , and round it dug a ditch for the purpose of draining away the water which was to be expected during the spring and summer . Soon after this snow began to fall , and was blown up round the canvas cover , forming solid walls . On September 17 , having finished this job , we could give our attention to the construction of the different observatories which I had planned . Our work had to be done with great care , and the task proved to be a difficult one . After marking out the boundaries , we dug out the foundations to a depth of two feet , which in the frozen ground was no child 's play . Large stones were then transported from some distance away , and with these the entire site was filled in and cement poured over it , forming a solid basis . To prevent sudden changes of temperature and to insure the absolute darkness of a photographic dark room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we constructed outside the door a covered entrance , which we also built of boxes . While two men were thus completing the house , the other two dug a trench round it , three feet wide by two deep . The land taken from this trench was thrown up against the walls of the house , giving it very much the appearance of a sandhill , but it afforded good protection against the blizzards of " the winter and the floods of the spring and summer . Next in order came a dwelling-house . This we built about five hundred feet distant , and outside it put up the meteorological instruments . The house was intended for two men , whose duty it would be to attend respectively to the magnetic and meteorological stations . During the month of October , after several heavy falls of snow , we built a snow hut , cutting out the blocks of hard snow with ice-saws . These blocks , which weighed up to 250 pounds each , were placed one on top of the other , and after the walls were up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sewed together on our sewing-machine on board the vessel . In this hut were taken the absolute magnetic observations , with the so - called  |p665  travelling equipment . A similar building was also erected , in which were stored the reserve magnetic instruments . This completed our building operations , which lasted until the end of October , with occasional interruptions caused by the appearance of reindeer . This was always the signal for an immediate suspension of labor , so that we might indulge in the pleasures of the chase . To get out our guns , and for each man to start off in a different direction , with or without ski or snow-shoes , was on such occasions the work of a few minutes ; and although the animals were rather shy , we could usually get fairly close to them , and shot with our Brag-Jorgensen rifles about a hundred reindeer during the period of house-building . It would have been an easy matter for us to have killed several times as many , but when we had secured enough for our winter supply we desisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Before the snow came we had covered the Gjoa with a winter awning made with her sails , and we now stacked the reindeer carcasses on the deck , placing then : in two layers , with a gangway in the middle . Double skylights were inserted in the forecastle and cabin , and the petroleum-stoves put in position for cooking and heating . The question of ventilation also received a share of our attention ; we contrived this in such a manner that fresh air was let in above the stoves , and mingling with the hot air generated by them , was carried round the cabins and finally conveyed away by outlets near the floor . The 29th of October was destined to be a red-letter day in the annals of our expedition . After breakfast , when we went out as usual to scan the country for reindeer , we noticed several ( lark spots far away on the side of a hill . These at first we took to be deer , but their movements seemed strange , and in order to make sure somebody at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprise when we discovered that what we saw were actually human beings . Doubtless they were Eskimos ; and I decided to go out and meet them , taking two of my men with me , all three of us being well armed . The scene which followed has ewer since appeared to me as one of the most ridiculous that happened during the whole expedition . We had been told that the natives of these regions were hostile and unfriendly towards strangers , and I still remember the martial air with which I mustered my detachment and led them out to meet the supposed enemy . From time to time I glanced anxiously behind me to inspect my troops , consisting as aforesaid of two well-armed followers , and observing that their bearing corresponded perfectly with the seriousness of the situation , I advanced hopefully in the direction of the Eskimos . Even a military man must have admitted the precision and esprit de corms with which we approached the supposed danger . The enemy had halted , and was now watching our movements with curiosity , so at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demands of the situation . Our opponents mustered five souls , two of whom carried each a bow and arrows slung across their backs ; the other three were entirely unarmed . Feeling somewhat reassured and not a little ashamed at our warlike preparations , I left my companions behind me and went out towards the Eskimos , who came to greet me with the most unmistakable manifestations of pleasure ? in fact , smiling and chanting a sort of melody . The meeting was most cordial and quite touching : we embraced and hugged one another like old friends , the Eskimos all the while yelling Manik-tu-mi , and at the same time touching and feeling my body from top to toe . During this ceremony my two companions had come up with us , and they now received similar greetings , accompanied by what were evidently demonstrations of undying devotion and friendship . The Eskimos returned with us to the ship , and the same ceremonies were again repeated when they met our two men on board the Gjoa . The two who were in the dwelling-house ashore were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took our new friends up to the house and introduced them formally as old acquaintances of mine whom we had just come across . It caused me much secret amusement to observe the solemnity and ceremony with which the Eskimos , who were ignorant  |p666  of our practical joke , were received by our two comrades . All hands then repaired on board the Gjoa , and while I was trying to start the " conversation " our cook came up to me and whispered something about the propriety of inviting our guests below to partake of refreshments , which he suggested might take the form of coffee and sandwiches . The invitation was duly extended , and we all proceeded down into the hold , where assemblies usually took place ; but coffee and sandwiches proved to be without any sort of attraction to our visitors , who seemed quite unable to appreciate them . Nor did fried deersteak appeal to their appetite ; but I had noticed up on deck that the piles of reindeer had awakened their liveliest enthusiasm , and I accordingly sent for a raw haunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broad grins to clothe the faces of our arctic friends . We had evidently discovered their weakness , for with the most satisfied expression of face and manner the meat was passed round from one to another , each in turn closing his teeth on as big a lamp as his mouth would hold , after which the piece was severed from the rest of the flesh with a knife , close to the teeth . Almost without chewing it they then swallowed the whole mouthful , and we could watch its downward progress on the outside of their throats , very much as one can in the case of a duck or goose . Several haunches of venison thus found their way into the interior of the Eskimo anatomy , and , the feast ended , various appreciative noises announced that the food had agreed perfectly with the digestive apparatus of our newly found friends . Before the conclusion of this visit I presented the Eskimos with a knife and some needles , after which they started for home to tell their tribe of the white men , whose like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever seen before . Despite the fact that we could not understand their language , we succeeded in obtaining their promise of a repeated visit in the near future . By November 2 , 1903 , all our different chains of observation were started , and they were kept going for an unbroken period of nearly two years , or until June 1 , 1905 . A week elapsed before our friends returned ; they then brought with them a number of fine reindeer-skins , which they sold to us for a needle each , with a few extra needles thrown in . This may appear an absurdly inadequate payment , but it must be remembered that the Gjoa was a very small vessel , and as our stay was to last several years , it was of the utmost importance to us to keep our goods in high esteem . Our Eskimo friends stayed with us until the following day , spending the night on hoard , well packed into reindeerskins . Their meals continued to consist of raw meat and ice-water , the latter partaken of to the extent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the clay after their arrival they made preparations for departure , and I made up my mind to return with them so as to investigate their village and see something of their mode of life . I packed a sledge with provisions and ammunition , a sleepinghag and rifle , and gave the hauling-lines to the Eskimos , who trotted away on their kimik 's , or reindeer-skin boots , while I used my ski . The latter as well as the Canadian snow-shoe is entirely unknown to the natives of these regions . After a four hours ' march we arrived at their village , situated in a picturesque valley and consisting of eight snow houses . The gleam of light falling through the ice windows lit up the snow outside , creating a romantic scene , it seemed to me as I stood there in the midst of a barren waste , surrounded by fields of ice and snow , and thousands of miles away from the nearest civilization , while all around the arctic night spread its gloom and darkness . At some distance from the settlement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which brought out the entire population , consisting probably of some fifty individuals , to receive us . One of my companions ? Attira by name ? took upon himself to act as host , and invited me into his hut , which was of considerable size , and , moreover , accommodated a second family , named Tamoktukte ? the Driving Reindeer . Attira brought my pack inside , and in every way acted the part of a host who wishes to make his guest feel at home . The male population soon assembled in  |p667  our house , and a feast took place , at which several reindeer were consumed , washed down by a liberal supply of seal-oil . Everybody present seemed to enjoy himself immensely , and contributed to a general and very noisy conversation , of which I seemed to be the chief subject . During this time the women made their appearance , one by one , and after satisfying their curiosity , disappeared quietly , making room for others . They seemed to regard me with a kind of real or feigned apathy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party came to an end , and everybody left , with the exception of the two families living in the house . I was given a place in the middle of the sleeping-bench , with a family on each side , and there I placed my bag for a much-needed rest , which lasted until daylight the next morning . After breakfast I started back to the Gjoa , accompanied by four smart young fellows , who ran along so fast with my sledge that I could hardly keep up with them even on my ski . On Christmas eve an old native named Terain arrived at the Gjoa , apparently with something serious on his mind , and on questioning him I discovered that the whole settlement had struck camp and departed for more southerly huntinggrounds , leaving Terain with his wife and child ? the latter a boy of ten years of age ? to shift for themselves . I made up my mind to get to the bottom of this story , and accordingly , when Christmas was over , started ( on January 2 ) on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found it deserted , as Terain had said , with the exception of the igloo occupied by him and his family . I returned the following day , bringing the three Eskimos back with me to the vessel , where we gave them an asylum till the beginning of March , when their roving spirit again took possession of then and they started off to seek their tribe . Basing my opinion upon later investigations , I feel confident that the whole incident was a put-up thing , a nice calculation , whereby Terain and the rest of the tribe saved themselves the labor involved in feeding one family .  |p668  The time had now arrived for us to start on the different sledge expeditions to points in the vicinity of the north magnetic pole , for the purpose of making the observations necessary for its absolute location . On March 1 , accordingly , in a temperature of 63 ? Fahr. ( 52 ? C. ) , four of us started northward on King William Land with two sledges and ten dogs . My intention was to put clown depots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ base on April 1 . However , the temperature was so low and the snow so dry that it collected in front of the sledgerunners like light sand and seriously impeded our progress . After two days of this sort of thing we clumped our loads about ten miles from " Gjoa Harbor , " and returned with empty sledges , every evening building snow huts , in which we slept quite comfortably , although the temperature at this time went clown to 79 ? Fahr. below zero ( 61 ? 7 ' C. ) ? the lowest temperature observed during the entire expedition . In the middle of March I made another attempt to advance this depot , taking with me one assistant . During this journey , while marching northward along the east coast of King William Land , we were confronted one morning , immediately after we had started , with an Eskimo , and suddenly , one after another , a large number of others made their appearance from among the blocks of ice . It was not long before some thirty of them had congregated . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the top of one of our sledges , I advanced towards the Eskimos , repeatedly calling , Manila-to-mi , which means , " How do you do ? " When they were able to distinguish my words , these seemed to have a pleasing effect , for they all came forward to meet me with evident good-will , which I considered lucky , as they were well armed with lances and bows . Our meeting was just as cordial as my first meeting with the natives of these parts had been . They intimated to me that their village was only a short distance away , and I accordingly decided to accompany them home . After we had arrived at this understanding they took their dogs and harnessed them to our two sledges , about twenty-five to each , and then began the wildest chase it has ever been my misfortune to take part in . Regardless of consequences to either life or limb , to say nothing of the sledges , everybody rushed towards the settlement as if a prairie fire were upon them , all the time shrieking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the wildest glee . These men had gone out to capture seal , but apparently thought no more of the matter after they fell in with us . They proved to be more intelligent and much better equipped than the first tribe we had met , and after a very short period had elapsed became our greatest friends and allies . On our arrival at their village we found that there were about one hundred and fifty of them , living in sixteen snow huts . They proved to belong to the Netchjilli Eskimos , which Ross mentions as having met in 1831 . Later on I discovered that other settlements of this same tribe were scattered about over a considerable area . At about fifty paces from the igloos we stopped to unharness the dogs , and while we were so doing the feminine element of the village assembled and came running towards us in a long single file . They circled round us once , uttering grunts meanwhile that were evidently some sort of welcome , and then returned to their huts . We were then invited into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name ? a man apparently about forty years of age , and who seemed to occupy the position of a chief . His dwelling was about twelve feet square , comparatively lofty , and was entered by a long passage . Meanwhile some of the others built a snow house for the visitors , and Attikleura 's wife regaled us with frozen salmon and reindeer meat , not to mention reindeer fat and blubber . When we had partaken of these several delicacies he brought me as a present a beautifully embroidered suit of reindeer clothing , and when , later on , we moved into our newly built hut he furthermore gave me a magnificent polar-bear skin . In a book written by Klutsehak , a member of the Schwatka expedition , the Eskimo word miki is given as meaning a dog . By employing this word I tried to explain to Attikleura that I should like him to accompany us north with his dogs  |p669  and sledge . The next morning , to my astonishment , I found outside our hut his sledge and little son , aged about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean dog , but child , and , whether from friendship or fear , Attikleura had decided to agree to what he supposed was my expressed wish ? viz. , to obtain his boy and sledge . When I explained the mistake , there were signs of great joy all over the camp . After this I presented the ladies with gifts , consisting of a couple of needles each , the distribution taking place as all passed by me in a long line . I soon discovered , however , that some of those who had already received their share reentered the line after passing me and tried it on again . When I jokingly gave them to understand that I had noticed their little deception it caused great merriment and childish laughter . The men being very unwilling to give up the prospect of seal-hunting , I found it difficult to induce one of them to act as our pilot , but finally a younger brother of Attikleura ? Poietah by name ? consented to accompany us . The day after our start , about 1 p.m. , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ttchnachtorvick tribe , from the east coast of Boothia Felix . The temperature still remained at about 57 ? Fahr. below zero , and this , combined with a stiff breeze from the north , having caused bad frost-bites on my wrists , I decided to take advantage of this opportunity of seeking shelter . From the first these Eskimos had made a bad impression on me , the disagreeable and deceitful expression of their faces denoting a low type of character ; and it was not long before I had certain proof that I had analyzed them correctly , for during the night a knife , an axe , and a saw disappeared from our pack . In vain I attempted to induce them to restore these very necessary implements , and at last had to resort to strategy . Pretending that I knew who had stolen the articles , I took my rifle and announced that I would shoot the perpetrators unless the things were produced forthwith . Without a moment 's hesitation three members of the band set out for their igloos and returned at once , carrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would lie useless to deposit any stores where this tribe had knowledge of it , and I therefore returned with our guide to his village and buried our depot on the shore in the presence of the entire population , admonishing them to keep good watch over it . The next  |p670  day we set off for the Gjoa , accompanied by nearly thirty Eskimos with three sledges . This was their first visit to us , and they remained for nearly a week , after which they went back to their camp . Two of us returned with them on a second journey north , towards the magnetic pole . This journey might easily have had a fatal ending for us . Our sledges being too heavy to drag across the packed and uneven ice , we were obliged to lighten our loads by making a cache , which later was totally despoiled by the Ttchnachtorvicks , and we thus found ourselves a hundred miles from our base without provisions . Ten tablets of pemmican was all that the thieves had left us , and with this scant supply of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an exhausted condition , and with our journey , which was to have lasted three months , cut short by two-thirds of that time . A year later the sledge was sent back to me through the Netchjilli tribe , presumably because all the Eskimos we fell in with believed us to be in possession of supernatural powers , by which we could punish them even at a distance . During our two years ' sojourn in Gjoa Harbor we took some two thousand photographs of the Eskimos , besides having ample opportunities of studying the life of these aborigines , who had never before come in contact with outside influences , and are undoubtedly among the most interesting of the inhabitants of our globe . The spring was taken up with short journeys in the vicinity of our winter quarters , to ascertain the magnetic conditions , and to prove conclusively that no local disturbances had taken place . During the month of July the ice melted and disappeared entirely from our harbor , notwithstanding the fact that Simpson Strait continued to be filled with drifting pack-ice . This was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been able to slip through it had the conquest of the Northwest Passage been my chief aim and object . About September 24 we set to work once again to put the Gjoa into trim for our second winter aboard her . This winter ( 1904-5 ) differed greatly in many ways from the past one : our  |p671  Eskimo friends , to the number of nearly two hundred , settled immediately round us , and thus gave us an improved opportunity of studying their mode of life . It is the custom of these Eskimos when out hunting to temporarily bury their bag under stones , in order to preclude activities on the part of the fox and badger . Meat which had been cached in this way was now hauled back on sledges to Gjoa Harbor , and an unbroken round of festivities began , in which overeating played the most important part . This went on until January ; when , their food being exhausted , they were obliged to resume hunting . At this season of the year it is the seal which supplies the necessaries of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ danger and hardship , caused by the long hours which it is often necessary to wait beside the sealholes in the ice , the temperature being very likely at a minimum and the wind at a maximum . With the arrival of February they packed up their belongings and moved out on to the ice , so as to be nearer to their hunting-grounds , and we were then left to ourselves again , which , it must be confessed , was somewhat of a relief . During February I began the encircling of the magnetic pole , and continued at this work until the month of June . During this latter month I went a sledging expedition to King William Land , to the supposed situation of the pole . Here a sensitive declinatorium showed the magnetic pole to be north of my place of observation . Immediately after this occurrence the needle turned , showing the pole to be to the south of my position . This very interesting and important fact proves what of late has been assumed on theoretic grounds , namely , that the magnetic pole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Our nineteen months of unbroken magnetic registration in Gjoa Harbor will , however , when worked out by experts , give , I hope , a great deal of further enlightenment on this subject . On April 1 . Lieutenant Hausen and Peder Ristvedt started on their expedition to chart the east coast of Victoria Land , taking with them two sledges and twelve dogs , and provisions for three months . They returned , after many adventures , on June 24 . This expedition had for its outcome the charting of half the missing coast-line and the discovery of a large group of hitherto unknown islands . At the end of May we dismantled the dwelling-house on shore , and on June 1 the magnetic-variation house . The packing-cases were emptied of the sand , repaired , and put out to dry ; and when ready the tin boxes , of which we still had a large number unopened , were again slipped into them and the whole loaded on board the Gjoa . During this July the ice again disappeared altogether from our harbor , but remained much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first time this summer , I found the ice somewhat practicable , and decided to make a start the next morning . The last of the meteorological instruments which were still on shore were brought on board during the night , and at three o'clock in the morning of August 13 we weighed anchor and steamed out of this cove , which had afforded us a splendid harbor for nearly two years . Our Eskimo friends remained on the beach , waving us a last farewell . We made our way westward through a thick fog , guided by the lead , which , as a rule , indicated about ten fathoms ; but the same day were obliged to anchor under Todd Island . as heavy fog and ice stopped any farther advance . A couple of hours after this the fog lifted , and we discovered a narrow lane between the pack and the shore , barely wide enough for the Gjoa to pass through . Needless to say , we did not lose any time in slipping through this opening , which brought us into open water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four o'clock the next morning we dropped anchor outside Kamiglu , where an appointment had been made to bid a last farewell to our Eskimo friends , who were hunting reindeer and catching salmon there ; from them we secured a supply of both articles sufficient for our needs . An Eskimo boy of eighteen years of age , named Maimi , expressed a wish to go with us , as he was unhappy at home and badly treated by his adoptive parents , and as the father would not let him go without some equivalent , I had to pay his ransom in the shape of a knife and a file .  |p672  The boy gained our affection by his honesty and cheery disposition , and it was a sorrow to us all when , a year later ( July 22 , 1906 ) , he accidentally fell from his kayak in our harbor at Herschel Island and was drowned . At eight o'clock in the morning of August 14 all was ready , and we weighed anchor and proceeded westward under sail and steam in open water . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Northwest Passage , Etta Sound ? a shoal and tortuous channel , about three-quarters of a mile wide , between Etta Island and the mainland . The following day we passed through the newly discovered group of islands , the ice , which was packed , barely permitting a passage through the centre of the group . An uneven , shoal , and foul bottom compelled us constantly to feel our way with the lead . The course westward took us through Victoria Strait , which was filled with heavy pack ; thence through the strait between Victoria Land and the mainland , where we encountered partially open water . We continued our way through Dease Strait and Coronation Gulf out into Dolphin and Union straits , and on the morning of August 25 sighted Nelson head ? a tall and imposing headland . We also sighted in the forenoon the first vessel which we had seen since leaving the Atlantic side , and she proved to be the Charles Haussonn , a whaling schooner from San Francisco . At Cape Bathurst we were stopped by ice , and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At Baily Island we passed several beset whalers . On the morning of September 1 , in a heavy snow-storm , we overtook and passed two whalers near Pullen Island , and later in the day they again overtook us on their way to Herschel Island . They proved to be the barks Alexander and Bowhead , the former of which was later on nipped in the ice and completely wrecked . On the afternoon of the next day , September 2 , the ice compelled us to seek shelter under Cape Sabine , where we anchored . The following day we started again , taking advantage of a narrow lead between the land ice and the shore , but after travelling westward for a short distance we were stopped by impassable ice-barriers and had to make fast to a hummock only a few yards outside the wrecked whaler Bonanza of San Francisco . Time passed but the ice remained , and I soon realized that we should have to make preparations for a third winter in the arctic regions . Young ice began to form , and in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were close under King Point , about thirty-five  |p673  miles east of Herschel Island , where , as we later discovered , five whaling-vessels were beset . Our winter quarters were on the open coast , exposed to the caprices of the ice , and at any time we were liable to be nipped and destroyed by the pressure . We missed Gjoa Harbor with its splendid shelter , our only protection  - -  which , however , proved to be ample ? being during this winter the land ice outside of us . By September 24 the young ice had become sufficiently strong to bear me with a dog-sledge , and I accordingly set off for the whaling fleet near Herschel Island , for the purpose of finding out when they intended to send off their mails . I obtained permission to accompany the Eskimos who were to start for Fort Yukon on October 24 , and then returned to the Gjoa . By October 13 we had put up all the stations on shore and begun the series of observations . On October 20 I left my vessel with a sledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and arrived at Eagle City , Alaska , on December 5 , whence all the despatches were forwarded . I stayed here two months awaiting letters for myself and the other members of the expedition , and during this period was the guest of Mr. and Mrs. Frank N. Smith , the local agent of the Northern Commercial Company . On March 12 I reached the Gjoa , after an absence of five months and after travelling a distance of fifteen hundred miles . Gustav Wiik , the assistant in the magnetic observations , died on March 31 , after a short illness , and his death was keenly felt by all of us his comrades . We buried him in the observatory which he had built himself , and a tall cross with an inscription on it was placed up at one end of the building . On July 2 the Gjoa got loose from her winter berth , and we lost no time in hauling her up to the hulk of the Bonanza , which was grounded and provided us with a splendid breakwater against the drifting floes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Island , and on the same day we left King Point and stood west towards the aforesaid island , Passing it on the night of the 12th . The ice , however , compelled our return thither , and we anchored in our old harbor there at three o'clock in the morning of July 13 . We made three more vain attempts to proceed , meeting each time with insurmountable difficulties in the way of ice , and each time driven back , until finally , on August 11 , we succeeded in entering and following a narrow lead between the pack and the shore , which we followed along the coast , often finding it almost impracticable . On August 19 the propeller struck a piece of ice , bending the shaft and putting the engine out of working gear , and from here onward we were entirely dependent upon our sails . We weathered Point Barrow , the most northwesterly point of the American continent , on August 20 , and received letters which had come by the tender of the Pacific Steam Whaling Company which we found here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and on August 30 stood south through Bering Strait . We touched at Nome , and here received our first impressions of civilization , after an isolation which had lasted for three and a half years . The cordiality of our reception , and the kindness and hospitality extended to us by the warm-hearted and generous gold-diggers of the great camp of Alaska , will long remain a pleasant memory . Festivities in and around Nome filled up a week , until September 5 , when the Gjoa set sail for San Francisco , under the command of Lieutenant Hansen . I myself took charge of all the magnetic instruments and went by steamer to Seattle , where the only observatory of the Pacific coast is situated , it being absolutely - necessary to compare my instruments with those ashore . All facilities for this work were extended to me by Mr. Edmonds , the director of the observatory . The Gjoa arrived at San Francisco on October 19 . The cargo , consisting of ethnographical , zoological , and botanical specimens , and many furs and curios , was discharged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to New York , en route for Christiania , after which the members of the expedition started by rail for home . The Gjoa was taken charge of by Admiral Lyons , the commandant of the Hare Island Navy-Yard , who showed such interest in her that he personally superintended her removal to the navyyard , where she is now resting after her long adventures .  |p674
