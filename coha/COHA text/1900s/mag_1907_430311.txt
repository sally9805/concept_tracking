IT was my good fortune , one day last summer , to be invited by a Mrs French of St Paul to a perfectly appointed ladies ' luncheon at the Minnesota clubhouse . Several notable guests were there and the talk was brilliant and absorbing ; but not until the luncheon was half over did it occur to me , or to any of the other out-of-town guests , just who our hostess was . Then it was something she said that arrested my attention . " Oh , I beg your pardon , " I interrupted her ; " but are von Susan Clegg ? " " Well , what if I am ! " she retorted , and went on with her conversation ; but every woman there was much more interested in what she had to say . And from that moment began a strong friendship between Anne Warner and the writer of this sketch . For , contrary to some of my literary experiences , I found her even more fascinating in conversation than in her writing Who does not know Susan Clegg , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Mrs Lathrop ) rocking chair and giving voluble views on people , philosophy , life , matrimony ? Who has not sympathized , even while chuckling with laughter , with Mrs Lathrop , who can never get farther than " Why , " or " What . " I believe , in the several volumes in which she appears , Mrs Lathrop has never completed a sentence , the irrepressible Susan invariably taking it off her tongue and rattling away for several paragraphs before she stops to take breath . And Aunt Mary , also , whose " Rejuvenation " has been so successful that we shall all be laughing at it on the stage very soon . And Uncle John , whose touring and talking in France was followed by a companion trip in England . When the great biennial of women 's clubs met in St Paul last summer , at the opening session there were fraternal greetings from every possible society , which lengthened out , as one sufferer put it , into " eternal greetings . " Consequently we were the more impressed by one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lyceum club of London and Paris and Berlin ; for instead of using up her allotted two minutes and then going on for twenty-three more with a written paper as some others did , she said exactly what she meant to and stopped the very second her two minutes were over . And the woman who can go directly at her subject and witho u t apology or excuse keep within the bounds set for her by the powers that control ( or attempt to ) a public program , is entitled to the respect of her audience ; but somehow no one seemed to know who this Mrs French was ; and of the three thousand women present none knew , unless a few St Paul women are excepted , that it was the author of Susan Clegg w h o stood before us . For she was introduced as " Anna Warren French of the Lyceum club of London . " You do not wonder that she created Susan when you have seen and  | talked with her for an hour ; rather let me say , listened to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Susan herself , with a steady stream of wit , and a faculty for seeing the funny side of everything in the world . So that you are quite content to fill the role of Mrs Lathrop . No photograph has ever begun to do Mrs French justice , and although she has lived abroad and " consorted with the rich and great " everywhere , she is as simple as Susan herself in mind and manner . An altogether delightful woman , she is not at all " set up " by her sudden rise as author of some of the " best sellers " and " six most popular books of the month . " She lives with her father and mother in a beautiful home on that lovely residence street of St Paul , Summit avenuenearly opposite the home of James J. Hill . Her father , Mr Warner , is one of St Paul 's leading lawyers ; her mother is an active , witty woman , with the cares of a large household and the social duties that go with her position . Although A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's books , it was really the third , being preceded by a family genealogy , published in 1892 , when the idea of writing as a profession had never occurred to her , and a tiny travel volume privately printed two years later , when the wining idea had begun to take root . But it was Susan Clegg and her projects that caught the public attention , and in this connection Mrs French discovered a very peculiar fact ; this was that , quite unconsciously to herself , she had reproduced places and phrases connected with her visits in childhood to her grandparents in Nunda , . New York : Indeed , it was at the dear old house in Nunda. where she spent every second summer all through her childhood , that she became familiar with country village life , and imbibed all those phrases , " in the square . " the " crick , " " the road out to , " etc , which are used so mach by Susan ( leg . And Nunda is the place where Susan may be said to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above Susan 's neighbors . " The only similitude I can see now , " says Mrs. Warner , " was the taking themselves very seriously ? a tendency not confined to Nunda , by any means . " Mrs French is small and dainty of figure . with excellent taste in dress , and the means to gratify it ; her attractive face , with its deep , brown eyes , lights up beautifully as she talks , and she is as gay as a girl , as she tosses the conversational ball lightly to and fro . She was born and educated in St Paul , but experience and much living abroad has broadened her into a cosmopolitan . She has a wonderful memory , and remembers all sorts of odd and funny incidents that most of us would forget . And that is why Susan and Uncle John and Aunt Mary are such comical realities to the readers of books and magazines . Have I said that The Rejuvenation of Aunt Mary is to be put on at the Bijou theater in New York this , fall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ title part ? It will doubtless have a run in New York before the rest of the world will get its chance to laugh at and with Aunt Mary ; by the way , the original story , The Rejuvenation of Aunt Mary , was re-written five times before appealing in book form , one of these being the form of the novelette , as it appeared in Ainslie 's . A Woman 's Will took exactly six weeks to write , and came out in book form only , but the remainder of Anne Warner 's work has appeared in some magazine first , either as short-story , novelette or serial . Susan Clegg appeared in several short stories , but Uncle John Seeing France was only a short story when first written , and was refused far and wide , until Mr Gilder of the Century was pleased by it , and asked to have it developed into a serial . The way Mrs French happened to begin writing fun was this : One day she happened to be on the streets at St Paul with a friend , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usual " how-do-you-do 's " were exchanged , and the " old maid , " upon being asked how she was getting along , said : " Well , I believe I shall get married ; and Um going to set right about it . " Anne Warner went home a n d laughed over the incident , and lay awake half that night with Susan Clegg taking definite shape in her head . The result was The Marrying of Susan Clegg . When it was done the author took a sheet of notepaper and wrote to the editor of the Century : " This is the fiftieth story I have written . I hope you will want it . If you do not , I wo n't send you another till I get to the hundred and fiftieth . " But the Century people were delighted , and Anne Warner 's future was settled . She has been offered $4000 for a serial by one of the magazines . Mrs French has two children , a boy old enough to be away at school , and a little girl of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their mother 's heart , for no amount of success and admiration turns her away from her own people . Charles flange French has his mother 's imaginative temperament . He has attended schools in France , Switzerland , New York , and will shortly enter the University of Virginia . His sister , Anne Hathaway , named for a many times great grandmother , was in kindergartens in St Paul , Minneapolis , France , Munich , and since then in convent schools in Hildesheim and St Paul . She now speaks German and French , and her brother only French ; but he can read Latin and say " Nihil faciens " when things look that way , which is beyond her . They have both shared the ocean and the Channel , the St Gothard and Madame Tussaud 's , punted on the Isis , and learned to swim ( under careful supervision ) in the Mississippi . " Brother , " has a strong sense of humor , and Anne Hathaway is very practical . Anne Warner does her literary work in a pleasant room on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the night before in bed . No typewriter for her ; she is a living example of the tyranny of  | habit . From her early childhood she has had to print everything she composed . And now every word of her stories is printed in fine letters , with pen and ink , just as she composes it . It makes a neatlooking paged manuscript , but after going over it for corrections , she usually has it typewritten for the publisher . Although no good photographs of Mrs French are in existence , the one given here is interesting , inasmuch as it shows her in her wedding dress , a heavy white satin , worn by her grandmother , Anne Elizabeth Whitwell , when she was married to Bradford Perez Richmond in 1836 at Fairhaven , Massachusetts . On the whole Mrs French is a good illustration of the saying that " Genius is the capacity for hard work , " for nu writer bends more constantly to her task . or sees more material in the world around . Although she has been writing only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly three hundred short stories and five books , with new ones promised , and a good start in stageland . As an example of her spontaneity , she wrote a friend the other day : " I have just finished my two hundred and eighty-sixth short story . When I have written my three hundredth . I am going to celebrate the occasion in some wildly foolish manner ? probably by writing the three hundred and first . "  |
