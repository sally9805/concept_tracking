 | RECITATIONS were taking place in the red schoolhouse at Orneville , Maine . It was winter and the snow lay deep on the ground , but some of the scholars were in bare feet , and only half as many hats hung on the pegs as there were potential wearers in the seats . That was forty years ago ; and the pioneers of northern New England were more noted for their industry than for their possession of the fruits of it . of " All the recitations have been too short , " complained the schoolmaster . " You must spend more time and learn longer lessons . " " How long pieces may we recite ? " The question came from the barefooted row , and none of the hats on the pegs fitted the head . " Oh , there is n't any limit ? as long as you like . " The next recitation-day had come around . The snow was still on the ground and the bare feet were warming themselves on the plank floor . The turn of the boy  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and began : " Awake , my St. John , leave all meaner things To low ambition and the pride of kings . Let us " " Stop ! " It was the teacher , with hand raised . " I know you . You 've gone and learned Pope 's " Essay on Man " by heart . Well , we have n't time for you to say it here . " The boy was Hudson Maxim , and he had committed the poem to memory from first word to last . He can recite it to this day . It is the power ? or the will ? of application , of concentrated effort , which capitalizes the natural abilities of a man . Barefooted , hatless , young Maxim tramping to school , rubbing his feet in the snow so he might slide on the ice as well as the boys who had shoes ? O envied ones ! ? was distinguishable from the rest only by the kind of head he had . It was the head that had memorized 1,296 lines in three clays ; which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem , devised probably the most destructive explosive of modern times , besides contributing to the solution of some of the most important scientific questions of the day . I have never known a man who can do so much hard work as he and continue it for so long . He knows no rest in the form of idling ; rest with him can only be a change of occupation , mental or physical . Six years ago when , after protracted experiments , he had solved the problem of an ideal high explosive for shells , he invented a compound which , exploding in direct contact with water , forms steam instantaneously . Applied as a motive power in torpedo boats and automobile torpedoes , this substance promises to change completely the character of marine warfare . The difficulty that long presented itself lay in the mechanical equipment for its successful use . For six years Mr. Maxim has devoted himself to the problem . A less persistent man would have passed it to the machinists , holding his own work done with the chemical discovery . That he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by officials of the United States government . A story told me by an old powder man who worked with Maxim illustrates t tremendous application which he brin to a matter in hand . He was trying a new kind of multi-perforated smokeless powder in an old-fashioned Springfield musket . to test its accelerating property . Mr. Maxim knew that the powder could not burn with sufficient rapidity to explode the gun , which he , therefore , did not fear to hold in his hands . But he had not calculated on the terrific kick of the weapon which followed the discharge . The stock of the musket struck him on the chin . cutting to the bone and knocking him senseless . It was almost an hour before he was brought to , when his first remark was , " How did it work ? " It is worth mentioning here , as showing the wide range of Mr. Maxim 's researches , that it was he who first formulated a hypothesis of the compound nature of the so-called atoms , which has become a generally accepted theory only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of experiments on radiant matter . Mr. Maxim 's theory was that " all matter is one in the ultimate , and the difference in the various forms of matter and manifestations of force is due to the difference in the relative positions of the ultimate atoms . " On the western shore of Lake Hopatcong in New Jersey , three miles from the workshops where his explosives are made , is Mr. Maxim 's country home . If you visit him there expecting to find an atmosphere of gunpowder you will be disappointed . First , as you notice the library , instead of books on chemistry , physics and ordnance you will be more likely to see volumes of the poets , histories , standard works in fiction , philosophy and sociology . I am never certain whether to admire the most his inventive talent or his literary attainments , his skill in producing a glorified dish of scrambled eggs , which he insisted on making unaided after getting home late with his automobile broken down , or his prowess with boxing-gloves in spite of the fact that his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1894 that Mr. Maxim lost his hand , in an explosion which occurred with a compound which he was holding . The thumb was found the next day by workmen on top of a building two hundred feet away . About six weeks after the accident , when he was recovering from its effects and had  | begun to wear an artificial hand , he was attacked by a ruffian at the elevated railroad station at Eighty-first street , in New York . Mr. Maxim promptly knocked his assailant down , and picking up the artificial hand , which had fallen off during the scuffle ( the story is told by an eyewitness ) , tucked it under his arm and started home . Being myself somewhat accustomed to the gloves , and having boxed with Mr. Maxim , I can credit the story . Among the observations credited to Napoleon there is one to the effect that all great men had great mothers . Mr. Maxim had a great mother . She was a remarkable woman . She was less than five feet in height , but weighed nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have seen a photograph of her . The features are as if chiseled from granite , so strong a face do they show , yet a kind and sympathetic one . Nothing daunted this mother of the Maine woods . She carded the wool , and spun and weaved and dyed and cut and made the clothes for her family of eight . She even raised flax , and beat and hetcheled it and spun and wove it and cut and made tow and linen suits for them . Once , when the elder Maxim was away , a wildeyed stranger called and took from his pocket a butcher knife , which he proceeded to whet on the stovepipe.  | Now I will have my revenge , " he remarked . " And I 'll have mine , " said Mrs. Maxim , and taking a broom she broke the handle of it over his head , and he ran . At another time a rabid dog ran into the house foaming , and snapping at the children . " Mercy ! " cried this Spartan mother , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she slammed it through the window , glass and all , into the street . Old Isaac Maxim , the father , was of no less note in the Maine community . He was a philosopher and an inventor . Long before the era of ironclads he had proposed the steel-armoring of ships . He experimented with breech-loading and with machine guns before the Civil War , but encountered great difficulty for the reason that fixed ammunition did not then exist . When the world rounded into the nineteenth century it used the flintlock gun . muzzle-loaded with powder , wad and ball . Its artillery was a cast-iron tube , charged with a bag of black powder and a solid round shot . Against an army thus equipped a regiment would now be more than sufficient . The harnessing of the new energy . which can hurl a half-ton bolt of steel through three feet of iron has been a giant task . In Europe and America an army of inventors , stimulated by the prospect of rich rewards , has been busy with the problem . And America , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outdistanced all in the wonder of her achievements . No other gunpowder is so near perfection as that with which American guns now can be provided , and no high explosive so marvelous as that which American shells could carry into the vitals of an enemy 's ship . The persistence which mastered Pope 's " Essay " did not fail when applied to its new task . But Mr. Maxim 's experiments are by no means confined to the things which kill . One of his most recent productions is a new flashlight for use in photography . Ten years ago while experimenting with electric furnaces he invented the process of making calcium carbide continuously by the heat of incandescence of a molten carbide conductor . This method is now in general use . About the same time also , he invented a process of making small diamonds by electro-decomposition . Still , it is with explosives that the name of Maxim always will be most associated . To the person whose knowledge of this subject runs back to the powder which he used to load with a ramrod into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lake Hopatcong would contain revelations . In one of the buildings there are rows of test tubes on racks , bottles of various liquids , and scales for weighing , just as in an apothecary 's shop . In an adjoining room , amid other appliances , is a huge cast-iron press , capable of exerting a pressure of 16,000 pounds to the square inch : this to press an explosive material to a sufficient compactness . Elsewhere are systems of rollers for squeezing out the water from the explosive in one of its varying forms , mixing vats and warming and drying  | rooms . Strange , pungent odors fill the air in some of these places , and the windows are open to guard the workmen from headache . Large sums would be paid for a revelation of the secrets of the materials here elaborated , but although several workmen are employed only the head alchemist knows all the ingredients . Mr. Maxim was the first to make and test smokeless powder in the United States , and practically all the smokeless cannon powder used by the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his letters-patent . He was also the first to design large torpedo guns using gunpowder instead of compressed air for throwing aerial torpedoes . Powder men like to tell stories of their experiences . Mr. Maxim sometimes yields to the weakness . One of these tales has to do with a bet which he made as to the payment for some dynamite . He had gone one day into a magazine in which were stored ten carloads of dynamite and 37,000 pounds of nitroglycerin which he had made for the Brazilian government , and found there one of his workmen knocking a case open , with a cold chisel and a hammer . The employee was immediately discharged . A short time afterward , a neighboring farmer bought a supply of dynamite from Mr. Maxim with which to blow up stumps in a field . " I have an old hand of yours with me , " said the farmer , " John Schultze . He knows all about dynamite . " " Schultze ! he 'll blow himself up with it . I had to discharge him , he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tell you what I 'll do , " said Mr. Maxim , " I 'll bet you the price of the dynamite he does . " It was agreed . The next day Schultze ran foul of an exploding stump . Four of his ribs were broken and he was nearly killed . In settling for the dynamite , Mr. Maxim contended that as the man had blown himself up the farmer should pay the bet , but the latter held that as Schultze was only half blown up he should pay only half price . It was finally decided that half price should be paid . Fulminate of mercury , used as a charge for fuses , is a substance with which Mr. Maxim has conducted many experiments . Once in the laboratory at Maxim , New Jersey , an assistant let drop a heavy weight which struck within an inch of a glass filled with that deadly explosive . Had it hit the glass an explosion would inevitably have occurred ; and there were ten pounds of fulminate and more than a hundred  | pounds of nitroglycerin in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Maxim simply remarked , " It is useless to be frightened now , since we are here . " But , despite such accidents , there is nothing " ticklish " about a properly made explosive compound . Maximite , named from its inventor , the adoption of which by the United States government placed this country in the lead of all others in high explosive projectiles , is so insensitive to shock that shells charged with it may not only be fired from high-power guns with entire safety , but will stand the greater shock of penetrating the thickest armor plate without exploding until set off by a proper fuse . Of all Mr. Maxim 's inventions in explosives the one which is most likely to capture the imagination is the substance which he has named " motorite , " and the uses to which it may be put in the next war in which this country may be engaged . Although an explosive , the function of motorite is , as its name indicates , to supply motive power , and it will be employed as a fuel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and automobile torpedoes . It consists of a compound of nitroglycerin and guncotton , and Mr. Maxim believes that ultimately a speed of a mile a minute may be obtained by its use . It is customary when discussing the possibilities of submarines and other marine wonders as yet only in their experimental stage , to predict the early extinction of the ponderous and costly battleship . But if motorite accomplishes the work which its inventor has designed it to do , the battleship 's days certainly are numbered . Motorite , although composed of the most powerful high-explosive compounds , is tempered so that it can not explode , and its combustion may be controlled and regulated with the greatest nicety . As it is capable of burning without atmospheric oxygen , producing a very hot flame , the method of employment is to burn it in a confined space , under pressure , and to utilize the heat of the products of combustion , or flame , to evaporate water , by directly mixing the water with the flame . No boiler is required . I think it must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maxim took to explosives . He is an explosive himself . " I did not hear you , sir , " said a maid to him one day when I was at Lake Hopatcong , as excuse for not responding to a call . " You heard me , all right , " was the calm rejoinder . " Never say you do n't hear when I call . " I should say not ! The explosive volume of that voice is one of the picturesque attributes of a generally unusual personality . At his city home , in Brooklyn , New York , Mr. Maxim defers to the obvious notion that an inventor of explosives should have explosive furnishings in evidence . So , as you enter the hallway , an imposing array of rapid-fire guns , flanked by piles of projectiles , and swords and small arms on the walls , gives the requisite martial atmosphere . Indeed , explosives are a household commonplace here , and , if you wish , Mr. Maxim will cut off a piece of dynamite , like so much wood , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rabbit in a chafing dish over a lamp filled with nitroglycerin . It is safe enough , though not always convincing to the timid caller . As an expert boxer is generally the hardest to provoke to an attack , so the experimenter in explosives is usually the most earnest advocate of peace . The Swedish inventor Nobel , who first made dynamite , established the prizes which bear his name as monuments to his hatred of war . Mr. Maxim is a writer and critic , a sociologist , a considerable bit of a philosopher , and abhors war with an earnestness born of his intimate knowledge of its horrors . But he believes that the more terrible and costly that warfare is made , the less recklessly will the nations plunge into it . The memory of the treasure poured out on the plains of Manchuria and the slopes of Port Arthur is not soon to be forgotten . In a poem by Mrs. Maxim , published in the " Anglo-American Magazine , " entitled " Greater Anglo-Saxony , " Mr. Maxim 's aspirations may be said to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood flow , but let it be In the unsevered vein ; Go , wage relentless war on War And all its hateful train . And then let Peace perch on your swords , And doves nest in your guns Let stain this great earth-girding realm No blood of Adam 's sons .
