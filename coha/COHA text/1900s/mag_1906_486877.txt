Last Saturday the weekly , statement of the New York Associated Banks , showing a " deficit in reserve . " threw the money market into commotion . It was particularly noted that this was the third deficit of the year , the others having occurred in the statements of September 8 and April 7 ; that not since 1899 had any year included ' three " deficit weeks " , that not since 1890 had three deficits occurred in three separate months ; and that the statement foreshadowed extremely high rates for money . In view of these facts , it is worth while to consider in detail - what such recurrent " deficit " really signifies as to banking operations , what it involves to the borrowing community , and what is the duty of public officers in regard to it . The National Bank act of 1864 , as subsequently amended , provides that whenever the holdings of lawful money ( excluding , of course , bank notes ) in the hands of a national bank in specified " re : ' serve " cities falls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deposits , and whenever the similar holdings of a national bank elsewhere fall below 15 per cent. , such a bank " shall not increase its liabilities by making any new loans or discounts , otherwise than by purchasing bills of exchange payable at sight , " until the prescribed ratio is restored . In other words , liabilities must not be increased . Lending on bills of exchange is excepted , because that is ' a means of drawing foreign gold and replenishing reserves The Comptroller of the Currency may warn a bank showing such deficiency to make good its reserve at once If it fail to do so within thirty days he may , with the concurrence of the ' Secretary of the Treasury , force it to stop business . He may do so , not must  --  an important distinction There are two ways in which the ratio of reserve to deposits ' may be brought below the 25 per cent . dead-line . A market 's currency reserves may be drained by demands of Interior centres . by gold exports , or by the accumulation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down in a still larger degree , the 25 per cent . reserve , which is required in New York city , may thereby be impaired . Or , without any actual loss of cash , deposit liabilities may be so increased , through the making of loans at a reckless rate , - that the reserve will be less than the legal ratio The outright drain on the reserves is worst in such panics as that of 1893 , when bank depositors are withdrawing and hoarding money , the undue expansion of loans is commonly seen in " boom times , " when every one is speculating and borrowing , and the banks are providing the credits . In a panic , the fall of the reserve below 25 per cent may be wholly unavoidable ; in the " boom , " it is likely to result from recklessness . Hence the discretion on the part of the Government authorities , either to do nothing or to force tile offending bank out of business . In the present instance the banks were not brought to a deficit by influences beyond their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partly by needs ' of active internal trade , partly by the Treasury 's accumLlations . Since the beginning of August , however , the Treasury has deposited $18,000,000 in the banks ; and $40,000,000 gold has been imported ; nevertheless the cash reserve of the New York Associated Banks has decreased $35,000,000 . But this is a perfectly familiar phenomenon of the season . It occurs because , when trade is dull at interior cities , bank liabilities light , and , therefore , need for reserve money reduced , interior banks send cash to New York . They do so , not only because they no longer need the currency , but because New York banks , which can lend on Wall Street at all seasons , offer 2 per cent . interest for use of this money of interior banks . With these fresh reserves , the New York banks expand their loans In prudent banking , this expansion will be cautious , especially as autumn approaches , because at harvest , the interior bank will ask for its cash again . Tens of millions in actual currency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands , in addition , the trade of a prosperous farming season requires that inland banks themselves should increase loans to customers , and hence , should need , more reserve money . If New York banks-have used these borrowed resources carefully  --  in particular , . if , on the eve of the " interior demand , " they have brought their reserves to a figure 10 or 15 per cent . above the bank law 's minimum , the return of money is easy This year , the New York banks did nothing of the sort . In the middle of last August , re-'serves stood at only 2Ws , per cent of deposits . With the banks in so weak a position , and with the largest legitimate interior demand in the history of the country lust before them , powerful Wall Street capitalists , controlling certain important banks , started a stock speculation of such magnitude as to strain all the credit resources of New York . By'September 8 , a deficit was reported . With the help of the Treasury and the foreign markets , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only by abandonment of Stock
