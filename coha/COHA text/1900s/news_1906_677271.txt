txt Commissioner GARFIELD has performed the chief public service of hiS career in bringing to light the Standard Oil Company 's continuous and habitual violation of law through the acceptance of secret rebates from railroadd , and the President has added to his many titles of distinction by sending to Congress a notable message upon the subject which calls the attention of that body and of the country to the guilt of the railroads and the oil company , and further by the assurance that the matter has been referred to the Department of Justice . It is most fervently to be hoped that , as the Pies= ! dent intlinates , prosecutions Will be stituted " in at least certain of the cases " ? In all of them , we trust , where the evidence is sufficient . Commissioner GARFIELD in this preliminary report upon his investigation instances repeated violations of ? the laiv prohibiting secret rebates and diaCritilitiatiOnS . He - brings Within the scope of his incriminating exposure the Pennsylvana Railroad , the New York , New Haven &; Hartford ; the New York Central @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Southern Railway , the Chicago , Burlington &; Quincy , the Chicago &; Alton , and many railroads , not specifically mentioned , beyond the Mississippi . Commissioner GARFIELD states that " the Standard Oil Company has habitually received from the railroads and is now receiving secret rates and other unjust and illegal discriminations . " He declares that during 1904 " the Standard saved about three-quarters of a million dollars through the secret rates discovered by the Bureau . " This sum represents the difference between the published rate and the secret rate . The President in his message informs Congress that " the report shows that the Standard Oil Company has benefited enormously , up almost to the present moment , by secret rates , many of these secret rates being clearly unlawful . " Yet during the " tainted money " discussion both Mr. ROGERS and Mr. Donn , the Chief Solicitor of the Standard Oil Company , cited the report of the Industrial Commission of 1898 - as proof convincing " to any unprejudiced mind that since the enactment of the Inter-State Commerce law the Standard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been accepted as a denial , and they manifestly were intended to be so accepted , that the Standard 011 Company has received rebate favors from railroads . Mr. GARFIELD 'S report shows these denials to have been false and deceiving . He says that " the facts regarding freight rates have been obtained by the examination of thousands of entries upon railroad records . " There is scarcely room for doubt that the Commissioner has the facts and evidence to support his charges . Assuming that his proofs are adequate , . the : country will demand that justice and the law shall have their due . We see no reason why the secret rebate should not be crushed out now for all time . It is a device of the business coward and assassin , it is dishonest and detestable . The country hates it , and among those who have openly condemned it were hypocrites who were all the time secretly giving or receiving it . Here is a chance to make it known in the most conspicuous manner that the American people win no longer tolerate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long sought to gain an Illegitimate advantage over rivals . The President says that since the discovery of the secret rates by Mr. GARFIELD " the larger portion of them have been promptly corrected by the railroads , so that most of them have nciw been done away with . " That is a confession of guilt . But it is no atonement , it is no defense . If the railroad managers of the country , the men of the Standard Oil Company and of other corporations and concerns that have profited by this criminal trickery , have not yet had their eyes opened to the fact that the prevailing spirit of discontent and the growing Socialistic agitation in the country are largely due to them and their contemptuous violation of the laws of the land , it is high time that al revealing light were let in upon their minds through the discourse of Judges pronouncing sentence in courts of law . The process of enlightening them will be rude and disturbing . But it is bet- ter that disturbance should come now , and , a few men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and further winking at offenses only half concealed the coming of an evil day that will be worse for all of us than any possible consequences of present rigor . If Mr. GARFIELD 'S charges can be proved we hope chanced for promotion to fine places in the Standard Oil organization and in some of the leading railroad companies will presently be opened to deserving youth ..
