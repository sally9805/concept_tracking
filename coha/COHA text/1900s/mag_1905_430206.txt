 |p1115  A GREAT deal has been said about colored people who are trying to help their own race ; much has been stated about the Northern white people who have given service and money in the elevation of my race in the South , but one hears very little of a small class of Southern white men who are quietly and privately working to help forward the interests of t he colored people and therefore the interests of both races . It is for this reason that I am calling the attention of my readers to Mr. R. O. Simpson , of Furman , Wilcox County , Alabama , a man about whom t h e world ought to k n o w more . Mr. Simpson was born at Belleville , Conecuh County , Alabama , December 1st , 1842 , which means that he is now 63 years old . During his youth he received some education in an academy near his home , but , like many young Southern men of his time , Mr. Simpson left school at an early age to enter the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which he served through the war . Returning penniless to his home at the close of the war , Mr. Simpson took charge of a plantation belonging to Mr. Dabney Palmer , his uncle . He has prospered as a business man and now owns several thousand acres of the most valuable land in Alabama . Wilcox County , to which Mr. Simpson came in 1861 , is in the center of the " Black Belt " of the South , where the colored people outnumber the white people about four to one . There are in the immediate neighborhood o f Mr. Simpson 's house hundreds of colored people , many of whom were formerly owned by Mr. Simpson 's family , a n d he , himself , also owned slaves inherited from his father . About twenty years ago the idea began to grow upon Mr. Simpson that he ought to use a portion of his wealth and time in helping to make more useful citizens of the colored people . How to begin , however , was a g r eat puzzle to him . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man by the name of William J. Edwards , whose father lived on Mr. Simpson 's plantation , began to work his way through a nearby Normal School . Mr. Simpson had loaned him several small sums of money , but with the lending the loan was forgotten . Some months afterward , much to the surprise of Mr. Simpson , young Edwards voluntarily appeared one day and repaid the loan . The act of this educated young negro impressed Mr. Simpson deeply . He began to reason that if  |p1116  education would help one negro to the point where he would act in this manner , it would help others , and he began to talk with Edwards about starting a school upon his plantation . After some search a vacant and abandoned log cabin was found and a little school was opened with twenty-five pupils . The results of the work of this school founded in 1898 have been marvelous . The Snow Hill Institute has now 308 students , 55 of whom are boarders , and the students this year have come from five States . There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of land and two rather large , substantial buildings , a third one having been recently destroyed by fire . In addition to these two large buildings there are many smaller ones . The whole property is valued at $35,000 . Mr. Simpson 's part in this wonderful growth has been to me one of the most beautiful and inspiring object lessons that I have known in my experience in Southern education . Mr. Simpson is a doer and not a talker . I have never heard him make speeches over ten minutes in length . No man could watch over a member of his own family with more solicitude and tender care than does Mr. Simpson guard this school , and between him and Edwards there is complete faith . Mr. Simpson has given too acres of land to the school , and many times when the treasury has been completely empty , when there has been no money to buy food or pay the teachers , even before an appeal could be made to him , he has from his private funds supplied the needs . Aside from what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land and funds for the erection of buildings . he contributes generously each year to the current expenses of the institution . From the first he has been President of the Board of Trustees . His son was Treasurer and is now Auditor , and his whole family is as deeply interested as Mr. Simpson is himself . The influence of Mr. Simpson has spread even further ? many white people in that section of Alabama who formerly had little faith in negro education now contribute toward the support of this school . One white man , Mr. C. W. Hooper , of Selma , Ala. , made a few weeks ago an unsolicited contribution of one hundred dollars . The importance of the education of the colored children has impressed itself so deeply upon Mr. Simpson that he recently helped to found another school in another portion of the county . My readers may get some further idea of his deep interest when I say that both these schools are connected with Mr. Simpson 's home by telephone . Within a few months he has placed his business in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to devote his entire time to helping the people who need help . Mr. Simpson has not only interested himself in the material and educational improvement of the colored people , but has been equally outspoken and strong in his stand in favor of the colored man receiving justice in the courts and in favor of his being permitted to vote wherever he satisfies the demands of the State constitution . Mr. Simpson 's help and interest are not confined to the colored people . The white schools and churches share his interest and generosity , but , since the colored population is more numerous and more needy , he is especially interested in helping them . Not many days pass that do not find this benefactor on the school grounds in consultation with Mr. Edwards . His days are now largely spent in going among the people , encouraging them to buy land and homes , to be frugal , to educate their children and to live Christian lives . Mr. Simpson is , as I have said , a modest and unassuming man of few words , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , and having clearly perceived his duty , he has pursued it stedfastly in spite of opposition or adverse criticism .
