AMONG our big cities , Boston is peculiar in not thrusting its bigness upon us . Its outward demeanor is demure . At its portals Liberty Enlightening the World would look out of place ; we should rather expect the Puritan maiden Priscilla to stand as doorkeeper . The evidences of commercial prosperity are present ; but they do not stare us out of countenance . They are not concentrated in any one spot , but are " a good diffused . " Here and there an incipient skyscraper attempts to lift its head , only to be severely snubbed . Sky-scraping is considered architectural li'se-tuajiste in the presence of the gilded dome of the State House . Old Boston , with its narrow , winding streets , has many curious survivals of the past , but the Greater Boston has advanced further than any of our communities toward the city of the future , which is to be not a city at all , but a thickly settled country . Half-way between London and Cambridge a company of English idealists have founded such a " Garden City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The aim is to unite the necessary . business of the town with the wholesome life of the country . In the vicinity of Boston this desirable state of things has been brought about by natural evolution . The well-to-do Bostonian lives in one of the garden cities that form a circle around the business center . Here are his real interests . He is not a suburbanite in the New York sense . Milton , Brookline , Cambridge , and the Newtons are not mere bedrooms for Boston . Each community has a life of its own . For one thing , each has a history reaching back to the beginnings of New England . The Puritans were not naturally an adventurous folk . They had undertaken one great adventure , and that was enough for them . They had come to the edge of the wilderness , but they had no notion of being lost in it . So they clung closely to the shore-line , and built their villages as near together as if they had not a whole continent in which to expand . The rocky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indians and wolves . Here they built their meeting-houses . The settlements followed the meandering streams , the Charles , the Mystic , and the Neponset . Where the streams came together in the bay was the natural site for the chief trading-place . At first it was only one of a group of tiny villages . In process of time these villages have grown into one great urban community ; but the original units still preserve their individuality , their old traditions linger , and the names have a pleasantly simple , sound . One takes the cars to Brookline Village or to Upham 's Corners or to Meeting-House Hill . The rural expectations are not always adequately fulfilled , but they are seldom so rudely dispelled as when , in London , one travels to Shepherd 's Bush , only to find that both the shepherd and the bush have disappeared in the roaring metropolis . . Nature has done much to prevent Boston from becoming " citified " in appearance . It is not built upon the open , inviting the endless extension of the checker-board pattern so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neces- sitating abnormal growth skyward . It is peninsular . Not Only in the peninsulas of Boston and Charlestown , but everywhere in the vicinity , there is the mingling of the land and the waterways . The early settlers , when they went to the Thursday lecture in an adjoining town , always had the choice of two routes , just as Paul Revere must look for the signal-lanterns on the Old North Church , " One , if by land , and two , if by sea . " Whichever way they chose , they must give up the ambition to follow a straight line . Near the First Parish Church in Cambridge is an eighteenth-century milestone that perplexes the modern wayfarer . It states that the distance to Boston is eight miles . At the present time it is a scant three miles over Harvard Bridge ; but the mile-stone was accurate enough in the days when the traveler had to go around by Roxbury and come into Boston by the Neck . These original peninsularities have been largely effaced by the filling in of the shallow waters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on outdoor Boston . For one thing , a tract of most valuable real estate was preserved in brine till such time as it was needed for firstclass residences . One of the things which makes Boston homelike is that one can walk easily from the business center to the best residence districts . One has only to cross the Common to be among the stately old houses of Beacon Hill . He crosses the Public Garden , and he is among the elect of the Back Bay . There is a sense of snugness about it like that of a prosperous little provincial town . To get lost in the city wilderness one has to go in a different direction . Copley Square , in the Back Bay , with Trinity Church , the New Old South Church , the Art Museum , and the Public Library , is a creation of " the New Boston . The whole ? district of which it is a center is a bit of the country bodily transplanted into the old city . In another way the interpenetration of the land and water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The various inlets and tidal streams had wide , unsightly margins . From this waste land , neglected by the utilitarian , the landscapeartist has extracted beauty , as a product of municipal growth . to the extensive forest reservations the more distant hills are broad ways , following for the most part were once marshlands . The most portant part of the comprehensive is the transformation of the Charles R ' into a pleasure-stream . When the dam now being built is completed , the inhabitants of Boston and C bridge do not indulge in gondolas , fault will be in the Yankee temperam Here is a magnificent Grand Canal it will be strange if the Venetian " pl ures and palaces " do not come in doe time . The new Boston gives the impression of breadth and openness . One may ride mile after mile through a pleasant parklike country interspersed with houses . It is the twentieth-century idea of civic development . Every year , as the facilities for rapid travel are improved , the citizen goes farther afield , and demands more space about his home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old Boston , which has clustering about it so many memories of the early life of the commonwealth . The historic imagination still clings to what is left of the old hills . From Charlestown one looks across upon Copp 's Hill , with its ancient burying-ground , and the spire of the old church . Sometimes in the evening , from the Cambridge bank of the Charles , the picturesque old Puritan city reveals itself with peculiar intimacy . The commercial buildings do not monopolize the sky-line . We see , as in the cities of the Old World . the houses where people live , with the churches lifting themselves above the houses . We turn from the made lands . and see the compact older city rising up the slopes of Beacon Hill . Crowning the hill is the dome of the State-House . Down the river rises the granite shaft of Bunker Hill . The sentiment of the place makes it a direct appeal . And Boston Common , in spite of recent changes , has not lost its original character . It is still a common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place to be used , and not merely to be admired . To be sure . cows are not now grazing upon it , but the memory of them still lingers , and this  | bit of green earth has still a simple pastot-al charm . At the head of the Common stands the Park Street Church . That it has a graceful spire is not enough to account for the storm of protest which arises when the periodical suggestion for its removal is made . It is a symbol of the old Puritan tuwn . The Bostonian believes . that the I'ark Street Church " is , and of right uught to be " where it is . It is a meetinghouse which stands just where a New England meeting-house always stands ? by the village green . For Boston has been singularly relucLint to change from its first estate , and it has become more and not less solicitous about the preservation of its old landmarks . King 's Chapel , with its ancient graves around it , the Old South Church , Faneuil Hall , and the Old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are symbols , the outward and visible signs of an inward grace . For the modern Boston is an illustration of the persistence of a civic tradition . In no city of the United States has the change of population , owing to unre-tricted immigration , been so startling during the last generation . The city of the Puritans has become osmopolitan . Were Cotton Mather to come to life again and revisit his haunts in the North End , even his linguistic acquirements would be severely tested in finding his way about . And yet , though the population has so largely changed , the type remains . If clever Mrs. Ann Hutchinson were to return and resume her afternoon discussions of things theological and social , she would find an audience waiting for her . Her fashion in dress and in thought might need a little revision , but she would soon come to her own again . Boston would still relish her assaults on the old orthodoxy . Governor Winthrop could still appeal confidently to the Bostonian respect for minorities , " the best part is always the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always the lesser . " This method of arriving at truth by the elimination of the mentally unfit is not infallible , but it often works well . It is refreshing to find one spot where " the dissidence of dissent " is respected . If the charm of Oxford lies in the fact that it is the home of lost causes , the perennial charm of Boston lies in its hospitality to causes that have not yet found themselves . And Samuel Adams would still find quick response to his appeals for sturdy resistance to every kind of tyranny . The spirit of the town meeting is not dead . Yet though Nature , which is " so careful of the type , " sees to it that the Bostonian state of mind is preserved , it must he confessed that that state of mind is not so highly intellectual as the newspaper wits would have us believe . Boston suffers the fate of the precocious child who , when he grows up , has all his early feats of intelligence thrown up at him . IHe is seen through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the expense of his present achievements . Boston took to literature at a time when literature was looked upon as an oddity on the American continent . The other communities , absorbed in the multifarious activities of pioneering , looked with halfenvious amusement upon the eager , little city which was trying to improve its mind . It was an infant phenomenon . Now , an infant phenomenon has a hard time , and must suffer many things from his contemporaries . They never fail to twit him on account of his divergencies from the average . 1 f he has any intellectual superiority , he is soon made to feel ashamed of it . and he learns to conceal his gifts . So it has happened with Boston . The self-conscious intellectuality of the transcendental period was a passing phase which has long since vanished . In the meantime a score of other cities have become " literary centers . " Still , the reputation gained in a previous generation remains . Even so keen an observer as Mr. H. G. Wells allows himself to see Boston only through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be altogether too superstitious in its worship of " culture . " Everywhere he saw copies of the Winged Victory , which seemed symbolic of the spirit of the place . It indicated boundless aspiration , but an aspiration that was not closely related to the facts of mundane life . There was an impression of the lack of strict contemporaneousness . This is the impression one might easily  | get from the talk of many a Boston drawing-room . But why should one choose his symbol from an indoor ornament ? Outdoor Boston is more representative . Here one may see what people are interested in . The statues scattered about the town are not all works of art , but they indicate the kind of men the people delight to honor . There is certainly no lack of wholesome virility . Turning from the equestrian statue of " Fighting Joe " Hooker , by Daniel C. French and Edward C. Potter , in front of the State-House , we linger before the Shaw Monument , by Augustus SaintGaudens . If we are looking for a symbol of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is aspiration and an eager forward movement that is represented ; but there is nothing vague about it . These men are urged on by something more grimly real than the pursuit of culture . On the Public Garden stands Herbert Adams 's statue of Channing , the first of Ameritan preachers to discern the significance of modern philanthropies and social reforms . A little farther on we come upon the uncompromising figure of Garrison , sculptured by Olin L. Warner . Let the stranger , then , ask a policeman to direct him to French 's monument erected to the memory of John Boyle O'Reilly . Instantly he will have made a friend . If the stranger be of a philosophic mind , he will linger over the inscription , " Poet , Patriot , Orator . " Then let him stop at the Public Library , and look over the works of this Irish-American Bostonian . He will arise with a new appreciation of what has been going on . The mingling of races has led to a mingling of ideals . Once Boston represented only the spirit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important an element to be ignored . In Boyle O'Reilly we see the two lines of tradition merging . The newcomer lifts his voice in praise of the Pilgrims of Plymouth and of the men of the town-meeting . New England ideas are garnished with Celtic wit . Perhaps nothing in outdoor Boston is more significant than the monument which recognizes that the new element entering into the city 's life is destined to modify it profoundly .  |
