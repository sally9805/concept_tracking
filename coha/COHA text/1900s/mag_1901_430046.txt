 | THE capitol of the United States Steel Corporation is in New York , just below Trinity Church and convenient to the head of Wall Street . It is a precipitous building , twenty-one stories high , called " The Empire . " Around a corner and one short block away is the office of J. Pierpont Morgan , to whom of a bright morning comes President Charles M. Schwab , of the Steel Corporation , walking down from his capitol ? a plain , sturdy man in a worn sack coat and black derby hat . A stone 's throw below The Empire , toward the Battery , rises that other capitol of industry where the inscrutable Mr. Rockefeller directs the colossal business of the Standard Oil Company . The two capitols , as I shall point out later , are connected by an invisible but by no means tenuous web , spun in the new pattern variously known as " community of interest , " " combination , " " community of control . " President Schwab occupies an office on the eighteenth floor of The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top of west New York , across the Hudson , and far into New Jersey . On the floor below him are the offices of ex-Judge E. H. Gary , chairman of the executive committee , and around about them are the vice-president , the general council , the secretary , the treasurer , the members of the executive committee , which may be called the president 's cabinet , and the rooms of the board of directors , which is the corporation 's Congress . Here also are grouped the headquarters of several of the subsidiary corporations ? the Carnegie Steel Company , the Federal Steel Company , the American Steel and Wire Company , and others , once regarded as giants of industry , but now overshadowed by the new power . Several of the greatest rivals of the corporation , as if to fight at close quarters , occupy offices on other floors of the same building . From this brain-center is directed a business so extensive that few people possess anything but the vaguest conception of its magnitude , organization , and methods of operation . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combination , " a " monopoly , " and abused or extolled offhand according to the political or financial predisposition of the individual . One who attempts to grasp it abstractly in its entirety finds the process like trying to realize the extent and purchasing power of a billion dollars in gold eagles . We have been thinking in terms of hundreds or thousands of dollars , and find ourselves suddenly called upon to think in billions , and because we do not immediately succeed , we feel somehow that the organization and operation of the great corporation are intentionally shrouded in secrecy . But this is hardly the case . In their recent testimony before the Industrial Commission of the United States Congress , Mr. Schwab , Judge Gary , and other prominent officers and attorneys of the Steel Corporation spoke with the utmost freedom of the organization and purposes of the so-called " trust , " and of its component corporations , even to the extent of furnishing statistics relative to certain branches of their business . They have also spoken and written freely for pub-  | lication elsewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) expresses astonishment at the " extraordinary frankness " of President Schwab and his colleagues as to the intentions of their organization , so " that we are really more fully informed-thereon than we are about the ambitions and methods of our family grocer . " It is not an uncommon impression that J. Pierpont Morgan , having more money at his disposal h n he knew what to do with , conceived the idea of buying up and combining under one management a number of steel properties , seeking thereby to make large promoter'sprofits and to establish a sort of " monopoly " in the steel business . But the Steel Corporation was not a sporadic promoter 's enterprise , being the product of conditions rather than of men ; and while the corporation seemed to burst suddenly upon the public view , its seeds had long been germinating . Many of the men who were prominent in the organization were unquestionably forced into it against their will . If the truth were known , it is probable that Mr. Morgan himself undertook the task out of necessity , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , knowing as he did that his reputation was at stake , must have weighed heavily upon him . Like the German Empire , the Steel Corporation was squeezed into existence " ; a number of mighty concerns , on the brink of war , were brought together because they dared not remain independent . And Andrew Carnegie , the man of all men who was most responsible for the Steel Corporation , had no desire to see it organized . When Mr. Carnegie embarked extensively in steel-making , the various industries which combine in producing steel the iron-mines , coal-mines , lime-quarries , coke-ovens , blast and Bessemer furnaces , and so on ? were Frog , a photo by Falk . owned for the most part by separate companies ; so that when he , as a steel-maker , needed raw materials he was compelled to bargain with Jones &; Co. for coal , with Smith &; Co. for iron-ore , with Jackson for coke , and so on down the list , and then he was compelled to pay freight on various railroad and steamship lines . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wanted them , and at reasonable prices . Mr. Carnegie , feeling the inconvenience and the money losses incident to this system , sought a better way . A few older concerns had already tried the experiment of owning their own coal and in some cases iron mines . Mr. Carnegie greatly extended this system , acquiring not only iron and coal mines , but coke- ovens , building or leasing his own railroad and steamship lines , until finally his company controlled every step in the process of steel-making , from ore mine to steel billet or ingot. * In other words , by becoming independent or " selfcontained , " he was enabled to put the profits of the various branches of the industry in his own pocket , and , by extending his plants and introducing the most approved machinery , soon became the greatest steel-maker in the world . An Englishman who visited the Carnegie works a year or so ago was apparently unmoved until , at the close of his inspection , he asked his guide how much steel was there produced . The answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone , equals about three-quarters of the entire product of Great Britain . " But other great steel-makers were quick to perceive the secret of Mr. Carnegie 's success , and they , too , began to combine , buy up coal and ore mines , and make themselves independent ; and some of them who  | had formerly purchased the crude steel billets and ingots from Mr. Carnegie to make into steel tubes , wire , tin-plate , and other finished products , found that they could make their own billets more cheaply than they could buy of Mr. Carnegie . And they were in themselves gigantic combinations or " trusts , " all completely or nearly self-contained . A single one of them , the Federal Steel Company , having $99,000,000 issued capital , was until the organization of the United States Steel Corporation the greatest corporation in the world , controlling the steel business of Chicago , Milwaukee , Joliet , Ill. , Lorain , 0. , and Johnstown , Pa. , * a large number of iron-ore mines in the Northwest , and of coking coal in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indeed , six large corporations , with several subsidiary railroad , coal , and iron companies , were combined in forming the Federal Steel Company . Mr. Carnegie , perceiving that his competitors were pushing his system a step further than he himself had planned , and that his market for crude steel was threatened , immediately planned to build enormous works for manufacturing his crude steel into tubes and kindred completed products . With his reputation for Scotch determination , backed by the best organized and most compact industrial institution of its kind in the world , it was not unnatural that his rivals , big as they were , should look upon the new move with alarm . There were two courses open to them : fight or buy . Now , Mr. Morgan had assisted in bringing the Federal Steel Company and two of the other great steel corporations into the world , and he and his associates were still largely interested in them . Mr. Morgan is as much a fighter as Mr. Carnegie , but he knows when to fight and when to buy . Fighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Carnegie 's price for his plants was enormous , and he plainly hinted that unless the purchase was made immediately the price would go higher still . But Mr. Morgan did not hesitate ; the price was promptly paid , and the Carnegie Steel Company and nine other great corporations were combined to form the colossal United States Steel Corporation. * Never before had there been such a huge business deal , and yet it was consummated with astonishing celerity . Mr. Morgan began the work of organization in December , 1900 , and the earliest announcements of the enterprise appeared in February and March , 1901 . In April the corporation began work . The total cost of all the steel plants , mines , steamship and railroad lines purchased , as it appears on the corporation books , was about $1,300,000,000 . Partial payment was made with the capital stock of the new corporation , which amounted to $1 , - 100,000,000 ( $550 , - 000,000 preferred and $550,000,000 common stock ) , and for the remainder the corporation went into debt ; that is , issued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corporation ? Mr. Morgan 's work ? as it appears on the books is about $750,000 , much less than is popularly supposed . Of this sum $220,000 , $200 on every million dollars of capital stock ,  | was paid to the State of New Jersey for the fees of incorporation. * It is difficult to convey any adequate idea of the magnitude of the Steel Corporation . A mere list of the properties owned or controlled would fill an entire number of this magazine . It receives and expends more money every year than any but the very greatest of the world 's national governments ; its debt is larger than that of many of the lesser nations of Europe ; it absolutely controls the destinies of a population nearly as large as that of Maryland or Nebraska , and indirectly influences twice that number . Its possessions are scattered over half a dozen States , from Minnesota to New York and Massachusetts , with its chief interests centering at Pittsburg , Chicago , and Duluth , and the whole controlled from New York City . It owns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and six important railroad lines and several smaller ones . In Pennsylvania , its coal possessions cover over 75,000 acres of land worth $1,200 an acre , besides 30,000 acres of other land and quarries , and 98,000 acres of leased natural-gas lands . It owns no fewer than 18,309 cokeovens , being the largest coke producer in the world . Of blast furnaces it owns eighty , producing 9,000,000 tons of pig iron yearly , and of steel plants it owns about 150 . And yet the Steel Corporation can not be called a monopoly ; it does not control production or prices , although its influence on both must be profound . In a general way the corporation may be said to own something more than two-thirds of the steel industry in this country ( in the tin-plate industry a considerably larger proportion ) , the remainder being controlled by a number of lively rivals . Here are the comparative figures of steel production for 1899 , being practically the same for 1900 :  | These figures show that the Steel Corporation produces more steel than either of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than a quarter of the entire production of the world . The production of the independent companies , given at 3,200,000 tons , is divided among some twenty or thirty rivals of the Steel Corporation , a few of which are powerful concerns , owning their own coal and iron mines , and therefore independent in the matter of competition . The growing industry of the South , centered at Birmingham , Alabama , as well as the Colorado branch of the industry are independent of the Steel Corporation . Jones &; Laughlin 's Limited in Pittsburg is the most threatening of all the rivals of the corporation . Other competitors are the Cambria Steel Company ; the Republic Iron &; Steel Company ; and the Pennsylvania Steel Company , which has recently passed into the control of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company , and acquired extensive iron mines in Cuba , thus making it , in case of a steel war , a most formidable competitor . Since the organization of the corporation a number of new independent concerns have sprung up in various parts of the country , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Broadway capitol from dozing . The above figures showing proportion of production are " good times " figures . Prosperity is favorable to the growth of rivals , and in times of financial stress some of the smaller concerns will no doubt go to the wall ; and the great corporation , fitted to weather storms , will , as Mr. Schwab says , control probably as high as seventy-five per cent . of the steel industry of the whole country instead of some sixtyfire per cent . as now . The Steel Corporation is a republican form of government , not unlike that of the United States , with a president ; a cabinet , or execWive committee , which is likewise a supreme court , having practically all the power of the board of directors ; a treasury department , or finance committee ; a legal department ( the general counsel ) ; and a congress ( board of directors ) , elected to office by the individual voters or stockholders . In this case , owing to the large amount of stock which he owns or influences , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of directors , and its composition shows how his idea of " community of interest " has been worked out . There are two main elements about equally represented among its twentyfour members , one of which may be called the financial side of the board ? men who , like Mr. Morgan , Mr. Rockefeller , and Mr. Marshall Field , know little or nothing about steel-making , but who do know business and finance . The other element , represented by Mr. Schwab , Mr. Reid , Mr. Roberts , Mr. Edenborn , and others , are practical steel-makers . There are other lines of division . Each of the subsidiary companies forming the Steel Corporation has its representation in the board . It is probable that Mr. Andrew Carnegie is the largest single owner of bonds in the Steel Corporation , having acquired this interest in partial payment for his share in the Carnegie Steel Company ; he has a first mortgage , so to speak , on the property , and while not a member of the board , he is represented through the Carnegie Steel Company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is probably the next most powerful interest , and he and two of his partners are on the board . The Standard Oil Company , which owned part of the Lake Superior mines and a steamship company absorbed by the Steel Corporation , also has three members ? Mr. Rockefeller himself , John D. Rockefeller , Jr. , and H. H. Rogers . In the same way the Federal Steel Company , the American Bridge Company , the " Moore group " of companies , and others are each represented by heavy stockholders.  | Each man on the board was chosen , like a political committeeman , for the influence he could wield ; and there is no better way to reach an understanding of the scope of this colossal enterprise than to follow out some of the many devious and far-reaching courses of influence represented by the various directors , which constitute a web covering the entire country and reaching hundreds of unexpected industries . Take the case of Mr. Morgan , who is a director in twenty-one railroad companies and a vital influence in several others , besides being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ require enormous quantities of steel material for rails , locomotives , and cars , the steamship line requires ships , and so on , and Mr. Morgan would naturally use his influence to persuade them to purchase their supplies of the Steel Corporation . Furthermore , he would buttress his influence throughout the railroad world by this forceful argument , in plain language thus expressed : " See here , the Steel Corporation is the greatest shipper of freight in the world . You buy your iron and steel of us and we will ship a proportionate amount of our freight by your line . " Similarly Mr. Rockefeller , dictator of the Standard Oil Company , is naturally prepared to favor the Steel Corporation as a source of all the vast supplies of steel tubing , piping , and materials for tanks , used in the combined oil industries of America . Then there is William E. Dodge , a member of the firm of Phelps , Dodge &; Co. , one of the controlling influences in the copper industry of America , with all its avenues of financial authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Navigation Company , a large user of steel ships , and a likely factor in the invasion of foreign markets which the Steel Corporation is planning . Mr. Griscom is also closely identified with the management of the Pennsylvania Railway Company , perhaps the most important single railroad system in the world , thereby reaching other long lines of influence . P. A. B. Widener , of Philadelphia , another member , controls many of the important street-car lines in America , all of which are heavy purchasers of iron and steel for rails , cars , power-houses , and so on . Marshall Field , of Chicago , probably the foremost of American merchants , brings to the corporation a wide authority in financial circles . Thus , one might continue the analysis , showing in what manner each member of the board adds strength to the corporation . It would seem that Mr. Morgan 's " community of interest " had been so completely and successfully worked out that most of the great aggregations of wealth in the country are gathered within the net of the Steel Corporation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great money masters that they must , perforce , bury their differences and step to the same music , for if they disagree , there is an even chance that their left hand will be found engaged in fisticuffs with their right . Never was there such evidence of the growing solidarity of capital as that furnished by the new Steel Corporation . There are other facts of interest in regard to this board of directors . It is indicative of the part the law plays in great enterprises , that the board contains no fewer than four men who were trained in that profession , three of whom have been judges . Six are bankers , and many of the others are  | heavily interested in banks . One of the twenty-four members is foreign-born ( Prussia ) ; nearly all of the remainder sprung from old American families , of British origin , though three are plainly of German descent . That early training and environment count much in fixing a man 's career is evident from the fact that seven directors were born in the coal and iron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in close proximity to centers of steel industry , and only one is from the South . More than half of the members are " self-made men , " having been farmer boys , clerks , or workmen , beginning with nothing , educating themselves , and pushing upward by sheer ability . Less than half the number received a college education , and only four or five are graduates of the great universities , a fact which explains Mr. Schwab 's light regard for an extended college course as a training for a business career . Mr. Schwab himself was educated in a Catholic school , from which he was graduated at the age of eighteen . The board of directors holds a meeting once every month in the Broadway office , though it is not often that all of the members are in attendance. * At these sessions the broader policies of management are settled , and such knotty questions as the executive or the finance committees can not decide are here discussed , together with all problems having to do with the purchase of new properties , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue of new bonds , the declaration of dividends , and so on . In short , the board is the law-making power , having very much the same duties and responsibilities as a parliament . But there is this difference : the president of the Steel Corporation presides at the head of the table at board meetings , and his cabinet ( the executive committee ) , as well as the finance committee , is composed of members of the board . The directors , being busy men , nothing but affairs of superior importance are placed before them , and those in the most condensed form . Indeed , the bulk of their work consists of approving what their president , the executive committee , and the finance committee , of which Robert Bacon , of J. P. Morgan &; Co. , is chairman , have done . All matters of executive routine , the whole vast internal workings and policies of the corporation , are left in the hands of President Schwab and the members of his cabinet , most of whom have offices near the president , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Indeed , they usually hold a meeting every day , gath-. ering around a mahogany table in the private office of Judge Gary , chairman of the executive committee . This executive committee has been constituted with scrupulous care . Every man on it has had experience in the conduct of large affairs , most of them having been presidents of the huge concerns which were absorbed by the United States Steel Corporation . Judge Gary , the chairman , a prominent lawyer of Illinois , was formerly president of the Federal Steel Company . The other members are Daniel G. Reid , a Western banker ; William Edenborn , German by birth , and an expert in every department of the wire industry ; E. C. Converse of Boston , formerly president of the National Tube Company ; Percival Roberts , Jr. , of Philadelphia , a trained engineer , and former president of the American Bridge Company ; and Charles Steele , a lawyer , and a member of the firm of J. P. Morgan &; Co . It is significant of the vitality of the new corporation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life . The average age of the president and his cabinet is only forty-eight ; the oldest member is fifty-five , and the youngest , President Schwab , but thirty-nine . It is a general though erroneous impression that when the Steel Corporation was organized all of the ten absorbed companies lost their identity , being merged in a single huge concern managed from New York City . But the United States Steel Corporation is rather a federation of independent companies , a combination of combinations , each with its own distinct government , officers , sphere of influence , and particular products . The Carnegie Steel Company , for instance , is still independent of the Federal Steel Company , and yet both are a part of the United States Steel Corporation , in the same way that Pennsylvania and Illinois , while separate States , each with its own governor , are part of the United States . The title , for instance , of A. J. Major is " President of the American Bridge Company of the United States Steel Corporation . " The organizers here pursued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Carnegie encouraged friendly rivalries between his plants , spurring them on with rewards , and by firing the pride of accomplishment he succeeded surprisingly in adding to the efficiency of his force . For years a huge broom , the mark of honor , was shifted from stack to stack in the Carnegie mills as the record of the world was broken ; and every man , from the manager down , gloried in the presence of that broom . So the various great companies of the Steel Corporation will be encouraged in rivalries . The United States Steel Corporation , owning practically all the stock in each subsidiary company , can assure harmony by electing such directors and officers as it chooses . But one company buys of or sells to another , as formerly , and the bargains are driven just as shrewdly as ever , each president being keenly ambitious to make a good showing for his company . The disputes which naturally arise , are settled by the executive committee , sitting as a sort of supreme court . Formerly the main offices of many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the new corporation was organized President Schwab transplanted some of these offices to the center , each of its own properties . For instance , the headquarters of the National Steel Company was removed to Pittsburg under the wing of the Carnegie Company . Put the management within  | smell of the smoke of the furnaces , " says Mr. Schwab ; " that is the way to get results . " These changes in several instances were productive of picturesque incidents , typical of the energy of the new management . Instead of permitting officers and employees to straggle along to their new headquarters , the company chartered special trains , as when the headquarters of the Oliver Mining Company were moved from Pittsburg to Duluth , and all the office employees with the books and documents of the company were sent flying to their destination . While each subsidiary company retains the entire management of its own manufacturing plants , it has been the policy of the new corporation to combine in great general departments those factors of production common to all the companies . For instance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own coke-ovens , and controlled their own ships on the lakes , and each had a department to care for these interests . Now , the ore and transportation interests are gathered in one great department , the chief of which is James Gayley , first vice-president of the Steel Corporation , with offices in New York and Duluth ; and the coke interests , the export department , the foreign offices in London , and cer- tain branches of the sales departments are each grouped under a single head . By this method a single agency distributes iron ore , coal , and coke between the various plants as needed , avoiding cross-shipments and supplying plants always from the nearest sources , thereby saving freight charges . Much of the economy of production depends on the efficiency of distribution . Formerly , serious delays resulted from the inability to obtain vessel tonnage at the right time , or to load the ships with the right kind of ore when wanted , for many companies , while owning plenty of one kind of ore , were compelled to purchase other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system , however , the splendid fleet of 115 vessels on the Great Lakes is all under the control of one man , Captain A. B. Wolvin ( fleet manager for Mr. Gayley ) , and the ore-distribution system is all under another chief . The ships can thus be directed by telegraph to the ore dock in Minnesota , Michigan , or Wisconsin , where each immediately secures a full load and carries it to the dock or mill where that particular kind of ore is most needed . Every plant of the corporation is connected by special telegraph wires , and many by telephone , with the central office in New  | York , as well as with Captain Wolvin 's office in Duluth , so that the needs of each in the matter of ores , vessels , and so on , can be instantly communicated . Suppose the works at Lorain , Ohio , need a load of some special kind of ore . Mr. Gayley 's department knows the exact location of every boat in the fleet , and by reference to its charts it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passing through the river at Detroit . A telegram is sent to the captain , and the vessel appears soon after at Lorain . Under the old system there might have been all manner of delays before the Lorain works could have secured this particular ore . Coke and coal are distributed much in the same manner by a central department . In the matter of sales there is still wide latitude of independence because the products of the various companies are different , one company manufacturing bridges , another tubes , another sheet steel , another wire , another tin-plate , so that each can best sell its own products . But in cases where several companies produce the same thing ? steel rails , for instance ? they agree on a price and appoint the same agents throughout the country . The foreign business of all the companies has been combined in one great office in London , under the direction of Millard Hunsicker . It may be said in passing that the corporation is planning the first really systematic effort ever made by Americans to capture foreign steel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been somewhat spasmodic and rather for the purpose of disposing of a surplus product than with a view to secure a permanent foreign foothold . It is said that Mr. Morgan had this development in view when he bought the Leyland steamship line . It is interesting , also , to note that the United States Steel Corporation has established a fire insurance department of its own , and that in future it will insure most of its own buildings , the business done exceeding that of many regular fire insurance companies . President Schwab has called the United States Steel Corporation a " clearing house for information " ; and this is truly one of its main purposes . The experience and wisdom of the best brains in the best plants are to be brought to the service of all the plants . In the old Carnegie Company the heads of departments were accustomed to get together at lunch and talk over their work . The same course is being pursued in the Steel Corporation . For instance , the presidents of the various companies assemble at certain times in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often deciding important questions without referring them to President Schwab . Similarly the general managers , the managers of sales departments , the freight agents , and the auditors of the various subsidiary companies have formed committees , elected chairmen , and each meets regularly to plan methods for securing greater efficiency and uniformity . Stenographers are present at these conferences , and such valuable points as may be brought out are set down and subsequently distributed widely among those in the corporation who will be benefited by the information . These meetings also serve as a sort of testing ground . Here talent shows its light , the chiefs come to know the qualities of their subordinates , and to select those who are to be advanced to positions of greater responsibility . It is said that the " trusts " crush the opportunities for young men , yet President Schwab has said : " I think there never was a greater opportunity for any man , workingman or manager , who has to use his brains as to-day . Never has there been such a scarcity of special men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is the expressed intention of the corporation to pursue the same course that Mr. Carnegie followed , that of admitting subordinates to an active share in the company 's business . President Schwab has a scheme of his own for extending the share system to the skilled mechanics of the works , it being his belief , pointed by Mr. Carnegie 's success and by the experiences of his own career , that the more harmoniously employer and men work together , and the more pride of employment that can be inspired , the better for all concerned . Indeed , there was rarely , if ever , a business enterprise in which every man was chosen so absolutely upon merit . To make such a vast enterprise a success , there can be no inefficiency in the management . It was one of Mr. Carnegie 's methods to discard , inexorably , all men who had passed the age of usefulness or whose energy was failing . He did it on principle , as he discarded worn-out machinery . Every man in his company , he said , must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are no ornamental officers , no " front office presidents . " I presume it would be impossible to find harder workers in any walk of life than Mr. Morgan , Mr. Rockefeller , Mr. Field , and Mr. Schwab , and other prime  | movers in the corporation . One of the first acts of the corporation was to cut down the number of directors in the subsidiary companies and make every officer the responsible chief of some department . For instance , the number of directors in the National Tube Company was reduced from 23 to 11 , and in the American Steel and Wire Company from 15 to 9 . A single example will show how one of these subsidiary corporations is managed . The president of the National Tube Company , Mr. Hearne , has general charge of its affairs . Mr. Schiller , first vice-president , is chief of the manufacturing department . Mr. Latshaw , second vice-president , is chief of the mercantile department . Mr. Culbertson , third vice-president and treasurer , has charge of the financial department . Mr. Matheson , fourth vice-president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Steel Corporation thus relies for its success on the human factor ; it is character and energy that have made the American leader in the world 's industries , and it is character and energy that the Steel Corporation is eager to purchase at any salary . In the same way that the various companies profit by the brains of their former rivals , they are also able to perfect their processes by the use of special inventions not before available . Each company had its own valuable patents and secret processes which now become common property . And the corporation keeps a sharp lookout for new processes and inventions , with which profits are increased and competition more successfully met . An important part of every plant is that of the scientific and mechanical experts , who are seeking new methods for performing by machinery work before dependent upon human muscle . The writer of the papers on American Engineering Competition in the London " Times " was strongly impressed with the loneliness of the great steel works at Pittsburg , the noisy machinery running at full speed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and perfect as the present processes of steel-making now seem , the Carnegies and the Schwabs see in the future amazing changes and development in the direction of making steel cheaper . Only recently Mr. Schwab predicted that the Bessemer process , which wholly revolutionized the steel industry scarcely thirty years ago , is doomed to disappear , being superseded by what is known as the open-hearth process . Another point of progress which will find fullest expression in the new corporation is that of making new markets for steel . Only a few years ago the steel-maker was fulfilling his mission if he sat still and let the orders come in , but to-day he manufactures not only his steel , but also his markets to absorb it . An English writer exclaims : " The American steel-makers manufacture business out of nothing ! " And one has only to look upon the recent development in the United States of steel buildings , steel bridges , steel railroad cars , steel railroad ties , steel ships , and so on , to realize the truth of this assertion . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business of proving that steel was better for certain purposes than wood or stone . Did a New York builder propose putting up a large office structure , Mr. Carnegie agreed to draw the plans without charge , provided only that in case steel was used his company should have the contract . It is by such methods that the new corporation proposes to spread itself . Every department of the United States Steel Corporation runs smoothly , simply , noiselessly . Knowing the magnitude of the business transacted at the capitol in Broadway , a vision of hurrying messengers , and of crowds of business men thronging the offices , rises before one 's mind ; but there is here no appearance of haste or of crowds . Here are roomy , comfortable , carpeted offices , high above the roar and smoke of the Mr. Schwab himself , though some humorism who loved the exaggerated and inconsequential has computed his time to be worth ten dollars a minute , is a calm , steady worker . He is surrounded by a personal staff of helpers , mostly young men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in the Carnegie Company . During office hours he is occupied largely in examining reports , in deciding questions , in answering the few important letters which have sifted through all his assistants , and in holding conferences with the members of his cabinet . Organization is , indeed , the mainspring of success in such a colossal enterprise , and yet it is absolutely necessary to have a man in the executive chair who possesses force and independence , who is ready , if necessity demands , to rise superior to organization , to cut red tape , to do the unexpected thing of genius .
