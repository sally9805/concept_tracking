txt The legislativ &; feature of the day in the Senate was Senator Cullom 's Anti-Trust bill , which had been expected and for which the claim has been widely advertised that it would represent the President 's ideas of the method of controlling trust ? . The fundamental idea of the bill is to bar the transportation of trust-made products from one State to another . The penalty for violations of the law is fixed at a fine of from $500 to $3,000 . The bill authorizes the Attorney General or any District Attorney to make application to the Federal Judges for the summoning of persons before them to answer questions as to material violations of the anti-trust law its advance of the trial of a case , and requires the Judges to issue orders for the appearance of such persons upon this application . In such cases witnesses are to be protected against prosecution , but they arc to be deprived of the right to refuse to answer because of self-crimination . Annual reports are required to be made by all persons , firms , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filed with the Inter-State Commerce Commission and they are to be subject to the scrutiny of the Attorney General , but nut of the general public . The Attorney General is authorized to appoint fifty special agents to seek out violations of the law . Senator Cullom says of the bill that it represents himself and not others . He has been led , he says , by his long service at the head of the Inter-State Commerce Committee to approach the subject of trust control by the most natural avenue , and that is under the commerce clause of the Constitution . Ile admits that his proposition is drastic and says that nothing but a complete and thorough law is going to accomplish the object aimed at . He does not say that the bill does not need amendment , and as much as says that it would only be after radical amendment in the Judiciary Committee that any report could be got on the measure . It is recognized that Senator Hoar will not support the Cullom plan for controlling trusts . If a bill should come from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the Cullom bill . But there is no sound reason ' for the expectation that any trust bill will be forthcoming from the Judiciary Committee this session , and it might as well be said at once that when Senator Cullom 's bill was referred to that committee it was consigned to forgetfulness . Thereis no prospect that it will ever be heard of again . Senator Cullom. however , said this afternoon that he would endeavor in all good faith to get a favorable report from the committee and would attempt to pass the measure , if not at this session , at the next . The Illinois Senator is a man of tenacious mind and he is likely to hold fast to his idea , It is the belief of those who have inside information that the President is not In any sense behind the JJullom bill . The Illinois Senator has . had many conferences with Mr. Roosevelt and has laid before him his views on the subject , but it is most improbable that his bill has been at any tithe " fully known by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his sanction . The measure is so radical and arrays such tremendous powers in restraint of commerce between the States wherever there may arise any suspicion of trust abuse that it is wholly inconsistent with the President 's views to suppose that he approves such a proposition . A Republican S ; , , nator said of the bill this afternoon that it is " valuable only as a standard of comparison to show what might be done with the trusts if the worst should conic to the worst , but it will never become a law , and , you might say , will never be seriously considered by the Senate . " The Judiciary Committee of the House held its first meeting to-day and took prompt action in the direction of getting an anti-trust measure before Congress at the earliest possible moment . Mr. Jenkins of Wisconsin , who has become acting Chairman owing to the retirement of Judge Ray . referred all measures dealing with trusts to the sub-committee , of which Mr. Littlefield of : Maine is chairman . It Is the hope of Mr. Littlefield that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the adjournment for the Christmas holidays . The committee to-day unanimously voted to request the Speaker to appoint Mr. Jenkins Chairman of the committee .
