IT seems almost superfluous to speak especially of the home life of the Chinese women , for they might be said to have no other life , save during he festive week of the China New Year , or San Nin . We seldom see these timid little Chinese ladies in this country , unless we take the trouble to go into the Chinatown of some large city . Even then , we may come and go forever without knowing any of the high caste Chinese ladies , unless by a fortunate chance we have a friend at court , who will take us into his home during the week of the New Year . Woman is ever the servant in a Chinese household and is looked upon as such . She is not the companion and equal of her husband , but the slave . Of course there are exceptions to this . One may at any time meet the Chinese woman of the lower class upon the streets of the Chinatowns of the United States , but not the high caste , little-footed ladies . Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ packed in cotton wool , and guarded as precious gems . One reason for this may be accounted for in the following : I once ventured to say to a cultured Chinese official : " But suppose a Chinese w o m a n had been compelled to marry when she was a child , and after she grew up should find some man whom she really loved ; what then ? " The reply came in all suavity : " That does sometimes happen , and it is to provide against any such contingency that we secrete our women , and thus prevent then from being brown into the society of , any  | other man . " There is not much danger of falling in love when the opposite sex may only be seen from the third or fourth story window . There is nothing left but to yearn and yearn for something different , and to weave all their heartaches into the rich and rare embroidery which is constantly evolving under the dexterous manipulation of their tiny brown fingers . There are no romances to talk over , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the New Year , and this is hardly possible , as they are always under the watchful and jealous eyes of the lords of the family . A woman is not considered even worthy a name , and in many families the women are designated , ignominiously , as one , two , three and four . If one is lucky enough to have a son , she is called " such and such a boy 's mother . " It is expected that she will retire from the room when a stranger or a man enters the home . Among the poorer classes there is not so much separation of the sexes , but an aristocratic woman is always a prisoner , and can only see the world from the limited area of a tiny balcony near the roof , removed from the seductive wiles of the opposite sex . To lose a wife by death is considered a mere trifle . It would seem better to be a very low class woman ? one even devoid of any character ? for they are allowed perfect freedom , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in joyous abandon into any place whatsoever , unless , by an unfortunate chance , they should happen to be the slaves , and at the beck and call of their master , or of the old hag who guards them . As women advance in years , hewever ; they are treated with a great deal more respect and consideration , and if they become mothers they are regarded with love and tenderness . If they should become grandmothers , they are almost worshiped . Sometimes there are real love matches , even when bride and groom have not seen one another before the wedding day a strong attachment may spring up afterwards . Chinamen , with rare exceptions , do not believe in educating women , because they find them hard enough to control without , and they think that with education they would simply be beyond all power of control . Even Chinese women have their ideas in regard to woman 's rights , and in many families the superior will and author- ity of the woman is manifested and acknowledged , though not always cheerfully . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a science , so scrupulously is it observed on all occasions . They are generous and full of hospitality . The thought of being married is so disheartening that many Chinese girls would rather enter a nunnery . Instances have been known in which , when a Chinese girl came to be married , her father demanded from the groom payment for all the food and clothing the father had bestowed upon her to date . A girl 's mind is taken to be of no account , and for it the parents in no way hold themselves responsible ; for her body alone they assume a care . To spend time and money in giving the daughter-in-law of someone else an education is considered nothing short of madness . " But , " you may say to the father , " she is your daughter , surely ? " " Not after she is married , " he replies , " she is theirs . " He sees no use in teaching her to read and write when she is to  | end her days in another man 's family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so far as he is concerned . In arranging for marriage the overtures must be made by a " go-between , " who always receives a commission from the groom 's parents . This party goes to the girl 's home and makes the proposal to her parents in behalf of the parents of the groom . If the father sanctions the match the prospective groom will then send a gift to the future bride , and documents are exchanged between the parents setting forth the day , hour , month and year when the young " people were born , also the maiden names of their respective mothers . Their horoscopes are then cast by astrologers , and if favorable , the couple become engaged , but not so securely that the pact can not be broken , for everything with the Chinese is guided by superstition . For instance , if a china bowl should be broken , or anything lost in either household within three days after their engagement , it is considered unlucky , and the engagement is broken , but if these accidents do not occur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the girl 's father , accompanied by gifts , such as a live pig , sweetmeats , or oftentimes a goose and gander , which latter are considered types of conjugal fidelity . The groom-elect then prepares two large cards , on which are inscribed the details of the engagement . A paper dragon is pasted on the outside of the one he retains , and a phoenix upon that sent to the girl . Two pieces of red silk adorn each end of the card , and after they are sent the groom presents gifts according to his rank . A fortunate day is then selected by an astrologer , and on the eve of the  | wedding day the groom with his best man will proceed to the house of the girl and carry her to her future home in a red sedan chair . Musicians will accompany them , playing wedding airs . When they arrive the bride is taken from the chair and lifted over a pan of burning charcoal , which has been laid at the door by " two women of luck " ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The groom waits for the bride in the reception room . He is seated on a raised platform before which she must prostrate herself . He then comes down to her level and taking off her veil views her face for the first time . No words are exchanged , and they then sit down side by side , each one trying to sit on a part of the dress of the other . They think that the one who does so will rule . They then go into the hall , and before the family altar worship heaven and earth and their ancestors . Dinner is served to them in their own apartments . The guests peep through the open door and make remarks on the bride 's appearance and actions . It is not considered good form for the bride to eat anything , but the groom may eat heartily . The attendants then hand each of them in turn a glass of wine , and with the exchanged pledges the ceremonies are at an end . On the third day after the wedding the bride pays the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she lives what is literally the " life , of a frog in a well , " and for the rest of her days she can see no one but her husband . in her rooms , save at the New Year . The newly married woman , instead of getting a new name , has no name at all , but only the two surnames of her husband and father , so that when these happen to be common ones it is impossible to distinguish one from the other by name . If a stranger address a Chinese woman it is even more embarrassing . In some places they use the term " elder-sister-inlaw " ( sas-tyn ) for any woman , and in others " aunt " ( ta-niang ) must be used ; and in others , " grandmother " ( nai-nai ) . The mother-in-law is the ruling spirit in every Chinese household , for the girls are usually married so young that they have had no opportunity to acquire selfcontrol . The married woman must call her mother-in-law " mother , " but is also allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divorce his wife for seven reasons , but he can do nothing that will give the wife the right to divorce him . The affection of most Chinese children for their mothers is deep and enduring . The mother 's death is the greatest calamity that can befall a daughter . When this love exists the visits of a young married woman to her mother are by far the most pleasant episodes of her life , and she endeavors to go as often as possible , to which course her husband 's people strenuously object . To prevent this they often load her down with more sewing than she can do , or send her off with a crowd of children , if she happens to have them . When one reflects that every Chinese family consists of married sons and several wives , each one having been forced into the circle almost unknown , and each one possessed of a strong and untamed will , it is plainly seen that little happiness can be expected . In Chinese homes the sexes do not eat together but eat in different rooms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mandarins ' wives have the same embroidered insignia on their garments as their husbands wear , and their way of dressing strongly resembles that of the men . It consists of a loose fitting blouse , trousers and wooden sandals . Their hair is pasted back with a gum made from Chinese shavings , which is applied with something very similar to our toothbrush . Their coiffure is sometimes intricate , and filled with jewels and stickpins . They must sleep with their necks on a wooden block to preserve this as long as possible . A Chinese woman can rest or sleep anywhere , or in any position , or in any amount of noise . Her  | face is therefore free from wrinkles , even to a green old age . She often , by an excessive use of cosmetics , covers up the bloom of youth . As their poets have declared that " a woman 's eyebrows should be arched like a rainbow and shaped like a willow leaf , " the women take tweezers and extract all the hairs which in the least deviate from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women to appear at all regular festivals with their faces whitened by a wash of rice flour paste . But the women with large feet hardly ever do this . Brides are supposed to keep their faces thus whitened for several months after marriage ; a respectable widow is never allowed to use cosmetics . A pale , white face is preferable to the bloom of youth . Bracelets form an important feature of a woman 's dress , and especially bracelets of the beautiful green jade , without which no Chinese woman 's toilet is perfect . Women of the Chinese laboring classes are fond of wearing such gewgaws as tin earrings , although the more fortunate ones possess in addition silver ornaments which they wear projecting from their heads , in various directions , together with vividly colored and unmistakably artificial flowers . They all wear flowers of some kind in their hair when it is possible to obtain them , but always in connection with the numerous other hair ornaments . They never wear hats of any kind , except field women , who wear straw hats like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifteenth of the first Chinese month , the birthday of the goddess " mother , " some married women will go to the nearest joss house and implore the goddess to allow her to have male children . On the seventh day of the seventh month they make offerings of fruit and melons to some goddess , and pray that she will give them skill in needlework . Then they thread seven needles with colored thread by the light of the moon . If they succeed in this they take it as a favorable sign . Water taken from wells on this same evening is believed to make beautiful complexions . The grandmother must prepare the food for all , and make all the garments worn by both young and old . Bedding must be made , and frequently ripped open , renewed and cleaned . At the happy New Year season the aristocratic woman is allowed for one week to don the rich clothes she has embroidered and to go forth like a freed bird and mingle with her kind in the intoxication of making and receiving calls . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on meeting , interlacing their fingers , or , for very formal greetings they place their closed hands side by side and shake them gently once or twice by way of salutation . The Chinese women , knowing nothing of a higher life than that they have always led , seem as a general thing perfectly content to endure privations and sorrows .  |
