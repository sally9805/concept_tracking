It being " impossible , " Mr. Roosevelt said on November 15 , " for the President of the United States to enter into a personal discussion " with Mr. Henry M. Whitney of Boston , he proceeded to do so in his usual vigorous style . It is not of supreme importance whether the President did or did not say , with or without that " context " which he thinks so vital , that he favored Canadian reciprocity and believed in " Continental free trade . " We imagine that his pres ent irritation on that subject is due to complaints and appeals from the beleaguered Lodge . Much more significant than this personal controversy is the letter which Governor-elect Guild wrote to the President three days after the election . In it he expressed the belief that he and his party in Massachusetts would have been " overwhelmingly defeated " if in their platform and campaign they had not favored " immediate tariff revision . " He added that both parties in Massachusetts desire it ; that " all admit " that certain duties are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is anathema " ; and that it is the " urgent desire " of the people of the State that the President should recommend instant tariff reform in his message . Mr. Roosevelt 's consent to the publication of the Guild letter shows that he does not consider its sentiments treasonable . His chance is now certainly splendid to dig up that buried tariff message which he was going to send to Congress a year ago , but did not , for reasons which Speaker Cannon could doubtless state . Mr. H. S. Frye , president of the New England Tobacco Growers ' Association , has confounded the standpatters by coming out for reduction in the tariff on Philippine sugar and tobacco to 25 per cent . of the Dingley rate , and the removal of the tariff tax on all other articles . He acknowledges his apparent heresy , saying : " I know the popular thing to do , and the thing every representative of every protected interest is expected to do , is to get up on one 's hind legs and howl calamity . " But , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protectionists , Mr. Frye urges this reduction in the duty on tobacco on the ground that it will benefit the Connecticut tobacco growers . He finds that there is actually a demand in the islands for New England . grown wrappers , and that the tariff stands in the way of a considerable export business . What happened when the bars were let down in the case of Porto Rico  --  the increase of the export tobacco trade ? Mr. Frye is sure will happen when the barrier is lowered for the Philippines . All this , of course , only bears out the contention of Secretary Taft and men like Representative Hill of Connecticut , who dame back from the islands last summer with a new conception of the mutual interests of the Filipinos and the New England tobacco-growers . " The Tariff as Seen from the Inside " would be the proper heading for the interview with Speaker Cannon which the Tribune printed on Friday . Mr. Cannon stands as pat as ever . He professes not to know what 386 men may do about the tariff . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tariff bill , and it was argued and argued , and at the end of twelve months its advocates could gather together enough votes to pass it , the country being held up by the tail in the meantime , I think you 'd find that the new law would have just as many outrageous things in it as are found in the Dingley tariff act . " This statement is well within the truth ? that is , if a new tariff bill should be framed , as the McKinley and the Ding-ley bills were , by the " friends of protection . " The object of these loving friends is not to reduce the tariff and lighten the burdens of the consumer . That is the last thing they think of . The problem for them , as experience has repeatedly proved , is to draft a measure which shall put the largest possible amount of money into the pockets of those who have most stoutly upheld the system  --  that is , by liberal campaign contributions . The sign over the door of the treasurer of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Slot and Get a Tariff Favor . " So long as this principle is in operation , so long as the consumer is the negligible factor , each new law will be just as outrageous as that which it supersedes . Elated , and very naturally , by his success in saving nearly a million dollars a year in the printing of department reports , by his injunction of brevity upon his Cabinet , President Roosevelt turns his attention to the subject of official correspondence . It is nearly as bad to be verbose in a letter as in a report . Perhaps the ideal outcome would be to bring the Government 's epistolary output back to the proportions of those often-photographed notes which " A. Lincoln " used to scribble on the backs of cards . Every now and then some Washington correspondent performs a valuable service by recounting the familiar story of the routine through which a high public officer must go if he wishes , for instance , to borrow a book from another bureau . " Red tape " is a relative term . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the official should be allowed to put on his hat and go for the book himself without any letter-writing or initialling of papers . But there can not be two opinions about the bureaucratic tendency which has been gradually turning Washington into one vast letter-file . If the Keep Commission , at the President 's behest , can bring in common-sense methods , both will surely deserve monuments . President Roosevelt appears to have been a bit staggered by the protest of railway employees on November 14 against his proposals for railway-rate legislation . The representatives of the Ave great labor organizations connected with railroads  --  engineers , firemen , conductors , switchmen , and trainmen  --  expressed the fear that reduction of rates would mean the reduction of their wages . In reply , Mr. Roosevelt said that he was only striving after " perfectly fair treatment " for all concerned , and that his plan of control did not mean necessarily a reduction in rates . Then , we ask , what is all the pother about ? Why was there so much fuss about the " maximum " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to empower a Government commission to fix ? Why the new plan to make the l.a , ilways submit to their losses , under a lowered rate , with right of appeal and reversal if they could show their original rate to have been " reasonable " ? The " fair treatment " at which the President aims must refer to secret rebates , local ; discriminations , the abuses of private-car lines , etc . But they are not to be net by Government rate-making ; and if the country is given to understand that the latter does not mean cheaper freights , it will lose interest in the plan . Mr. Roosevelt 's statement betrays , in fact , a tendency to waver which goes far to justify Senator Long of Kansas in refusing to promise the Commercial Club of Wichita to " get right " with the President . Mr. Long said that the President had already taken contradictory positions , and that there was no telling what he would recommend to Congress . The Interstate Commerce Commission was overruled by Judge Bethea in the United States Circuit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examination into the facts of the case , the Commission had directed the lowering of isilroad rates on live stoe% between the Missouri River and Chicago to a point where they would conform to the rates on dressed beef . But Judge Bethea , in brief , found that the Commission was entirely mistaken as to its facts , and also as to its legal powers , and gave his decision for the railroads , while declining to grant the application of the Commission for an injunction to force the railroads to lower their rates . The fact that the Commission has been overruled will not surprise M ! . Roosevelt , for in no less than ninety-three per cent . of the cases appealed to the courts from the Commission , the Commission has been upset . But he may well pause in his determination to make the Commission the final arbiter in tie matter of railroad rates . Not even the promise of the appointment of " only good men " to a reorganized Commission should conceal the danger . Mr. Roosevelt might appoint only men of the calibre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In this connection it is interesting to note that Mr. Roosevelt appointed Judge Bethea to the Circuit Court as a reward for his services as a prosecutor of Trusts . Yet even he is compelled by law and facts to appear , in his first decision of importance to the public , to side with the corporations attacked by the Commission . We are expected to see a great moral significance in the attempt of Platt and his crowd to wrest the Republican machine of this city and State away from Odell and his crowd . The war between the factions is declared . Even the President is said to be drawn into it  --  and what lovely associates are assigned to him ! He is to go into the glorious struggle alongside Platt and Black and Barnes and Ward and Aldridge and Dunn and Quigg . The noble array on the other side includes Odell and Halpin and Lauterbach and Littauer , along with many underlings and dependents whose names signify nothing  --  except a mighty appetite . And the Republican party of the Empire State expected to stand by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ establish the right to make carrion of it ! Platt may succeed in glutting his revenge upon Odell ; the smaller schemers who are so cynically using the " prestige of our former beloved leader " to get their hands upon patronage and plunder , may be able to break Odell 's grip upon the machine ; but that will simply mean that the last state of the organization is worse than the first . It is time for a genuine stirring of new life in the Republican party of this State . Why should all its young and ambitious members be content to line up , year after year , first under one boss and then under another , giving the State nothing but a choice of evils , or , rather , evils among which there is absolutely no choice . Critical days confront the party . Legislation of the highest importance must be attacked at once . A Governor is to be chosen next year . Sooner than any one can tell , two live men will have to be elected to the United States Senate , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Yet with all these vital matters pressing upon it , the Republican party is asked to give its time and energy for a year or more to a wretched squabble between embittered rivals for the post of chief ladler-out of the spoils ! ? Secretary Taft 's comment on the Ohio election is of the kind that can hardly be too often or too emphatically repeated . " The result in Cincinnati , " he says , " is a long step toward better municipal government and better local party politics , but the victory will not be completed for several years . A machine in-trenched in power as is the Ohio machine can only be made to give up through the earnest attention and work of young men entering politics with the enthusiastic and unselfish desire to make it better . " He echoes here the thought of the disappointed candidate for Governor , Mr. Herrick , who complained that it was largely blind wrath ( and desire for punishment that moved the voters to the State 's political overturn . As we said at the time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all . But the retirement of one man or a dozen men is no assurance against the return of gang- rule . Cox has retired , but so did Croker and a hundred other bosses of past years in our cities and States . The late peaceful revolution at the polls was remarkable in its wide extent , not in its kind . But Ohio , or any other State that actually makes it impossible for a new machine to take the place of the old , will have won unique honor . The news that voters are being paid $3 apiece for their ballots in Spain is considered important enough to cable to this country . But here an item to this effect would attract about as much attention as a statement that some " prominent citizen " had stubbed his toe . For instance , the Wickford , R. I. , Standard remarks placidly of the late State election : " There was not much money in circulation . Of course , the old stand-by floaters had to have their fee , but that was probably the extent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report the price of hogs and cows ; the only differ-ence is that this market report re-lates to the buying and selling of votes . In Binghamton , N. Y. , the quotation 's were very low . State Senator Harvey D. Hinman got Elmer G. Sisson to vote in return for one dollar . Sisson 's vote was challenged by Democrats who saw the payment made by Hinman . The high-minded Republican Binghamton newspapers , the Press and the Evening News , naturally belittle the affair . " It was , " one explains , " a sensation with little foundation " ? this apparently because Sisson got only one dollar . Mr. Hinman himself explains that he in no way advised Sisson how to vote , but merely reimbursed him for his car-fare and lass of work-time --  -- a purely philanthropic action . Yet supersensitive souls find fault with this little business arrangement . Mayor Dunne of Chicago seemingly has as many ways of attaining municipal ownership as Cyrano de Bergerac had of reaching the moon . His " contract plan " having been definitely rejected by the Council , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " municipal ownership . One of these is a modification of his former " city plan , " under which the city would proceed to build parallel and competing lines on streets not occupied by the private companies . The second contemplates the condemnation of the companies ' property , and the third , an agreement by arbitration on a price to be paid fork the lines . None of these is actually new . In fact , there are not Many conceivable solutions of the traction question that have not been aired during the years of discussion in Chicago . It must always be remembered in connection with the everlasting interchange of views between the municipal Executive and Legislature , that Chicago 's Council is very different from our Board of Aldermen . The weeding-out process of years and the regular reelection of desirable members have made it an assembly in whose honesty , ability , and understanding of the traction questidn the people of Chicago have exceptional confidence . It is no longer true . as it was when Carter H. Harrison took office , that to be at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's own wisdom and integrity . A visitor from Mars , newly landed in New York , would write home that in this topsy-turvey land the one essential to worldly success is total lack of the faculty known as memory . The most eminent financiers and statesmen of the commercial capital of this continent , he would remark , have recently been giving testimony under oath . While each displays markedly individual traits of speech and taste in dress , they are alike in their absolute inability to remember . A brisk young man named Frank B. Jordan , son of a former comptroller of the Equitable Life Assurance Society , had forgotten everything so completely that , were he a resident of Mars , he would.belong in an asylum for imbeciles . A United States Senator , former president Nov. 23 , 1905 of a great railway , and still member of Many important directorates , has apparently risen to his present height of glory because , in the course of a few weeks or months , all names , faces , letters , sums voted for various purposes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swim in a hopeless deliquium . A former Governor of the Empire State , leader of the dominant political party , a second man who is a brilliant financier , master of one of the most extensive railway systems in the world , and a third , a young graduate of the oldest and most famous university in America , a patron . of art and literature , whose services to an insurance company and certain allied corporations were reckoned to be worth $127,500 a year  --  these three gave testimony on the same point , and no two of them were able to agree . Presidents of insurance companies with salaries ranging from $100,000 to $150,000 annually had seemingly lost , track of all they ever knew about the details of their business  --  especially the work of the ) ir legislative agents . In brief , the visitor would warn his friends who contemplated coming here to live that they must drink of nepenthe . The publishing of frequent reports by the Mutual Life investigating committee seems to us altogether . wise . The investigation may be prolonged ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can formulate its broader opinions on the present theory and practice of insurance . But in the meantime the Mutual 's own situation is one in which delay in the introduction of needed reforms would be most unfortunate . The budget of recommendations reported by the committee on Thursday is entirely to t he point . Premising that . " certain of the practices and methods are so palpably loose and unsound as to call for immediate attention and correction , " the committee advises , first , that all matters pertaining to legislation affecting the company be handled exclusively by the law department , with full responsibility for each and every transaction . This is a stroke at the subterranean lobby system maintained by the Mutual , almost wholly through improper and irregular use of policyholders ' money for that purpose . The business of the Albany " House of Mirth " the company declares must be promptly ended , and " Watcher " Fields discharged . The " Department of Supplies and Printing , " whose administration of the corruption fund was the most flagrant of all the scandals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declares , as to both personnel and methods . Finally , the " commission agency contracts , " whereby the McCurdy family was progressively enriched , and of which the committee remarks that they " were originally made and have since been continued or modified " in an " apparently irregular manner , " should be brought , the Truesdale committee thinks , to an immediate termination , and be replaced by employment of salaried managers . These recommendations make a good beginning , and promise thoroughness in the committee 's dealings , later on , with other important aspects of the situation . Not the least striking paragraph of the report , if one mads between the lines , is the committee 's ! answer to President McCurdy 's proposal to cut down his $150,000 salary . In his letter he " considers that it has been earned , " but cautiously defers to " the judgment of some policyholders that it is too large . " The committee 's answer , in declining to deal with the matter as requested , is , that to alter such a salary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the committal of the company to the continuance of the personnel of the present management . " " John Krup " ? if that happens to be his name  --  is described as " a thin , harmless-looking young chap " ; no one seems to have heard his name before ; his own lawyers do not , apparently , know his address . He was arrested on election day for the not-unheard-of offence of having voted on a name that did not belong to him . For all that any one can prove to the contrary , he may have voted for Ivins and Jerome . He was perhaps as obscure a citizen as all New York could show . Yet on Thursday morning an ex-Assemblyman of the State of New York , his counsel , deposited $5,000 in cold cash as his bail , and by afternoon he had disappeared . Either we have here a case of purely disinterested charity , or else this man 's absence from the city was worth $5,000 to somebody . The offence occurred in Charles F. Murphy 's own district ; that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes at a time when the canvass of votes is bringing to light daily an amazing series of blunders , and failures to observe the legal requirements in the tallying of votes  --  to put the case mildly . The average election board is stupid enough , in all conscience , but if anything in the world is calculated to produce conviction that there was a dishonest purpose behind all these discrepancies , it is just such an incident as the flight of Krup . The rumor that the Germans were about to withdraw from their Chinese colony was , of course , promptly denied . The colonizing nation which will voluntarily give up a country to its rightful owners has yet to be discovered . Germany never pretended to a trusteeship in Kiao-chau as did the United States in Cuba . She was there for what
