txt Mr. Cleveland 's ante-mortem declaration of greater faith In Taft than In Bryan , and of confidence in Taft 's election , published since Cleveland 's death , is arousing the Bryanites everywhere to emphatic protest . Many of them are as free to denounce Cleveland dead as Cleveland living ; But these last words of Cleveland , which seem to come as a voice from the tomb , seem also to come as retribution upon a party which permitted the defeat of the Parker memorial resolution at Denver . Standing by the new-made grave of the only man it had made PreSident in nearly two generations , that party allowed itself to be dragooned into defeating the adoption of any adequate expression of regret at its loss or of understanding of the public and party service of the dead . This action was in shocking bad taste . Worse still , from the purely political point of view , it was a challenge to an element in the party which Mr. Bryan 's Denver platform seems to be making an effort to reassure . The dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calculailin was made at Denver , or rather at Lincoln , that he , being a dead one , was no longer a factor to be considered in politics , the publication , since his death , of an article writ .. ten by him gust before his fatal Illness , shows its emptiness . The Bryanites are hardly to be blamed for resenting its pub . lioation now . It has all the seeming of an arm thrust up out of the grave fot the dealing of a terrific blow at old and seemingly triumphant enemies . The dead speaks with tenfold more power than the quick could have spoken , and . with tenfold more power than if the convention at Denver had done the wise and decent thing . The Bryanites have a right to their scare . They had been counting upon the return to the party of many thousand Democrats hopeful of regaining their party regularity by supporting Bryan in the year of his third and final defeat .                  @ @ @
