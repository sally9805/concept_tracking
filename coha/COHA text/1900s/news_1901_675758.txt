txt The Russian . Ambassadon Count Cassini , has comniunicated to the State Department that , in consequence of the action of ( he American Government . through a Treasury or.le , : of March e lase. apply-ing tariff restrictions against Russian petroleum imported into this country , the Russian Minister of Finance . M. de Witte. has issued an order , dated June 7. imposing the high tariff rate of the Russian schedule on American white resin . or colophon . galipot. white resin under Article S-2 of the Russian tariff law . and increasing the rate on American bicycles , under Article 17$ of the Russian laws . This action is entirely apart from that taken in connection with Russian sugar , and is a new develop/milt in the discrimleatory duties in-loosed ny this Government and the retaliatory duties imposed by Russia . The order of the Russian Minister is to take effect next Friday , or two weeks from the date of its issuance . At the Treasury Department it is stated that the imposition of a duty on petro ' was not a matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ th ut was made mandatory by the Dingley Tarift act , which directs the Secretary , in case any foreign country imposes a duty on petroleum imported from the United States , to levy a like duty on petroleum imputted from that country . As Russia collects a duty on petroleum imported from the United States , this Government , it . compliance with law , imposes a duty on Russian petroleum . In no sense , it is stated , can this duty be regarded as an unjust discrimination against Russian petroleum , as that country took the initiative against the American article . Had Russia not taken this st.ep , her petroleum would have been admitted to this country free of duty , under the terms of the Tariff act . In his reply to Count Caseini 's note . which was transmitted to the Treasury Department . Secretary Gage protests against the implied contention that this Government 's action a discrimination against Russia , and ada : " I beg leave to submit for your consideration the question whether the measure now adopted by the Imperial Government is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the existing treaty of eommeece and navigation with Russia . " The text of the Russian Ambassador 's letter , as delivered to the Treasury Departmsnt , is as follows : Washington , May 26 , 1901 . . Secretary of State : The Federal Government having by circular dated March 9 , 1901. applied Article 626 of the American tariff to Russian petroleum , the imperial Government has just informed me that the Minister of Finance of Russia has taken the requisite steps for the application of the advanced rates of duty to the following American products entered into Rus-sia : " 1 . White resin or colophon . ganeot , brewers ' pitch , Article 82. and 12 ) bicycles . Article 173 , Paragraph 3 . This measure will go into effect two weeks from the date of its promulgation . " The present duty on articles under the first head , of the resin family , is 30.8 cents per pood , or 36.112 pounds . Bicycles are now taxable at the rate of e0 ? 26 each . The imposition of the maximum rate will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the effect of the Russian decree is an application of Article 625 of the Russian Custom House regulations , which was the paragraph applied by the Russian Government to American argicultUral machinery and hardware in return for the requisition for the differential sugar duties upon Russian sugar . The communication by Count Cassini has Caused more disquietude in the administration than is expressed in the statements of the Secretary of the Treasury .. The action of the Treasury in indicating that discrimination shall be made against Russian oils was not prompted by fear of Russian competition in this country , for the statistical reports for 1900 show that no Russian oils were imported . American oils to the value of about $$2.000.000 were exported during the ten months ending with April . but there is not a separate entry showing the amount exported to Russia . " All other Europe " is put down as taking $12.390,992 worth of oils , and France is mentioned in a separate line as having taken in that period oils to the value of about $1.400.000 for illuminating purposes . The assumption by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have been figures to show their importations . Following , as it does , a series of St. Petersburg reports of irritation in the Russian Government in consequence of the imposition of the countervailing duty on sugars , the news brought by the Russian Ambassador seems to heve had a provoltitig effect , and it is intimated that there has been consultation looking to action to bring the controversy to a head . Little reliance can be placed upon the report . that can not be corroborated .. to-night . that retaliation amounting to embargo is contemplated , as such action would embarrass trade amounting to about $16,000,000 . The exports to Russia average about $10.000,000 in direat shipments . and the imports reach something ' ee 56.000.000 . In attat:Vng the exports to Russia of naval stores M. de Witte will strike a tender spot for our shipments of resins reach to about $300,000 to European Rugsia. the amount sent to Asiatic Russia also being considerable . This is about half of the value of manufactured goods affected by M. de Witte 's first order of retaliation . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russia . having taken only $263,503 in the ten months ended April . leer ? . There is no separate entry for Russia . while France is set down es having taken in the last ten months bicycles and parts valued at 5126.874 . Again , the assumption is that Russia 's share of what is credited to " all other Europe ' is smaller thap that sent to Prance . It is not the value of the inhibited articles of which we may lose the exportation that causes such vexation as is manifested . It is the purpose behind the retaliation , as the ' amounts to be affected , under the order of the Russian Minister of Finance , is no breaking matter . Some disposition is discovered to look for a diplomatic purpose to be achieved by thus striking at American exports . as if the United States might be constrained , by its desire to retain every dollar of its export trade , to yield some point to hold Russia 's good-will in other directions . Hitherto it has been understood that Russia was not dissatisfied with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very candid acknowledgment by China of the friendly course of the United States in Chinese affairs may be found to have aroused the jealousy and resentment of Russia , which , it is suggested by a diplomatic officer , may have found expression in objection to the orders of the Secretary of the Treasury , which Mr. Gage points out were not discretionary with him , but merely the discharge of a Ministerial duty imposed by the language of the Dingley law . It is tipnsidered too incredible for serious comment , that Russia , as has been intimated at ' the Treasury , has become affected with the European distrust or jealousy of the rising importance of the United States as a commercial power . Whatever sympathy might be felt by Russia with envious European nations that feel our competition . it is suggested that Russia , which is not exposed to our competition and which has always insisted upon the maintenance of a tradition of friendly relations , would naturally be inclined to favor the United States as against some of the European countries that have recently been manifesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the products of America . AMALGAMATED COPPER DEAL EFFECTED AT LAST . Butte and Boston and Boston and Montana Companies Absorbed  --  Mr. Heinze , However , Will Continue the War . The application of Calvin 0 . Geer and others , in their ' suit against the Amalgamated Copper Company , for a continuation of the temporary orders of Vice Chancelors Pitney and , Stevens restraining the absorption by that concern of the Butte and Boston and the Boston and Montana Mining Companies , came up before the Court of Errors and Appeals , in Newark , N. J. , yesterday , and was denied . Thus ended the case and makes unnecessary the final argument which wouide have been heard at the present term of the court had the temporary injunction been continued . The orders of Vice Chancellors Pitney and Stevens expired at 6 o'clock last evening . A few hours later the merging of the three companies was accomplished , the institution of further injunction suits being thus forestalled . When the proceedings in court opened , Flavel , Mr. Geer 's counsel , in asking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally disposed of the appeals from the decisions of Vice Chancellors , Pitney and Stevens refusivg to grant permanent injunctions. stated that there were two propositions for the acquiring of the property of the Butte and Boston and the Boston and Montana Companies . The first proposition netted about $1s.000.000 in cash for the Butte and Boston property . The other offered one share of Amalgamated stock , par $100 for each Sill share of Butte and Boston , and four shares of Amalgamated for each share of Boston and Montana . The latter offer carried with it a proposition to increase the capital stock of the Amalgamated Company front $75,000,000 to ** Mr. quoted figures to support his contention that the total value of the Butte and Boston property was not over $2,000,000 and that the total value of the Boston and Montana Company was not over 520.000,000 . R. C. Lindabury , counsel for the copper companies , in reply , made a vigorous attack upon the complainants in the case . The suit , he said , was simply a " strike , " and was instituted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total of 750,000 , and that most of the 304 shares were acquired in the open market after the amalgamation had been proposed , simply for the purpose of bringing this suit . Mr. Lindabury next directed his attention to refuting the claim that the companies to be absorbed were worth only $23,000,000 . The companies , he said , were paying dividends equivalent to 10 per cent . on $80 , - ( 0 ) 0,000 , and a , committee consisting of James Stillman . President of the City National Bank of New York ; Robert Bacon of J. P. Morgan Co. , and Frederick R Olcott had employed mining experts and thorough a made investigation and re-m ported the companies worth all that it was proposed to pay for them . The Court went into conference , and in five minutes Chancellor Magie made the announcement that the Court was of the opinion that the injunction asked for should be denied . F. A. Heinze entertained a party of friends . at dinner at Claremont last night . and on their return to the city some of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A. O'Farrell , Mr. Heinze 's personal representative . said : " We understand that the merging will take place at once , but subject to further litigation . Mr. Heinze 's war on Amalgamated and allied concerns still continues in Montana . and there is absolutely no prospect , of a settlement between Hein and the Amalgamated Copper Company . ' ? R. E. L. Brown , mining engineer , idtntilied with South African and Montana mining . said : If any . settlement has been made it does not signify that Mr. Heinze has made any recession from the position he has always maintained , viz. , that he holds the key to the situation at Butte.
