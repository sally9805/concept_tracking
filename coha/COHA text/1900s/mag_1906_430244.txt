THE WOMEN OF JAPAN . IN many ways our country has been fortunate enough to win the good opinion of foreign critics . One of them has said : " The Lord has never made anything more beautiful than your Inland Sea . " And of that oldtime , half-smiling culture of Nippon which had penetrated to the very bottom of society , another has been gracious enough to say : " Why , your coolies and jinrikisha men speak a language fit only for the court of Louis XIV . " But what of our women ? M. Pierre Loti , the French Academician , seems never to have grown weary of writing of " those singular dolls with flat profiles , " of " the little eyes drawn to the temples , little eyes as of cats . " He has said that " the Japanese women of all classes are small of body and mind , artificial and affected . " But not content with this superficial criticism of the women of Japan , he once endeavored to show how learned he could really be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and confused to their giddy little brains , when even the most learned priests of their country lose themselves in their cosmogonies , their symbols , and their metamorphoses of gods , and in the millinery chaos upon which the Buddhism of India has so strangely foisted itself without destroying anything . It will appear from the above that even the prose of M. Loti sometimes becomes muddy . If one would write simply and clearly , he must first be master of his subject . He must know what he is writing about . But that is neither here nor there . Does not this academician know that the three representatives of Japanese scholarship who were selected to go from our country to India to make the first investigation of the philosophic Buddhism were the women Jenshinni , Jenzoni , and Keizenni ? But why should he have burdened himself with a tedious historical study , when he could with so much comfort and ease tell the whole world that he knew it all ? Now , our good M. Loti has seen a treaty port or two in Nippon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a l'Europeenrre held in Tokio at the Rokumeikwan , when Western civilization was , like young wine , mounting to the head of the nation , when Count Inoue was happy with his whitewash diplomacy . All these things were burlesques , which murdered the classic grace of our women and their costumes , and only succeeded in caricaturing the vulgarities of the West . To a woman of Nagasaki , on whom a boatman-coolie would scarcely have bestowed a I It ) THE WOMEN OF , JAPAN . passing glance , the learned academician devoted himself for the purpose of making an impression . If we take him at his word , there is no doubt that his efforts were successful ; and he took occasion to report his success to the world by means of a popular novel . In reply to my comments some persons might ask : Is it not a rather original idea to select M. Loti as a true representative of the West , and base thereupon the charge that all the Western nations are libelling the women of Japan ? In answer to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christian gentleman , a missionary and an educator ; and I have culled the following from a new book of his , advertised quite extensively ? doubtless with his knowledge , if not his consent ? as the most recent and complete authority on Nippon and things Nipponese : In no regard , perhaps , is the contrast between the East and the West more striking than in the respective ideas concerning woman and marriage . The one counts woman the equal if not the superior of man ; the other looks down upon her as man 's inferior in every respect . . . . In the one , the wife at once takes her place as the queen of the home ; in the other , she enters as the domestic for her husband and his parents . ... In the one , the wife is the helpmate ' ; in the other she is the man 's plaything ' .. . In the ideal home of the one , the wife is the object of the husband 's constant affection and solicitous care ; in the ideal home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , serves his food for him , and faithfully sits up for him at night , however late his return may be . . . . The one considers profound love as the only true condition of marriage ; the other thinks of love as essentially impure , beneath the dignity of a true man , and not to be taken into consideration when marriage is contemplated . That , perhaps , is the reason why the Eldorado of women , called America , the home of this Christian gentleman , has never seen a woman in the presidential chair , not one ; and the history not only of America , but of the entire West , seems quite unable to give us a single name that might be placed side by side with that of Hojo Masako . And who , pray , answered to the name of Hojo Masako ? A woman of Nippon ? and in her day there were many men in Nippon . She lived in the Augustan age of Nippon statesmanship . And permit me to remark , that I have not cited the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the throne of the Mikado . Does this glimpse into our history assure you that with us woman is inferior to man ? I am not saying that a pair of eyes ? especially a pair of imported ones engaged in collecting data in support of certain conclusions about t he women of Nippon formed in the United States or in Europe ? focussed upon a certain corner of our social life , might not see , to the entire satisfaction and comfort of the critic , that in Nippon a woman is a " man 's inferior in every respect . " But , the reverend authority to the contrary notwithstanding , our historians without fail go to two sources whenever Ihey wish to trace the greatness of a historic character or to THE WOMEN OF JAPAN . 141 account for a great historic event . And these two sources are ? wife and mother . In America , Mary Washington is the mother of George Washing ton , after all ; and to the student of Nippon history , Kusuncki Masatsura , to whom we have erected a temple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nippon patriotism , is the son of his mother . In Nippon , where , according to the reverend author , the wife enters as the domestic of her husband and his parents , the Lord of Inaba ? unquestionably one of the ablest men of his day ? is remembered in history as the husband of Kasuganotsubone . In the latter , the founder of the Shogunate , Tokugawa leyasu , placed more confidence than in his " Elders . " She stood as the embodiment of the highest type of constructive statesmanship in her day . In Nippon , many persons could write many a page on " the unknown husbands of well-known women " ; but it would tax the genius of an apologist and something of a sophist to say much about the unknown wives of well-known men , which seems to be a fairly entertaining topic in the happy West , where " the wife at once takes her place as the queen of the home . " To be sure , many great forces in the universe are silent ; and the power of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boldly in front of her husband in a parade , only would strike her sense of humor . She has frequently seen turkey gobblers , peacocks , and other things that strut ; but the sight of them has always tortured her sense of taste and form . Moreover , through her reading of history , and through what she has seen in life , she has become acquainted with the fact that the fashioner of history frequently makes his way behind a mask , and that a great prince often follows his own puppet . Her eyes are always on the real ; and she makes liberal tribute to men of the spectacular type . " Man 's plaything ! " A student of the shadier side of New York society might find some pertinent meaning in this expression of the reverend critic . Using it as he does , in connection with the Nippon woman , the expression stings us , the hapless males of that land , with an overwhelming irony . Having danced to the pipings of our ladies ' wits for some fifteen centuries , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last grace of burying our humiliations in the shade . It has not been altogether the fault of the men of Nippon that they have spent so much of their time and effort upon the art of war and in the profitless pursuit of gold , and therefore have not had half as much time as our women to devote to the cultivation of the powers and fancies of the mind . As for the wife serving her husband 's food to him and " faithfully sitting up for him at night however late his return may be , " ? why should she be censured for such things , if they are quite as pleasant to her as making a lady 's maid out of her husband and compelling him to cook his breakfast THE WOMEN OF JAPAN . himself on a winter 's morning are to the refined selfishness of the civilI and Christian wife of the West ? I venture the offhand assertion that re wives have laid down their lives for their husbands in the heathen of Yeddo in one year than in all the capitals of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman seems to be quite as marked as the selfishness of her Western sisters . All that I pray is that authority from whom I have quoted above will prove that my observations have been erroneous . As if for the purpose of giving a sort of backbone to his story ? but certainly not because he felt the need of so doing the reverend author quotes from " the editor of the Japan Mail , ' " who " himself married a Japanese woman " : The woman of Japan is a charming person in many ways ? gracious , refined , nanly before everything , sweet-tempered , unselfish , virtuous , a splendid mother , an ideal wife from the point of view of the master . But she is virtually Ended from the whole intellectual life of the nation . Politics , art , literature , and nee are closed books to her . She can not think logically about any of these subs , express herself clearly with reference to them , or take an intellectual part in conversations relating to them . She is , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companion , and the inevitable result is that he despises her . More 's the pity ! We have a book called " Genji Monogatari , " than ich none is more important to us in the entire range of the classic literature of Nippon . The position it occupies in our literature is similar to that occupied by Homer 's works in Hellenic literature , and by Shakespeare 's works in English literature . May I be permitted to ask these precious fora critics to name the author of the greatest classic of Nippon ? No Badan controversy has served to cast any doubt upon the authorship . e author of the work was Murasaki Shikibu , a court lady of rank . shonagon , another woman of Nippon , wrote the famous " Makura Zoshi , " which is classed by many critics as only second to the " Genji Monitari . " A few years ago , the writer happened to be in a certain part the United States during the time of a drought ; and the people flocked o the churches to pray that the gracious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many years ago , in the days of that historic drought en all the rivers were but the powdered skeletons of the living waters it had been , the people went to a poetess and begged her to address an peal to heaven . Clad in white , bareheaded , under the cloudless glare of sun , she read her classic lines ; and to-day there are thousands of people- descendants of the simple folk to whom the poetess was gracious o would swear to you that the sky was so touched by the pathos of her ' s and the music of her rhythm that it sent down a perfect flood of rain . historical record , there is a shrine Avhieh the grateful people built in THE WOMEN OF JAPAN . 143 honor of the poetess . So transcendent did her poetic gifts seem to her people that they , like the Greeks in their goodly ( lays , begged her to join the company of the immortals . What names , pray , can America give us , out of all her accomplished and enlightened women , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heights where stands the name of Koshikibu as a lyric poet ? To find one in any way comparable with her , we must go to the one songstress of Greece ? Sappho . A confession , even if good for the soul , is sometimes humiliating . But , since what must be must be , here it is : The brains of Nippon have always been with her women rather than with her men . And what is more humiliating still , is the fact that Nippon women very often outdo their brothers in their own territory . The one in Nippon whose generalship conducted the first successful foreign campaign was the Empress Jingo . Under her victorious banner , the warriors of Nippon marched through Korea on their first foreign campaign . Tomoe , who fought side by side with the famous warrior Yoshinaka , was the peer of any of her soldiers . In all the desperate sieges of the feudal days , the women of the clans , naginata ( spears ) in hand , were always conspicuous for their bravery and fighting qualities . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To-day we are very proud to say of Tokugawa Ieyasu , the founder of the Tokugawa Shogunate , that he was the greatest constructive statesman that Nippon has ever seen . Nevertheless , every historian admits that in the building of the House of Tokugawa it is impossible to say how much of its stability and of the profound wisdom of its policy was due to the now famous lady called Kasuganotsubone . Certainly , after the death of Tokugawa Ieyasu , she was the brains of the government . Even in the sad days of the Tokugawa culture , when frivolity in its madness darkened into crime and excesses knew no bounds , one could see the names of Kamei Shoken , Hara Saihin , Yama Saiko , and Cho Koran stand out , with no little lustre , against the sombre background . And they were the names of scholars , women all , especially distinguished for their Chinese culture . An eminent professor connected with the Imperial University of Tokio , named Basil Hall Chamberlain , is one of the three scholars of foreign birth who can pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , without a key and without a pause . I do not know what he thinks of our women to-day , but there was a time when even he allowed himself to write : Women are all their lives treated more or less like babies , neither trusted with the independence which our modern manners allow , nor commanding the romantic homage which was woman 's dower in Mediaeval Europe . If , in spite of his scholarship , his brain , his opportunity of seeing people 144 THE WOMEN OF JAPAN . and things , and his thirty-odd years of experience in Nippon , Prof. Cham berlain was to such an extent misled in his conclusions , it is not at all un natural that so many other critics  --  critics with three months ' or three years ' treaty-port experience ? should write such utter nonsense when they pose as judges of Nippon women . Both Miss Bacon and Mr. Lafcadio Hearn have said many a kindly thing about our women . Both of them have seen the Nippon woman of these modern days = days of transition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have led up to the Nippon woman as she is today , they , with all their sympathetic insight , have found not a little diffi culty in accounting for those qualities in her that capture the soul . With the exception of these critics and a very few more , all the civilized writers who have hailed from the homeland of gallantry have libelled the Nippon woman ; but she has simply smiled sweetly at all that has been said to her discredit .
