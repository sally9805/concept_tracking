The interest in the life of Margaret Gordon , Lady Bannerman , is altogether too slight to warrant the publication of a volume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is made bulky by thick paper and expensive by the London tradition . The title of the book , " Carlyle 's First Love " ' ( John Lane Co. ) , will explain , if it does not quite justify the purpose of the author , Raymond Clare Archibald . As a matter of fact , he has extremely little to say about Carlyle , and that little neither very new nor interesting . Those only who are concerned in certain Scotch genealogies will find the book valuable . One reflection it raises . Now that virtually the whole mass of Carlyle material has been published , and all the facts of his career are easily available , why does not some ambitious scholar undertake a thorough revision of Froude 's biography ? By the correction of dates and quoted texts , by an occasional note or modification of the text where Froude goes too far astray in his interpretation of events , that much maligned life might be restored to its high place . It is scarcely within probability that any one will ever de novo write a life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or even , in certain aspects , come as close as Froude 's to the real man Carlyle . The great need is to purge it of its errors , and that for the most part could be easily done . When Carlyle , in 1843 , published " Past and Present , " the exaggerated cult of optimism which we have to-day was not as yet , a literary limitation . Carlyle was permitted to write , in his Proem , that " England is dying of inanition , " without being ruled out of court . And now one of our latter-day prophets , Gilbert Keith Chesterton , writes an introduction for Carlyle 's book , which is published in the World 's Classics , by Henry Frowde . Mr. Chesterton is not at his best in this introductory essay . " All skepticism is like seasickness , " he writes ; and we do not relish the figure . Nor do we . admire its expansion : " If you can not enjoy the universe it is better to throw it up . " Mr. Chesterton too often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of parody is the least admirable of all . When , however , he protests against the everyday use of the words " reactionary " and " progressive " as , inevitably , terms respectively of offence and of praise , we are more sympathetic . " Progress . " he writes , " happens , in short , whenever men can endure one tendency for a long time . And reaction happens whenever some particular man can endure it no longer . A progressive is always a conservative ; he conserves the direction of progress . A reactionary is always a rebel . " There speaks Chesterton in his better vein . And his reactionary rebel is , of Course , Carlyle . It is good to have " Past and Present " in this new and excellent reprint . We are glad to see a good edition from the Clarendon Press , of Hobbes 's " Leviathan , " one of the great clarifying books , both for its style and its ideas . Nor does such praise necessarily . imply an acceptance of Hobbes 's theories , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is idle , " says W. G. Pogson Smith , in his introductory essay , " to qualify such a political philosophy : it is rotten at the core . It is valueless , save in so far as it stiraulates to refutation . We may be content to leave it as a precious privilege to the lawyers , who need definitions , and have no concern with morality . And yet , no thinker on politics has ever probed its fundamental conceptions more thoroughly ; and I say advisedly , if you would think clearly of rights and duties , sovereignty and law , you must begin with the criticism of Hobbes . " Mr. Pogson Smith , whose recent death was much deplored at Oxford , shows that he has himself gone deeply into the analysis , not only of Hobbes , but of the political philosophy generally of that age and the next . Some of his remarks are penetrating , as when he speaks of Rousseau 's survey of human nature as often strangely and suspiciously , resembling that of Hobbes ; but he fails , nevertheless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much needed . His comparison with Rousseau might have get him on the way , but he goes aside to consider subsidiary matters . What we desire is a thorough study of the element of social illusion , which , to Hobbes in the form of kingship , and to Rousseau in the form of the volonte generale ( and , we might add , to Plato , and other philosophers in a variety of forms ) , seemed the necessary basis of government . In this , Hobbes and Rousseau agree ; they differ in their respective views of human nature as essentially evil and egotistic or good and sympathetic . A proper study of Hobbes ' must , in the end , be psychological , rather than legal , and such a study Mr. Pogson Smith , with all his knowledge , does not give us . Readers whose interest in the poet has been revived by his death will find in " Swinburne 's Dramas , " selected by Arthur Beatty ( Thomas Y. Crowell &; Co. ) , an attractive one-volume edition of " Atalanta in Calydon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The editor has supplied judicious notes explaining classical obscurities , and an introduction apparently not ' dictated by intemperate enthusiasm . In placing Swinburne beside Matthew Arnold as an interpreter of the results of " The Origin of Species , " he touches upon an important subject demanding rather fuller elucidation than he has been able to accord . In praising the rhythmical splendors of the choruses in the Greek plays he emphasizes a poetical virtue felt in varying degrees in the non-dramatic work as well . If this re-offering of the dramas is to be of service in strengthening Swinburne 's hold upon the public , it should invite reexamination of what is purely dramatic in the poet 's contribution . It will never persuade any one that Swinburne had mastered the art of Webster ? " Mary Stuart , " though it contains much virile ? verse , is merely the best in a trilogy of the most formidably undramatic plays in the English language . It should , however , allure some of the sad young people who go about , intoxicated with mortality , chanting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Proserpine " ? There star nor sun shall waken , Nor any change of lightit should allure those hot-blooded lovers of death into the sobering shadows of the Greek tragic spirit . There is in " Atalanta " and in " Erectheus " not an intellectual , but an emotional depth , a sense of pity and terror , which seems constantly to escape the facile apprehension of critics . It is easy to declare that the abandoned volubility of these plays , especially the earlier , is Swinburnian and not Aeschylean or Sophoclean . On the other hand , it is easy to point with ? delight to metrical or pictorial triumphs  --  he slaying of the boar , the choruses , the sacrifice of Chthonia .. To grasp their variety and respond vitally to their unity is - another matter For full participation in the terrific ideas of life , death , and destiny involved in the tragedy of Meleager , or in the magnificent conception of civic duty symbolized by Chthoma , demands a rebirth in the antique world , demands a reader divested , collected , hearkening like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a task for a still , long , sunlit morning or for the privacy of a stormy midnight ; and it is worth while The authorities of the Jamaica Institute are about to follow up their publication of " Bibhographia Jamaicensis " by the issue of a Bibliography of the West Indies , omitting Jamaica The work includes all islands in , and lands adjoining , the Caribbean Sea .

The chief interest of the papers is in the light which they throw on political conditions in that State during the period of civil war and reconstruction Worth , who entered public life early as a Whig , was one of the most determined opponents of secession , and in 1861 opposed the calling of a convention to consider Federal relations , on the ground that such action by the Legislature was unconstitutional .

W Holden became provisional Governor , Worth was made provisional treasurer , and later State agent , an office which required him to collect the scattered property of the State which had been seized by Federal officials or stolen outright by individuals On the downfall of the Holden administration , at the end of 1865 , he became Governor , and had the good fortune to commend himself to Gen Sickles , the military commander of the district ; but with Sickles 's successor , Canby , whose administration took little account of either the prejudices or rights of the people , he was at sword 's points , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a judge of one of the State courts In 1868 he was removed from office " to facilitate the process of restoration , " and lived in retirement until his death the following year .

" since " we who were born here will never get along with the free negroes , especially while the fools and demagogues of the North insist they must be our equals " As an intimate picture of conditions in the Far West during the last period of its epic history , the period from 1871 to 1885. when even the officers and soldiers of thi United States army had to reckon with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roe 's " Army Letters from an Officer 's Wife " ( D Appleton &; Company ) more than ordinarily interesting It is not a pretentious book , the author assures us that " all flowery descriptions have been omitted , " but in spite of the lack of such floral ornamentation the wild land between the Mississippi and the Pacific , with its perils and fascinations , is very vividly described Mrs. Roe was with her husband durmg sixteen years of service in what was then Indian Territory , Colorado Territory , Montana Territory , and Idaho Territory , and her account of the country and of life in camp bears the stamp of absolute veracity It is an interesting experiment to recall one 's early impressions of Deadwood Dick and his compeers and see how far they square with the realities as described by one who was in the magic laud just about when we were reading of it in the dime novels Mrs. Roe participated in the running down of Indians and was , on several occasions , nearly captured by them One gathers that , in spite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplemented by dancing and theatricals , the life was an exceedingly hard one The charm of a more than usually attractive personality is felt throughout the book , whether it as a question of the domestic and social life in officers ' circles , hunting parties , or occasional encounters with desperate and gentlemanly outlaws Mrs Roe 's sojourn beyond the Mississippi was broken by a short stay in the South . At Vicksburg in 1877 she spent three weeks in the house of Jefferson Davis , whom she sketches with a good deal of sincere sympathy . Calderon , indifferent to the future fortunes of his dramas , gave forth no personally supervised editions of them , apart from a few autos or religious plays . After his death , his Gongoristic disciple , Vera Tassis , published the most complete collection of them , and this , in the opinion of so important a critic as Menendez y Pelayo , shows probable traces of alterations at the hands of the editor , who is not unduly suspected of having introduced purple patches into some of the best works for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the seventeenth century . Vera Tassis 's edition is , unfortunately , the chief basis of the modern editions of Calderon 's plays . In the case , however , of the " Vida Es Suede " we have also the edition , published ( with several other Pieces ) by the poet 's brother Jos ? in 1636 , and then , surreptitiously , in the same year , at Saragossa .. Making use of the two 1636 prints and of that by Vera Tassis ( 1685 ) , Dr Buchanan has prepared the present welcome edition ( " La Vida es Sueflo " : Comedia famosa de D. Pedro Calderon de la Berea , 1636 , edited by M , A. Buchanan . Vol I. University of Toronto Library ) . He has undoubtedly improved upon Keil , Hartzenbusch , MacColl , Krenkel , Menendez y Pelayo and others , who , in the course of the nineteenth century , have sought to present the drama in critical form In the choice of variants among the readings of his three texts Dr. Buchanan has shown good judgment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the second volume , in which he is to discuss the previous history of the theme of the play and its general literary importance . The quarto " Odyssey " printed at the Oxford University Press in the type designed by Robert Proctor will be treasured by all who love what is rare and beautiful . The type itself , as Mr. Proctor has explained , " is based on the celebrated Alcala font of 1514 . This was cut by order of Cardinal Ximenes for use in the New Testament of the great Coraplutensian polyglot Bible , and is usually supposed , though there is no direct evidence , to owe its form to an ancient manuscript which was sent to Spain by Leo X from the Vatican library to serve as the basis for the text of the New Testament in that work . " Whatever the origin , it is singularly rich in curves , and , after the first look of strangeness has passed away , easy to read . The Alcala type had only one capital letter , a a , and for the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ingenuity . He has been highly successful here , with the exception , possibly , of the epsilon and omega , which would have better matched the other capitals , if they had been more angular . But this is a small matter , and we give our opinion here with diffidence The paper is identical in manufacture with that used by William Morris for his Kelmscott Press . The text is that of Dr. D. B. Monro , issued at Oxford , in 1901 . The edition is limited to 225 copies , and the price is four guineas . Such a hook is distinctly and frankly a luxury , but why should not scholarship have its own magnificent rewards ? In 1907 the British Academy accepted a gift of ? 10,000 , bestowed in memory of Leopold Schweich of Paris , as the foundation of the " Schweich Trust , " to be devoted " to the furtherance of research in the archmology , art , history , language , and literature of ancient civilization with reference to biblical study . " A portion of the income has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicated in the foundation . The first addresses were made by Canon S. R. Driver on " Modern Research as Illustrating the Bible " ( Henry Frowde ) .. They sketch briefly the progress made in biblical arch- logy in the nineteenth century , and , more particularly , describe the information which has been secured recently on the early history of Palestine from the inscriptions and monuments brought to light from excavations . Excellent illustrations accompany the text . The principles of the " New Thought " ' movement in American religious circles are set forth in a series of tractates by the Rev. J. Herman Randall , pastor of the Mount Morris Baptist Church of New York . Some of the titles are : " The Real God ; " " The Subconscious Mind , " " The Power of Suggestion , " " The Rebirth of Religion . " ( H. M.

The Rev. M. W. Paterson of Trinity College , Oxford , makes no claim of original research for his " History of the Church of England " ( Longmans ) , yet it is an uncommonly good summary . The author 's point of view is that of a moderate Angli can , and the treatment is characterized throughout by fairness and self-restraint , even while party spirit still runs so high in the English Church that the books dealing with its history  --  and they are legion  --  are all too frequently partisan in method . The account of the ecclesiastical revolution under Henry VIII and of the critical generations that followed is , on the whole , admirable . The eighteenth century , on the ' other hand , fares very badly . Nothing could be more unsatisfactory than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further from the truth than the notion , traditional among English churchmen , that Bishop Butler 's " Analogy " gave deism its death blow . Deism succumbed to quite other forces , and hardly an important book of the eighteenth century had less influence in its ( Bin day than the " Analogy . " The nineteenth century , like the eighteenth , receives relatively too little space . The account of the Oxford Movement is fair and sane , but other matters get scant attention . Taken as a whole , however , the book is one of the best , as it is one of the most readable , of the many brief histories of the English Church . ? A bibliography of the hymns of Paul Gerhardt and of the editions of his poems and sermons , the biographies , monographs , popular essays , and addresses , and the musical and dramatic observances occasioned by the celebration of the three hundredth anniversary of his birth in 1907 , has been prepared by a warm admirer of Gerhardt , Rudolf Eckert ( Pritzwalk : A.

In the second part of the book Beth shows in detail the influence of this idea on such prominent problems of theology as Theodicy , Sin , the Original State of Man , Revelation , Jesus Christ , and Immortality . Beth concedes that , in view of what the modern development philosophy has accomplished , it is necessary even for orthodox theological thought to make concessions that would have shocked older generations . The death is announced of William Richard Morfill , professor of Slavonic languages at Oxford University and curator of the Taylor Institution .

John Bannister Tabb , a professor at St. Charles 's College , Ellicott City , Md. , and , since 1884 , a priest of the Roman Catholic church , died on November 19 , in his sixty-fifth year . He was born in Amelia County , Virginia , and served during the civil war in the Southern navy ; becoming in 1864 a prisoner of war .

His education was received at Dublin University . Later he studied at St. Cecilia 's School of Medicine . On coming to this country , he entered journalism , and in 1870 became managing editor of the San Francisco Bulletin . Later he became editor and part owner of the Baltimore Bulletin . In 1877 he joined the Sun as a general writer , being elected publisher in 1884 . Three years later he founded the Evening Sen. In 1900 he purchased the interests of the Charles A. Dana estate . An abiding interest , other than that of journalism , was that which he always had in the fine arts .

Richard Watson Gilder , editor of the Century Magazine since its organization in 1881 , died November 18 in New York city . He was born in Bordentown , N. J. , February 8 , 1844 . His father was a Methodist clergyman , from whom the author inherited , perhaps , a part , of his creative impulse .. Owing to his frailness , he was educated at home ; but when the Northern cause seemed threatened in the campaign of 1863 , his state of health did not deter him from enlisting in Landis 's Philadelphia Battery , and he was under fire in the ? defence of Carlisle . In 1865 he entered newspaper journalism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Home , a monthly magazine issued by the Scribners .

On the death of Dr. Holland , the managing editor b e came editor- in-chie f ; and when , in 1881 , the magazine was pus-chased by Roswell Smith , and the name changed to the Century. , he continued the editorship of the magazine under its new name . It is as poet , ! however , rather than as editor . that Mr. Gilder attained the greatest reputation . His first collection of verses , " The New Day , " was published in 1875 ; " Five Books of Song " came out in 1894 , and included earlier publications ; " In Palestine " was issued four years later ; " Poems and Inscriptions " ( 1901 ) , and " A Christmas Wreath " ( 1903 ) and " A Book of Music " ( 1906 ) , both anthologies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " " Fire Divine , " and " In Helena 's Garden . " But Mr. Gilder was more than editor and man of letters . His enthusiasms included an ever active sense of civic responsibility , and he was an unflagging worker for the city beautiful and the city righteous . As president of the Tenement House Commission of 1894 , he achieved invaluable results , and his was one of the voices raised , not in vain , against the abandonment of St. John 's Chapel in Varick Street . He was one of the founders of the Society of Amer  --  ean Artists and of the Authors ' Club , and will be remembered as one of the members of a circle of literary men of whom William Dean Howells and Mark Twain alone survive .
