txt The Methodist Episcopal General Conference Committee on Temperance , ' of which Samuel pickle of Michigan is Chairman , and of which Congressman M. N. Johnson of North Dakota , author and champion of the anti-canteen law , is a member , adopted resolutions today , which . in the minds of a number of the committeemen , are at least a direct slap at President because of his acquiescence in the decision of Attorney General Griggs declaring the law ineffective . The resolutions are a portion of the report of a sub-committee into whose hands the task of preparing the committee report to the General Conference had been placed , and was adopted in the face of a motion to substitute for it a less severe minority report from Dr. Jacob E. Price of the New " York Conference , after a two hours ' debate , in which the members alternately arraigned and championed President in his stand on the anti-canteen law . The report is as follows : We are , however , chagrined , humiliated , and exasperated by the puerile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called , by the Attorney General of the United States . and , with all due respect to his exalted station , we record the fact that we are pained and disappointed at the course of the President in accepting as final and satisfactory an opinion without binding force . Such an abuse of power is nullification in its most dangerous form . Upon the President . as Commander in Chief of our army . rests the responsibility for - the canteen saloon . an evil which he has ample power to suppress . arid which , to quote the Episcopal ad " is a more deadly foe to the soldier thai bullet or tropic heat . " We urge upon the President an early exercise of the power vested in him , to the end that the authority of the Government , instead of being used to place temptation before the soldier , shall be used to save him , as far as possible , from the mural hazards incident to military life . The argument of W. B. Howard , a lay deleg'ate from the East New York Con. ference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belittle a public official , " brought forth the reply from Dr. William D. Parr of North Indiana . that " the report could belittle no one when it spoke the truth . " - I contributed to the Presidential situation as far as I was able , but I do not answer for the future , " said Dr. Parr . " If a man makes a mistake , let him take the consequences , but let the Church face toward the right . " A dozen called for recognition when Dr. Parr yielded the floor , and Dr. R. H. Gilbert of Central Pennsylvania , after an illustration of a sailor who criticised a sermon , " because there was no harpoon in it , " said : " I do not believe in taking the harpoon out of our report by making the substitute , which perhaps was the best the . Episcopal Board could offer , but which is beneath this committee . There is only one right side to this question , " - In the cries for recognition which follow-ed . Dr. F. H. Lynch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secretary , secured the floor . anti called forth a Volley of disapproval when he said : " I favor the substitute , ' first , . because it is more statesmanlike , and second , because it is more likely to pass in the General Conference . There are men in the conference , and powers they are , too . who will not stand for the least word of condemnation or personal criticism of the President or the Administration . At the least word of renunciation they will arise and slap you in the face . We are not all together on this great question of temperance . Why will you take this means to further separate us ? Harpoon a principle as much as you will . but it is not necessary to harpoon an individual . " Dr. Eaton of the Des Moines conference took exception to the imputation that the committee had to frame its report to suit the General Conference and referred to a claim that the I-resident had been present at a " beer banquet " in Milwaukee , and was friendly to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a part of the report , " said Dr. Eaton . " We might have made the report more personal with good grounds . In fact , the arraignment of the President is mild in comparison to what we might have made it . " The vote to make the substitute was lost , with only 16 affirmative to . ' 14 negative votes , and the original report was adopted .
