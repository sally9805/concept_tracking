If the President , and every other Republican with a shred of decency , were not , as Mr. Roosevelt writes that he is , " very solicitous about the political conditions in New York , " they would be both stupid and callous . Apparently , the President had in mind only the sordid quarrel between Odell and Platt . But last week 's testimony by the latter unreverend corruptionist , before the insurance inquiry , carries us far beyond that . We have now a full revelation of the way in which the Republican party in New York has been for years a political bawd , selling itself for money . Corruption has been its daily bread . It has lived upon dishonesty , thriven upon blackmail , and grown great on bribery . We now see that its Legislatures have been made up of men hired to do dirty work , its Governors more or less consciously the tools of thieves , and its United States Senators common carriers of rottenness . Senator Platt frankly took off the manhole cover and showed us his party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down , must feel disgraced as well as astonished by Platt 's cynical admission that the party has lived in this State by bleeding corporations and robbing widows and orphans . But what is to be done about it ? Restitution , we suppose , can not now be made , but the promoters and beneficiaries of the shameless corruption can be whipped from public life as they already are expelled from the society of decent men . We for our part can see nothing for it but at once to call upon Platt and Depew to resign their offices . They have brought disgrace on the State ; the people of the State should demand that they no longer flaunt their infamy in the Senate . Even in that body their presence would hereafter be regarded as infectious ; even its indicted or convicted members would say that their punishment was greater than they could bear if they were held to have sunk so low as Platt and Depew . With those two spokesmen in the Senate , New York is not only misrepresented , but made a hissing Neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every finger in the galleries pointing to the outward sign of New York 's deep disgrace . The unbought and self-respecting press of the State should take this up immediately . Honest citizens should lift up their voices . Petitions should be sent to the Legislature . Gov . Higgins should be addressed ; does he not care that New York is made a byword and a reproach by its two United States Senators caught in the political stews ? Platt and Depew must go . Their co-parceners in corruption  --  the insurance officials  --  are being driven out ; so must they be . It will not do to fall back and leave it to nature soon to snuff out the flickering flame ; indignant New Yorkers must see to it that Its last ghastly light is not made to reflect upon the fair fame of the State . President Roosevelt has an imperative duty laid upon him . One striking way to show his disgust with Platt 's confessed villany is to break with him openly now . The hoary blackmailer and trafficker in legislation ought never to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not resign , and has business to transact , the President ought to compel him to do it by letter or messenger . The hand of Theodore Roosevelt should never again be laid in that of Tho'm'as Platt . Here is a real chance for ostradisne  --  social and political  --  and the President well be on the defensive if he does not apply it to Platt . Nor can Mr. Roosevelt or his Mends allege that this corruption does not touch his white garments That , indeed , may be  --  alleged of the trust funds obtained last year to elect him President : But how about 1898 , when he was elected Governor ? That Was a close-fought Campaign . Mr. Rooseveltle plurality was narrow . Yet in that year Plait was boss , he was collecting his $10,000 from the Equitable , his $10,000 or whatever it was from the Mutual , and ( m the Tribune has asserted , defying Platt to sue it for libel ) blackmailing corpora-Cons promiscuously . Mr. Roosevelt , moreover , went to consult Platt about the conduct of the campaign . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rightful leader ; so that a peculiar obligation rests upon him to clear his own skirts , and to come to the rescue of his own State , by aiding or leading in every Movement to rid public life of the Platt poison . It is not strange that Platt 's habitual defenders and lenders are struck dumb All the old talk about his " wonderful sagacity " and " unsurpassed management " and " extraordinary power of attacking to himself devoted followers , " is now put in its right place . It always Was absurd to the eye of reason , and now the dullest can see it ' WI be so . Plait a statesman , a leader ! He is simply a " striker , " a blackmailer , a purchaser of votes , a seller of nominations and of legislation ; Carrying the bag , he has carried the party in it . Paymaster-General of the forces of corruption , he has held himself in power by precisely the same means as Croker . And how foolish , in the light of his own confessions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate , none of the money which Platt handled stack to his own fingers . " How can that be known ? He has had millions given to him , and he himself states that he has kept no accounts . He could do with the money what he pleased . There were no tell-tale checks ; it was , as he testified , cash by special messenger . From the insurance companies alone he appears to have had More than $500,000 in the last twenty years . Well , we can not stand about holding our noses . We must fall to disinfecting . Here is a work of sanitation before the President greater and more urgent than anything which confronts him at Panama . And the first step should be to retire Platt , Depew , and Odell , so that they will no longer be in control of the corrupt management of the Republican party , both receiving and giving infection . A LITTLE INSURANCE HISTORY . The reappearance of the name of David B. Hill in connection with life-insurance affairs recalls an incident which took place while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1880 the State Legislature passed a law to tax life-insurance companies . It imposed a tax of one per cent . per annum on the gross amount of the premiums , interest , or other income ( except from rents ) , received by such companies of this State from persons residing in this State , or from investments represented by , or based upon , property situated in this State . This not was chapter 534 of the Laws of 1880 . The companies paid the tax until somebody discovered that it might be unconstitutional . The State Constitution provided that every law imposing a tax should state the object to which it was to be applied . The law of 1880 did not do so . The amount received from the tax had passed into the Treasury and had been appropriated to ' the general expenses of the State . The companies thereupon ceased paying until the arrears amounted to $1,000,000 or thereabouts . Meanwhile , the Legislature had passed another tax law without any mention of the object to which the revenue should be applied . This was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the courts almost immediately which was destined to settle the , dispute . Mrs. Mary McPherson died , leaving a will containing bequests to other persons than her direct heirs . The taxing authorities demanded the portion due to the State , which the executors refused to pay , on the ground that the law fixing the tax was unconstitutional , since it did not state the object to which it was to be applied . It was at once perceived that the decision in the McPherson case would cover the question raised by the life-insurance companies . Accordingly , its progress was watched with great and growing interest , and it came to pass that before it reached the Court of Appeals a dozen or more of the ablest lawyers in the State ranged themselves on the side of the McPherson heirs . The fees , of these lawyers , if charged at the usual rates , would have swallowed up the . estate in controversy several times esrer , and the natural inference was tharthe life-insurance companies were fighting the battle of the McPherson heirs . The case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , without a dissenting voice . The court held that the provision in the Constitution which retime of the adoption of the Constitution ( 1846 ) , i. e. , the general property tax , but did not apply to the special taxes subsequently devised and enacted . It was absurd to suppose that the State could not reach new sources of revenue without specifying in each instance how it should be apportioned among the several objects of public expenditure . Thia case is known as " the matter of McPherson " ( 104 N. Y. 306 ) . When the decision was announced , it was generally assumed that the delinquent companies would pay the back taxes due to the State , but no such thing happened . A bill was forthwith introduced in the Legislature , then Republican in both branches , not only to release them from the arrears , but to repeal the law of 1880 altogether , and this movement gained such headway that the State Comptroller ( Hon. Alfred C. Chapin ) , in order to save this source of revenue for the future , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeping the law of 1880 in force Charges of bribery and corruption began to reach the newspapers from their Albany correspondents , and these rumors worried the supporters of the bill not a little , but did not stop , the measure . Comptroller Chapin 's bill was voted down and the repealing bill was passed by both branches . It is chapter 699 of the Laws of 1887 . Undoubtedly some votes were cast for it honestly ; some men voted for it then who would not do so in the light of s'ecent revelations . Senator Fassett , for example , supported it on the ground that the money released by the State would , in the case of the three leading companies ( the Equitable , the Mutual , and the New York Life ) , enure to the benefit of the policyholders , who ought not to be taxed . The possibility that the State might lose the money , and the policyholders lose it also , had not present-led itself to the Senatorial mind . Moreover , the superstition that policyholders ought not to bear any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was in 1880 , or than it is now Making all possible allowance , however , for the simplicity of legislators who voted to these rich companies a million dollars actually due to the State Treasury , and many other millions to become due , there can be no doubt that this bill lwas " handled " by such characters as " Judge " Hamilton and " Al " Fields , backed by the use of money . The bill passed the Senate on the 19th Of May , and went immediately to Governor Hill , who took a long time to consider it . Not until the 25th of June did he make up his mind what to do . Meanwhile , the Legislature had adjourned . If he should simply withhold his signature , the bill would be dead , and of mind as the Mercantile Trust Company was last year , with the Ambler bill hanging as a sword of Damocles over its head . But the Governor made up his mind at last that it was a good bill and ought to pass . So he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while he was a Senator of the United States , Mr. Hill received from the Equitable Life an offer of a retainer , which he accepted with thanks , saying that it came very " handy " at that time . FOOTBALL REFORM BY ABOLITION . Never before has a football season ended amid such a well-nigh universal chorus of denunciation of the game , or with such a record of fatalities . At last our college presidents have found their voices ; some of them at least have got beyond the fear of losing students by attacking what has become an intolerable evil , and are ready to follow President Eliot 's lead in demanding a change . Thus , President Wheeler of the University of California declares that the game " must be made over or go " ; President Hopkins of Williams feels that the game is doomed unless it can be radically altered ; President Schurman thinks it time for the college presidents to act ; and Chancellor MacCracken has asked President Eliot to call a conference of the heads of our educational institutions . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mathews , dean of the Divinity School of Chicago University , who thus states the truth : " Football to-day is-a social obsession  --  a education-prostituting , gladiatorial sport . It teaches virility and courage , but so does war I do not know what should take Its place , but the new game should not require the services of a physician , ' the maintenance of a hospital , and the celebration of funerals . " There is danger , however , that , in the multiplicity of denunciation and of plans for reform , the true nature of the evil may be lost sight of . For instance , the proposed changes in the eligibility rules , to guard against professionalism , suggested by the repentant sinners of the University of Pennsylvania , are likely only to distract attention from the main issue , even if their inspiration is from within the White House . The ' question of injuries and deaths , too , serious as it is , has become now of smaller importance  --  merely incidental . It is , of course , most gratifying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ R. Oastler , in charge of the Columbia squad . Most surgeons , of athletic teams have been content to drug and stimulate the players , to patch them up so that they may enter the fray again , even at the risk of their lives . This physician has had enough of silence , and demands the abolition of the game . " I have been , " he says , " surgeon of the Columbia team for six years , and I think it is the most brutal exhibition I have ever seen or heard of to call a sport . The players go on the field expecting to be hurt , and are glad if they come off with nothing worse than a broken bone . " The real question before the public to-day is whether it is worth while to attempt to modify the game , or whether it should not be abolished forthwith . For twenty years modern football has been on trial in one form or another , and it has gone steadily from bad to worse . It has been shown beyond dispute in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McClure 's Magazine , Collier 's Weekly , Public Opinion , and in newspapers all over the country , that the following evils have come in the train of football : ( 1 ) the introduction of paid athletes and bogus students , such as teamsters and ex-prizefighters ; ( 2 ) the demoralization of the secondary schools by the recruiting sergeants of the universities ; ( 3 ) the use of unfair and immoral methods to win games ; ( 4 ) the steady ' increase in the-gambling and betting features of intercollegiate contests ; ( 5 ) the ever-growing danger of injuries from mass plays ; ( 6 ) the demoralization of the student body by false standards of what is honorable-and dishonorable in athletics , and the utterly disproportionate emphasis placed upon athletics as opposed to mental training . This indictment itself would seem to be enough to make the end of the game inevitable . But there are still other facts to be recorded College presidents and faculties have everywhere been terrorized by student opinion . " The boys have wanted the game , " and desired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have abdicated their proper functions , always trembling lest a radical stand decrease the enrolment and drive students to a rival institution where teams , mayhap , have won three or four years out of five . Even at Harvard there are timid souls who ask whether this year 's decreased attendance is not perhaps due to President Eliot 's hostility to football . At any rate , the loss of students seems to them to make this time " inopportune " for the greatest American university to win fresh prestige by uprooting this athletic evil Professor Mathews is right . Football has become a " social obsession , " from which education has suffered terribly . We hear of instance after instance in which preparatory-school pupils are forced to play by their teachers , often against their own and their parents ' wishes , and under penalty of ostracism . In Harvard it is notorious that football has now become the best and easiest way to enter the undergraduate societies . Your " grind " may rank as high as he pleases in his studies ; it is the fellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plaudits and the admiration of his mates , and before whom the doors of the chapter houses swing open as if by magic . To say that this obsession can be cured by ignoring the fatuous rules committee , and deciding whether there shall or shall not be " offside interference or mass plays , " is like turning a hose on the roof of a building when the first floor is in flames Football has become not merely intolerable in itself , but a grave menace to American scholastic ideals and development . As such it should go forthwith There is no time like the present in which to right this wrong . A few schools and small colleges have abolished football , but its death-blow must come from such an institution as Harvard or Columbia . There should be no lack of rivalry for the honor , and no time wasted in considering how the game can be " radically altered " or " made over . " " FUNDAMENTALS " ' IN COLLEGE . The Harvard Overseers ' Committee on Reports and Resolutions , Charles Francis Adams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set college men to thinking . The committee asks whether , " under conditions exacting some measure of retrenchment , " it le better " to impair the efficiency of the fundamental courses of instruction , pursued by large numbers of students , or to effect the necessary economies by reducing the number of special courses . " The committee had before it the needs of the English department According to a report made to the Overseers by the Committee on English Literature , the allowance for this department was cut $9,800 in 1904-05 . " The practical result of this economy , " says the committee , " has been the reduction in the number of courses provided , and a curtailment in the force of assistants requisite for proper supervision of the men in the large courses " The Committee on English supports its case by particulars , and concludes that " the department is at present undermanned , to the detriment of the students in the large courses and of the progress of the Graduate School . " Mr. Adams 's committee , accepting the statements in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to the educational policy involved . The English courses are " elementary and fundamental , " " attended by no less than 2,131 students , " while there are many special courses attended 1:e but few students or even by single students . " Referring to the experience and policy of Yale , under similar circumstances , it has been stated that , of a total number of 181 courses , it was there found that 70 were taken by fewer than ten students each , 30 by fewer than five , 8 by fewer than three , and 11 by a single student each only . Tinder these circumstances , the total number of courses in the Yale programme was , as a measure of necessary retrenchment , reduced from 263 to 249 , and of the 249 remaining courses it was stated that between 50 and 60 would be cut out unless a sufficient number of students elected them to make it worth while giving them ' Other colleges , we may add , have , in periods of stress , been forced to make cuts quite as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer the question which it brings forward . Were a college a factory , Mr. Adams could not hesitate to reply in seven Words , " Cut along the line of least resIstance . " But a college , though its buginess needs the most skilful management , is not a commercial enterprise . For example , the heed of a factory or a store must think twice before incurring a deficit ; the ' president of a college must think twice before not incurring one for the administration Which always keeps within Its income will stand still . President Eliot 's delrborate plan , if we may judge by appearances , has been to press steadily a little beyond immediate income Thus he leas been able to show condlueively that more money can be profitably spent by Harvard , and make an irresistible plea for it . Had he always crept along cautiously , never taking chances , Harvard would now be where it was two decades ago . Occesionally his advance has been slightly retarded by successive deficits , but in general he has led the way , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to similar principle must lie applied to the solution of the problem which Mr. Adams outlines . If a college can not afford terrapin  --  to barrow the happy phrase of an insurance officer  --  must it forthwith restrict its diet to tripe ? No college can permanently cripple the large " stock " courses . In the long run , these must be creditably maintained whatever else is lopped off . But that is not to say that temporary crippling is not now and then justifiable . One of Harvard 's sources of strength , for example , is the group of advanced courses , attended by but few students , which perhaps no other institution is prepared to offer . These can not be supported indefinitely at the expense of the large courses ; but for terms of two or three years Harvard might suffer less in pres'tige and that leadership , Wittich is its glory , might contribute more to the cause of education , by carrying on certain special courses for the few till money is found to Man them . There can be no hard-and-fast rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courses to be sacrificed for the moment , and of the small ones to be saved , and must settle the individual ease on its merits . The effect on the teaching force must also be taken into account . The instructor 's mend becomes deadened by repetition year after year of the elementary and fundamental courses . He must have an opportunity for expansion and refreshment in the small ' advanced courses , devoted peehaps to research . One reason why teachers in secondary schools tend to mental atrophy is that they are steadily held down to tripe , with seldom even a sniff of terrapin . Thee view is forcibly presented by President J. G. Sdhurnean of Cornell in his last annual report just from the press . " No man , " he says , " can do valuable original reflection if he is always wearied With lectures and teaching . " President Sdhurman would therefore make provision " for reducing the time demanded for the instruction of students from professors who era exceptionally qualified for and devoted to the work of original investigation . " This ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authority than Lord Kellen. ' declared to be the most imperative called for in our American university system . Thus , in economizing there must be considered the possibility of impairing the efficiency nut merely of the fundamental courses , but of the teachers themselves . In short , the ' abilities and the temperament of individual instructors must be seriously regarded in formulating the scheme of retrenchment . JAMES DAVIE BUTLER . There passed away in Madison , Wisconsin , on November 20 , the " first citizen " of that university town , known and beloved of all , and whose home was thronged on every succeeding birthday ; who attained his ninetieth year on the 15th of last March , and , being chaplain of the Senate , was honored by that body with roses and the spreading ' of his response upon the minutes Dr. Butler was then entering on the twenty-fourth year of his connection , as a literary contributor , with the Nation .

He made some noticeable , published researches into portraits of Columbus , - he published ' Hapax Legomena , or Words used once for all by Shakspere ' , he discussed the census , the rainfall in Wisconsin , Washington 's tutor , Raphael 's Houis , reindeer in Alaska All that pertained to the Northwest and its early settlement interested him , and he flung himself with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lateDr Elliott - Couea .
