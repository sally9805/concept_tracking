 |p1364  NOT one of the men who have given distinction to THE INDEPENDENT has done so much for it as the young man who founded it in 1848 and who left it only with his death in 1896 . He came , while a boy , to New York from the farm , which had descended to his father from the first settlers of Woodstock , Conn . He was ambitious , alert to an extraordinary degree , and had the genius which is indicated by initiative and courage . He was taken into the employ of the dry goods firm of the famous Tappan brothers , Arthur and Lewis , and he subsequently married the daughter of Lewis Tappan , the distinguished Abolitionist . He connected himself with Dr. Cox 's Presbyterian Church , and was soon active in its religious work . It was not long before he was conducting a neighborhood prayer meeting , but he was rebuked for it and told that he had no right to do it , as he had not been ordained an elder or evangelist . Just as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hiram Bingham , one of the first missionaries to the Sandwich Islands , had returned to this country and visited New York . To him Mr. Bowen told his trouble , when the missionary put his hand on the youth 's head , saying : " I ordain you , young man , to do all the good you can , wherever in the province of God you may be called to labor . Amen . " " That , " he continued , " is as good an ordination as any one can give . " Two of the Tappan Brothers ' clerks soon withdrew to found a wholesale dry goods house under the name of Bowen &; McNamee , which continued in prosperous business till the crash of 1857 , when it succumbed . He afterward founded the silk house of Bowen , Holmes &; Co. , which failed in the loss of payments from Southern customers in the Civil War . Mr. Bowen was one of the founders of Dr. Storrs 's Church of the Pilgrims , the first Congregational Church of Brooklyn , and afterward he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Beecher from 1364 Indiana to Brooklyn . He was the munificent helper in founding a multitude of churches in his own city and thruout the Western country , and it was his insistence which developed the Congregational Union , a social organization , into the first church building society in the country . His passion for progress and reform made him one of the early adherents of the unpopular anti-slavery reform , and when in 1848 Drs . Bacon , Thompson and Storrs were willing to edit an organ of political reform and of theological and ecclesiastical liberty , Mr. Bowen was ready to find four young men who , with himself , should back the enterprise with their money . It is told elsewhere how he became sole owner of a financially valueless , and , indeed , expensive journal . To its business management he had given very little attention , altho he had given it standing in the commercial world by collecting and publishing a weekly list of business failures , which he kept up until obliged to include his own in the list . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Civil War , I think , that he told me his liabilities were $1,800,000 and the credits due him $3,000,000 , but collections from the South were impossible . Many years later he settled all his outlawed debts , and his creditors , in recognition of his honesty , gave him a handsome silver service . It was after this second failure in business that he determined to put all his business energy on the development of THE INDEPENDENT . The conditions , unfavorable for reopening the silk business , were favorable for such a journal as this , a journal in the very flush of its victory against slavery , and representing also the progressive enthusiasms of the Church . And it had no competitor , for it had been the one earnest anti-slavery , undenominational Christian paper . Mr. Bowen pushed the premium system beyond anything previously known , offering large prizes for large lists of new subscribers , and this he kept up for many years , while he was no less ambitious to secure ,  |p1366  at any price , the most distinguished contributors . Longfellow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of poets only , were of those who answered his call , and Presidents and Senators came a little later , after the War was over , to be his guests on the Fourth of July at Woodstock , and their addresses filled double numbers of THE INDEPENDENT . In those days the woods were not full of competing magazines . Thus THE INDEPENDENT had the field to itself , and had an enormous circulation . Those of the present generation can not conceive the shock given to the country when Mr. Tilton presented charges against Mr. Beecher . Beecher was the nation 's idol , the most distinguished preacher in the world , the very genius of American sentiments . The long and terrible ecclesiastical and legal conflict split churches and families and absorbed the attention of the country . Into that conflict Mr. Bowen was brought against his will . Altho now no partisan of Mr. Tilton , who was no longer editing either THE INDEPENDENT or the Brooklyn Union , and whose financial claims on his dismissal had been handsomely settled , Mr. Bowen could not and did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his were reported he was charged with slander and excommunicated from Plymouth Church . He immediately was received into membership of the church in Woodstock , where he was born and had long had his summer home , and he became a regular attendant of Dr. Storrs 's church in Brooklyn . For many months the exposures and trials continued , and THE INDEPENDENT , which did not support Mr. Beecher , and which defended Mr. Bowen , lost many friends . This sad scandal , with the consequent estrangement of Mr. Bowen from Mr. Beecher and Plymouth Church , had the effect upon Mr. Bowen , not of making him cool on questions of freedom and social reform , but of withdrawing him from sympathy with such theological liberty as Mr. Beecher had represented . He was now an old man , and when the new theological questions came up represented by Andover and the American Board , he was positively and strongly with the conservatives , with Secretary Alden , of the Board , with Joseph Cook and Professor Park , whose own old age was defending the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lasted , and Mr. Bowen cared more for his view of truth than for the interests of THE INDEPENDENT , and many who had been its progressive friends left it and went elsewhere . He died in 1896 , eighty-three years old , surrounded by his large family of children , highly honored in the community , and leaving behind him a great record of distinguished service for the Church and for the nation . Of his sons , one is now proprietor of THE INDEPENDENT , and another has done good work in the diplomatic service of the country ; while one of his daughters is married to a United States District Judge , another to a distinguished diplomatist and author , and a third to a scholar formerly in charge of the American Archeological School in Athens .
