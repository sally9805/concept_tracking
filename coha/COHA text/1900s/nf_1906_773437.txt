txt // II . REIGN OF CONSTANTINE THE GREAT ( A.D. 306 ? 337 ) 423 . The Battle of the Milvian Bridge ( A.v. 312 ) ; " In this Sign conquer . " ? Galerius and Constantius , who became Augusti on the abdication of Diocletian and Maximian , had reigned together only one year when the latter died at York , in Britain . His soldiers , disregarding the rule of succession as determined by the system of Diocletian , proclaimed his son Constantine Emperor Six competitors for the throne arose in different quarters . For - eighteen years Constantine fought before he gained the supremacy . One of the most important of the battles that took place between the contending rivals for the imperial purple was the battle of the Milvian Bridge , about two miles from Rome . Constantine 's standard on this celebrated battlefield was the Christian cross . He had been led to adopt this emblem through the appearance , as once he prayedto the sun-god , of a cross over the setting sun , with this inscription above it : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the celestial vision , Constantine had at once made the cross his banner , ' and it was beneath this new emblem that his soldiers marched to victory at the battle of the Milvian Bridge . This act of Constantine constitutes a turning point in the history of the Roman Empire , and especially in that of the Christian Church . Christianity had come into the world as a religion of peace and good will . The Master had commanded his disciples to put up the sword , and had forbidden its use by them either in the spread or in the defense of the new faith . For three centuries now his followers had obeyed literally this injunction of the Founder of the Church , so that a Quaker , non-military spirit had up to this time characterized the new sect . By many of the early Christians the profession of arms had been declared to be incompatible with the Christian life . // Now in a moment all this was changed . The most sacred emblem of the new faith was made a battle standard , and into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government that had made that emblem the ensign of the state . From the day of the battle at the Milvian Bridge a martial spirit has animated the religion of the Prince of Peace . Since then Christian warriors have often made the cross their battle standard . This infusion into the Church of the military spirit of Rome was one of the most important consequences of the espousal of the Christian cause by the Emperor Constantine . 424 . Constantine makes Christianity the Religion of the Court .  - -  By a decree issued at Milan A.D. 313 , the year after the battle at the Milvian Bridge , Constantine placed Christianity on an equal footing with the other religions of the Empire . The language of this famous edict of toleration , the MagnaCarta , as it has been called , of the Church , was as follows : " We grant to Christians and to all others full liberty of following that religion which each may choose . " // But by subsequent edicts Constantine made Christianity in effect the state religion and extended to it a patronage which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A.D. 321 he had granted the Christian societies the right to receive gifts and legacies , and he himself enriched the Church with donations of money and grants of land . This marks the beginning of the great possessions of the Church , and with these the entrance into it of a worldly spirit . From this moment can be traced the decay of its primitive simplicity and a decline from its early high moral standard . It is these deplorable results of the imperial patronage that Dante laments in his well-known lines : Ah , Constantine ! of how much ill was mother , Not thy conversion , but that marriage dower Which the first wealthy Father took from thee ! 4 Another of Constantine 's acts touching the new religion is of special historical interest and importance . He recognized the Christian Sunday , " the day of the sun , " as a day of rest , forbidding ordinary work on that day , and ordering that Christian soldiers be then permitted to attend the services of their Church . This recognition by the civil authority of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the first time in the history of the Aryan peoples , the slave had one day of rest in each week . It was a good augury of the happier time coming when all The days should be his own . 425 . The Church Council of Nica ( A.D. 325 ) . ? With a view to settling the controversy between the Arians and the Athanasians 5 respecting the nature of Christ , the former denied his equality with God the Father , ? Constantine called the first ( Ecumenical or General Council of the Church at Nicma , a town of Asia Minor , A.D. 325 . Arianism was denounced , and a formula of Christian faith adopted , which is known as the Nicene Creed . // 426 . Constantine founds Constantinople , the New Rome , on the Bosporus ( A.D. 330 ) . After the recognition of Christianity , the most important act of Constantine was the selection of Byzantium , on the Bosporus , as the new capital of the Empire . One reason which led the Emperor to select a new seat for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the inhabitants of Rome , because he had abandoned the worship of the old national deities . But there were also military reasons , the most dangerous enemies of the Empire being now in the East , and also social and political reasons , since through the Eastern conquests of Rome the center of population , wealth , and culture of the Empire had shifted eastward . The imperial invitation and the attractions of the court induced multitudes to crowd into the new capital , so that almost in a day the old Byzantium grew into a great city . In honor of the Emperor the name was changed to Constantinople , the " City of Constantine . " The old Rome on the Tiber , emptied of its leading inhabitants , soon sank to the obscure position of a provincial town . 427 . The Reorganization of the Government . ? Another of Constantine 's important acts was the reorganization of the government . In this great reform he seems to have followed , in the main , the broad lines drawn ' by Diocletian , so that his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his predecessor . To aid in the administration of the government , Constantine laid out the Empire into four great divisions called prefectures , which were subdivided into thirteen dioceses , and these again - into one hundred and sixteen provinces . The purpose that Constantine had in view in laying out the Empire in so many and such small provinces was to diminish the power of the provincial governors , and thus make it impossible for them to raise successfully the standard of revolt . 428 . The Pagan Restoration under Julian the Apostate ( A.D. 361-363 ) . ? A troubled period of nearly a quarter of a century followed the death of Constantine the Great , and then the imperial scepter came into the hands of Julian , called the Apostate because he abandoned Christianity and labored to restore the // pagan worship . In his efforts to restore paganism , however , Julian did not resort to the old means of persuasion ,  --  " the sword , the fire , the lions . " One reason why he did not was because under the softening influences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roman world had already become imbued with a gentleness and humanity that rendered morally impossible the renewal of the Neronian and Diocletian persecutions . Julian 's chief weapon was the pen , for he was a writer and satirist of no mean talent . It was in vain that the apostate Emperor labored to uproot the new faith ; for the purity of its teachings , the universal and eternal character of its moral precepts , had given it a name to live . Equally in vain were his efforts to restore the worship of the old Greek and Roman divinities . Polytheism was a form of religious belief which the world had now outgrown ; Great Pan was dead . The disabilities under which Julian had placed the Christians were removed by his successor Jovian ( A.D. 363-364 ) . In the army the old pagan standards were replaced by the Labarum , and Christianity was again made the religion of the imperial court . Selections from the Sources . ?

The two most vital elements in the Grxco-Roman world of the fifth century were the German barbarians and Christianity . They had , centuries before this , as we have seen , come into certain relations to the Roman government and to Roman life ; but during the period lying immediately before us they assumed an altogether new historical interest and importance . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention during the century yet remaining for our study , will be ( r ) the struggle between the dying Empire and the young German races of the North ; and ( 2 ) the final triumph of Christianity , through the aid of the temporal power , over expiring paganism . 430 . The Goths cross the Danube ( A.D. 376 ) . ? The year 376 of the Christian era marks an event of the greatest importance in the East . The Visigoths ( Western Goths ) dwelling north of the Lower Danube appeared as suppliants in vast multitudes upon its banks . They said that a terrible race , whom they were powerless to withstand , had invaded their territories and spared neither their homes nor their lives . They begged permission of the Emperor Valens i to cross the river and settle in Thrace , and promised , should this request be granted , ever to remain the grateful and firm allies of the Roman state . Their petition was granted on condition that they surrender their arms and give up their children as hostages . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a monstrous race of fierce nomadic horsemen from the vast steppes . 305 // of Asia . Scarcely had the fugitives been received within the limits of the Empire before a large company of their kinsmen , the Ostrogoths ( Eastern Goths ) , also driven from their homes by the same terrible enemy , crowded to the banks of the Danube and pleaded that they also might be allowed to place the river between themselves and their dreaded foe . But Valens , becoming alarmed at the presence of so many barbarians within his dominions , refused their request , whereupon they crossed the river with arms in their hands . Once within the Empire they , joined by their Visigothic kinsmen , soon began to overrun and ravage the Danubian provinces . Valens dispatched swift messengers to Gratian , Emperor in the West , asking for assistance ; but without awaiting the arrival of the Western legions , he imprudently risked a battle with the barbarians near Adrianople . The Roman army was almost annihilated and Valens himself was killed ( A.D. 378 ) . Gratian was hurrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his death was brought to him . He at once appointed as his associate Theodosius ( A.D. 379 ? 395 ) , known afterwards as the Great , and intrusted him with the government of the East . Theodosius quickly reduced the Goths to submission . Great multitudes of them were settled upon the waste lands of Thrace , while more than forty thousand of these warlike barbarians , the destined subverters of the Empire , were enlisted in the imperial legions . 431 . The Prohibition of the Pagan Cults . ? Both Gratian and Theodosius were zealous champions of the orthodox Church , and a large portion of the edicts issued during their joint reign had for aim the uprooting of heresy or the suppression of the pagan worship . Speaking generally , from the accession of Constantine down to the time which we have now reached , the pagans had been allowed full liberty of worship . At first the pagans were merely placed under certain disabilities , but finally it was made a crime for any one to practice any pagan cult , or even to enter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private worship of the Lares and Penates was prohibited . The struggle between Christianity and heathenism was now virtually ended ? and the // " Galilean " had conquered . Pagan rites , however , were practiced secretly long after this . Especially did the old home cult of the Lares and Penates linger on in the country districts , from which circumstance the term pagan ( from paganus , the dweller in a pages , or village ) came to indicate a follower of the ancient idolatry. 432 . Final Division of the Empire ( A.u. 395 ) . ? The Roman world was united practically for the last time under Theodosius the Great . From A.D. 392 to 395 he ruled as sole Emperor . Just before his death he divided the Empire between his two sons , Arcadius and Honorius , assigning the former , who was only eighteen years of age , the government of the East , and giving the latter , a mere child of eleven , the sovereignty of the West . This division was not to affect the unity of the Empire . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were to be two emperors . But as a matter of fact so different was the course of events in the two halves of the old Empire that from this on we shall find it convenient to trace the history of each division separately . 433 . The Empire in the East . ? The story of the fortunes of the Empire in the East need not detain us long here . The line of Eastern emperors lasted over a thousand years , ? until the capture of Constantinople by the Turks , A.D. 1453 . It will thus be seen that the greater part of its history belongs to the mediieval period . Up to the time of the overthrow of the Empire in the West the emperors of the East were engaged almost incessantly in suppressing uprisings of their Gothic allies or mercenaries , or in repelling invasions of different barbarian tribes . 434 . First Invasion of Italy by Alaric ( A.D. 4o2 ? 4o3 ) . ? Only a few years had elapsed after the death of the great Theodosius before the barbarians were tr000ing in vast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Thrace and Mania came the Visigoths , led by the great Alaric . They poured through the Pass of Thermopyke and devastated almost the entire peninsula of Greece ; but being driven from that country by Stilicho , the renowned Vandal general of Honorius , they crossed the Julian // Alps and spread terror throughout Italy . Stilicho followed the barbarians cautiously , and , attacking them at a favorable moment , inflicted a terrible and double defeat upon them at Pollentia and Verona ( A.D. 402 ? 403 ) . The captured camp was found filled with the spoils of Thebes , Corinth , and Sparta . Gathering the remnants of his shattered army , Alaric forced his way with difficulty through the defiles of the Alps and escaped . 435 . Last Triumph at Rome ( A.D. 404 ) . A terrible danger had been averted . All Italy burst forth in expressions of gratitude and joy . The days of the Cimbri and Teutons were recalled , and the name of Stilicho was coupled with that of Marius ( sec. 366 ) . A magnificent triumph at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Rome ever saw . Three hundred times ? such is asserted to be the number  --  the imperial City had witnessed the triumphal procession of her victorious generals , celebrating conquests in all quarters of the world . 436 . Last Gladiatorial Combat of the Amphitheater.  --  The same year that marks the last military triumph at Rome signalizes also the last gladiatorial combat in the Roman amphitheater . It is to Christianity that the credit of the suppression of these inhuman exhibitions is entirely , or almost entirely , due . The pagan philosophers usually regarded them with indifference , often with favor . Thus Pliny commends a friend for giving a gladiatorial entertainment at the funeral of his wife . They were defended on the ground that they fostered a martial spirit among the people and inured the soldiers to the sights of the battlefield . Hence gladiatorial games were sometimes actually exhibited to the legions before they set out on their campaigns . But the Christian Fathers denounced the combats as immoral , and labored in every possible way to create a public opinion against them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edict against them was issued by Constantine . From this time forward the exhibitions were under something of a ban , until their final abolition was brought about by an incident of the games that closed the triumph of Honorius . In the midst of the exhibition a Christian monk , named Telemachus , descending into the arena , rushed // between the combatants , but was instantly killed by a shower of missiles thrown by the people , who were angered by his interruption of their sport . The people , however , soon repented of their act ; and Honorius himself , who was present , was moved by the scene . Christianity had awakened the conscience and touched the heart of Rome . The martyrdom of the monk led to an imperial edict " which abolished forever the human sacrifices of the amphitheater. " 437 . The Ransom of Rome ( A.n . 409 ) . ? Shortly after the victory of Stilicho over the German barbarians , he came under the suspicion of the weak and jealous Honorius , and was executed . Thus fell the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the barbarians , ' and who might again have averted similar dangers that were now at hand . Listening to the rash counsel of his unworthy advisers , Honorius provoked to revolt the thirty thousand Gothic mercenaries in the Roman legions by a massacre of their wives and children , who were held as hostages in the different cities of Italy . The Goths beyond the Alps joined with their kinsmen to avenge the perfidious act . Alaric again crossed the mountains , and led his hosts to the very gates of Rome . Not since the time of the dread Hannibal ( sec. 344 ) more than six hundred years before this ? . had Rome been insulted by the presence of a foreign foe beneath her walls . Famine soon forced the Romans to sue for terms of surrender . The ambassadors of the Senate , when they came before Alaric , began , in lofty language , to warn him not to render the Romans desperate by hard or dishonorable terms : their fury when driven to despair , they represented , was terrible , and their number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mow it , " was Marie 's derisive reply . The barbarian chieftain at length named the ransom that he would accept and spare the city . Small as it comparatively was , the Romans were able to raise it only by the // most extraordinary measures . The images of the gods were first stripped of their ornaments of gold and precious stones , and finally the statues themselves were melted down . 438 . Sack of Rome by Alaric ( A.D. 410 ) . Upon retiring from Rome , Alaric established his camp in Etruria . The chieftain now demanded for his followers lands of Honorius , who , with his court , was safe behind the marshes of Ravenna ; but the Emperor treated all the proposals of the barbarian with foolish insolence . Rome paid the penalty . Alaric turned upon the city , resolved upon its sack and plunder . The barbarians broke into the capital by night , " and the inhabitants were awakened by the tremendous sound of the Gothic trumpet . " Precisely eight hundred years had passed since its sack by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Imperial City had carried its victorious standards over three continents , and had gathered within the temples of its gods and the palaces of its nobles the plunder of the world . Now it was given over for a spoil to the fierce tribes from beyond the Danube . Alaric commanded his soldiers to respect the lives of the people , and to leave untouched the treasures of the Christian churches ; but the wealth of the citizens he permitted them to make their own . For six days and nights the rough barbarians trooped through the streets of the city on their mission of pillage . Their wagons were heaped with the costly furniture , the rich plate , and the silken garments stripped from the palace of the Caesars and the residences of the wealthy patricians . Amidst the license of the sack , the barbarian instincts of the robbers broke loose from all restraint , and the streets of the city were wet with blood , while the nights were lighted by burning buildings . 439 . Effects of the Disaster upon Paganism . ? The overwhelming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impression upon both pagans and Christians throughout the Roman world . The pagans asserted that these unutterable calamities had overtaken the Roman people because of their abandonment of the worship of the gods of their forefathers , under whose protection and favor Rome had become the mistress of the world . THE DEATH OF ALARIC 31I The Christians , on the other hand , saw vl the fall of the city the fulfillment of the prophecies of their Scriptures against the Babylon of the Apocalypse . It was this interpretation of the appalling calamity that gained credit amidst the panic and despair of the times . " Henceforth , " says the historian Merivale , " the power of paganism was entirely broken , and the indications which occasionally meet us of its continued existence are rare and trifling . Christianity stepped into its deserted inheritance . " 440 . The Death of Alaric ( A.D. 410 ) . After withdrawing his warriors from Rome , Alaric led them southward . As they moved slowly on , they piled still higher the wagons of their long trains with the rich spoils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Southern Italy . In the villas of the Roman nobles the barbarians spread rare banquets from the stores of their well-filled cellars , and drank from jeweled cups the famed Falernian wine . Alaric 's designs of conquest in Africa were frustrated by his death , which occurred A.D. 410 . With religious care his followers secured the body of their hero against molestation . The little river Busentinus , in Northern Bruttium , was turned from its course with great labor , and in the bed of the stream was constructed a tomb , in which was placed the body of the king , with his jewels and trophies . The river was then restored to its old channel , and , that the exact spot might never be known , the prisoners who had been forced to do the work were all put to death . 441 . The Disintegration of the Empire and the Beginnings of the Barbarian Kingdoms ( A.D. 410-451 ) .3- We must now turn our eyes from Rome and Italy in order to watch the movement of events in the western provinces of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Rome by Alaric , the German tribes seized the greater part of these provinces and established in them what are known as the " Barbarian Kingdoms . " The Goths who had pillaged Rome and Italy , after the death of their great chieftain Alaric , under the lead of his successors , // recrossed the Alps , and establishing their camps in the south of Gaul and the north of Spain , set up finally in those regions what is known as the Kingdom of the Visigoths or West Goths ( sec. 475 ) . While the Goths were making these migrations and settlements , a kindred but less civilized tribe , the Vandals , moving from their seat in Pannonia , traversed Gaul , crossed the Pyrenees into Spain , and there occupied for a time a large tract of country , which in its present name of Andalusia preserves the memory of its barbarian settlers . Then they crossed the straits of Gibraltar , overthrew the Roman authority in all North Africa , and made Carthage the seat of a dreaded corsair empire ( sec. 477 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Southeastern Gaul . A portion of the region occupied by these settlers still retains from them the name of Buis undo . Meanwhile the Franks , who about a century before the sack of Rome by Alaric had made their first settlement in Roman territory west of the Rhine , were increasing in numbers and in authority , and were laying the basis of what after the fall of Rome was to become known as the Kingdom of the Franks , ? the beginning of the French nation of to-day ( sec. 478 ) . 442 . Invasion of the Huns ; Battle of Chalons ( A.D. 45 1 ) . ? The barbarians who were thus overrunning and parceling out the inheritance of the dying Empire were now in turn pressed upon and terrified by a foe more hideous and dreadful in their eyes than they themselves were in the eyes of the Roman provincials . These were the non-Aryan Buns , of whom we have already caught a glimpse as they drove the panic-stricken Goths across the Danube ( sec. 430 ) . At this time their leader was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Scourge of God . " It was Attila 's boast that the grass never grew again where once the hoof of his horse had trod . Attila defeated the armies of the Eastern Emperor and exacted tribute from the court of Constantinople . Finally he turned westward , and , at the head of a host numbering , it is asserted , seven hundred thousand warriors , crossed the Rhine into Gaul , purposing first to ravage that province and then to traverse Italy // with fire and sword , in order to destroy the last vestige of the Roman power . The Romans and their German conquerors united to make common cause against the common enemy . The Visigoths rallied about their king , Theodoric ; the Italians , the Franks , the Burgundians flocked to the standard of the Roman general Aetius.4 Attila drew up his mighty hosts upon the plain of Chalons , in the north of Gaul , and there awaited the onset of the Romans and their allies . The conflict was long and terrible , but at last fortune turned against the barbarians , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the field and retreated with his shattered hosts across the Rhine . This great victory is placed among the significant events of history ; for it decided that the Christian German folk , and not the pagan Scythic Huns , should inherit the dominions of the expiring Roman Empire and control the destinies of Europe . 443 . Attila threatens Rome ; his Death ( A.D. 453 ? ) . ? The year after his defeat at Chalons , Attila crossed the Alps and burned or plundered all the important cities of Northern Italy . The Veneti fled for safety to the morasses at the head of the Adriatic ( A.D. 452 ) . Upon the islets where they built their rude dwellings there grew up in time the city of Venice , " the eldest daughter of the Roman Empire , " the " Carthage of the Middle Ages . " The barbarians threatened Rome ; but Leo the Great , bishop of the capital , went with an embassy to the camp of Attila and pleaded for the city . He recalled to the mind of Attila how death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Imperial City as a spoil to his warriors , and warned him not to call down upon himself the like judgment of Heaven . Attila was induced to spare the city and to lead his warriors back beyond the Alps . Shortly after he had crossed the Danube he died suddenly in his camp , and like Alaric was buried secretly . 444 . Sack of Rome by the Vandals ( A.D. 455 ) . Rome had been saved a visitation from the spoiler of the North , but a new // destruction was about to burst upon it by way of the sea from the South . Africa sent out another enemy whose greed for plunder proved more fatal to Rome than the eternal hate of Hannibal . The kings of the Vandal empire in North Africa had acquired as perfect a supremacy in the Western Mediterranean as Carthage ever enjoyed in the days of her commercial pride . Vandal corsairs swept the seas and harassed all the shore lands . In the year 455 a Vandal fleet led by the dread Geiseric sailed up the Tiber . Panic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with terror throughout the world . Again the great Leo , who had once before saved his flock from the fury of Attila , went forth to intercede in the name of Christ for the Imperial City . Geiseric granted to the pious bishop the lives of the citizens , but said that the movable property of the capital belonged to his warriors . For fourteen days and nights the city was given over to the barbarians . The ships of the Vandals , which almost hid with their number the waters of the Tiber , were piled , as had been the wagons of the Goths before them , with the rich and weighty spoils of the capital . Palaces were stripped of their furniture , and the walls of the temples denuded of the trophies of a hundred Roman victories . ' From the Capitoline sanctuary were borne off the golden candlestick and other sacred things that Titus had stolen from the temple at Jerusalem ( sec. 405 ) . The greed of the barbarians was sated at last , and they were ready to withdraw . The Vandal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the city , ' more than thirty thousand of the inhabitants as slaves . Carthage , through her own barbarian conquerors , was at last avenged upon her hated rival . The mournful presentiment of Scipio had fallen true ( sec. 359 ) . The cruel fate of Carthage might have been read again in the pillaged city that the Vandals left behind them . . // 445 End of the Roman Empire in the West ( an . 476 ) . Only the shadow of the Empire in the West now remained . The provinces of Gaul , Spain , and Africa were in the hands of the Franks , the Vandals , the Goths , and various other intruding tribes . Italy , as well as Rome herself , had become again and again the spoil of the barbarians . The story of the twenty years following the sack of the capital by Geiseric affords only a repetition of the events we have been narrating . During these years several puppet emperors were set up by army leaders . The last was a child of only six years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this boy-sovereign bore the name of Romulus Augustus , thus uniting in the name of the last Roman Emperor of the West the names of the founder of Rome and the establisher of the Empire . He became known as Augustulus , the little Augustus . " He reigned only one year , when Odoacer , the leader of the Heruli , a small but formidable German tribe , dethroned the child-emperor . The Roman Senate now sent to Constantinople an embassy with the royal vestments and the insignia of the imperial office to represent to the Eastern Emperor Zeno that the West was willing to give up its claims to an emperor of its own , and to request that the German chief , with the title of " patrician , " might rule Italy as his viceroy . This was granted ; and Italy now became in effect a province of the Empire in the East ( A.D. 476 ) . 446 . The Import of the Break-up of the Roman Empire in the West . The destruction of the Roman Empire in the West by the German barbarians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It marks a turning point in the fortunes of mankind . The revolution brought it about that for a long time the lamp of culture burned with lessened light . It brought in the so-called " Dark Ages . " During this period the new race was slowly , lifting itself to the level of culture that the Greeks and Romans had attained . But the revolution meant much besides disaster and loss . It meant the enrichment of civilization through the incoming of a new and splendidly endowed race . Within the Empire during // several centuries three of the most vital elements of civilization , the Greek , the Roman , and the Christian , had been gradually blending . Now was added a fourth factor , the Germanic . It is this element which has had very much to do in making modern civilization richer and more progressive than any preceding one . The downfall of the Roman imperial government in the West was , further , an event of immense significance in the political world for the reason that it rendered possible the growth in Western Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Empire . Another consequence of the fall of the Roman power in the West was the development of the Papacy . In the absence of an emperor in the West the popes rapidly gained influence and power , and soon built up an ecclesiastical empire that in some respects took the place of the old Empire and carried on its civilizing work . CHAPTER XXXV ARCHITECTURE , LITERATURE , LAW , AND SOCIAL LIFE AMONG THE ROMANS I. ARCHITECTURE 447 . Greek Origin of Roman Architecture : the Arch . ? The architecture of the Romans was , in the main , an imitation of Greek models . But the Romans were not mere servile imitators . They not only modified the architectural forms they borrowed , but they gave their structures a distinct character by the prominent use of the arch , which the Greek and Oriental builder ; seldom employed , though they were acquainted with its principle . By means of it the Roman builders vaulted the roofs of the largest buildings , carried stupendous aqueducts across the deepest valleys , and spanned the broadest streams with bridges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the present day . 448 . Sacred Edifices . ? The temples of the Romans were in general so like those of the Greeks that we need not here take space to enter into a particular description of them . Mention , however , should be made of their circular vaulted ternples , as this was a style of building almost exclusively Italian . The best representative of this style of sacred edifices is the Pantheon at Rome , which has come down to our own times in a state of wonderful preservation . This structure is about one hundred and forty feet in diameter . The immense concrete dome which vaults the building is one of the boldest pieces of masonry executed by the master builders of the world . 449 . Circuses , Theaters , and Amphitheaters . ? The circuses of the Romans were what we should call race courses . There were several at Rome , the most celebrated being the Circus Maximus , which was first laid out in the time of the Tarquins and afterwards enlarged as the population of the capital increased until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spectators 317 // The Romans borrowed the plan of their theaters from the Greeks ; their amphitheaters , however , were original with them . The Flavian amphitheater , known as the Colosseum , was five hundred and seventy-four feet in its greatest diameter , and was capable of seating over forty thousand spectators . ' The ruins of this immense structure stand to-day as " the embodiment of the power and splendor of the Roman Empire . " 450 . Aqueducts. ? The aqueducts of ancient Rome were among the most important of the utilitarian works of the Romans . The water system of the capital was commenced by Appius Claudius ( about 313 e.c . ) . During the Republic four aqueducts in all were completed ; under the emperors the number was increased to fourteen . ' The longest of these was about fifty-five miles in length . The aqueducts usually ran beneath the surface , but when a depression was to be crossed they were lifted on arches , which sometimes were over one hundred feet high . ' These lofty arches // running in long , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are to-day the most striking feature of the Campagna. 451 . Therma ; , or Baths . ? Among the ancient Romans bathing became in time a luxurious art . Under the Republic bathing houses were erected in considerable numbers . But it was during the imperial period that those magnificent structures to which the name Thersntz properly attaches , were erected . These edifice ; were among the most elaborate and expensive of the imperial works . They contained chambers for cold , hot , and swimming baths ; dressing rooms and gymnasia ; museums and libraries covered colonnades for lounging and conversation ; and every other adjunct that could add to the sense of luxury and relaxation.4 Being intended to exhibit the liberality of their builders , they were thrown open to the public free of charge . II . LITERATURE , PHILOSOPHY , AND LAW 452 . Relation of Roman to Greek Literature : the Poets of the Republican Era . ? Latin literature was almost wholly imitative or borrowed , being a reproduction of Greek models ; nevertheless it // performed a most important service for civilization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world of the rich literary treasures of Greece . It was the dramatic productions of the Greeks which were first studied and copied at Rome . Livius Andronicus , Nvius , Ennius , Plautus , and Terence , all of whom wrote under the Republic , are the most noted of the Roman dramatists . Most of their plays were simply adaptations or translations of Greek pieces . During the later republican era there appeared two poets of distinguished merit , Lucretius and Catullus . Lucretius ( 95 ? 51 B.C. ) was an evolutionist , and in his great poem On the Nature of Things we find anticipated many of the conclusions of modern scientists . 453 . Poets of the Augustan Age . ? Three poets contributed to cast an unfading luster over the period covered by the reign of Augustus , ? Vergil ( 70 ? 19 B.C. ) , Horace ( 65 ? 8 B.C. ) , and Ovid ( 43 B.C.-A.D. 18 ) . So distinguished have these writers rendered the age in which they lived , that any period in a people 's literature marked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allusion to this Roman era , an Augustan Age ( sec. 397 ) . 454 ? Satire and Satirists . ? Satire thrives best in the reeking soil and tainted atmosphere of an age of selfishness , immorality , and vice . Such an age was that which followed the Augustan at Rome . Hence arose a succession of writers whose mastery of sharp and stinging satire has caused their productions to become the models of all subsequent attempts in the same species of literature . Two names stand out in special prominence ,  - -  Persius ( A.D. 34 ? 62 ) and Juvenal ( about A.D. 40-120 ) . After the death of Juvenal the Roman world produced not a single poet of preeminent merit . 455 . Oratory among the Romans . ? " Public oratory , " as has been truly said , " is the child of political freedom , and can not exist without it . " We have seen this illustrated in the history of repub lican Athens ( sec. 260 ) . Equally well is the same truth exemplified by the records of the Roman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the Republic . Among these Hortensius ( 114 ? 50 B.c. ) , a learned jurist , and Marcus Tullius Cicero ( ro6 ? 43 B.c. ) stand preeminent . Of these two Cicero is easily first , ? " the most eloquent of all the sons of Romulus . " 456 . Latin Historians . ? Ancient Rome produced four writers of history whose works have won for them a permanent fame , Caesar , Sallust , Livy , and Tacitus . Of Caesar and his Commentaries on the Gallic Isar we have learned in a previous chapter . His Commentaries will always be cited along with the Anabasis of Xenophon as a model of the narrative style of writing . Sallust ( 86 ? 34 n.c. ) was the contemporary and friend of Csesar . The two works upon which his fame rests are the Conspiracy of Caliline and the Jncnrtlaine liar . Livy ( 59 B.C. ? A.D. 17 ) was one of the brightest ornaments of the Augustan Age . Herodotus among the ancient , and Macaulay among the modern , writers of historical narrative are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatest work is his Annals , a history of Rome from the earliest times to the year 9 B.C. Unfortunately , only thirty-five of the one hundred and forty-two books ? of this admirable production have been preserved . Many have been the laments over " the lost books of Livy . " As a chronicle of actual events , Livy 's history , particularly in its earlier parts , is very unreliable ; however , it is invaluable as an account of what the Romans themselves believed respecting the founding of their city and the deeds and virtues of their forefathers . The most highly prized work of Tacitus is his Germania , a treatise on the manners and customs of the Germans . In this work Tacitus sets in strong contrast the virtues of the untutored Germans and the vices of the cultured Romans . // 457 ? Science , Ethics , and Philosophy . ? Under this head may be grouped the names of Seneca , Pliny the Elder , Marcus Aurelius , and Epictetus . Seneca ( about A.D. 1-65 ) , moralist and philosopher , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( sec. 403 ) . He was a disbeliever in the popular religion of his countrymen , and entertained conceptions of God and his moral government not very different from those of Socrates . Pliny the Elder ( A.D. 23 ? 79 ) is almost the only Roman who won renown as an investigator of the phenomena of nature . The only work of his that has been spared to us is his Natural History , a sort of Roman encyclopedia . Marcus Aurelius the emperor and Epictetus the slave hold the first place among the ethical teachers of Rome . They were the last eminent representatives and expositors of the philosophy of Zeno ( sec. 272 ) . Christianity , giving a larger place to the affections than did Stoicism , was already fast winning the hearts of men . 458 . Writers of the Early Latin Church. ? The Christian authors of the first three centuries , like the writers of the New Testament , employed the Greek , that being the language of learning and culture . As the Latin tongue , however , gradually came into more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to use it in the composition of their works . Hence almost all the writings of the Fathers of the Church produced in the western half of the Empire during the later imperial period were composed in Latin . Among the many names that adorn the Church literature of this period must be mentioned St. Jerome and St. Augustine . Jerome ( A.n . 342 ? ? 420 ) is held in memory especially through his translation of the Scriptures into Latin . This version is known as the Vulgate , and is the one which , with slight changes , is still // used in the Catholic Church . " It was for Europe of the Middle Ages , " asserts Mackail , " more than Homer was to Greece . " Aurelius Augustine ( A.D. 354 ? 43o ) was born near Carthage , in Africa . His City of God , a truly wonderful work , possesses a special interest for the historian . The book was written just when Rome was becoming the spoil of the barbarians . It was designed to answer the charge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the worship of the ancient gods , was the cause of the calamities that were befalling the Roman state . 459 ? Roman Law and Law Literature . ? Although the Latin writers in all the departments of literary effort which we have so far reviewed did much valuable work , yet the Roman intellect in all these directions was under Greek guidance . But in another department it was different . We mean , of course , the field of legal and political science . Here the Romans ceased to be pupils and became teachers . Nations , like men , have their mission . Rome 's mission was to give laws to the world . In the year A.D. 527 Justinian became Emperor of the Roman Empire in the East . He almost immediately appointed a commission , headed by the great lawyer Tribonian , to collect and arrange in a systematic manner the immense mass of Roman laws and the writings of the jurists . The undertaking was like that of the decemvirs in connection with the Twelve Tables , only far greater . The result of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cozpus Jnrrls Ch ilis , or " Body of the Civil Law . " This consisted of three parts , ? the Code , the Pannderts , and the Institutes . The Code ' was a revised and compressed collection of all the laws , instructions to judicial officers , and opinions on legal subjects promulgated by the different emperors since the time of Hadrian ; the Pandects ( all-containing ) were a digest or abridgment of the writings , opinions , and decisions of the most eminent of the old Roman jurists and lawyers . The Institutes were a condensed edition of the Pandects , and were intended to form an elementary text-book for the use of students . . // The body of the Roman law thus preserved and transmitted was the great contribution of the Latin intellect to civilization . ' It has exerted a profound influence upon the law systems of almost all the European peoples . Thus does the once little Palatine city of the Tiber still rule the world . The religion of Judea , the arts of Greece , and the laws of Rome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . III . SOCIAL LIFE 46o . Education . ? Under the Republic there were no public schools in Rome ; education was a private affair . Under the early Empire a mixed system prevailed , there being both public and private schools . Eater , education came more completely under the supervision of the state . The salaries of the teachers and lecturers were usually paid by the municipalities , but sometimes from the imperial chest . The education of the Roman boy differed from that of the Greek youth in being more practical . The laws of the Twelve Tables were committed to memory ; and rhetoric and oratory were given special attention , as a mastery of the art of public speaking was an almost indispensable acquirement for the Roman citizen who aspired to take a prominent part in the affairs of state . After their conquest of Magna Grmcia and of Greece the Romans were brought into closer relations with Greek culture than had hitherto existed . The Roman youth were taught the language of Athens , often to the neglect , it appears , of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means not unusually went to Greece , just as the graduates of our schools go to Europe , to finish their education . Many of the most prominent statesmen of Rome , as , for instance , Cicero and Julius Caesar , received the advantages of this higher training in the schools of Greece . Somewhere between the ages of fourteen and eighteen the boy exchanged his purple-hemmed toga , or gown , for one of white wool , which was in all places and at all times the significant badge of Roman citizenship and Roman equality . 461 . Social Position of Woman . Until after her marriage the ( laughter of the family was kept in almost Oriental seclusion . Marriage gave her a certain freedom . She might now be present at the races of the circus and the shows of the theater and amphitheater , ? a privilege rarely accorded to her before marriage . In the early virtuous period of the Roman state the wife and mother held a dignified and assured position in the household , and divorces were unusual , there being no instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 23 r B.C. ; but in later times her position became less honored and divorce grew to be very common . The husband had the right to divorce his wife for the slightest cause or for no cause at all . In this disregard of the sanctity of the family relation may doubtless be found one cause of the degeneracy and failure of the Roman stock . 462 . Public Amusements ; the Theater and the Circus . ? The entertainments of the theater , the games of the circus , and the combats of the amphitheater were the three principal public amusements of the Romans . These entertainments , in general , increased in popularity as liberty declined , the great festive gatherings at the various places of amusement taking the place of the political assemblies of the Republic . The public exhibitions under the Empire were , in a certain sense , the compensation which the emperors offered the people for their surrender of the right of participation in public affairs ; and the people were content to accept the exchange . Tragedy was never held in high esteem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the exhibitions of the amphitheater // to care much for the make-believe tragedies of the stage . The entertainments of the theaters usually took the form of comedies , farces , and pantomimes . The last were particularly popular , both because the vast size of the theaters made it quite impossible for the actor to make his voice heard throughout the structure and for the reason that the language of signs was the only language that could be readily understood by an audience made up of so many different nationalities as composed a Roman assemblage . Almost from the beginning the Roman stage was gross and immoral . It was one of the main agencies to which must be attributed the undermining of the originally sound moral life of Roman society . More important and more popular than the entertainments of the theater were the various games of the circus , especially the chariot races . 463 . Animal Baitings . ? But far surpassing in their terrible fascination all other public amusements were the animal baitings and the gladiatorial combats of the amphitheater . The beasts ? bears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tigers ? required for the baitings were secured in different parts of the world and transported to Rome and the other cities of the Empire at enormous expense . The creatures were pitted against one another in every conceivable way . Often a promiscuous multitude would be turned loose in the arena at once . But even the terrific scene that then ensued became at last too tame to stir the blood of the Roman populace . Hence a new species of entertainment was introduced and grew rapidly into favor with the spectators of the amphitheater . This was the gladiatorial combat . 464 . The Gladiatorial Combats . ? Gladiatorial shows seem to have had their origin in Etruria , whence they were brought to Rome . It was a custom among the early Etruscans to slay prisoners upon the warrior 's grave , it being thought that the manes of the dead delighted in the blood of such victims . In later times the prisoners were allowed to fight and kill one another , this being deemed more humane than their cold-blooded slaughter . The first gladiatorial spectacle at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their father in the year 264 B.C. From this // time the public taste for this species of entertainment grew rapidly , and by the beginning of the imperial period had become a perfect infatuation . It was now no longer the manes of the dead , but the spirits of the living that the spectacles were intended to appease . At first the combatants were slaves , captives , or condemned criminals ; but at last knights , senators , and even women descended voluntarily into the arena . Training schools were established at Rome and in other cities . Free citizens often sold themselves to the keepers of these seminaries ; and to them flocked desperate men of all classes and ruined spendthrifts of the noblest patrician houses . Slaves and criminals were encour aged to become proficient in the art by the promise of freedom if they survived the combats beyond a certain number of years . Sometimes the gladiators fought in pairs ; again , great companies engaged at once in the deadly fray . They fought in chariots , on horseback , on foot , ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in actual battle . The contestants were armed with lances , swords , daggers , tridents , and every manner of weapon . Some were provided with nets and lassos with which they entangled their adversaries and then slew them . The life of a wounded gladiator was , in ordinary cases , in the hands of the audience . If in response to his appeal for mercy , which was made by outstretching the forefinger , the spectators waved their handkerchiefs or reached out their hands with thumbs extended , that indicated that his prayer had been heard ; but if they extended their hands with thumbs turned in , that was the signal for the victor to give him the death stroke . Sometimes // the dying were aroused and forced to resume the fight by being burned with a hot iron . The dead bodies were dragged from the arena with hooks , like the carcasses of animals , and the pools of blood soaked up with dry sand . These shows increased to such an extent that they entirely overshadowed the entertainments of the circus and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to curry favor with the masses ; magistrates were expected to give them in connection with the public festivals ; the heads of aspiring families exhibited them " in order to acquire social position " ; wealthy citizens prepared them as an indispensable feature of a fashionable banquet ; the children caught the spirit of their elders and imitated them in their plays . The rivalries between ambitious leaders during the later years of the Republic tended greatly to increase the number of gladiatorial shows , as liberality in arranging these spectacles was a sure passport to popular favor . It was reserved for the emperors , however , to exhibit them on a truly imperial scale . Titus , upon the dedication of the hlavian amphitheater , provided games , mostly gladiatorial combats , that lasted one hundred days . Trajan celebrated his victories with shows that continued still longer , in the progress of which ten thousand gladiators fought upon the arena . ' 465 . Luxury . By luxury , as we shall use the word , we mean extravagant and self-indulgent living . This vice seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primitive Romans were men of frugal habits , who found contentment in poverty and disdained riches . A great change , however , as we have seen , passed over Roman society after the conquest of the East and the development of the corrupt provincial system of the later Republic . The colossal fortunes quickly and dishonestly amassed by the ruling class marked the incoming at Rome of such a reign of luxury as perhaps no other capital of the world ever witnessed . This luxury was at its height in the last century of the Republic and the first of the Empire . Never perhaps has great wealth been more grossly misused than during this period at Rome . // 466 . State Distribution of Corn .  --  The free distribution of corn at Rome has been characterized as the " leading fact of Roman life . " It will be recalled that this pernicious practice had its beginnings in the legislation of Gains Gracchus ( sec. 364 ) . Just before the establishment of the Empire over three hundred thousand Roman citizens were recipients of this state bounty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have been even larger . The corn for this enormous distribution was derived , in large part , from a grain tribute exacted of the African and other corn-producing provinces . In the third century , to the largesses of corn were added doles of oil , wine , and pork . The evils that resulted from this misdirected state charity can hardly be overstated . Idleness and all its accompanying vices were fostered to such a degree that we probably shall not be wrong in enumerating the practice as one of the chief causes of the demoralization of society at Rome under the emperors . 467 . Slavery . ? The number of slaves under the later Republic and the earlier Empire was very great , some estimates making it equal to the number of freemen . Some large proprietors owned as many as twenty thousand . The love of ostentation led to the multiplication of offices in the households of the wealthy and the employment of a special slave for every different kind of work . Thus in some families there was kept a slave whose sole duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The price of slaves varied from a few dollars to ten or twenty thousand dollars , ? these last figures being of course exceptional . Greek slaves were the most valuable , as their lively intelligence rendered them serviceable in positions calling for special talent . The slave class was chiefly recruited , as in Greece , by war and by the practice of kidnapping . Some of the outlying provinces in Asia and Africa were almost depopulated by the slave hunters . Delinquent taxpayers were often sold as slaves , and frequently poor persons sold themselves into servitude . The feeling entertained towards this unfortunate class in the later republican period is illustrated by Varro 's classification of slaves as " vocal agricultural implements , " and again by Cato the // Censor 's recommendation to masters to sell their old and decrepit slaves in order to save the expense of caring for them . In many cases , as a measure of precaution , the slaves were forced to work in chains and to sleep in subterranean prisons . Their bitter hatred towards their masters , engendered by harsh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As many enemies as slaves , " and by the servile revolts of the republican period . Slaves were treated better under the Empire than under the later Republic , a change to be attributed doubtless to the influence of Stoicism and of Christianity . From the first century of the Empire forward there is observable a growing sentiment of humanity towards the bondsman . Imperial edicts take away from the master the right to kill his slave or to sell him to the trader in gladiators , or even to treat him with undue severity . This marks the beginning of a slow reform which in the course of ten or twelve centuries resulted in the complete , or almost complete , abolition of slavery in Christian Europe . PART II MEDI2EVAL AND MODERN HISTORY CHAPTER XXXVI INTRODUCTION 468 . Preliminary Survey . As has already been noted , the fourteen centuries since the fall of the Roman Empire in the West are usually conceived as forming two periods , ? the Middle Ages , or the period lying between the fall of Rome and the discovery of America by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extends from the latter event to the present time . The Middle Ages again naturally subdivide into two periods , ? the Dark Ages and the Age of Revival ; while the Modern Age , as we shall view it , also falls into two divisions , the Era of the Protestant Reformation and the Era of the Political Revolution . 469 . Chief Characteristics of the Four Periods .  --  The Dark Ages , which embrace the years between the fall of Rome and the opening of the eleventh century , are so called for the reason that the inrush of the barbarians and the almost total eclipse of the light of classical culture caused them to contrast unfavorably , in enlightenment and social order , as well with the age which preceded as with that which followed them . The period was one of origins ,  --  of the beginnings of peoples , and languages , and institutions . The Age of Revival begins with the opening of the eleventh century and ends with the discovery of the New World . During all this time civilization was making slow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feudal anarchy , and governments were becoming more regular . The last part of the period especially was marked by a great intellectual revival , 332 // ? a movement known as the Renaissance , or " New Birth , " by improvements , inventions , and discoveries which greatly stirred men 's minds and awakened them as from a sleep . The Crusades , or Holy Wars , were the most remarkable undertakings of the age . The Err of the Reformation embraces the sixteenth century and the first half of the seventeenth . The period is characterized by the great religious movement known as the Reformation , and the tremendous struggle between Catholicism and Protestantism . Almost all the wars of the period were religious wars . The last great combat was the Thirty Years ' War in Germany , which was closed by the celebrated Peace of Westphalia , in 1648 . After this date the disputes and wars between parties and nations were dynastic or political rather than religious in character . The Era of the Political Revolution extends from the Peace of Westphalia to the present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conflict between despotic and liberal principles of government , resulting in the triumph of democratic ideas . This is one of the most important revolutions that history records . The central event of the epoch was the terrible upheaval of the French Revolution . Having now made a general survey of the region we are to traverse , we must turn back to our starting point , the fall of Rome . 470 . Relation to World History of the Fall of Rome .  --  The calamity which in the fifth century befell the Roman Empire in the West is sometimes spoken of as an event marking the extinction of ancient civilization . The treasures of the Old World are represented as having been destroyed , and mankind as obliged to take a fresh start , ? to lay the foundations of civilization anew . It was not so . All or almost all that was really valuable in the accumulations of antiquity escaped harm , and became sooner or later the possession of the succeeding ages . The catastrophe simply prepared the way for the shifting in the West of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Europe , simply transferred at once political power , and gradually social and intellectual preeminence , from one race to another , ? from the Roman to the Teuton. if // The event was not an unrelieved calamity , because fortunately the floods that seemed to be sweeping so much away were not the mountain torrent , which covers fruitful fields with worthless drift , but the overflowing Nile with its rich deposits . Over all the regions covered by the barbarian inundation a new stratum of population was thrown down , a new soil formed that was capable of nourishing a better civilization than any the world had yet seen . 471 . The Three Chief Elements of European Civilization . ? We must now notice what survived the catastrophe of the fifth century , what it was that Rome transmitted to the new Teutonic race . This renders necessary an analysis of the elements of civilization . European civilization is mainly the result of the blending of three historic elements , the Classical , the Hebiew , and the Teutonic . By the classical element in civilization is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , laws , manners , ideas , social arrangements , and models of imperial and municipal government ,  --  everything , in a word , save Christianity , ? that Greece and Rome gave to mediaeval and modern Europe . Taken together , these things constituted a valuable gift to the new northern race that was henceforth to represent civilization . By the Hebrew element in history is meant Christianity . This has been a most potent factor in modern civilization . It has so colored the life and so molded the institutions of the European peoples that their ' history is very largely a story of this religion , which , first going forth from Judea , was given to the younger world by the missionaries of Rome . Among the doctrines taught by the new religion were the unity of God , the brotherhood of man , and immortality , ? doctrines which have greatly helped to make the modern so different from the ancient world . By the Teutonic element in history is meant the Germanic race . The Teutons , though of course they had the social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in those things in which the Romans were rich . They had neither arts , nor sciences , nor philosophies , nor literatures . But they had something better than all these things ; they had personal worth . It was because of this , because of their free independent spirit , // of their unbounded capacity for growth , for culture , for accomplishment , that the future time became theirs . 472 . Celts , Slays , and Other Peoples . ? Having noticed the Romans and the Teutons , the two most important of the peoples that present themselves to us at the time of the fall of Rome , if we now name the Celts , the Slays , the Arabians , and the Mongols and Turks , we shall have under view the chief actors in the drama of medixval and of a large part of modern history . At the commencement of the medieval era the Celts were in front of the Teutons , clinging to the western edge of the European continent , and engaged in a bitter contest with these latter peoples , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was destined to extend itself to our own day . The Slays were in the rear of the Teutonic tribes , pressing them on even as the Celts in front were struggling to resist their advance . These peoples , backward in civilization , will play only an obscure part in the transactions of the media ; val era , but in the course of the . modern period will assume a most commanding position among the European nations . The Arabians were hidden in their deserts ; but in the seventh century we shall see them , animated by a wonderful religious enthusiasm , issue from their peninsula and begin a contest with the Christian nations which , in. its varying phases , was destined to fill a large part of the mediaval period . The Mongols and Turks were buried in Central Asia . They will appear late in the eleventh century , proselytes for the most part of Mohammedanism ; and , as the religious ardor of the Semitic Arabians grows cool , we shall see the Islam standard carried forward by these zealous converts of another race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall see the Crescent , the adopted emblem of the new religion , placed by the Ottoman Turks upon the dome of St. Sophia in Constantinople . As the Middle Ages draw to a close , the remote nations of Eastern Asia will gradually come within our circle of vision ; and , as the Modern Age dawns , we shall catch a glimpse of new continents and strange races of men beyond the Atlantic CHAPTER XXXVII THE BARBARIAN KINGDOMS : ntroductory . In connection with the history of the of the Roman Empire in the West we have already inc account of the migrations and settlements of the tribes . In the present chapter we shall indicate briefly ical fortunes , for the two centuries and more following the ome , of the principal kingdoms set up by the German s in the different parts of the old Empire . Cingdom of the Ostrogoths ( A.D. 493-554 ) . ? Odoacer ecalled as the barbarian chief who dethroned the last of tern Roman emperors ( sec. 445 ) . His feeble governItaly lasted only seventeen years , when it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goths ) under ic , the greatest of their chiefs , who set up in Italy a new known as the Kingdom of the Ostrogoths. eign of Theodoric covered thirty-three years ( A.D. 493. years of such quiet and prosperity as Italy had not ince the happy era of the Antonines . The king made promise that his reign should be such that " the only the people should be that the Goths had not come at r period . " : ingdom established by the rare abilities of Theodoric ly twenty-seven years after his death . Justinian , Emperor , ast ( sec. 508 ) , taking advantage of that event , sent his first Belisarius and afterwards Narses , to deliver Italy 336 // from the rule of the barbarians . The last of the Ostrogothic kings fell in battle , and Italy , with her fields ravaged and her cities in ruins , was reunited to the Empire ( A.D. 554 ) . 475 . Kingdom of the Visigoths ( A.D. 415 ? 71 I ) . ? The Visigoths ( Western Goths ) were already in possession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Roman Empire in the West was brought to an end by the act of Odoacer and his companions . Being driven south of the Pyrenees by the kings of the Franks , the Visigoths held their possessions in Spain until the beginning of the eighth century , when their rule was ended by the Saracens ( sec. 522 ) . The Visigothic kingdom when thus overturned had lasted nearly three hundred years . During this time the conquerors had mingled with the old Romanized inhabitants of Spain , so that in the veins of the Spaniard of to-day is blended the blood of Iberian , Celt , Roman , and Teuton , together with that of the last intruder , the African Moor . 476 . Kingdom of the Burgundians ( A.D. 443 ? 534 ) ? ? The Burgundians we have already noticed as the founders of a principality in Southeastern Gaul ( sec. 441 ) . They were hardly well established in these parts before they came in collision with the Franks on the north , and were reduced by them to a state of dependence . 477 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . ? We have also previously spoken of the establishment in North Africa of the Kingdom of the Vandals , and told how , under the lead of their king Geiseric , they bore in triumph down the Tiber the heavy spoils of Rome ( sec. 444 ) . Being Arian Christians , the Vandals persecuted with furious zeal the orthodox party . Moved by the entreaties of the African Catholics , the Byzantine emperor Justinian sent his general Belisarius to drive the barbarians from Africa . The expedition was successful , and Carthage and the fruitful fields of Africa were restored to the Empire after having suffered the insolence of the barbarian conquerors for the space of above a hundred years . The Vandals remaining in the country were gradually absorbed by the old Roman population , and after a few generations no certain trace of the barbarian invaders could be detected in the // physical appearance , the language , or the customs of the inhabitants of the African coast . The Vandal nation had disappeared ; the name alone remained . 478 . The Franks under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fall of Rome the Franks , as we have seen ( sec. 441 ) , were on the soil of Gaul , laying there the foundations of the French nation and monarchy . Among their several chieftains at this time was Clovis . Upon the break-up of the Roman Empire in the West , Clovis conceived the ambition of erecting a kingdom upon the ruins of the Roman power . He attacked Syagrius , the Roman governor of Gaul , and at Soissons gained a decisive victory over his forces ( A.D. 486 ) . Thus was destroyed forever in Gaul that Roman authority established among its barbarian tribes more than five centuries before by the conquests of Julius Caesar . Clovis in a short time extended his authority over the greater part of Gaul , reducing to the condition of tributaries the various Teutonic tribes that had taken possession of different portions of the country . Upon his death ( A.D. 511 ) his extensive dominions , in accordance with the ancient Teutonic law of inheritance , were divided among his four sons . About a century and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time the Merovingians 1 had become so feeble and inefficient that they were contemptuously called roil faineants , or " do-nothing kings , " and an ambitious officer of the crown , known as Mayor of the Palace , in a way that will be explained a little later , pushed aside the weak Merovingian king and gave to the Frankish monarchy a new royal line , ? the Carolingian . 479 . Kingdom of the Lombards ( A.D. 568-774 ) . ? Barely a decade had passed after the recovery of Italy from the Ostrogoths by the Eastern emperor Justinian ( sec. 474 ) , before a large part of the peninsula was again lost to the Empire through its conquest by another barbarian tribe known as the Lombards . When they entered Italy the Lombards were Christians of the Arian sect ; but in time they became converts to the orthodox faith , and Pope // Gregory I bestowed upon their king a diadem which came to be known as the " Iron Crown , " for the reason that there was wrought into it what was believed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christ had suffered . The Kingdom of the Lombards was destroyed by Charles the Great , the most noted of the Frankish rulers , inn the year 774 but the blood of the invaders had by this time become intermingled with that of the former subjects of the Empire , so that throughout all that part of the peninsula which is still called Lombardy after them , one will to-day occasionally see the fair hair and light complexion which reveal the strain of German blood in the veins of the present inhabitants . 480 . The Anglo-Saxon Conquest of Britain . ? In the fifth century of our era , being then engaged in her death struggle with the barbarians , Rome withdrew her legions from Britain in order to protect Italy . Thus that province was left exposed to the depredations of the Anglo-Saxon corsairs from the Continent . No other province of the Roman Empire made such determined and heroic resistance against the barbarians . It is to this period of desperate struggle that the famous King Arthur belongs . The legends that have gathered about the name of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible that he had a real existence and that the name represents one or more of the most valiant of the Celtic chiefs who battled so long and heroically against the pagan invaders . The conquerors of Britain belonged to three Teutonic tribes , ? the Angles , Saxons , and Jutes , ? but among the Celts they all passed under the name of Saxons , and among themselves , after they began to draw together into a single nation , under that of Angles , whence the name England ( Angle-land ) . By the close of the sixth century the invading bands had set up in the conquered parts of the island eight or nine , or perhaps more , kingdoms , ? frequently designated , though somewhat inaccurately , as the Hcpttaa ? chy . For the space of two hundred years there was an almost perpetual strife for supremacy among the leading states . Finally , Egbert , king of Wessex ( A.D. 802-839 ) , // brought all the other kingdoms to a subject or tributary condition , and became in reality , though he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually assumed the title , the-first king of England . 481 . Teutonic Tribes outside the Empire. ? We have now spoken of the most important of the Teutonic tribes which forced themselves within the limits of the Roman Empire in the West , and that there , upon the ruins of the civilization they had overthrown , laid or helped to lay the foundations of the modern nations of Italy , Spain , France , and England . Beyond the boundaries of the old Empire were still other tribes and clans of this same mighty family of nations , tribes and clans that were destined to play great parts in European history . On the east , beyond the Rhine , were the ancestors of the modern Germans . Notwithstanding the immense hosts that the forests and morasses of Germany had poured into the Roman provinces , the Fatherland , in the sixth century of our era , seemed still as crowded as before the great migration began . These tribes were yet barbarians in manners , and , for the most part , pagans in religion . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the modern Danes , Swedes , and Norwegians . They were as yet untouched either by the civilization or the religion of Rome . CHAPTER XXXVIII THE CHURCH AND ITS INSTITUTIONS I. THE CONVERSION OF THE BARBARIANS 482 . Introductory. ? The most important event in the history of the tribes that took possession of the Roman Empire in the West was their conversion to Christianity . Many of the barbarians were converted before or soon after their entrance into the Empire ; to this circumstance the Roman provinces owed their immunity from the excessive cruelties which pagan barbarians seldom fail to inflict upon a subjected enemy . Alaric left untouched the treasures of the churches of the Roman Christians because his own faith was also Christian . For like reason the Vandal king Geiseric yielded to the prayers of Pope Leo the Great and promised to leave to the inhabitants of the Imperial City their lives . 483 . Conversion of the Goths , Vandals , and Other Tribes . ? The first converts to Christianity among the barbarians beyond the limits of the Empire were won from among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Ulfilas , who translated the Scriptures into the Gothic language , omitting from his version , however , the Books of the Kings , as he feared that the stirring recital of wars and battles in that portion of the Word might kindle into too fierce a flame the martial ardor of his new converts . What happened in the case of the Goths happened also in the case of most of the barbarian tribes that participated in the overthrow of the Roman Empire in the West . By the time of the fall of Rome the Goths , the Vandals , the Suevi , and the Burgundians had become proselytes to Christianity . They , however , professed the Arian creed , which had been condemned by the great council of the Church held at Nicaea during the reign of Constantine the Great . Hence they were regarded as heretics by the Catholic Church , and all had to be reconverted to the orthodox creed , which good work was gradually accomplished . 34T // The remaining Teutonic tribes of whose conversion we shall speak the Franks , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outset the Catholic faith . 484 . Conversion of the Franks ; Importance of this Event . ? The Franks when they entered the Empire , like the Angles and Saxons when they landed in Britain , were still pagans . Christianity gained way very slowly among them until a supposed interposition by the Christian God in their behalf led the king and nation to adopt the new religion in place of their old faith . The circumstances , as reported by tradition , were these . In a terrible battle between the Alemanni and the Franks under their king Clovis , the situation of the Franks had become desperate . Then Clovis , falling upon his knees , called upon the God of the Christians , and vowed that if he would give him the victory he would become his follower . The battle turned in favor of the Franks , and Clovis , faithful to his vow , was baptized , and with him three thousand of his warriors . This story of the conversion of Clovis and his Franks illustrates how the belief of the barbarians in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if their gods did not do for them all they wanted done they had a right to set them aside and choose others in their stead , contributed to their conversion , and how the reception of the new faith was often a tribal or national affair rather than a matter of personal conviction . " The conversion of the Franks , " says the historian Milman , " was the most important event in its remote as well as its immediate consequences in European history . " It was of such moment for the reason that the Franks embraced the orthodox Catholic faith , while almost all the other German invaders of the Empire had embraced the heretical Arian creed . This secured them the loyalty of their Roman subjects and also gained for them the official favor of the Church of Rome . Thus was laid the basis of the ascendancy in the West of the Frankish kings . 485 . Augustine 's Mission to England . In the year A.D. 596 Pope Gregory I sent the monk Augustine with a band of forty companions to teach the Christian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become interested through seeing in the slave market at Rome some fair-faced captives from that remote region . The monks were favorably received by the English , who listened attentively to the story the strangers had come to tell them ; and being persuaded that the tidings were true , they burned the temples of Woden and Thor , and were in large numbers baptized in the Christian faith . ' One of the most important consequences of the conversion of Britain was the reestablishment of that connection of the island with Roman civilization which had been severed by the calamities of the fifth century . As Green says , ? he is speaking of the embassy of St. Augustine , The in art of " That man is little to be envied whose patriotism would not gain force upon the plain of Marathon , or whose the ' honks as they piety would not grow wanner among the ruins of Iona. ? C h a Il t e d their solemn litany was in one sense a return of the Roman legions who withdrew at the trumpet call of Alaric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ union with the western world which the landing of Hengist had destroyed . The new England was admitted into the older commonwealth of nations . The civilization , art , letters , which had fled before the sword of the English conquerors , returned with the Christian faith . " 486 . The Conversion of Ireland ; Iona . The spiritual conquest of Ireland was effected largely by a zealous priest named Patricius ( d. about A.D. 469 ) , better known as St. Patrick , the patron saint // of Ireland . With such success were his labors attended that by the time of his death a great part of the island had embraced the Christian faith . Never did any race receive the Gospel with more ardent enthusiasm . The Irish or Celtic Church sent out its devoted missionaries into the Pictish highlands , into the forests of Germany , and among the wilds of Alps and Apennines . Among the numerous religious houses founded by the Celtic missionaries was the famous monastery established A.D. 563 by the Irish monk St. Columba , on the little isle of Iona @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most renowned center of Christian learning and missionary zeal , and for almost two centuries was the point from which radiated light through the darkness of the surrounding heathenism. 487 . The Conversion of Germany . ? The great apostle of Germany was the Saxon Winfrid , better known as St. Boniface . During a long and intensely active life he founded schools and monasteries , organized churches , preached and baptized , and at last died a martyr 's death ( A.D. 753 ) . Through him , as says Milman , the Saxon invasion of England flowed back upon the Continent . The Christianizing of the tribes of Germany relieved the Teutonic folk of Western Europe from the constant peril of massacre by their heathen kinsmen , and erected a strong barrier in Central Europe against the advance of the waves of Turanian paganism and Mohammedanism which for centuries beat so threateningly against the eastern frontiers of Germany . 488 . Christianity in the North .  --  The progress of Christianity in the North was slow ; but gradually , during the ninth , tenth , and eleventh centuries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scandinavian peoples . One important effect of their conversion was the checking of those piratical expeditions which during all the centuries of their pagan history had been constantly putting out from the fiords of the Northern peninsulas and vexing every shore to the south . By about the year r000 all Europe was claimed by Christianity , save the regions of the Northwest about the Baltic , which were // inhabited chiefly by the still pagan Finns and Lapps , parts of what is now Russia , ' and the larger portion of the Iberian peninsula , which was in the hands of the Mohammedan Moors . II . THE RISE OF MONASTICISM 489 . Monasticism defined ; the System fostered by Scripture Teachings . ? It was during the period between the third and the sixth century that there grew up in the Church the institution known as Monasticism . This term , in its widest application , denotes a life of austere self-denial and of seclusion from the world , with the object of promoting the interests of the soul . As thus defined , the system embraced two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or anchorites , ? persons who , retiring from the world , lived solitary lives in desolate places ( 2 ) cenobites , or monks , who formed communities and lived usually under a common roof . Christian asceticism was fostered by teachings drawn from various texts of the Bible . " Thus Christ himself had declared , " If any man come to me , and hate not his father , and mother , and wife , and children , and brethren , and sisters , yea , and his own life also , he can not be my disciple " ; s and , again , he had said to the rich young man , " If thou wilt be perfect , go and sell that thou hast , and give to the poor . " ' These passages , and others like them , taken literally , tended greatly to confirm the belief of the ascetic that his life of isolation and poverty and abstinence was the most perfect life and the surest way to win salvation . St. Antony , an Egyptian ascetic ( b. about A.D. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tremendous impulse to the movement , is called the Father of the Hermits . But the most renowned of all the anchorites of the East was St. Simeon Stylites , the Saint of the Pillar ( d . A.D. 459 ) , who spent thirty-six years on // a column only three feet in diameter at the top , which he had gradually raised to a height of over fifty feet . ' " 490 . Monasticism in the West . During the fourth century the anchorite type of asceticism , which was favored by the mild climate of the Eastern lands , and especially by that of Egypt , assumed in some degree the monastic form that is to say , the fame of this or that anchorite or hermit drew about him a number of disciples , whose rude huts or cells formed what was known as a Laura , the nucleus of a monastery . Soon after the cenobite system had been established in the East it was introduced into Europe , and in an astonishingly short space of time spread throughout all the Western countries where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the almost total exclusion of the hermit mode of life . Monasteries arose on every side . The number that fled to these retreats was vastly augmented by the disorder and terror attending the invasion of the barbarians and the overthrow of the Empire in the West . 491 . The Rule of St. Benedict . ? With the view of introducing some sort of regularity in regard to the practices and austerities of the monks , rules for their observance were early prescribed . The three essential requirements or vows were poverty , chastity , and obedience . The greatest legislator of the monks was St. Benedict of Nursia ( A.D. 480-543 ) , the founder of the celebrated monastery of Monte Cassino , situated midway between Rome and Naples , in Italy . His code was to the religious world what the Corpus Juris Civilis of Justinian ( sec. 459 ) was to the lay society of Europe . Many of his rules were most wise and practical , as , for instance , one that made manual work a pious duty , and another that required the monk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The monks who subjected themselves to the rule of St. Benedict were known as Benedictines . The order became immensely popular . At one time it embraced about forty thousand abbeys. 492 . Services of the Monks to Civilization . ? The early establishment of the monastic system in the Church resulted in great // advantages to the new world that was shaping itself out of the ruins of the old . The monks , especially the Benedictines , became agriculturists , and by patient labor converted the wild and marshy lands which they received as gifts from princes and others into fruitful fields , thus redeeming from barrenness some of the most desolate districts of Europe . The monks also became missionaries , and it was largely to their zeal and devotion that the Church owed her speedy and signal victory over the barbarians.The quiet air of the monasteries nourished learning as well as piety . The monks became teachers , and under the shelter of the monasteries established schools which were the nurseries of learning during the earlier Middle Ages and the homes for centuries of the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as copyists , and with great painstaking and industry gathered and multiplied ancient manuscripts , and thus preserved and transmitted to the modern world much classical learning and literature that would otherwise have been lost . They became also the chroniclers of the events of their own times , so that it is to them we are indebted for a great part of our knowledge of the early medival centuries . Thus the scriptorium , or writing-room of the monastery , held the place in mediveval society that the great publishing house holds in the modern world . The monks became further the almoners of the pious and the wealthy , and distributed alms to the poor and needy . Everywhere the monasteries opened their hospitable doors to the weary , the sick , and the discouraged . In a word , these retreats were the inns , the asylums , and the hospitals of the medieval ages . // III . THE RISE OF THE PAPACY 493 . The Empire within the Empire . Long before the fall of Rome there had begun to grow up within the Roman Empire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imperial model . This spiritual empire , like the secular empire , possessed a hierarchy of officers , of which deacons , priests or presbyters , and bishops were the most important . The bishops collectively formed what is known as the episcopate . There were four grades of bishops , namely , country bishops , city bishops , metropolitans or archbishops , and patriarchs . At the end of the fourth century there were five patriarchates , that is , regions ruled by patriarchs . These centered in the great cities of Rome , Constantinople , Alexandria , Antioch , and Jerusalem . Among the patriarchs , the patriarchs of Rome were accorded almost universally a precedence in honor and dignity . They claimed further a precedence in authority and jurisdiction . Besides the influence of great men , such as Leo the Great , Gregory the Great , and Nicholas I , who held the seat of St. Peter , there were various historical circumstances that contributed to the realization by the Roman bishops of their claim to supremacy and aided them vastly in establishing the almost universal authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we shall enumerate several of these favoring circumstances . These matters constitute the great landmarks in the rise and early growth of the Papacy . 494 . The Belief in the Primacy of St. Peter and in the Founding by him of the Church at Rome . ? It came to be believed that the apostle Peter had been given by the Master a sort of primacy among his fellow-apostles . This belief was fostered by the fact that Christ had intrusted that disciple with the keys of the kingdom of heaven , and had invested him with authority as a teacher and interpreter of the Word by the commission , " Feed my lambs ; . . . feed my sheep , " thus giving into his charge the entire flock of the Church . It also came to be believed that Peter himself had founded the church at Rome . Without doubt he preached there and suffered martyrdom under the Emperor Nero . // These beliefs and interpretations of history , which make the Roman bishops the successors of the first of the apostles and the holders of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their reputation and to justify their claim to a primacy of authority over all the dignitaries of the Church . 495 . Advantage of their Position at the Political Center of the World . The claims of the Roman bishops were in the early centuries greatly favored by the spell in which the world was held by the name and prestige of imperial Rome . Thence it had been accustomed to receive commands in all temporal matters ; how very natural , then , that thither it should turn for command and guidance in spiritual affairs . The Roman bishops in thus occupying the geographical and political center of the world enjoyed a great advantage over all other bishops and patriarchs . The halo that during many centuries of wonderful history had gathered about the Eternal City came naturally to invest with a kind of aureole the head of the Christian bishop . 496 . The Pastor as Protector of Rome . ? Then , when the barbarians came , there came a propitious occasion for the Roman bishops to widen their influence and enhance their authority . Rome 's extremity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mainly through the intercession of the pious Pope Leo the Great the fierce Attila was persuaded to turn back and spare the Imperial City ; and how the same bishop , in the year A.D. 455 , also appeased in a measure the wrath of the Vandal Geiseric and shielded the inhabitants from the worst passions of a barbarian soldiery ( secs . 443 and 444 ? Thus when the emperors , the natural defenders of the capital , were unable to protect it , the unarmed Pastor was able , through the awe and reverence inspired by his holy office , to render services that could not but result in bringing increased honor and dignity to the Roman see . 497 . Effects upon the Papacy of the Extinction of the Roman Empire in the West . ? But if the misfortunes of the Empire in the West tended to the enhancement of the reputation and influence of the Roman bishops , much more did its final downfall tend to // the same end . Upon the surrender of the sovereignty of the West into the hands of the Emperor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most important personages in Western Europe , and , being so far removed from the court at Constantinople , gradually assumed almost imperial powers . They became the arbiters between the barbarian chiefs and the Italians , and to them were referred for decision the disputes arising between cities , states , and kings . Especially did the bishops and archbishops throughout the West in their contests with the Arian barbarian rulers look to Rome for advice and help . It is easy to see how greatly these things tended to strengthen the authority and increase the influence of the Roman bishops . 498 . The Missions of Rome . Again , the early missionary zeal of the church at Rome made her the mother of many churches , all of whom looked up to her with affectionate and grateful loyalty . Thus the Angles and Saxons , won to the faith by the missionaries of Rome , conceived a deep veneration for the holy see and became its most devoted children . To Rome it was that the Christian Britons made their most frequent pilgrimages , and thither they sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Saxons became missionaries to their pagan kinsmen of the Continent they transplanted into the heart of Germany these same feelings of filial attachment and love . 499 . Result of the Fall of Antioch , Jerusalem , and Alexandria before the Saracens . In the seventh century all the great cities of the East fell into the hands of the Mohammedans . This was a matter of tremendous consequence for the church at Rome , since in every one of these great capitals there was , or might have been , a rival of the Roman bishop . The virtual erasure of Antioch , Jerusalem , and Alexandria from the map of Christendom left only one city , Constantinople , that could possibly nourish a rival of the Roman church . Thus did the very misfortunes of Christendom give an added security to the ever-increasing authority of the Roman prelate. 500 . The Iconoclastic Controversy ; the Popes become Temporal Sovereigns. ? A dispute about the use of images in worship , known // in Church history as the " War of the Iconoclasts , " ? which broke out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ East and the Latin churches of the West , drew after it farreaching consequences as respects the growing power of the Roman pontiffs . Leo the Isaurian , who came to the throne of Constantinople in 717 , was a zealous Iconoclast . The Greek churches of the East having been cleared of images , the Emperor resolved to clear also the Latin churches of the West of these symbols . To this end he issued a decree that they should not be used . The bishop of Rome not only opposed the execution of the edict , but by the ban of excommunication cut off the Emperor and the iconoclastic churches of the East from communion with the true Catholic Church . Though images ? paintings and mosaics only ? were permanently restored in the Eastern churches in 842 , still by this time other causes of alienation had arisen , and the breach between the two sections of Christendom could not now be closed . The final outcome was the permanent separation , in the last half of the eleventh century , of the Church of the Last from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ( ; reek , Byzantine , or Eastern Church ; the latter , as the Latin , Roman , or Catholic Church . The East was thus eventually lost to the Roman see , but the loss was more than made good by fresh accessions of power in the West . In this quarrel with the Eastern emperors the Roman bishops formed an alliance with the Frankish princes . We shall a little later tell briefly the story of this alliance ( Chapter XLII ) . Never did allies render themselves more serviceable to each other . The popes consecrated the Frankish chieftains as kings and emperors ; the grateful Frankish kings defended the popes against all their enemies , imperial and barbarian , and dowering them with cities and provinces , laid the basis of their temporal power . ' // Such in broad outline was the way in which grew up the Papacy , an institution which , far beyond all others , was destined to mold the fortunes and direct the activities of Western Christendom throughout the mediaeval time . CHAPTER XXXIX THE FUSION OF LATIN AND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barbarians and the development in Western Christendom of the central authority of the Papacy prepared the way for the introduction among the northern races of the arts and the culture of Rome , and contributed greatly to hasten in Italy , Spain , and Gaul the fusion into a single people of the Latins and the Teutons , of which important matter we shall treat in the present chapter . We shall tell how these two races , upon the soil of the old Empire in the West , intermingled their blood , their languages , their laws , their usages and customs , to form new peoples , new tongues , and new institutions . 502 . The Romance Nations . In some districts the barbarian invaders and the Roman provincials were kept apart for a long time by the lintel antagonism of race , and by a sense of injury on the one hand and a feeling of disdainful superiority on the other . But for the most part the Teutonic intruders and the Latin-speaking inhabitants of Italy , Spain , and France very soon began freely to mingle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say what proportion the Teutons bore to the Romans . Of course the proportion varied in the different countries . In none of the countries named , however , was it large enough to absorb the Latinized population ; on the contrary , the barbarians were themselves absorbed , yet not without changing very essentially the body into which they were incorporated . Thus about the end of the fourth century everything in Italy , Spain , and France ? dwellings , cities , dress , customs , language , laws , soldiers ? reminds us of Rome . A little later and a great change has taken place . The barbarians have come in . For a time we see everywhere , jostling each other in the streets and markets , crowding each other in the theaters and courts , kneeling together in the churches , the former Romanized subjects of 353 // the Empire and their uncouth Teutonic conquerors . But by the close of the ninth century , to speak in very general terms , the two elements have become quite intimately blended , and a century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we are introduced to Italians , Spaniards , and Frenchmen . These we call Romance nations , because at base they are Roman . 503 . The Formation of the Romance Languages . ? During the five centuries of their subjection to Rome , the natives of Spain and Gaul forgot their barbarous dialects and came to speak a corrupt Latin . Now , in exactly the same way that the dialects of the Celtic tribes of Gaul and of the Celtiberians of Spain had given way to the more refined speech of the Romans did the rude languages of the Teutons yield to the more cultured speech of the Roman provincials . In the course of two or three centuries after their entrance into the Empire , Goths , Lombards , Burgundians , and Franks had , in a large measure , dropped their own tongue and were speaking that of the people they had subjected . But of course this provincial Latin underwent a great change upon the lips of the mixed descendants of the Romans and Teutons . Owing to the absence of a common popular literature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not exactly correspond to those going on in another . Hence , in the course of time , we find different dialects springing up , and by about the ninth century the Latin has virtually disappeared as a spoken language , and its place has been usurped by what will be known as the Italian , Spanish , and French languages , all more or less resembling the ancient Latin , and all called Romance tongues , because children of the old Roman speech . 504 . The Personal Character of the Teutonic Laws . ? The laws of the barbarians were generally personal instead of territorial , as with us ; that is , instead of all the inhabitants of a given country being subject to the same laws , there were different ones for the different classes of society . The Latins , for instance , were subject in private law only to the old Roman code , while the Teutons lived under the tribal rules and regulations which they had brought with them from beyond the Rhine and the Danube . // Even among themselves the Teutons knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equal before the law . The penalty inflicted upon the evil doer depended not upon the nature of his crime but upon his rank or that of the party injured . Thus slaves and serfs were beaten and put to death for minor offenses , while a freeman might atone for any crime , even for murder , by the payment of a fine , the amount of the penalty being determined by the rank of the victim . 505 . Ordeals . The agencies relied upon by the Germans to ascertain the guilt or innocence of accused persons show in how rude a state the administration of justice among them was . One very common method of proof was by what were called ordeals , in which the question was submitted to the judgment of God . Of these the chief were the ordeal by fire , the ordeal by water , and the wager of battle . ' The ordeal by fire consisted in taking in the hand a piece of red-hot iron , or in walking blindfolded with bare feet over a row of hot plowshares laid Iengthwise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his innocence was held to be established . Another way of performing the fire ordeal was by running through the flames of two fires built close together , or by walking over live brands ; hence the phrase " to haul over the coals . " The ordeal by water was of two kinds , by hot water and by cold . In the hot-water ordeal the accused person thrust his arm into boiling water , and if no hurt was visible upon the arm three days after the operation , the party was considered guiltless . When we speak of one 's being " in hot water , " we use an expression which had its origin in this ordeal . In the cold-water trial the suspected person was thrown into a stream or pond : if he floated , he was held guilty ; if he sank , innocent . The water , it was believed , would reject the guilty , but receive the innocent into its bosom . The practice common in Europe until a very recent date of trying supposed witches by // throwing them into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or float , grew out of this superstition . The trial by combat , or wager of battle , was a solemn judicial duel . It was resorted to in the belief that God would give victory to the right . Naturally it was a favorite mode of trial among a people who found their chief delight in fighting . Even the judge in some cases resorted to it to maintain the authority and dignity of his court . To a person who had disregarded a sumMons the judge would scud a challenge in this form : " I sent for thee , and thou did st not think it ff-worth thy while to come ; 1 demand therefore satisfaction for this thy contempt . " The ordeal was frequently performed bY deputy , that one person for hire or for the sake of friendship would undertake it for another ; hence the expression " to go through fire and water to serve one . " Especially was such substitution common in the judicial duel , as women and ecclesiastics were generally forbidden to appear personally in the lists . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time a regular class in society , like the gladiators in ancient Rome . Religious houses and chartered towns hired champions at a regular salary to defend all the cases to which they might become a party . // 506 . The Revival of the Roman Law . ? Now the barbarian law system , if such it can be called , the character of which we have merely suggested by the preceding illustrations , gradually displaced the Roman law in all those countries where the two systems at first existed alongside each other , save in Italy and Southern France , where the provincials greatly outnumbered the invaders . But the admirable jurisprudence of Rome was bound to assert its superiority . About the close of the eleventh century there was a great revival in the study of the Roman law as embodied in the Justinian code , and in the course of a century or two this became either the groundwork or a strong modifying element in the law systems of almost all the peoples of Europe . What took place may be illustrated by reference to the fate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spain . As the barbarian tongues , after maintaining a place in those countries for two or three centuries , at length gave place to the superior Latin , which became the basis of the new Romance languages , so now in the thnnain of law the barbarian maxims and customs , though holding their place more persistently , likewise finally give way , almost everywhere antl in a greater or less degree , to the more excellent law system of the Empire . Rome must fulfill her destiny and give laws to the nations . CHAPTER XL THE ROMAN EMPIRE IN THE EAST 507 . The Era of Justinian ( A.D. 527-565 ) .  --  During the fifty years immediately following the fall of Rome , the Eastern emperors struggled hard and sometimes doubtfully to withstand the waves of the barbarian inundation which constantly threatened to overwhelm Constantinople with the same awful calamities that had befallen the Imperial City of the West . Had the New Rome ? the destined refuge for a thousand years of Greco-Roman learning and culture ? also gone down at this time before the storm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been incalculable . Fortunately , in the year 527 , there ascended the Eastern throne a prince of unusual ability , to whom fortune gave a general of such rare genius that his name has been allotted a place in the short list of the great commanders of the world . Justinian was the name of the prince , and Belisarius that of the soldier . The sovereign has given name to the period , which is called after him the " Era of Justinian . " 508 . Justinian as the Restorer of the Empire and " The Lawgiver of Civilization " ; Calamities of his Reign . One of the most important matters in the reign of Justinian is what is termed the " Imperial Restoration , " by which is meant the recovery from the barbarians of several of the provinces of the West upon which they had seized . Africa , as we have seen ( sec. 477 ) , was first wrested from the Vandals . Italy was next recovered from the Goths and again made a part of the Roman Empire ( A.D. 553 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who bore the title of Exarch . Besides recovering Africa and Italy from the barbarians , Justinian also reconquered from the Visigoths the southeastern part of Spain . But that which gives Justinian 's reign a greater distinction than any conferred upon it by the achievements of his generals was 358 // the collection and publication by him of the Corpus Jur 's Civilis , the " Body of the Roman Law . " This work embodied all the law knowledge of the ancient Romans , and was the most precious legacy of Rome to the world.i In causing its publication Justinian earned the title of " The Lawgiver of Civilization . " Although the reign of Justinian was in many respects auspicious and brilliant , still it was for the Empire a time of almost unparalleled woes and sufferings . Among the calamitous events of the period a prominent place must be given the seditions at Constantinople and the attendant destruction of property and loss of life . The parties or factions indulging in these disorders rose out of the chariot races of the circus . These games possessed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such as the gladiatorial spectacles had had for the debased multitudes of Old Rome . The people became divided into two leading factions , known as the Blues and the Greens . These factions carried their rivalries into all the relations of life , political and religious . Often they indulged in unseemly disturbances in the circus , even in the presence of the Emperor himself . In the year 532 there broke out what is known as the " Nika " riot , during which a large part of the city was reduced to ashes . The mob was finally enticed // within the Hippodrome , where it was set upon by the soldiers of Belisarius and thirty-five thousand of the rioters were slain . In the year 542 an awful pestilence , bred probably in Egypt , fell upon the Empire and did not wholly cease its ravages until about fifty years later . This plague was the most terrible scourge of which history has any knowledge , save perhaps the so-called Black Death , which afflicted Europe in the fourteenth century ( sec. 626 ) . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population of the Empire . 509 . The Reign of Heraclius ( A.D. 6 r o ? 64 ) . ? For half a century after the death of Justinian the annals of the Eastern Roman Empire are unimportant . Then we reach the reign of Ieraclius , a prince about whose worthy name gather matters of significance in world history . About this time Chosroes If , king of Persia , wrested from the hands of the Eastern emperors the fortified cities that guarded the Euphratean frontier and overran all Syria , Egypt , and Asia Minor . For many years Heraclius battled heroically for the integrity of the Empire . The struggle between the two rivals was at last decided by a terrible combat known as the battle of Nineveh ( A.D. 627 ) . The Persian army was almost annihilated . Grief or violence ended the life of Chosroes . With his successor , Heraclius negotiated a treaty which restored the earlier boundaries of the Roman dominions . A few years after this the Arabs , of whom we shall tell in the following chapter , entered upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time completely changed the face of the entire East . Heraclius himself lived to see ? so cruel are the vicissitudes of fortune ? the very provinces which he had recovered from the fire worshipers in the possession of the followers of the Arabian Prophet . The conquests of the Arabs cut off from the Empire those provinces that had the smallest Greek element , and thus rendered the population subject to the Emperor more homogeneous , more thoroughly Greek . ' The Roman element disappeared , and though the government still retained the imperial character impressed // upon it by the conquerors of the world , the court of Constantinople became Creek in tone , spirit , and manners . Hence , instead of longer applying to the Empire the designation Roman , many historians from this on call it the Greek co Byzantine Empire . 51o . Services rendered European Civilization by the Roman Empire in the East . ' ? The later Roman Empire rendered such eminent services to the European world that it justly deserves an important place in universal history . First , as a military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thousand years against Asiatic barbarism . Second , it was the keeper for centuries of the treasures of ancient civilization and the instructor of the new Western nations in law , in government and administration , in literature , in painting , in architecture , and in the industrial arts . Third , it kept alive the imperial idea and principle , and gave this fruitful idea and this molding principle back to the West in the time of Charlemagne . Without the later Roman Empire of the Ifast there would never have been a Romano-German Empire of the West ( se ( . 532 ) . fourth , it was the teacher of religion and civilization to the Slavic tames of Eastern Europe . Russia forms part of the civilized world to-day largely by virtue of what she received from New Rome . CHAPTER XLI THE RISE OF ISLAM 511 . The Attack from the South upon Ancient Civilization . ? We have seen the German barbarians of the North descend upon and wrest from the Roman Empire all its provinces in the West . We are now to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arabs of the South , and to see wrested from the emperors of the East a large part of the lands still remaining under their rule ) . 512 . The Arabs . ? The Arabs , or Saracens , who are now about to play their surprising part in history , are , after the Hebrews and the Phoenicians , the most important people of the Semitic race . They are divided into two distinct classes , ? dwellers in towns and dwellers in tents . It is to the latter class alone that the term Bedouins is properly applied . Secure in their inaccessible deserts , the Arabs have never as a nation bowed their necks to a foreign conqueror , although portions of the Arabian peninsula have been repeatedly subjugated by different invaders . 513 . The Religious Condition of Arabia before Mohammed . ? Before the reforms of Mohammed the Arabs were idolaters . Their holy city was Mecca . Here was the ancient and most revered shrine of the Kaaba , ' where was preserved a sacred black stone that was believed to have been given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pilgrimages were made from the most remote parts of Arabia . But though polytheism was the prevailing religion of Arabia , still there were in the land many followers of other faiths . The Jews especially were to be found in some parts of the peninsula in great numbers , having been driven from Palestine by the Roman persecutions . From them the Aral ) teachers had been // made acquainted with the doctrine of one sole God . From the numerous Christian converts dwelling among them they had learned something of the doctrines of Christianity . It was from the Jews and Christians , doubtless , that Mohammed learned many of the doctrines that he taught . 514 . Mohammed. ? Mohammed , the great Prophet of the Arabs , was born in the holy city of Mecca , probably in the year A.D. 570 . He sprang from the distinguished tribe of the Koreish , the custodians of the sacred shrine of the Kaaba . In his early years he was a shepherd and a watcher of flocks by night , as the great religious teachers Moses and David @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a camel driver . Mohammed possessed a soul that was early and deeply stirred by the contemplation of those themes that ever attract the religious mind . He declared that he had visions in which the angel Gabriel appeared to him and made to him revelations which he was commanded to make known to his fellow-men . The starting point of the new faith which he was to teach was this : There is but one God , and Mohammed is his Prophet . For a long time Mohammed endeavored to gain adherents merely by persuasion ; but such was the incredulity which he 3 64 THE RISE OF ISLAM everywhere met that at the end of three years of apostolic labors his disciples numbered only forty persons . 515 . The Hegira ( A.D. 622 ) . ? The teachings of Mohammed at last aroused the anger of a powerful party among the Koreish , and they began to persecute him and his followers . To escape these persecutions Mohammed fled to the neighboring city of Medina . This I-A ira , or Flight , as the word signifies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moslems as such an important event in the history of their religion that they adopted it as the beginning of a new era , and from it still continue to reckon historical dates . 516 . Mohammed at Medina ; Beginning of the Holy Wars of Islam . ? At this time Medina was merely a cluster of clan villages on an oasis of the desert . Bitter feuds divided the clans , and the community was in a state of genuine Arab anarchy . Mohammed at once assumed the functions of an arbiter and lawgiver . He framed for the community a remarkable charter or constitution , which united the warring clans into a little commonwealth , ? the nucleus of the great Arabian Empire . His government was a theocracy , like that of ancient Israel . Mohammed was not now , as while at Mecca , simply a prophet , but a legislator , judge , and king . As chief or king , Mohammed , like his prototype David , planned and led border raids and military campaigns . The year after the Hegira he sent out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make it a prize . This was in strict accord with Arab rule and custom , for the Korcish in expelling Mohammed from Mecca and in attempting to kill him had established a state of war between him and themselves . This marauding soon led to a pitched battle ( the so-called battle of Bedr , A.D. 624 ) between the Meccans and the followers of Mohammed , which resulted in a signal victory for the Moslems . This was the beginning of the holy wars of Islam . ' // 517 . Capture of Mecca ; Arabia acknowledges Mohammed as a True Prophet . ? In the tenth year of the Hegira , the Meccans having violated a truce which they had entered into with the new state at Medina , Mohammed at the head of an army of ten thousand Bedouins marched against Mecca and captured the city almost without a blow . The Arabian tribes now almost unanimously turned to lvlohanuned as a true prophet , and he who had been once rejected now became the spiritual and military head of the innumerable Arab clans , whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mighty brotherhood and nation . The same year that marks the capture of Mecca by Mohammed marks also his death . He was buried at Medina , and his tomb there is to-day a most sacred place of pilgrimage for the Moslem world . 518 . The Origin of the Koran . ? Before going on to trace the conquests of the successors of Mohammed , we must try to form some idea of the religion of the great Prophet . The doctrines of Mohammedanism , or Islam , which means ? ' submission to God , " are contained in the Koran , which is believed by the orthodox to have been written from all eternity on tablets in heaven . Eton ' time to time the apostle recited ' to his disciples portions of the " heavenly book " as its contents were revealed to him in his dreams and visions . These communications were held in the " breasts of men , " or were written down upon bones , pieces of pottery , and the ribs of palm leaves . Soon after the death of the Prophet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tradition , and then arranged chiefly according to length . Thus came into existence the sacred book of Islam . 519 . The Teachings of the Koran . ? The fundamental doctrine of Islam is the unity of God : " ' There is no God save Allah " echoes through the Koran . To this is added the equally binding declaration that " Mohammed is the Prophet of Allah . " The Koran inculcates four cardinal virtues . The first of these is prayer : five times every day must the believer turn his face // towards Mecca and pray . The second is almsgiving . The third is keeping the fast of Ramadan , which lasts a whole month . The fourth duty is making a pilgrimage to Mecca . Every person who can possibly do so is required to make this journey . To the faithful the Koran promises a heaven filled with every sensual delight , with flowers and fruits and bright-eyed maidens ( houris ) of ravishing beauty , and threatens unbelievers and the doers of evil with the torments of a hell filled with every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conquest of Persia , Syria , Egypt , and North Africa . ? For exactly one century after the death of Mohammed the caliphs or successors of the Prophet ' were engaged in an almost unbroken series of conquests . Persia was subjugated and the authority of the Koran was established throughout the land of the ZendAvesta . Syria was wrested from the Eastern Roman Empire and Asia Minor was overrun . Egypt and North Africa , the latter just recently delivered from the Vandals , were also snatched from the hands of the Byzantine emperors . By the conquest of Persia Zoroastrianism , a religion with a great past , was , as a force in history , destroyed . ' By the conquest of Syria the birthplace of Christianity was lost to the Christian world . By the conquest of North Africa lands whose history for a thousand years had been intertwined with that of the opposite shores of Europe , and which at one time seemed destined to share in the career of freedom and progress opening to the peoples of that continent , were drawn back into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From being an extension of Europe they became once more an extension of Asia . 521 . Attacks upon Constantinople . ? Thus in only a little more than fifty years from the death of Mohammed his standard had been carried by the lieutenants of his successors through Asia to the Hellespont on the one side and across Africa to the Straits of Gibraltar on the other . We may expect to see the Saracens at one or both of these points attempt the invasion of Europe . The first attempts were made in the East , where the Arabs repeatedly endeavored , but without success , to wrest Constantinople from the hands of the Eastern emperors . The check that the Saracens received before Constantinople was doubtless next in importance for European civilization to the check given their conquering hordes a little later in France at the great battle of Tours . 522 . The Conquest of Spain ( A.D. 711 ) . ? While the Moslems were thus being repulsed from Europe at its eastern extremity , the gates of the continent were opened to them legend says by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foothold in Spain . At , the great battle of Xeres ( : v.o. 7 i 1 ) the last of the Visigothic kings was hopelessly defeated , and all the peninsula save some mountainous regions in the northwest quickly submitted to the invaders . By this conquest some of the fairest provinces of Spain were lost to Christendom for a period of eight hundred years . No sooner had the subjugation of the country been effected than multitudes of colonists from Arabia , Syria , and North Africa crowded into the peninsula , until in a short time the provinces of Seville , Cordova , Toledo , and Granada became predominantly Arabic in dress , manners , language , and religion . 523 . Invasion of France ; Battle of Tours ( A.D. 732 ) . ? Four or five years after the conquest of Spain the Saracens crossed the Pyrenees and established themselves upon the plains of Gaul . This advance of the Moslem host beyond the northern wall of Spain was viewed with the greatest alarm by all Christendom . It looked as though the followers of Mohammed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , the Crescent , lying in a 36S THE RISE OF ISLAM vast semicircle upon the northern shore of Africa and the curving coast of Asia , with one horn touching the Bosporus and the other the Straits of Gibraltar , seemed about to round to the full and overspread all Europe . In the year 732 , just one hundred years after the death of the Prophet , the Franks , under their leader Charles Martel , and their allies met the Moslems upon the plains of Tours in the center of ( maul and committed to the issue of a single battle the fate of Christendom and the future course of history . The Arabs suffered an overwhelming defeat and soon withdrew behind the Pyrenees . The young Christian civilization of Western Europe was thus delivered from an appalling danger such as had not threatened it since the fearful days of Attila and the Huns. 524 . Golden Age of the Caliphate at Bagdad . ? For about thirty years after the death of Mohammed , Medina continued to be the capital of the Arabian Empire ; then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century , ' after which , a new dynasty arising , a new capital , Bagdad , was founded on the Lower Tigris , in ancient Babylonia . The golden age of the caliphate of Bagdad covered the latter part of the eighth and the ninth century of our era , and was illustrated by the reigns of such princes as Al-Mansur ( A.n . 754 ? 775 ) and the renowned Harun-al-Rashid Gm ) . 786 So9 ) . During this period science and philosophy and literature were most assiduously cultivated by the Arabian scholars , and the court of the caliphs presented in culture and luxury a striking contrast to the rude and barbarous courts of the kings and princes of Western Christendom . 525 . The Dismemberment of the Caliphate . ? " At the close of the first century of the Hegira , " writes Gibbon , " the caliphs // were the most potent and absolute monarchs of the globe . " But in a short time their extended empire , through the quarrels of sectaries and the ambitions of rival aspirants for the honors of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three capitals ? from Bagdad upon the Tigris , from Cairo upon the Nile , and from Cordova upon the Guadalquivir were issued the commands of three rival caliphs , each of whom was regarded by his adherents as the sole rightful spiritual and civil successor of Mohammed . All , however , held the great Prophet in the same reverence , all maintained with equal zeal the sacred character of the horan , and all prayed with their faces turned toward the holy city of Mecca . 526 . The Civilization of Arabian Islam . ? The Saracens were coheirs of antiquity with the Germans . They made especially their own the scientific s accumulations of the ancient civilizations and bequeathed them to Christian Europe . These elements of civilization they added to and enriched , and in several of the countries of which they took possession , especially in Babylonia and in Spain , there developed a civilization which in some respects far surpassed any that the world had yet seen . The Moslem law system , the basis of which is found in the Koran , is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and regulations that any race or civilization has developed . Since the system embraces religious as well as civil matters , it is in some respects like the Mosaic code , from which it freely borrowed . In the lighter forms of literature ? romance and poetry the Arabs produced much that possesses a high degree of excellence . The inimitable talcs of the Arabian Nights , besides being a valuable commentary on Arabian life and manners at the time of the culmination of Oriental culture at the court of Bagdad , forms also an addition to the imperishable portion of the literature of the world . The physical sciences were also pursued by the Arabian scholars with great eagerness and with considerable success . From the // Greeks and the Hindus they received the germs of astronomy , geometry , arithmetic , algebra , medicine , botany , and other sciences . Almost all of the sciences that thus came into their hands were improved and enriched by them , and then transmitted to European scholars.10 They made medicine for the first time a true science . They devised and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arabic or decimal system of notation . " All this literary and scientific activity naturally found expression in the establishment of schools , universities , and libraries . In all the great cities of the Arabian Empire , as at Bagdad , Cairo , and Cordova , centuries before Europe could boast anything beyond cathedral or monastic schools , great universities were drawing together vast crowds of eager young Moslems and creating an atmosphere of learning and refinement . The famous university at Cairo , which has at the present day an attendance of several thousand students , is a survival from the great days of Arabian Islam . In the erection of mosques and other public edifices the Arab architects developed a new and striking style of architecture , ? some of the most beautiful specimens of which are preserved to us at Cordova and Granada , in Spain , ? a style which has given to modern builders some of their finest models . 527 . The Evil and the Good in Islam . ? In some of its teachings and institutions Islam is a system unfavorable to social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12 and places no restraint upon divorce , thus destroying the sacredness of family life . In authorizing the faithful to make slaves of their captives in holy wars , it legalizes slavery ; Mohammedan countries are the // main strongholds of slavery at the present time . It also fosters religious intolerance ; the Moslem is forbidden by his religion to grant equality to unbelievers . Islam , however , inculcates many inspiring truths and recommends some great virtues . Like Christianity , it teaches the unity of God , immortality , and rewards and punishments after death . These doctrines render it immeasurably superior to fetichism or to polytheism , and have made it a great force for the uplift of multitudes of idolatrous tribes in Asia and Africa . Among the leading virtues inculcated by Islam is that of temperance . The Koran forbids positively to the believer the use of wine and inferentially of all strong drinks . To this prohibition is attributable the fact that drunkenness is less common and open in Mohammedan than in Christian lands . Finally , in forming our estimate of Islam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held and practiced by many Mohammedan peoples to-day is a very degenerate form of the Islamic faith when cnmlrued with that held and practiced by the Arabs nu , ng huni it lirst arose . Mohammedanism , like Christianity , was at its best iii what we may call its Apostolic Age . CHAPTER XL , II CHARLEMAGNE AND THE RESTORATION OF THE EMPIRE IN THE WEST 528 . Introductory . ? We return now to the West . The Franks , who with the aid of their confederates withstood the Saracens on the field of lours and saved Europe from subjection to the Koran , are the people that first attract our attention . Charlemagne , or Charles the Great , their king , is the imposing figure that moves amidst all the events of the times , indeed , is the one who makes the events and renders the period an epoch in universal history . The story of this era affords the key to very much of the subsequent history of Western Europe . The mere enumeration of the events which are to claim our attention will illustrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how the mayors of the palace of the Merovingian princes became the actual kings of the Franks how , through the liberality of the Frankish kings , the popes laid the foundations of their temporal sovereignty ; and how Charlemagne restored the Roman Empire in the West , and throughout its extended limits , in the fusion of things Roman and things Germanic , laid the basis of modern civilization . 529 . How Duke Pippin became King of the Franks ( A.D. 7 5 1 ) . ? Charles Martel , who saved the Christian civilization of Western Europe on the field of Tours , although the real head of the Frankish nation , was nominally only an officer of the Merovingian court ( sec. 478 ) . He died without ever having borne the title of king , notwithstanding he had exercised all the authority of that office . But Charles ' son , Pippin III , aspired to the regal title and honors . He resolved to depose his titular master and to make himself king . Not deeming it wise , however , to do this without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to represent to him 372 // the state of affairs and to solicit his advice . Mindful of recent Iavors that he had received at the hands of Pippin , the Pope gave his approval to the proposed change by replying that it seemed altogether reasonable that the one who was king in reality should be king also in name . This was sufficient . Childeric ? such was the name of the Merovingian king ? was straightway deposed , and Pippin , whose own deeds together with those of his illustrious father had . done so much for the Frankish nation and for Christendom , was crowned king of the Franks , and thus became the first of the Carolingian line , the name of his illustrious son Charles ( Charlemagne ) giving name to the house . 530 . Pippin helps to establish the Temporal Power of the Popes ( A.n . 756 ) . ? In the year A.D. 754 Pope Stephen l.l , troubled by the king of the Lombards , besought Pippin 's aid against the barbarian . Pippin , quick to return the favor which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ securing of his crown , straightway interposed in behalf of the Pope . Ile descended into Italy with an army , expelled the Lombards from their recent conquests , and male a donation to the Pope of the regained lands ( A.U. 756 ) . As it symbol of the gift he laid the keys of Ravenna , Rimini , and of many other cities on the tomb of St. Peter . This endowment may be regarded as having practically laid the basis of the temporal sovereignty of the popes ; for although Pope Stephen , as it seems , had already resolved to cast off allegiance to the Eastern Emperor and set up an independent Church state , still it is not probable that he could have carried out such an enterprise successfully had he not been aided in his project by the Frankish king . 531 . Accession of Charlemagne ; his Wars . ? Pippin died in the year 768 , and his kingdom passed into the hands of his two sons , Carloman and Charles , the latter being better known by the name he achieved of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years after the accession of the brothers Carloman died , and Charles took possession of his dominions. // During his long reign of nearly half a century Charlemagne so extended the boundaries of his dominions that they came to embrace the larger part of Western Europe . He made over fifty military campaigns , among which were those against the Lombards , the Saracens , and the Saxons . Among the first undertakings of Charlemagne was a campaign against the Lombards , whose king , Desiderius , was troubling the Pope . Charlemagne wrested from Desiderius all his possessions , shut up the unfortunate king in a monastery , and placed on his own head the famous " Iron Crown " of the Lombards ( sec. 479 ) . In the year 778 Charlemagne gathered his warriors for a crusade against the Mohammedan Moors in Spain . He crossed the Pyrenees and succeeded in winning from the Moslems all the northeastern corner of the peninsula . These lands thus regained for Christendom he made a part of his dominions , under the title of the Spanish March . ' But by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directed against the still pagan Saxons . These people were finally reduced to permanent submission and forced to accept Charlemagne as their sovereign and Christianity as their religion . 532 . Restoration of the Empire in the West ( A.D. 800 ) . ? An event of seemingly little moment , yet in its influence upon succeeding affairs of the very greatest importance , now claims our attention . Pope Leo III having called upon Charlemagne for aid against a hostile faction at Rome , the king soon appeared in person at the capital and punished the disturbers of the peace of the Church . The gratitude of Leo led him at this time to make a most signal return for the many services of the Frankish king . To understand his act a word of explanation is needed . For a considerable time a variety of circumstances had been fostering a growing feeling of enmity between the Italians and // the emperors at Constantinople . Just at this time , by the crime of the Empress Irene , who had deposed her son , Constantine VI , and put out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Byzantine throne was vacant , in the estimation of the Italians , who contended that the crown of the Cmsars could not be worn by a woman . In view of these circumstances Pope Leo and those about him conceived the purpose of taking away from the heretical and effeminate Greeks the imperial crown and bestowing it upon some strong and orthodox and worthy prince in the West . Now among all the Teutonic chiefs of Western Christendom there was none who could dispute in claims to the honor with the king of the Franks , the representative of a most illustrious house and the strongest champion of the young Christianity of the West against her pagan foes . Accordingly , as Charlemagne was participating in the solemnities of Christmas Day in the basilica of St. Peter at Rome , the Pope approached the kneeling king , and placing a crown of gold upon his head proclaimed him Emperor and Augustus ( A.D. 800 ) . The intention of Pope Leo was , by a sort of reversal of the act of Constantine the ( ; ream , to bring back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he really accomplished was a restoration of the line of emperors in the West , which three hundred and twenty-four years before had been ended by Odoacer ( sec. 445 ) . We say this was what he actually effected ; for the Greeks of the East , disregarding wholly what the Roman people and the Pope had done , maintained their line of emperors just as though nothing had occurred in Italy . So now from this time on for centuries there were , most of the time , two emperors , one in the East and another in the West , each claiming to be the rightful successor of Cmsar Augustus . ' // This revival of the Empire in the West was one of the most important matters in European history . It gave to the following centuries " a great political ideal , " which was the counterpart of the religious ideal of a universal Church embodied in the Papacy , and which was to shape large sections of mediaeval history . 533 . Charles the Great as a Ruler . ? Charlemagne must not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was that which he effected as a legislator and administrator . He ruled his Empire with the constant solicitude of a father . The character of his government is revealed by his celebrated Capitularies . These were not laws proper , but collections of decrees , decisions , and instructions covering matters of every kind , civil and religious , public and domestic . They show what were Charlemagne 's ideas of what his chiefs or his subjects needed in the way of advice , suggestion , or command . Charlemagne , particularly after his coronation as Emperor , exercised as careful a superintendence over religious as over civil affairs . He called synods or councils of the clergy of his dominions , presided at these meetings , and addressed to abbots and bishops fatherly words of admonition , reproof , and exhortation . Education was also a matter to which Charlemagne gave zealous attention . He was himself from first to last as diligent a student as his busy life permitted . He never ceased to be a learner . In his old age he tried to learn to write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the dense ignorance all about him , he labored to instruct his subjects , lay and clerical , by the establishment of schools and the multiplication and dissemination of books through the agency of the copyists of the monasteries . He invited from England the celebrated Alcuin , one of the finest scholars of the age , and with his help organized what became known as the Palace School , in which his children and courtiers and he himself were pupils . 534 . The Death of Charlemagne ( 814 ) ; Results of his Reign .  - -  Charlemagne enjoyed the imperial dignity only fourteen years . He // died in 8r4 . By the almost universal verdict of students of the uiedi ; eval period , he has been pronounced the most imposing personage that appears between the fall of Rome and the fifteenth century . His greatness has erected an enduring monument for itself in his name , the one by which he is best known , Charlemagne . Among the results of the reign of Charlemagne we should note at least the two following . First , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this barbarian land within the pale of civilization and made it a part of the new-forming RomanoGerman world . Second , he kneaded into something like a homogeneous mass the various racial elements composing the mixed society of the wide regions over which he ruled . Throughout his long and vigorous reign that fusion of Roman and Teuton of which we spoke in an earlier chapter went on apace . He failed indeed to unite the various races of his extended dominions in a permanent political union , but he did notch to create among them those religious , intellectual , and social bonds which were never afterwards severed ... From his time on , as it has been concisely expressed , there was a Western Christendom . 535 . Division of the Empire ; the Treaty of Verdun ( 843 ) .  --  Like the kingdom of Alexander and that of many another great conqueror , the mighty empire of Charlemagne fell to pieces soon after his death . His scepter was the bow of Ulysses , which could not be drawn by any weaker hand . " Charlemagne ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 814-84o ) . Upon his death fierce contention broke out afresh among his surviving sons , Lewis , Charles , and Lothair , and myriads of lives were sacrificed in the unnatural strife . Finally , by the famous Treaty of Verdun ( 843 ) , the Empire was divided as follows : to Lewis was given the part east of the Rhine , the nucleus of the later Germany ; to Charles , the part west of the Rhone and the Meuse , one day to become France ; and to Lothair , the narrow central strip between these , stretching across Europe from the North Sea to the Mediterranean , and including // the rich lands of the lower Rhine , the valley of the Rhone , and the larger part of Italy . To Lothair also was given the imperial title . This treaty is celebrated , not only because it was the first great treaty among the European states , but also on account of its marking the divergence from one another , and in some sense the origin , of two of the great nations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France . As shown by the celebrated bilingual oath of Strassburg , 4 there had by this time grown up in Gaul , through the mixture of the provincial Latin with German elements , a new speech , which was to grow into the li rench tongue , ? the firstborn of the Romance languages . ' In the year 962 a strong king of Germany , Otto the Great , again revived the Empire , which now came to be called the Holy Roman Empire .

Northmen , Norsemen , Scandinavians are different names applied in a general way to the early inhabitants of Denmark , Norway , and Sweden . For the reason that those making settlements in England came for the most part from Denmark , the term Danes is often used with the same wide application by the English writers . These people formed the northern branch of the Teutonic family . For the first eight centuries of our era the Norsemen are practically hidden from our view in their remote northern home ; but towards the end of the eighth century their black piratical crafts are to be seen creeping along the coasts of Britain , Ireland , and Gaul , and even venturing far up the inlets and creeks . Soon all the shores of the countries visited were dotted with their stations and settlements . With a foothold once secured , fresh bands came , and the stations in time grew into permanent colonies . These marauding expeditions and colonizing enterprises did not cease till late in the eleventh century . // The most noteworthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laid aside their own manners , habits , ideas , and institutions , and adopted those of the country in which they established themselves .

Iceland was settled by the-Northmen in the ninth century , ' and about a century later Greenland was discovered and colonized . In 1874 the Icelanders celebrated the thousandth anniversary of the settlement of their island , an event very like our Centennial of 1876 . America was reached by the Northmen as early as the opening of the eleventh century ; the " Vinland " of their traditions was probably some part of the . New England coast . Whether these first visitors to the continent ever made any settlements in the new land is a disputed question . 538 . The Norsemen in Russia . While the Norwegians were sailing boldly out into the Atlantic and taking possession of the isles and coasts of the western seas , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Finns and Slays on the eastern shore of that sea . Either by right of conquest or through the invitation of the contentious Slavonic clans , the renowned Scandinavian chieftain Rurik acquired , about the middle of the ninth century , kingly dignity , and became the founder of the first royal line of Russia . 539 . The Danish Conquest of England .  --  The Danes began to make descents upon the English coast toward the close of the eighth century . They were not content with plunder , but , being pagans , took special delight in burning the churches and monasteries of the now Christian Anglo-Saxons , or English , as we shall // hereafter call them . In a short time fully one half of England was in their hands . Just when it began to look as though the hard-pushed English would be wholly enslaved or driven from the island by the heathen intruders , Alfred ( 871-901 ) , later to be known as Alfred the Great , ' came to the throne of Wessex . He finally gained some advantage over the Danes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and by the celebrated Treaty of Wedmore ( 878 ) gave up to them all the northeastern part of England . For a full century following the death of Alfred his successors were engaged in a constant struggle to hold in restraint the Danes already settled in the land , or to protect their domains from fresh invasions . In the end the Danes got the mastery , and Canute , king of Denmark , became king of England ( 1(3,16) . For eighteen years he reigned in a wise and parental way . Altogether the Danes ruled in England about a quarter of a century , and then the old English line was restored in the person of Edward the Confessor ( 1042 ) . 540 . Settlement of the Northmen in Gaul . ? The Northmen begun to make piratical descents upon the coasts of Gaul before the end of the reign of Charlemagne . The great king had been dead only thirty years when these sea rovers ascended the Seine and sacked Paris ( 845 ) . At last the Carolingian king , Charles the Simple , did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Channel only a short time before . He granted to Rollo , the leader of the Northmen who had settled at Rouen , a large section of country in the north of Gaul , upon condition of homage and conversion ( 912 ) . In a short time the newcomers had adopted the language , the manners , and the religion of the // French , and had caught much of their vivacity and impulsiveness , without , however , any loss of their own native virtues . This transformation in them we may conceive as being recorded in their transformed name ,  --  Northmen becoming softened into Norman . 541 . Normandy in French History . ? The establishment of a Scandinavian settlement in Gaul proved a momentous matter , not only for the history of the French people , but for the history of European civilization as well . This Norse factor was destined to be one of the most important of all those various racial elements which on the soil of the old Gaul blended to create the richly dowered French nation . For many of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the adventurous spirit of the descendants of these wild rovers of the sea . The knights of Normandy lent an added splendor to French knighthood , and helped greatly to make France the hearth of chivalry and the center of the crusading movement of the eleventh and twelfth centuries . Nor was the influence of the incoming of the Scandinavian race felt upon French history alone . Normandy became the point of departure of enterprises that had deep and lasting consequences for Europe at large . These undertakings had for their arena England and the Mediterranean lands . Their results were so important and far-reaching that we shall devote to the narration of them a subsequent chapter ( Chapter ) ( I.V ) . SECOND PERIOD ? THE AGE OF REVIVAL ( From the Opening of the Eleventh Century to the Discovery of America by Columbus in 1492 ) CHAPTER XLIV FEUDALISM AND CHIVALRY I. FEUDALISM 542 . Feudalism defined . ? Feudalism is the name given to a special form of society and government , based upon a peculiar tenure of land , which prevailed in Europe during the latter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its most perfect development in the eleventh , twelfth , and thirteenth centuries . A feudal estate , which might embrace a few acres or an entire province , was called a Ai , or feud , whence the term Feudalism . The person granting a fief was called the suzerain , liege , or lard ; the one receiving it , his vassal , licgen/an , or retainer . 543 . The Ideal System . ? The few definitions given above will render intelligible the following explanation of the theory of the feudal system . In theory all the kings of the earth were vassals of the Emperor , who according to good imperialists was God 's vassal , and according to good churchmen , the Pope 's . The kings received their dominions as fiefs to be held on conditions of loyalty to their suzerain and of fealty to right and justice . Should a king become disloyal , or rule unjustly or wickedly , through such misconduct he forfeited his fief , and it might be taken from him by his suzerain and given to another worthier liegernan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fief from the Emperor , so might he grant it out in parcels to his chief men , they , in return for it , promising , in general , to be faithful to him as their lord , and to serve and aid him . In like manner these immediatevassals of the king , or suzerain , might parcel out their doinainS in 383 // smaller tracts to others , on conditions similar to those upon which they had themselves received theirs ; and so on down through any number of stages . We have thus far dealt only with the soil of a country . We must next notice what disposition was made of the people under this system . The king on receiving his fief was intrusted with sovereignty over all persons living upon it ; he became their commander , their lawmaker , and their judge , ? practically , their absolute , irresponsible ruler . Then , when he parceled out his fief among his great men , he invested them , within the limits of the fiefs granted , with all his own sovereign rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ domain . And when these great vassals subdivided their fiefs and granted portions of them to others , they in turn invested their vassals with more or less of those powers of sovereignty with which they themselves had been clothed . ' To illustrate the workings of the system , we will suppose the king or suzerain to be in need of an army . He calls upon his own immediate vassals for aid ; these in turn call upon their vassals ; and so the order runs down through the various ranks of retainers . The retainers in the lowest rank rally around their respective lords , who , with their bands , gather about their lords , and so on up through the rising tiers of the system , until the immediate vassals of the suzerain , or chief lord , present themselves before him with their graduated trains of followers . The array constitutes a feudal army , ? a splendidly organized body in theory , but in fact an , extremely poor instrument for warfare . Such was the ideal feudal state . it is needless to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system simply made more or less distant approaches to it in the several European countries . 544 . The Ceremony of Homage . ? A fief was conferred by a very solemn and peculiar ceremony called homage . The person // about to become a vassal , kneeling with uncovered head , placed his hands in those of his future lord and solemnly vowed to be henceforth his man and to serve him faithfully even with his life . This part of the procedure , sealed with a kiss , was what properly constituted the ceremony of homage . It was accompanied by an oath of fealty , and the whole was concluded by the act of investiture , whereby the lord put his vassal in actual possession of the land or , by placing in his hand a clod of earth or a twig , symbolized the delivery to him of the estate for which he had just now done homage and sworn fealty . 545 . The Relations of Lord and Vassal . ? In general terms the duty of the vassal was service ; that of the lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vassal , and the one most willingly rendered in a martial age , was military aid . The liegeman must always be ready to follow his lord upon his military expeditions ; but the time of service for one year was usually not more than forty days . He must defend his lord in battle ; if he should be unhorsed , must give him his own animal ; and if he should be made a prisoner , must offer himself as a hostage for his release . He must also give entertainment to his lord and his retinue on their journeys . He was , moreover , under obligation , upon summons , to serve as juror or judge in the lord 's court , and thus aid him in the settlement of disputes between his vassals . Among other incidents attaching to a fief were what were known as reliefs , escheats , and aids . A relief was the name given to the sum of money which an heir upon coming into possession of a fief must pay to the lord of the domain . This was often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the estate for one year . // By escheat was meant the falling back of the fief into the hands of the lord through failure of heirs . If the fief lapsed through disloyalty or other misdemeanor on the part of the vassal , this was known as foifeilure . Aids were sums of money which the lord had a right to demand to enable him to meet unusual expenditures , especially for defraying the expense of knighting his eldest son , for providing a marriage dower for his eldest daughter , and for ransoming his own person from captivity in case he were made a prisoner of war . The chief return that the lord was bound to make to the vassal as a compensation for these various services and rights was justice and protection , ? by no means a small return in an age of turmoil and insecurity . 546 . Serfs and Serfdom .  --  The vassals , or fief holders of various grades , constituted only a small proportion , perhaps five per cent or less , of the population of the countries where feudalism came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agricultural serfs . ' These were the men who actually tilled the soil . just how this servile class arose is not positively known . In some countries at least they seem to have been the lineal descendants of the slaves of Roman times . Their status varied greatly from country to country and from period to period ; that is to say , there came to be many grades of serfs filling the space between the actual slave and the full freeman . Consequently it is impossible to give any general account of the class which can be regarded as a true picture of their actual condition as a body at any given time . The following description must therefore be taken as reflecting their duties and disabilities only in the most general way . The first and most characteristic feature of the condition of the serfs was that they were affixed to the soil . They could not of their own will leave the estate or manor to which they belonged ; // nor , on the other hand , could their lord deprive then of their holdings and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed with it , just like a " rooted tree or stone earth-bound . " Each serf had allotted him by his lord a cottage and a number of acres of land , thirty acres formed a normal holding , consisting of numerous narrow strips scattered about the great open fields of the manor . For these he paid a rent , usually , during the earlier feudal times , in kind and in personal services . The personal services included a certain number of days ' work , usually two or three ( lays each week , on the demesne , that is , the land which the lord had kept in his own hands as a sort of home farm . He must furthermore grind his grain at his lord 's mill , press his grapes at his wine press , bake his bread at his oven , often paying for these services an unreasonable toll . After the serf had rendered to the lord all the rent in kind he owed for his cottage and bit of ground , the remainder of the produce from his fields was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his own . Generally the share was only just sufficient to keep the wolf of hunger from his door . In some countries , upon the death of the serf all that he had became in the eye of the law the property of his lord ; in other lands , again , the lord could take only the best animal or the best implement of the deceased serf . This was called the kcriot . What we have now said will convey some idea of the nature of the relations that existed between the lord and his serf , and will indicate how servile and burdensome was the tenure by which the serf held his cottage and bit of ground . How the serf gradually freed himself from the heavy yoke of his servitude and became a freeman will appear as we advance in our narrative . 547 ? Development of the Feudal System . The development of feudalism as a military system was hastened by the disturbed state of society everywhere during the greater part of the ninth and the tenth century ; for after the death of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as though the world were again falling back into chaos . The bonds of society seemed entirely broken . Every man did that which was right in his own eyes . // To internal disorders were added the invasioiis of the outside barbarians ; for , no longer held in restraint by the strong arm of the great Charles , they had now begun their raids anew . From the north came the Scandinavian pirates to harry the shores of Germany , Gaul , and Britain . The terror which these pagan sea rovers inspired is commemorated by the supplication of the litany of those days : " From the fury of the Northmen , good Lord , deliver us . " From the east came the terrible Hungarians , and by the way of the sea on the south came an equally dreaded foe , the Saracens , who had gained a foothold in Spain and Sicily . It was this anarchical state of things which caused all classes to hasten to enter the feudal system in order to secure the protection which it alone could afford . Kings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they had never parceled out as fiefs , were now led to do so , that their estates might be held by tenants bound to protect them by all the sacred obligations of homage and fealty . Thus sovereigns and princes became suzerains and feudal lords . Again , the smaller proprietors often voluntarily surrendered their little holdings into the hands of some neighboring lord , and then received them back again from him as fiefs , that they might claim protection as vassals . They deemed this better than being robbed of their property altogether . Moreover , for like reasons and in like manner , churches , monasteries , and cities became members of the feudal system . They granted out their vast possessions as fiefs , and thus became suzerains and lords . Bishops and abbots became the heads of great bands of retainers , and often themselves led military expeditions like temporal chiefs . On the other hand , these same monasteries and towns frequently placed themselves under the protection of some powerful lord , and thus came in vassalage to him . Sometimes the bishops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military service , bound themselves to say a certain number of Masses for the lord or his family . In this way were Church and State , all classes of society from the wealthiest suzerain to the humblest vassal , bound together by feudal ties . Everything was impressed with the stamp of feudalism. // 548 . Castles of the Nobles . ? The lawless and violent character of the times during which feudalism prevailed is well shown by the nature of the residences which the great nobles built for themselves . These were strong stone fortresses , often perched upon some rocky eminence and defended by moats and towers . France , Germany , Italy , Northern Spain , England , and Scotland , in which countries the feudal system became most thoroughly developed , fairly bristled with these fortified residences of the nobility . Strong walls were the only protection against the universal violence of the age . One of the most striking and picturesque features of the landscape of many regions in Europe to-day is the ivy-mantled towers and walls of these feudal castles now falling into ruins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Chief among the various causes which undermined and at length overthrew feudalism were the hostility of the kings to the system , the Crusades , the growth of the cities , and the introduction of firearms in the art of war . The kings opposed the system and sought to break it down , because it left them only the semblance of power . We shall see later how the kings came again to their own ( Chapter LII ) . The // Crusades , or Holy Wars , that agitated all Europe during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries did much to weaken the power of the nobles for in order to raise money for their expeditions they frequently sold or mortgaged their estates , and in this way power and influence passed into the hands of the kings or the wealthy merchants of the cities . Many of the great nobles also perished in battle with the infidels , and their lands escheated to their suzerain , whose domains were thus augmented . The growth of the towns also tended to the same end . As they increased in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactions and tyranny of the lord in whose fief they happened to be , and eventually were able to secede , as it were , from his authority , and to make of themselves little republics . Again , improvements and changes in the mode of warfare , especially those resulting from the use of gunpowder , hastened the downfall of feudalism by rendering the yeoman foot soldier equal to the armor-clad knight . " It made all men of the same height , " as Carlyle puts it . But it is to be carefully noted that , though feudalism as a system of government disappeared , speaking broadly , with the Middle Ages , it still continued to exist as a social organization . The nobles lost their power and authority as petty sovereigns , but retained their titles , their privileges , their social distinction , and , in many cases , their vast landed estates . 550 . Defects of the Feudal System . Feudalism was perhaps the best form of social organization that it was possible to maintain in Europe during the medieval period ; yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faults may be pointed out the two following . First , it rendered impossible the formation of strong national governments . Every country was divided and subdivided into a vast number of practically independent principalities . Thus in the tenth century France was partitioned among about a hundred and fifty overlords , all exercising equal and coordinate powers of sovereignty . The enormous estates of these great lords were again subdivided into about seventy thousand smaller fiefs. // In theory , as we have seen , the holders of these petty estates were bound to serve and obey their overlords , and these great nobles were in turn the sworn vassals of the French king . But many of these lords were richer and stronger than the king himself , and if they chose to cast off their allegiance to him , he found it impossible to reduce them to obedience . The king 's time was chiefly occupied in ineffectual efforts to reduce his haughty and refractory nobles to proper submission , and in intervening feebly to compose their endless quarrels with one another . It is easy to conceive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A second evil of the institution was its exclusiveness . Under the workings of the system society became divided into classes separated by lines which , though not impassable , were yet very rigid , with a proud hereditary aristocracy at its head . It was only as the lower classes in the different countries gradually wrested from the feudal nobility their special and unfair privileges that a better , because more democratic , form of society arose , and civilization began to make more rapid progress . 551 . The Good Results of Feudalism . ? The most conspicuous service that feudalism rendered European civilization was the protection which it gave to society after the break-up of the empire of Charles the Great . " It was the mailed feudal horseman and the impregnable walls of the feudal castle that foiled the attacks of the Danes , the Saracens , and the Hungarians " ( Oman ) . Feudalism rendered another noteworthy service to society in fostering among its privileged members self-reliance and love of personal independence . Turbulent , violent , and refractory as was the feudal aristocracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alive during the later medieval period the spirit of liberty . The feudal lords would not allow themselves to be dealt with arrogantly by their king ; they stood on their rights as freemen . Hence royalty was prevented from becoming as despotic as would otherwise have been the case . Thus , in England , for instance , the feudal lords held such tyrannical rulers as King john in check ( sec. 62o ) , until such time as the yeoman and // the burgher were bold enough and strong enough alone to stand against and to baffle their despotically inclined sovereigns . Another of the good effects of feudalism was the impulse it gave to certain forms of polite literature . Just as learning and philosophy were fostered by the seclusion of the cloister , so were poetry and romance fostered by the open and joyous hospitalities of the baronial hall . The castle door was always open to the wandering singer and story-teller , and it was amidst the scenes of festivity within that the ballads and romances of medieval minstrelsy and literature had their birth . Still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within the baronial castle of those ideas and sentiments ? among others a nice sense of honor and an exalted consideration for woman which found their noblest expression in chivalry , of which institution and its good effects upon the social life of Europe we shall now proceed to speak . II . CHIVALRY 552 . Chivalry defined ; Origin of the Institution . ? Chivalry has been aptly defined as the " Flower of Feudalism . " It was a military institution or order , the members of which , called knights , were pledged to the protection of the Church and to the defense of the weak and the oppressed . The germ out of which chivalry developed seems to have been the body of vassal horsemen which Charles Martel created to repel the raids of the Saracens into Aquitaine after the battle of Tours ' ( sec. 523 ) . It was in these border wars that the Franks learned from the Arab Moors " to put their trust in horses . " From South France this new military system , in which mounted armor-clad warriors largely superseded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development was closely connected with that of feudalism ; indeed , it was the military side of that // development . It became the rule that all fief holders must render military service on horseback . Fighting on horseback gradually became the normal mode and for centuries remained so . Gradually this feudal warrior caste underwent a transformation . It became in part independent of the feudal system , in so far as that had to do with the land , so that any person , if qualified by birth and properly initiated , might be a member of the order without being the holder of a fief . A great part of the later knights were portionless sons of the nobility . At the same time the religious spirit entered the order , and it became a Christian brotherhood , somewhat like the order of the priesthood. 553 . Training of the Knight . ? When chivalry had once become established , all the sons of the nobility , save such as were to enter the holy orders of the Church , were set apart and disciplined for its service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the family of some lord of renown and wealth , whose castle became a sort of school , where they were trained in the duties and exercises of knighthood . This education began at the early age of seven , the youth bearing the name of page or varlet until he attained the age of fourteen , when he acquired the title of squire , or esquire . The lord and his knights trained the boys in manly and martial duties , while the ladies of the castle instructed them in the duties of religion and in all knightly etiquette . The duties of the page were usually confined to the castle , though sometimes he accompanied his lord to the field . The esquire always attended in battle the knight to whom he was attached , carrying his arms and , if need , be , engaging in the fight . 554 . The Ceremony of Knighting . ? At the age of twenty-one the squire became a knight , being then introduced to the order of knighthood by a peculiar and impressive service . After a long fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his duties as a knight . Then kneeling , as in the feudal ceremony of homage , before the lord conducting the services , he vowed to defend religion and the ladies , to succor the distressed , and ever to be faithful to his companion knights . His arms were now given // to him , and his sword was girded on , when the lord , striking him with the flat of his sword on the shoulders , said , " In the name of God , of St. Michael , and of St. George , I dub thee knight ; be brave , bold , and loyal . " 555 . The Tournament . ? The tournament was the favorite amusement of the age of chivalry . It was a mimic battle between two companies of knights , armed usually with pointless swords or blunted lances . In the universal esteem in which the participants were held , it reminds us of the sacred games of the Greeks ; while in the fierce and sanguinary character it often assumed , it recalls the gladiatorial combats of the Roman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century was the evening of chivalry . The decline of the system resulted from the operation of the same causes that effected the overthrow of feudalism . The changes in the mode of warfare which helped to do away with the feudal baron and his mail-clad retainers likewise tended to destroy knight-errantry . And then as civilization advanced , new feelings and sentiments began to claim the attention and to work upon the imagination of men . Governments , too , // became more regular , and the increased order and security of society rendered less needful the services of the gallant knight in behalf of the weak and the oppressed . 557 . The Good in Chivalry . ? Chivalry contributed powerfully to lift that sentiment of respect for the gentler sex which characterized all the northern nations , into that tender veneration of woman which forms the distinguishing characteristic of the present age , and makes it differ from all preceding phases of civilization . Again , chivalry did much to create that ideal of character ? an ideal distinguished by the virtues of courtesy , gentleness , humanity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word ? which we rightly think to surpass any ever formed under the influences of antiquity . Just as Christianity gave to the world an ideal manhood which it was to strive to realize , so ( lid chivalry hold up an ideal to which men were to conform their lives . Men , indeed , have never perfectly realized either the ideal of Christianity or that of chivalry ; but the influence which these two ideals have had in shaping and giving character to the lives of men can not be overestimated . Together , through the enthusiasm and effort awakened for their realization , they have produced a new type of manhood , which we indicate by the phrase " a knightly and Christian character . " a DEN.Ge di/5 9T hl CHAPTER XLV THE NORMAN CONQUEST OF ENGLAND I 558 . Introductory . ? The history of the Normans ? the name , it will be recalled , of the transformed Scandinavians who settled in Northern Gaul ( sec. 54o ) ? is simply a continuation of the story of the Northmen ; and nothing could better illustrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one upon which we have entered , nothing could more strikingly exhibit the gradual transformation that has crept over the face and spirit of European society , than the transformation which time and favoring associations have wrought in these men . When first we met them in the ninth century they were pagans ; now they are Christians . Then they were rough , wild , merciless corsairs ; now they are become the most cultured , polished , and chivalrous people in Europe . But the restless , daring spirit that drove the Norse sea kings forth upon the waves in quest of adventure and booty still stirs in the breasts of their descendants . As has been said , they were simply changed from heathen Vikings , delighting in the wild life of sea rover and pirate , into Christian knights , eager for pilgrimages and crusades. // The most important of the enterprises of the Normans , and one followed by consequences of the greatest magnitude not only to the conquered people but indirectly to the world , was their conquest of England . 559 . Events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ro66 Edward the Confessor , in whose person , it will be recalled , the old English line was restored after the Danish usurpation ( sec. 539 ) , died , and immediately the Witan , ' in accordance with the dying wish of the king , chose Harold , Earl of Wessex , the best and strongest man in all England , to be his successor . When the news of the action of the Witan and of Harold 's acceptance of the English crown was carried across the Channel to William , Duke of Normandy , he was greatly vexed . He declared that Edward , who was his cousin , had during his lifetime promised the throne to him , and that Harold had assented to this , and by solemn oath engaged to sustain him . He now demanded of Harold that he surrender to him the usurped throne , threatening the immediate invasion of the island in case he refused . King Harold answered the demand by collecting an army for the defense of his dominions . Duke William now made ready for a descent upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( i o66 ) . ? The Norman army of invasion landed in the south of England , at the port of Hastings , which place gave name to the battle that almost immediately followed , ? the battle that was to determine the fate of England . It was begun by a horseman riding out from the Norman lines and advancing alone toward the English army , tossing up his sword and skillfully catching it as it fell , and singing all the while the stirring battle song of Charlemagne and Roland . The English watched with astonishment this exhibition of " careless dexterity , " and if they did not contrast the vivacity and nimbleness of the Norman foe with their own heavy and clumsy manners , others at least have not failed to do so . // The battle once joined , the conflict was long and terrific . The day finally went against the English . Harold fell , pierced through the eye by an arrow ; and William was master of the field . He now marched upon London , and at Westminster , on ChristmasDay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Distribution of the Land and the Gemot of Salisbury .  --  Almost the first act of William after he had established his power in England was to fulfill his promise to the nobles who had aided him in his enterprise , by distributing among them the forfeited estates of the English who had fought against him at Hastings . Profiting by the lesson taught by the wretched condition of Prance , which country was kept in a state of constant turmoil by a host of feudal lords , many of whom were almost or quite as powerful as the king himself ( sec. 55o ) , William took care that in the distribution no feudatory should receive an entire shire , save in two or three exceptional cases . To the great lord to whom he must needs give a large fief , he granted not a continuous tract of land , but several estates or manors scattered in different parts of the country , in order that there might be no dangerous concentration of property or power in the hands of the vassal . Another equally important limitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through his requiring all fief holders , great and small , to take an oath of fealty directly to him as overlord . This was a great innovation upon feudal custom , for the rule was that the vassal should swear fealty to his own immediate lord only , and in war follow his banner even against his own king . The oath that William exacted from every fief holder made the allegiance which he owed to his king superior to that which he owed to his own immediate lord . At the great gemot or military assembly of Salisbury in the year ro86 " all the landholders of substance in England " swore to William this solemn oath of superior fealty and allegiance . William also denied to his feudatories the right of coining money and making laws ; and by other wise restrictions upon their power saved England from those endless contentions and petty wars that were distracting almost every other country of Europe . // 562 . Domesday Book . One of the most celebrated acts of the Conqueror was the making of Domesday Book . This famous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of England ,  --  excepting those of some counties , mostly in the north , that were either unconquered or unsettled ; an enumeration of the cattle and sheep ; and statements of the income of every man . It was intended , in a word , to be a perfect survey and census of the entire kingdom . 563 . The Norman Successors of the Conqueror . ? For nearly three quarters of a century after the death of William the Conqueror , England was ruled by Norman kings . ' The latter part of this period was a troublous time . The succession to the crown coming into dispute , civil + , = 1 r tom . war broke out . The result of the . contention was a decline in the royal power , and the ascendancy - of the Norman ) barons , who for a time made England the scene of the same feudal anarchy that prevailed at this time upon the Continent . Finally , in 1 154 , the Norman dynasty gave place to that of the Plantagenets . Under Henry la 0154. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house , and an energetic and strong ruler , the barons were again brought into proper subjection to the crown , and many castles which had been built without royal permission during the // preceding anarchical period , and some of which at least were little better than robbers ' dens , were dismantled and demolished . 564 . Results of the Norman Conquest . ? The most important and noteworthy result of the Conquest was the establishment in England of a strong centralized government . England now became a real kingdom , ? what it had hardly been in more than semblance before . A second result of the Conquest was the founding of a new feudal aristocracy . The Saxon thane was displaced by the Norman baron . This not only introduced a new and more refined element into the social life of England , but it also changed the membership , the temper , and the name of the national assembly , the old English Witan now becoming the Parliament of later times . A third result of the Conquest was the drawing of England into closer relations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her advance in art , science , and general culture was greatly promoted .
