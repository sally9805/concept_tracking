INTRODUCTION Lafcadio Hearn , known to Nippon as Yakumo Koizumi , was born in Leucadia in the Ionian Islands , June 27 , 1850 . His father was an Irish surgeon in the British Army ; his mother was a Greek . Both parents died while Hearn was still a child , and he was adopted by a great-aunt , and educated for the priesthood . To this training he owed his Latin scholarship and , doubtless , something of the subtlety of his intelligence . He soon found , however , that the prospect of an ecclesiastical career was alien from his inquiring mind and vivid temperament , and at the age of nineteen he came to America to seek his fortune . After working for a time as a proof-reader , he obtained employment as a newspaper reporter in Cincinnati . Soon he rose to be an editorial writer , and went in the course of a few years to New Orleans to join the editorial staff of the " Times-Democrat . " Here he lived until 1887 , writing odd fantasies and arabesques for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and publishing several curious little books , among them his " Stray Leaves from Strange Literature , " and his translations from Gautier . In the winter of 1887 he began his pilgrimages to exotic countries , being , as he wrote to a friend , " a small literary bee in search of inspiring honey . " After a couple of years , spent chiefly in the French West Indies , with periods of literary work in New York , he went in 1890 to Japan to prepare a series of articles for a magazine . Here through some deep affinity of mood with the marvelous people of that country he seems suddenly to have felt himself at last at home . He married a Japanese woman ; he acquired Japanese citizenship in order to preserve the succession of his property to his family there ; he became a lecturer in the Imperial University at T=oky=o ; and in a series of remarkable books he made himself the interpreter to the Western World of the very spirit of Japanese life and art . He died there of paralysis of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * * * With the exception of a body of familiar letters now in process of collection , the present volume contains all of Hearn 's writing that he left uncollected in the magazines or in manuscript of a sufficient ripeness for publication . It is worth noting , however , that perfect as is the writing of " Ultimate Questions , " and complete as the essay is in itself , the author regarded it as unfinished , and , had he lived , would have revised and amplified some portions of it . But if this volume lacks the incomparably exquisite touch of its author in its arrangement and revision , it does , nevertheless , present him in all of his most characteristic veins , and it is in respect both to style and to substance perhaps the most mature and significant of his works . In his first days as a writer Hearn had conceived an ideal of his art as specific as it was ambitious . Early in the eighties he wrote from New Orleans in an unpublished letter to the Rev. Wayland D. Ball of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me the future possibilities of a long cherished dream ,  - -  the English realization of a Latin style , modeled upon foreign masters , and rendered even more forcible by that element of strength which is the characteristic of Northern tongues . This no man can hope to accomplish , but even a translator may carry his stones to the master-masons of a new architecture of language . " In the realization of his ideal Hearn took unremitting pains . He gave a minute and analytical study to the writings of such masters of style as Flaubert and Gautier , and he chose his miscellaneous reading with a peculiar care . He wrote again to the same friend : " I never read a book which does not powerfully impress the imagination ; but whatever contains novel , curious , potent imagery I always read , no matter what the subject . When the soil of fancy is really well enriched with innumerable fallen leaves , the flowers of language grow spontaneously . " Finally , to the hard study of technique , to vast but judicious reading , he added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend , Nobushige Amenomori , he wrote in a passage which contains by implication a deep theory not only of literary composition , but of all art :  --  " Now with regard to your own sketch or story . If you are quite dissatisfied with it , I think this is probably due not to what you suppose ,  - -  imperfection of expression ,  - -  but rather to the fact that some latent thought or emotion has not yet defined itself in your mind with sufficient sharpness . You feel something and have not been able to express the feeling -- only because you do not yet quite know what it is . We feel without understanding feeling ; and our most powerful emotions are the most undefinable . This must be so , because they are inherited accumulations of feeling , and the multiplicity of them -- superimposed one over another -- blurs them , and makes them dim , even though enormously increasing their strength .... Unconscious brain work is the best to develop such latent feeling or thought . By quietly writing the thing over and over again , I find that the emotion or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Again , it is often worth while to try to analyze the feeling that remains dim . The effort of trying to understand exactly what it is that moves us sometimes proves successful .... If you have any feeling -- no matter what -- strongly latent in the mind ( even only a haunting sadness or a mysterious joy ) , you may be sure that it is expressible . Some feelings are , of course , very difficult to develop . I shall show you one of these days , when we see each other , a page that I worked at for months before the idea came clearly .... When the best result comes , it ought to surprise you , for our best work is out of the Unconscious . " Through this study , reading , and brooding Lafcadio Hearn 's prose ripened and mellowed consistently to the end . In mere workmanship the present volume is one of his most admirable , while in its heightened passages , like the final paragraph of " The Romance of the Milky Way , " the rich , melancholy music , the profound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very greatest English prose . In substance the volume is equally significant . In 1884 he wrote to one of the closest of his friends that he had at last found his feet intellectually through the reading of Herbert Spencer which had dispelled all " isms " from his mind and left him " the vague but omnipotent consolation of the Great Doubt . " And in " Ultimate Questions , " which strikes , so to say , the dominant chord of this volume , we have an almost lyrical expression of the meaning for him of the Spencerian philosophy and psychology . In it is his characteristic mingling of Buddhist and Shinto thought with English and French psychology , strains which in his work " do not simply mix well , " as he says in one of his letters , but " absolutely unite , like chemical elements -- rush together with a shock ; "  - -  and in it he strikes his deepest note . In his steady envisagement of the horror that envelops the stupendous universe of science , in his power to evoke and revive old myths and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light of vanished suns over the darkness of the abyss , he was the most Lucretian of modern writers . * * * * * In outward appearance Hearn , the man , was in no way prepossessing . In the sharply lined picture of him drawn by one of his Japanese comrades in the " Atlantic " for October , 1905 , he appears , " slightly corpulent in later years , short in stature , hardly five feet high , of somewhat stooping gait . A little brownish in complexion , and of rather hairy skin . A thin , sharp , aquiline nose , large protruding eyes , of which the left was blind and the right very near-sighted . " The same writer , Nobushige Amenomori , has set down a reminiscence , not of Hearn the man , but of Hearn the genius , wherewith this introduction to the last of his writings may fitly conclude : " I shall ever retain the vivid remembrance of the sight I had when I stayed over night at his house for the first time . Being used myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that night . The clock struck one in the morning , but there was a light in Hearn 's study . I heard some low , hoarse coughing . I was afraid my friend might be ill ; so I stepped out of my room and went to his study . Not wanting , however , to disturb him , if he was at work , I cautiously opened the door just a little , and peeped in . I saw my friend intent in writing at his high desk , with his nose almost touching the paper . Leaf after leaf he wrote on . In a while he held up his head , and what did I see ! It was not the Hearn I was familiar with ; it was another Hearn . His face was mysteriously white ; his large eye gleamed . He appeared like one in touch with some unearthly presence . " Within that homely looking man there burned something pure as the vestal fire , and in that flame dwelt a mind that called forth life and poetry out of dust , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . September , 1905 . THE ROMANCE , OF THE MILKY WAY Of old it was said : ' The River of Heaven is the Ghost of Waters . ' We behold it shifting its bed in the course of the year as an earthly river sometimes does . Ancient Scholar Among the many charming festivals celebrated by Old Japan , the most romantic was the festival of Tanabata-Sama , the Weaving-Lady of the Milky Way . In the chief cities her holiday is now little observed ; and in T=oky=o it is almost forgotten . But in many country districts , and even in villages , near the capital , it is still celebrated in a small way . If you happen to visit an old-fashioned country town or village , on the seventh day of the seventh month ( by the ancient calendar ) , you will probably notice many freshly-cut bamboos fixed upon the roofs of the houses , or planted in the ground beside them , every bamboo having attached to it a number of strips of colored paper . In some very poor villages you might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ color only ; but the general rule is that the papers should be of five or seven different colors . Blue , green , red , yellow , and white are the tints commonly displayed . All these papers are inscribed with short poems written in praise of Tanabata and her husband Hikoboshi . After the festival the bamboos are taken down and thrown into the nearest stream , together with the poems attached to them . * * * * * To understand the romance of this old festival , you must know the legend of those astral divinities to whom offerings used to be made , even by , the Imperial Household , on the seventh day of the seventh month . The legend is Chinese . This is the Japanese popular version of it :  --  The great god of the firmament had a lovely daughter , Tanabata-tsum'e , who passed her days in weaving garments for her august parent . She rejoiced in her work , and thought that there was no greater pleasure than the pleasure of weaving . But one day , as she sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she saw a handsome peasant lad pass by , leading an ox , and she fell in love with him . Her august father , divining her secret wish , gave her the youth for a husband . But the wedded lovers became too fond of each other , and neglected their duty to the god of the firmament ; the sound of the shuttle was no longer heard , and the ox wandered , unheeded , over the plains of heaven . Therefore the great god was displeased , and he separated the pair . They were sentenced to live thereafter apart , with the Celestial River between them ; but it was permitted them to see each other once a year , on the seventh night of the seventh moon . On that night -- providing the skies be clear -- the birds of heaven make , with their bodies and wings , a bridge over the stream ; and by means of that bridge the lovers can meet . But if there be rain , the River of Heaven rises , and becomes so wide that the bridge can not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet , even on the seventh night of the seventh month ; it may happen , by reason of bad weather , that they can not meet for three or four years at a time . But their love remains immortally young and eternally patient ; and they continue to fulfill their respective duties each day without fault ,  - -  happy in their hope of being able to meet on the seventh night of the next seventh month . * * * * * To ancient Chinese fancy , the Milky Way was a luminous river ,  - -  the River of Heaven ,  - -  the Silver Stream . It has been stated by Western writers that Tanabata , the Weaving-Lady , is a star in Lyra ; and the Herdsman , her beloved , a star in Aquila , on the opposite side of the galaxy . But it were more correct to say that both are represented , to Far-Eastern imagination , by groups of stars . An old Japanese book puts the matter thus plainly : " Kengy=u ( the Ox-Leader ) is on the west side of the Heavenly River , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and looks like a man leading an ox . Shokujo ( the Weaving-Lady ) is on the east side of the Heavenly River : three stars so placed as to appear like the figure of a woman seated at her loom .... The former presides over all things relating to agriculture ; the latter , over all that relates to women 's work . " * * * * * In an old book called Zatsuwa-Shin , it is said that these deities were of earthly origin . Once in this world they were man and wife , and lived in China ; and the husband was called Ishi , and the wife Hakuy=o . They especially and most devoutly reverenced the Moon . Every clear evening , after sundown , they waited with eagerness to see her rise . And when she began to sink towards the horizon , they would climb to the top of a hill near their house , so that they might be able to gaze upon her face as long as possible . Then , when she at last disappeared from view , they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the wife died ; and her spirit rode up to heaven on a magpie , and there became a star . The husband , who was then one hundred and three years old , sought consolation for his bereavement in looking at the Moon and when he welcomed her rising and mourned her setting , it seemed to him as if his wife were still beside him . One summer night , Hakuy=o -- now immortally beautiful and young -- descended from heaven upon her magpie , to visit her husband ; and he was made very happy by that visit . But from that time he could think of nothing but the bliss of becoming a star , and joining Hakuy=o beyond the River of Heaven . At last he also ascended to the sky , riding upon a crow ; and there he became a star-god . But he could not join Hakuy=o at once , as he had hoped ; for between his allotted place and hers flowed the River of Heaven ; and it was not permitted for either star to cross the stream , because the Master of Heaven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there was no bridge . But on one day every year -- the seventh day of the seventh month -- they were allowed to see each other . The Master of Heaven goes always on that day to the Zenh=odo , to hear the preaching of the law of Buddha ; and then the magpies and the crows make , with their hovering bodies and outspread wings , a bridge over the Celestial Stream ; and Hakuy=o crosses that bridge to meet her husband . There can be little doubt that the Japanese festival called Tanabata was originally identical with the festival of the Chinese Weaving-Goddess , Tchi-Niu ; the Japanese holiday seems to have been especially a woman 's holiday , from the earliest times ; and the characters with which the word Tanabata is written signify a weaving-girl . But as both of the star-deities were worshiped on the seventh of the seventh month , some Japanese scholars have not been satisfied with the common explanation of the name , and have stated that it was originally composed with the word tan'e ( seed , or grain ) , and the word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make the appellation , Tanabata-Sama , plural instead of singular , and render it as " the deities of grain and of the loom , "  - -  that is to say , those presiding over agriculture and weaving . In old Japanese pictures the star-gods are represented according to this conception of their respective attributes ;  - -  Hikoboshi being figured as a peasant lad leading an ox to drink of the Heavenly River , on the farther side of which Orihim'e ( Tanabata ) appears , weaving at her loom . The garb of both is Chinese ; and the first Japanese pictures of these divinities were probably copied from some Chinese original . In the oldest collection of Japanese poetry extant ,  - -  the Many=osh=u , dating from 760 A.D. ,  - -  the male divinity is usually called Hikoboshi , and the female Tanabata-tsum'e ; but in later times both have been called Tanabata . In Izumo the male deity is popularly termed O-Tanabata Sama , and the female M'e-Tanabata Sama . Both are still known by many names . The male is called Kaiboshi as well as Hikoboshi and Kengy=u ; while the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) 1 , Ito-ori-him'e ( " Thread-Weaving Princess " ) , Momoko-him'e ( " Peach-Child Princess " ) , Takimono-him'e ( " Incense Princess " ) , and Sasagani-him'e ( " Spider Princess " ) . Some of these names are difficult to explain ,  - -  especially the last , which reminds us of the Greek legend of Arachne . Probably the Greek myth and the Chinese story have nothing whatever in common ; but in old Chinese books there is recorded a curious fact which might well suggest a relationship . In the time of the Chinese Emperor Ming Hwang ( whom the Japanese call Gens=o ) , it was customary for the ladies of the court , on the seventh day of the seventh month , to catch spiders and put them into an incense-box for purposes of divination . On the morning of the eighth day the box was opened ; and if the spiders had spun thick webs during the night the omen was good . But if they had remained idle the omen was bad . Footnote 1 : Asagao ( lit. , " morning-face " ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we call " morning glory . " * * * * * There is a story that , many ages ago , a beautiful woman visited the dwelling of a farmer in the mountains of Izumo , and taught to the only daughter of the household an art of weaving never before known . One evening the beautiful stranger vanished away ; and the people knew that they had seen the Weaving-Lady of Heaven . The daughter of the farmer became renowned for her skill in weaving . But she would never marry ,  - -  because she had been the companion of Tanabata-Sama. * * * * * Then there is a Chinese story -- delightfully vague -- about a man who once made a visit , unawares , to the Heavenly Land . He had observed that every year , during the eighth month , a raft of precious wood came floating to the shore on which he lived ; and he wanted to know where that wood grew . So he loaded a boat with provisions for a two years ' voyage , and sailed away in the direction from which the rafts used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , over an always placid sea ; and at last he arrived at a pleasant shore , where wonderful trees were growing . He moored his boat , and proceeded alone into the unknown land , until he came to the bank of a river whose waters were bright as silver . On the opposite shore he saw a pavilion ; and in the pavilion a beautiful woman sat weaving ; she was white like moonshine , and made a radiance all about her . Presently he saw a handsome young peasant approaching , leading an ox to the water ; and he asked the young peasant to tell him the name of the place and the country . But the youth seemed to be displeased by the question , and answered in a severe tone : " If you want to know the name of this place , go back to where you came from , and ask Gen-Kum-Pei. " 2 So the voyager , feeling afraid , hastened to his boat , and returned to China . There he sought out the sage Gen-Kum-Pei , to whom he related @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and exclaimed , " So it was you ! ... On the seventh day of the seventh month I was gazing at the heavens , and I saw that the Herdsman and the Weaver were about to meet ;  - -  but between them was a new Star , which I took to be a Guest-Star . Fortunate man ! you have been to the River of Heaven , and have looked upon the face of the Weaving-Lady ! ... " Footnote 2 : This is the Japanese reading of the Chinese name. * * * * *  - -  It is said that the meeting of the Herdsman and the Weaver can be observed by any one with good eyes ; for whenever it occurs those stars burn with five different colors . That is why offerings of five colors are made to the Tanabata divinities , and why the poems composed in their praise are written upon paper of five different tints . But , as I have said before , the pair can meet only in fair weather . If there be the least rain upon the seventh night , the River @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another whole year . Therefore the rain that happens to fall on Tanabata night is called Namida no Am'e , " The Rain of Tears . " When the sky is clear on the seventh night , the lovers are fortunate ; and their stars can be seen to sparkle with delight . If the star Kengy=u then shines very brightly , there will be great rice crops in the autumn . If the star Shokujo looks brighter than usual , there will be a prosperous time for weavers , and for every kind of female industry . * * * * * In old Japan it was generally supposed that the meeting of the pair signified good fortune to mortals . Even to-day , in many parts of the country , children sing a little song on the evening of the Tanabata festival ,  - -  Tenki ni nari ! ( " O weather , be clear ! " ) In the province of Iga the young folks also sing a jesting song at the supposed hour of the lovers ' meeting :  --  Tanabata ya ! Amari isogaba , Korobub'eshi ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very rainy district , the contrary belief prevails ; and it is thought that if the sky be clear on the seventh day of the seventh month , misfortune will follow . The local explanation of this belief is that if the stars can meet , there will be born from their union many evil deities who will afflict the country with drought and other calamities . Footnote 3 : " Ho ! Tanabata ! if you hurry too much , you will tumble down ! " * * * * * The festival of Tanabata was first celebrated in Japan on the seventh day of the seventh month of Tomby=o Sh=oh=o ( A.D. 755 ) . Perhaps the Chinese origin of the Tanabata divinities accounts for the fact that their public worship was at no time represented by many temples . I have been able to find record of only one temple to them , called Tanabata-jinja , which was situated at a village called Hoshiaimura , in the province of Owari , and surrounded by a grove called Tanabata-mori. 4 Footnote 4 : There is no mention , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even before Temby=o Sh=oh=o , however , the legend of the Weaving-Maiden seems to have been well known in Japan ; for it is recorded that on the seventh night of the seventh year of Y=or=o ( A.D. 723 ) the poet Yamagami no Okura composed the song :  --  Amanogawa , Ai-muki tachit'e , Waga ko:ishi Kimi kimasu nari --  Himo-toki makina ! 5 It would seem that the Tanabata festival was first established in Japan eleven hundred and fifty years ago , as an Imperial Court festival only , in accordance with Chinese precedent . Subsequently the nobility and the military classes everywhere followed imperial example ; and the custom of celebrating the Hoshi-mat-suri , or Star-Festival , as it was popularly called ,  - -  spread gradually downwards , until at last the seventh day of the seventh month became , in the full sense of the term , a national holiday . But the fashion of its observance varied considerably at different eras and in different provinces . Footnote 5 : For a translation and explanation of this song , see infra , page 30 . The ceremonies at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a full account of them is given in the K=oji Kongen , with explanatory illustrations . On the evening of the seventh day of the seventh month , mattings were laid down on the east side of that portion of the Imperial Palace called the Seir-y=oden ; and upon these mattings were placed four tables of offerings to the Star-deities . Besides the customary food-offerings , there were placed upon these tables rice-wine , incense , vases of red lacquer containing flowers , a harp and flute , and a needle with five eyes , threaded with threads of five different colors . Black-lacquered oil-lamps were placed beside the tables , to illuminate the feast . In another part of the grounds a tub of water was so placed as to reflect the light of the Tanabata-stars ; and the ladies of the Imperial Household attempted to thread a needle by the reflection . She who succeeded was to be fortunate during the following year . The court-nobility ( Kug'e ) were obliged to make certain offerings to the Imperial House on the day of the festival . The character of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were fixed by decree . They were conveyed to the palace upon a tray , by a veiled lady of rank , in ceremonial dress . Above her , as she walked , a great red umbrella was borne by an attendant . On the tray were placed seven tanzaku ( longilateral slips of fine tinted paper for the writing of poems ) ; seven kudzu-leaves ; 6 seven inkstones ; seven strings of s=omen ( a kind of vermicelli ) ; fourteen writing-brushes ; and a bunch of yam-leaves gathered at night , and thickly sprinkled with dew . In the palace grounds the ceremony began at the Hour of the Tiger ,  - -  4 A.M. Then the inkstones were carefully washed ,  - -  prior to preparing the ink for the writing of poems in praise of the Star-deities ,  - -  and each one set upon a kudzu-leaf . One bunch of bedewed yam-leaves was then laid upon every inkstone ; and with this dew , instead of water , the writing-ink was prepared . All the ceremonies appear to have been copied from those in vogue at the Chinese court in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thunbergiana. * * * * * It was not until the time of the Tokugawa Sh=ogunate that the Tanabata festival became really a national holiday ; and the popular custom of attaching tansaku of different colors to freshly-cut bamboos , in celebration of the occasion , dates only from the era of Bunser ( 1818 ) . Previously the tanzaku had been made of a very costly quality of paper ; and the old aristocratic ceremonies had been not less expensive than elaborate . But in the time of the Tokugawa Sh=ogunate a very cheap paper of various colors was manufactured ; and the holiday ceremonies were suffered to assume an inexpensive form , in which even the poorest classes could indulge . The popular customs relating to the festival differed according to locality . Those of Izumo -- where all classes of society , samurai or common folk , celebrated the holiday in much the same way -- used to be particularly interesting ; and a brief account of them will suggest something of the happy aspects of life in feudal times . At the Hour of the Tiger , on the seventh night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the work of washing the inkstones and writing-brushes was performed . Then , in the household garden , dew was collected upon yam-leaves . This dew was called Amanogawa no suzuki ( " drops from the River of Heaven " ) ; and it was used to make fresh ink for writing the poems which were to be suspended to bamboos planted in the garden . It was usual for friends to present each other with new inkstones at the time of the Tanabata festival ; and if there were any new inkstones in the house , the fresh ink was prepared in these . Each member of the family then wrote poems . The adults composed verses , according to their ability , in praise of the Star-deities ; and the children either wrote dictation or tried to improvise . Little folk too young to use the writing-brush without help had their small hands guided , by parent or elder sister or elder brother , so as to shape on a tanzaku the character of some single word or phrase relating to the festival , such as " Amanogawa , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hashi " ( the Bridge of Magpies ) . In the garden were planted two freshly-cut bamboos , with branches and leaves entire ,  - -  a male bamboo ( otoko-dak'e ) and a female bamboo ( onna-dak'e ) . They were set up about six feet apart , and to a cord extended between them were suspended paper-cuttings of five colors , and skeins of dyed thread of five colors . The paper-cuttings represented upper-robes ,  - -  kimono . To the leaves and branches of the bamboos were tied the tanzaku on which poems had been written by the members of the family . And upon a table , set between the bamboos , or immediately before them , were placed vessels containing various offerings to the Star-deities ,  - -  fruits , s=omen , rice-wine , and vegetables of different kinds , such as cucumbers and watermelons . But the most curious Izumo custom relating to the festival was the N'emu-nagashi , or " Sleep-wash-away " ceremony . Before day-break the young folks used to go to some stream , carrying with them bunches composed of n'emuri-leaves and bean-leaves mixed together . On reaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the current , and sing a little song :  --  N'emu wa , nagar'e yo ! Mam'e no ha wa , tomar'e ! These verses might be rendered in two ways ; because the word n'emu can be taken in the meaning either of n'emuri ( sleep ) , or of nemuri-gi or n'emunoki , the " sleep-plant " ( mimosa ) ,  - -  while the syllables mam'e , as written in kana , can signify either " bean , " or " activity , " or " strength , " " vigor , " " health , " etc . But the ceremony was symbolical , and the intended meaning of the song was :  --  Drowsiness , drift away ! Leaves of vigor , remain ! After this , all the young folk would jump into the water , to bathe or swim , in token of their resolve to shed all laziness for the coming year , and to maintain a vigorous spirit of endeavor. * * * * * Yet it was probably in Y'edo ( now T=oky=o ) that the Tanabata festival assumed its most picturesque @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  - -  the sixth and seventh of the seventh month ,  - -  the city used to present the appearance of one vast bamboo grove ; fresh bamboos , with poems attached to them , being erected upon the roofs of the houses . Peasants were in those days able to do a great business in bamboos , which were brought into town by hundreds of wagonloads for holiday use . Another feature of the Y'edo festival was the children 's procession , in which bamboos , with poems attached to them , were carried about the city . To each such bamboo there was also fastened a red plaque on which were painted , in Chinese characters , the names of the Tanabata stars . But almost everywhere , under the Tokugawa r'egime , the Tanabata festival used to be a merry holiday for the young people of all classes ,  - -  a holiday beginning with lantern displays before sunrise , and lasting well into the following night . Boys and girls on that day were dressed in their best , and paid visits of ceremony to friends and neighbors. * * * * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called Tanabata-tsuki , or " The Moon of Tanabata . " And it was also called Fumi-tsuki , or " The Literary Moon , " because during the seventh month poems were everywhere composed in praise of the Celestial Lovers . * * * * * I think that my readers ought to be interested in the following selection of ancient Japanese poems , treating of the Tanabata legend . All are from the Many=osh=u . The Many=osh=u , or " Gathering of a Myriad Leaves , " is a vast collection of poems composed before the middle of the eighth century . It was compiled by Imperial order , and completed early in the ninth century . The number of the poems which it contains is upwards of four thousand ; some being " long poems " ( naga-uta ) , but the great majority tanka , or compositions limited to thirty-one syllables ; and the authors were courtiers or high officials . The first eleven tanka hereafter translated were composed by Yamagami no Okura , Governor of the province of Chikuzen more than eleven hundred years ago . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little of his work will bear comparison with some of the finer epigrams of the Greek Anthology . The following verses , upon the death of his little son Furubi , will serve as an example :  --  Wakaker'eba Nichi-yuki shiraji : Mahi wa s'emu , Shitab'e no tsukahi Ohit'e-tohoras'e.  - -  As he is so young , he can not know the way .... To the messenger of the Underworld I will give a bribe , and entreat him , saying : " Do thou kindly take the little one upon thy back along the road . " Eight hundred years earlier , the Greek poet Diodorus Zonas of Sardis had written :  --  " Do thou , who rowest the boat of the dead in the water of this reedy lake , for Hades , stretch out thy hand , dark Charon , to the son of Kinyras , as he mounts the ladder by the gang-way , and receive him . For his sandals will cause the lad to slip , and he fears to set his feet naked on the sand of the shore . " But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the " son of Kinyras " was no other than Adonis ,  - -  whereas the verses of Okura express for us the yearning of a father 's heart . * * * * *  - -  Though the legend of Tanabata was indeed borrowed from China , the reader will find nothing Chinese in the following compositions . They represent the old classic poetry at its purest , free from alien influence ; and they offer us many suggestions as to the condition of Japanese life and thought twelve hundred years ago . Remembering that they were written before any modern European literature had yet taken form , one is startled to find how little the Japanese written language has changed in the course of so many centuries . Allowing for a few obsolete words , and sundry slight changes of pronunciation , the ordinary Japanese reader to-day can enjoy these early productions of his native muse with about as little difficulty as the English reader finds in studying the poets of the Elizabethan era . Moreover , the refinement and the simple charm of the Many=osh=u compositions have never been surpassed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As for the forty-odd tanka which I have translated , their chief attraction lies , I think , in what they reveal to us of the human nature of their authors . Tanabata-tsum'e still represents for us the Japanese wife , worshipfully loving ;  - -  Hikoboshi appears to us with none of the luminosity of the god , but as the young Japanese husband of the sixth or seventh century , before Chinese ethical convention had begun to exercise its restraint upon life and literature . Also these poems interest us by their expression of the early feeling for natural beauty . In them we find the scenery and the seasons of Japan transported to the Blue Plain of High Heaven ;  - -  the Celestial Stream with its rapids and shallows , its sudden risings and clamourings within its stony bed , and its water-grasses bending in the autumn wind , might well be the Kamogawa ;  - -  and the mists that haunt its shores are the very mists of Arashiyama . The boat of Hikoboshi , impelled by a single oar working upon a wooden peg , is not yet obsolete ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hiki-fun'e in which Tanabata-tsum'e prayed her husband to cross in a night of storm ,  - -  a flat broad barge pulled over the river by cables . And maids and wives still sit at their doors in country villages , on pleasant autumn days , to weave as Tanabata-tsum'e wove for the sake of her lord and lover . * * * * *  - -  It will be observed that , in most of these verses , it is not the wife who dutifully crosses the Celestial River to meet her husband , but the husband who rows over the stream to meet the wife ; and there is no reference to the Bridge of Birds .... As for my renderings , those readers who know by experience the difficulty of translating Japanese verse will be the most indulgent , I fancy . The Romaji system of spelling has been followed ( except in one or two cases where I thought it better to indicate the ancient syllabication after the method adopted by Aston ) ; and words or phrases necessarily supplied have been inclosed in parentheses . Amanogawa Ai-muki tachit'e , Waga @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my long-desired lord , whom I have been waiting to meet here , on the banks of the River of Heaven .... The moment of loosening my girdle is nigh ! 7 Footnote 7 : The last line alludes to a charming custom of which mention is made in the most ancient Japanese literature . Lovers , ere parting , were wont to tie each other 's inner girdle ( himo ) and pledge themselves to leave the knot untouched until the time of their next meeting . This poem is said to have been composed in the seventh year of Y=or=o ,  - -  A.D. 723 ,  - -  eleven hundred and eighty-two years ago . Hisakata no8 Ama no kawas'e ni , Fun'e uk'et'e , Koyo:i ka kimi ga Agari kimasan ? Footnote 8 : Hisakata-no is a " pillow-word " used by the old poets in relation to celestial objects ; and it is often difficult to translate . Mr. Aston thinks that the literal meaning of hisakata is simply " long-hard , " in the sense of long-enduring ,  - -  hisa ( long ) , katai ( hard , or firm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " firmamental . " Japanese commentators , however , say that the term is composed with the three words , hi ( sun ) , sasu ( shine ) , and kata ( side ) ;  - -  and this etymology would justify the rendering of hisakata-no by some such expression as " light-shedding , " " radiance-giving . " On the subject of pillow-words , see Aston 's Grammar of the Japanese Written Language . Over the Rapids of the Everlasting Heaven , floating in his boat , my lord will doubtless deign to come to me this very night . Kaz'e kumo wa Futatsu no kishi ni Kayo:edomo , Waga toho-tsuma no Koto zo kayowanu ! Though winds and clouds to either bank may freely come or go , between myself and my faraway spouse no message whatever may pass . Tsubut'e9 ni mo Nag'e koshitsu-b'eki , Amanogawa H'edat'er'eba ka mo , Amata sub'e-naki ! To the opposite bank one might easily fling a pebble ; yet , being separated from him by the River of Heaven , alas ! to hope for a meeting ( except in autumn ) is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tabut'e . Aki-kaz'e no Fukinishi hi yori " Itsushika " to --  ; Waga machi koishi Kimi zo kimas'eru . From the day that the autumn wind began to blow ( I kept saying to myself ) , " Ah ! when shall we meet ? "  - -  but now my beloved , for whom I waited and longed , has come indeed ! Amanogawa Ito kawa-nami wa Tatan'edomo , Samorai gatashi --  Chikaki kono s'e wo . Though the waters of the River of Heaven have not greatly risen , ( yet to cross ) this near stream and to wait upon ( my lord and lover ) remains impossible . Sod'e furaba Mi mo kawashitsu-b'eku Chika-ker'edo , Wataru sub'e nashi , Aki nishi aran'eba . Though she is so near that the waving of her ( long ) sleeves can be distinctly seen , yet there is no way to cross the stream before the season of autumn . Kag'ero:i no Honoka ni mi'et'e Wakar'enaba ;  --  Motonaya ko:in A:u-toki mad'e wa ! When we were separated , I had seen her for a moment only ,  - -  and dimly as one sees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her as before , until time of our next meeting ! Hikoboshi no Tsuma muka:e-bun'e Kogizurashi ,  --  Ama-no-Kawara ni Kiri no tat'eru wa . Footnote 10 : Kag'ero:i is an obsolete form of kag'er=o , meaning an ephemera . Methinks that Hikoboshi must be rowing his boat to meet his wife , for a mist ( as of oar-spray ) is rising over the course of the Heavenly Stream . Kasumi tatsu Ama-no-Kawara ni , Kimi matsu to ,  --  Ikay=o hodo ni Mono-suso nurenu . While awaiting my lord on the misty shore of the River of Heaven , the skirts of my robe have somehow become wet . Amanogawa , Mi-tsu no nami oto Sawagu-nari : Waga matsu-kimi no Funad'e-surashi mo . On the River of Heaven , at the place of the august ferry , the sound of the water has become loud : perhaps my long-awaited lord will soon be coming in his boat . Tanabata no Sod'e maku yo:i no Akatoki wa , Kawas'e no tazu wa Nakazu to mo yoshi . As Tanabata ( slumbers ) with her long sleeves rolled up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O storks of the river-shallows , awaken her by your cries. 11 Footnote 11 : Lit. , " not to cry out ( will be ) good "  - -  but a literal translation of the poem is scarcely possible . Amanogawa Kiri-tachi-wataru : Ky=o , ky=o , to --  Waga matsu-ko:ishi Funad'e-surashi ! ( She sees that ) a mist is spreading across the River of Heaven .... " To-day , to-day , " she thinks , " my long-awaited lord will probably come over in his boat . " Amanogawa , Yasu no watari ni , Fun'e uk'et'e ;  --  Waga tachi-matsu to Imo ni tsug'e koso . By the ferry of Yasu , on the River of Heaven , the boat is floating : I pray you tell my younger sister12 that I stand here and wait . Footnote 12 : That is to say , " wife . " In archaic Japanese the word imo signified both " wife " and " younger sister . " The term might also be rendered " darling " or " beloved . " =O-sora yo Kay=o war'e sura , Na ga yu'e ni @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being a Star-god ) can pass freely to and fro , through the great sky ,  - -  yet to cross over the River of Heaven , for your sake , was weary work indeed ! Yachihoko no Kami no mi-yo had been my spouse in secret14 only ; yet now , because of my constant longing for her , our relation has become known to men . Footnote 13 : Yachihoko-no-Kami , who has many other names , is the Great God of Izumo , and is commonly known by his appellation Oho-kuni-nushi-no-Kami , or the " Deity-Master-of-the Great-Land . " He is locally worshiped also as the god of marriage , for which reason , perhaps , the poet thus refers to him . Footnote 14 : Or , " my seldom-visited spouse . " The word tsuma ( zuma ) , in ancient Japanese , signified either wife or husband ; and this poem might be rendered so as to express either the wife 's or the husband 's thoughts . Am'e tsuchi to Wakar'eshi toki yo Onoga tsuma ; Shika zo t'e ni aru Aki matsu ar'e wa . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she has been my own wife ;  - -  yet , to be with her , I must always wait till autumn. 15 Footnote 15 : By the ancient calendar , the seventh day of the seventh month would fall in the autumn season . Waga k=oru Niho no omo wa Koyo:i mo ka Ama-no-kawara ni Ishi-makura makan . With my beloved , of the ruddy-tinted cheeks , 16 this night indeed will I descend into the bed of the River of Heaven , to sleep on a pillow of stone . Footnote 16 : The literal meaning is " b'eni-tinted face , "  - -  that is to say , a face of which the cheeks and lips have been tinted with b'eni , a kind of rouge . Amanogawa . Mikomori-gusa no Aki-kaz'e ni Nabikafu mir'eba , Toki kitarurashi . When I see the water-grasses of the River of Heaven bend in the autumn wind ( I think to myself ) : " The time ( for our meeting ) seems to have come . " Waga s'eko ni Ura-koi or'eba , Amanogawa Yo-fun'e kogi-toyomu Kaji no ' to kikoyu . When I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 17 then on the River of Heaven the sound of the rowing of the night-boat is heard , and the plash of the oar resounds . Footnote 17 : In ancient Japanese the word s'eko signified either husband or elder brother . The beginning of the poem might also be rendered thus :  --  " When I feel a secret longing for my husband , " etc . T=o-zuma to Tamakura kawashi N'etaru yo wa , Tori-gan'e na naki Ak'eba aku to mo ! In the night when I am reposing with my ( now ) far-away spouse , having exchanged jewel-pillows18 with her , let not the cock crow , even though the day should dawn . Footnote 18 : " To exchange jewel-pillows " signifies to use each other 's arms for pillows . This poetical phrase is often used in the earliest Japanese literature . The word for jewel , tama , often appears in compounds as an equivalent of " precious , " " dear , " etc . Yorozu-yo ni Tazusawari it'e Ai mi-domo , Omoi-sugu-b'eki Koi naranaku ni . Though for a myriad ages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exceeding love could never come to an end . ( Why then should Heaven deem it necessary to part us ? ) Waga tam'e to , Tanabata-tsum'e no , Sono yado ni , Oreru shirotai Nu:it ken kamo ? The white cloth which Tanabata has woven for my sake , in that dwelling of hers , is now , I think , being made into a robe for me . Shirakumo no I-ho ' e kakurit'e T=o-k'edomo , Yo:i-sarazu min Imo ga atari wa . Though she be far-away , and hidden from me by five hundred layers of white cloud , still shall I turn my gaze each night toward the dwelling-place of my younger sister ( wife ) . Aki sar'eba Kawagiri tat'eru Amanogawa , Kawa ni muki-it'e Kru19 yo zo =oki ! Footnote 19 : For kofuru . When autumn comes , and the river-mists spread over the Heavenly Stream , I turn toward the river , ( and long ) ; and the nights of my longing are many ! Hito-tos'e ni Nanuka no yo nomi A:u-hito no --  Ko:i mo tsuki-n'eba Sayo zo ak'e ni keru ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the seventh night ( of the seventh month ) , to meet the beloved person -- and lo ! The day has dawned before our mutual love could express itself ! 20 Footnote 20 : Or " satisfy itself . " A literal rendering is difficult . Toshi no ko:i Koyo:i tsukush'it'e , Asu yori wa , Tsun'e no gotoku ya Waga ko:i oran . The love-longing of one whole year having ended to-night , every day from to-morrow I must again pine for him as before ! Hikoboshi to Tanabata-tsum'e to Koyo:i a:u ;  --  Ama-no-Kawa to ni Nami tatsu-na yum'e ! Hikoboshi and Tanabata-tsum'e are to meet each other to-night ; ye waves of the River of Heaven , take heed that ye do not rise ! Aki-kaz'e no Fuki tadayowasu Shirakumo wa , Tanabata-tsum'e no Amatsu hir'e kamo ? Oh ! that white cloud driven by the autumn-wind -- can it be the heavenly hir'e21 of Tana-bata-tsum'e ? Footnote 21 : At different times , in the history of Japanese female costume , different articles of dress were called by this name . In the present instance , the hir'e referred to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and carried over the shoulders to the breast , where its ends were either allowed to hang loose , or were tied into an ornamental knot . The hir'e was often used to make signals with , much as handkerchiefs are waved to-day for the same purpose ;  - -  and the question uttered in the poem seems to signify : " Can that be Tanabata waving her scarf -- to call me ? " In very early times , the ordinary costumes worn were white . Shiba-shiba mo Ai minu kimi wo , Amanogawa Funa-d'e haya s'eyo Yo no fuk'enu ma ni . Because he is my not-often-to-be-met beloved , hasten to row the boat across the River of Heaven ere the night be advanced . Amanogawa Kiri tachi-watari Hikoboshi no Kaji no ' to kikoyu Yo no fuk'e-yuk'eba . Late in the night , a mist spreads over the River of Heaven ; and the sound of the oar22 of Hikoboshi is heard . Footnote 22 : Or , " the creaking of the oar . " ( The word kaji to-day means " helm " ;  - -  the single oar , or scull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for rudder and oar , being now called ro . ) The mist passing across the Amanogawa is , according to commentators , the spray from the Star-god 's oar . Amanogawa Kawa ' to sayak'eshi : Hikoboshi no Haya kogu fun'e no Nami no sawagi ka ? On the River of Heaven a sound of plashing can be distinctly heard : is it the sound of the rippling made by Hikoboshi quickly rowing his boat ? Kono y=ub'e , Furikuru am'e wa , Hikoboshi no Haya kogu fun'e no Ka:i no chiri ka mo . Perhaps this evening shower is but the spray ( flung down ) from the oar of Hikoboshi , rowing his boat in haste . Waga tama-doko wo Asu yori wa Uchi hara:i , Kimi to in'ezut'e Hitori ka mo nen ! From to-morrow , alas ! after having put my jewel-bed in order , no longer reposing with my lord , I must sleep alone ! Kaz'e fukit'e , Kawa-nami tachinu ;  --  Hiki-fun'e ni Watari mo kimas'e Yo no fuk'enu ma ni . The wind having risen , the waves of the river have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 23 I pray thee , before the hour be late ! Footnote 23 : Lit. " pull-boat " ( hiki-fun'e ) ,  - -  a barge or boat pulled by a rope . Amanogawa Nami wa tatsutomo , Waga fun'e wa Iza kogi iden Yo no fuk'enu ma ni . Even though the waves of the River of Heaven run high , I must row over quickly , before it becomes late in the night . Inishi'e ni Orit'eshi hata wo ; Kono y=ub'e Koromo ni nu:it'e --  Kimi matsu ar'e wo ! Long ago I finished weaving the material ; and , this evening , having finished sewing the garment for him --  ( why must ) I still wait for my lord ? Amanogawa S'e wo hayami ka mo ? Nubatama no Yo wa fuk'e ni tsutsu , Awanu Hikoboshi ! Is it that the current of the River of Heaven ( has become too ) rapid ? The jet-black night24 advances -- and Hikoboshi has not come ! Footnote 24 : Nubatama no yo might better be rendered by some such phrase as " the berry-black night , "  - -  but the intended effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " pillow-word " ) is written with characters signifying " like the black fruits of Karasu-=Ogi ; " and the ancient phrase " nubatama no yo " therefore may be said to have the same meaning as our expressions " jet-black night , " or " pitch-dark night . " Watashi-mori , Fun'e haya watas'e ;  --  Hito-tos'e ni Futatabi kay=o Kimi naranaku ni ! Oh , ferryman , make speed across the stream !  - -  my lord is not one who can come and go twice in a year ! Aki kaz'e no Fukinishi hi yori , Amanogawa Kawas'e ni d'edachi ;  --  Matsu to tsug'e koso ! On the very day that the autumn-wind began to blow , I set out for the shallows of the River of Heaven ;  - -  I pray you , tell my lord that I am waiting here still ! Tanabata no Funanori surashi ,  --  Maso-kagami , Kiyoki tsuki-yo ni Kumo tachi-wataru . Methinks Tanabata must be coming in her boat ; for a cloud is even now passing across the clear face of the moon. 25 Footnote 25 : Composed by the famous poet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Way , on the seventh night of the seventh month of the tenth year of Tampy=o ( A.D. 738 ) . The pillow-word in the third line ( maso-kagami ) is untranslatable.  - -  And yet it has been gravely asserted that the old Japanese poets could find no beauty in starry skies ! ... Perhaps the legend of Tanabata , as it was understood by those old poets , can make but a faint appeal to Western minds . Nevertheless , in the silence of transparent nights , before the rising of the moon , the charm of the ancient tale sometimes descends upon me , out of the scintillant sky , to make me forget the monstrous facts of science , and the stupendous horror of Space . Then I no longer behold the Milky Way as that awful Ring of the Cosmos , whose hundred million suns are powerless to lighten the Abyss , but as the very Amanogawa itself ,  - -  the River Celestial . I see the thrill of its shining stream , and the mists that hover along its verge , and the water-grasses that bend in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starry loom , and the Ox that grazes on the farther shore ;  - -  and I know that the falling dew is the spray from the Herdsman 's oar . And the heaven seems very near and warm and human ; and the silence about me is filled with the dream of a love unchanging , immortal ,  - -  forever yearning and forever young , and forever left unsatisfied by the paternal wisdom of the gods . GOBLIN POETRY Recently , while groping about an old book shop , I found a collection of Goblin Poetry in three volumes , containing many pictures of goblins . The title of the collection is Ky=oka Hyaku-Monogatari , or " The Mad Poetry of the Hyaku-Monogatari . " The Hyaku-Monogatari , or " Hundred Tales , " is a famous book of ghost stories . On the subject of each of the stories , poems were composed at different times by various persons ,  - -  poems of the sort called Ky=oka , or Mad Poetry ,  - -  and these were collected and edited to form the three volumes of which I became the fortunate possessor . The collecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the literary pseudonym " Temm'er R'e=ojin " ( Ancient of the Temm'er Era ) . Takumi died in the first year of Bunky=u ( 1861 ) , at the good age of eighty ; and his collection seems to have been published in the sixth year of Ka'e:i ( 1853 ) . The pictures were made by an artist called Masazumi , who worked under the pseudonym " Ry=osai Kanjin . " From a prefatory note it appears that Takumi Jingor=o published his collection with the hope of reviving interest in a once popular kind of poetry which had fallen into neglect before the middle of the century . The word ky=oka is written with a Chinese character signifying " insane " or " crazy ; " and it means a particular and extraordinary variety of comic poetry . The form is that of the classic tanka of thirty-one syllables ( arranged 57577 ) ;  - -  but the subjects are always the extreme reverse of classical ; and the artistic effects depend upon methods of verbal jugglery which can not be explained without the help of numerous examples . The collection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which a Western reader can discover no merit ; but the best of it has a distinctly grotesque quality that reminds one of Hood 's weird cleverness in playing with grim subjects . This quality , and the peculiar Japanese method of mingling the playful with the terrific , can be suggested and explained only by reproducing in Romaji the texts of various ky=oka , with translations and notes . The selection which I have made should prove interesting , not merely because it will introduce the reader to a class of Japanese poetry about which little or nothing has yet been written in English , but much more because it will afford some glimpses of a supernatural world which still remains for the most part unexplored . Without knowledge of Far Eastern superstitions and folk-tales , no real understanding of Japanese fiction or drama or poetry will ever become possible . * * * * * There are many hundreds of poems in the three volumes of the Ky=oka Hyaku-Monogatari ; but the number of the ghosts and goblins falls short of the one hundred suggested by the title . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest my readers in the whole of this goblinry , and my selection includes less than one seventh of the subjects . The Faceless Babe , The Long-Tongued Maiden , The Three-Eyed Monk , The Pillow-Mover , The Thousand Heads , The Acolyte-with-the-Lantern , The **29;3496;TOOLONG , The Goblin-Heron , The Goblin-Wind , The Dragon-Lights , and The Mountain-Nurse , did not much impress me . I omitted ky=oka dealing with fancies too gruesome for Western nerves , such as that of the Obum'edori ,  - -  also those treating of merely local tradition . The subjects chosen represent national rather than provincial folklore ,  - -  old beliefs ( mostly of Chinese origin ) once prevalent throughout the country , and often referred to in its popular literature . I. KITSUN'E-BI The Will-o ' - the- wisp is called kitsun'e-bi ( " fox-fire " ) , because the goblin-fox was formerly supposed to create it . In old Japanese pictures it is represented as a tongue of pale red flame , hovering in darkness , and shedding no radiance upon the surfaces over which it glides . To understand some of the following ky=oka on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the magical power of the fox have given rise to several queer folk-sayings , one of which relates to marrying a stranger . Formerly a good citizen was expected to marry within his own community , not outside of it ; and the man who dared to ignore traditional custom in this regard would have found it difficult to appease the communal indignation . Even to-day the villager who , after a long absence from his birthplace , returns with a strange bride , is likely to hear unpleasant things said , such as : " Wakaranai-mono we hippat'e-kita ! ... Doko no uma no hon'e da ka ? " ( " Goodness knows what kind of a thing he has dragged here after him ! Where did he pick up that old horse-bone ? " ) The expression uma no hon'e , " old horse-bone , " requires explanation . A goblin-fox has the power to assume many shapes ; but , for the purpose of deceiving men , he usually takes the form of a pretty woman . When he wants to create a charming phantom of this kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and holds it in his mouth . Presently the bone becomes luminous ; and the figure of a woman defines about it ,  - -  the figure of a courtesan or singing-girl .... So the village query about the man who marries a strange wife , " What old horse-bone has he picked up ? " signifies really , " What wanton has bewitched him ? " It further implies the suspicion that the stranger may be of outcast blood : a certain class of women of pleasure having been chiefly recruited , from ancient time , among the daughters of ' Eta and other pariah-people . Hi tomoshit'e Kitsun'e no kwas'eshi , Asobim'e26 wa --  Izuka no uma no Hon'e ni ya aruran ! Footnote 26 : Asobim'e , a courtesan : lit. , " sporting-woman . " The ' Eta and other pariah classes furnished a large proportion of these women . The whole meaning of the poem is as follows : " See that young wanton with her lantern ! It is a pretty sight -- but so is the sight of a fox , when the creature kindles his goblin-fire and assumes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fox-woman will prove to be no more than an old horse-bone , so that young courtesan , whose beauty deludes men to folly , may be nothing better than an ' Eta . "  - -  Ah the wanton ( lighting her lantern ) !  - -  so a fox-fire is kindled in the time of fox-transformation ! ... Perhaps she is really nothing more than an old horse-bone from somewhere or other .... Kitsun'e-bi no Moyuru ni tsuk'et'e , Waga tama no Kiyuru y=o nari Kokoro-hoso-michi ! Because of that Fox-fire burning there , the very soul of me is like to be extinguished in this narrow path ( or , in this heart-depressing solitude ) . 27 Footnote 27 : The supposed utterance of a belated traveler frightened by a will-o ' - the- wisp . The last line allows of two readings . Kokoro-hosoi means " timid ; " and hosoi michi ( hoso-michi ) means a " narrow path , " and , by implication , a " lonesome path . " II . RIKOMBY=O The term Rikomby=o is composed with the word rikon , signifying a " shade , " " ghost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by=o , signifying " sickness , " " disease . " An almost literal rendering would be " ghost-sickness . " In Japanese-English dictionaries you will find the meaning of Rikomby=o given as " hypochondria ; " and doctors really use the term in this modern sense . But the ancient meaning was a disorder of the mind which produced a Double ; and there is a whole strange literature about this weird disease . It used to be supposed , both in China and Japan , that under the influence of intense grief or longing , caused by love , the spirit of the suffering person would create a Double . Thus the victim of Rikomby=o would appear to have two bodies , exactly alike ; and one of these bodies would go to join the absent beloved , while the other remained at home . ( In my " Exotics and Retrospectives , " under the title " A Question in the Zen Texts , " the reader will find a typical Chinese story on the subject ,  - -  the story of the girl Ts'ing . ) Some form of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every part of the world ; but this Far Eastern variety is of peculiar interest because the double is supposed to be caused by love , and the subjects of the affliction to belong to the gentler sex .... The term Rikomby=o seems to be applied to the apparition as well as to the mental disorder supposed to produce the apparition : it signifies " doppelg:anger " as well as " ghost-disease. " * * * * *  - -  With these necessary explanations , the quality of the following ky=oka can be understood . A picture which appears in the Ky=oka Hyaku-Monogatari shows a maid-servant anxious to offer a cup of tea to her mistress ,  - -  a victim of the " ghost-sickness . " The servant can not distinguish between the original and the apparitional shapes before her ; and the difficulties of the situation are suggested in the first of the ky=oka which I have translated :  --  Ko-ya , sor'e to ? Ayam'e mo wakanu Rikomby=o : Izur'e we tsuma to Hiku zo wazura:u ! Which one is this ?  - -  which one is that ? Between the two shapes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find out which is the real wife -- that will be an affliction of spirit indeed ! Futatsu naki Inochi nagara mo Kak'ega:e no Karada no miyuru --  Kage no wazurai ! Two lives there certainly are not ;  - -  nevertheless an extra body is visible , by reason of the Shadow-Sickness . Naga-tabi no Oto we shita:it'e Mi futatsu ni Naru wa onna no S=aru rikomby=o . Yearning after her far-journeying husband , the woman has thus become two bodies , by reason of her ghostly sickness . Miru kag'e mo Naki wazurai no Rikomby=o ,  --  Omoi no hoka ni Futatsu miru kag'e ! Though ( it was said that ) , because of her ghostly sickness , there was not even a shadow of her left to be seen ,  - -  yet , contrary to expectation , there are two shadows of her to be seen ! 28 Footnote 28 : The Japanese say of a person greatly emaciated by sickness , miru-kag'e mo naki : " Even a visible shadow of him is not ! "  - -  Another rendering is made possible by the fact that the same expression is used in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " though the face of the person afflicted with this ghostly sickness is unfit to be seen , yet by reason of her secret longing for another man there are now two of her faces to be seen . " The phrase omoi no hoka , in the fourth line , means " contrary to expectation ; " but it is ingeniously made to suggest also the idea of secret longing . Rikomby=o Hito ni kakushit'e Oku-zashiki , Omot'e y d:easanu Kag'e no wazurai . Afflicted with the Rikomby=o , she hides away from people in the back room , and never approaches the front of the house ,  - -  because of her Shadow-disease. 29 Footnote 29 : There is a curious play on words in the fourth line . The word omot'e , meaning " the front , " might , in reading , be sounded as omott'e , " thinking . " The verses therefore might also be thus translated :  --  " She keeps her real thoughts hidden in the back part of the house , and never allows them to be seen in the front part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' of love . " Mi wa koko ni ; Tama wa otoko ni So:in'e suru ;  --  Kokoro mo shiraga Haha ga kaih=o . Here her body lies ; but her soul is far away , asleep in the arms of a man ;  - -  and the white-haired mother , little knowing her daughter 's heart , is nursing ( only the body ) . 30 Footnote 30 : There is a double meaning , suggested rather than expressed , in the fourth line . The word shiraga , " white-hair , " suggests shirazu , " not knowing . " Tamakushig'e Futatsu no sugata Mis'enuru wa , Awas'e-kagami no Kag'e no wazurai . If , when seated before her toilet-stand , she sees two faces reflected in her mirror ,  - -  that might be caused by the mirror doubling itself under the influence of the Shadow-Sickness. 31 Footnote 31 : There is in this poem a multiplicity of suggestion impossible to render in translation . While making her toilet , the Japanese woman uses two mirrors ( awas'e-kagami ) one of which , a hand-mirror , serves to show her the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflecting it into the larger stationary mirror . But in this case of Rikomby=o , the woman sees more than her face and the back of her head in the larger mirror : she sees her own double . The verses indicate that one of the mirrors may have caught the Shadow-Sickness , and doubled itself . And there is a further suggestion of the ghostly sympathy said to exist between a mirror and the soul of its possessor . III . =O-GAMA In the old Chinese and Japanese literature the toad is credited with supernatural capacities , such as the power to call down clouds , the power to make rain , the power to exhale from its mouth a magical mist which creates the most beautiful illusions . Some toads are good spirits ,  - -  friends of holy men ; and in Japanese art a famous Rishi called " Gama-Sennin " ( Toad Rishi ) is usually represented with a white toad resting upon his shoulder , or squatting beside him . Some toads are evil goblins , and create phantasms for the purpose of luring men to destruction . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be found in my " Kott=o , " entitled " The Story of Chug=or=o . " M'e wa kagami , Kuchi wa tarai no Hodo ni aku : Gama mo k'esh=o no Mono to kos=o shir'e . The eye of it , widely open , like a ( round ) mirror ; the mouth of it opening like a wash-basin -- by these things you may know that the Toad is a goblin-thing ( or , that the Toad is a toilet article ) . 32 Footnote 32 : There are two Japanese words , kesh=o , which in kana are written alike and pronounced alike , though represented by very different Chinese characters . As written in kana , the term kesh=o-no-mono may signify either " toilet articles " or " a monstrous being , " " a goblin . " IV . SHINKIR=O The term Shinkir=o is used in the meaning of " mirage , " and also as another name for H=orai , the Elf-land of Far Eastern fable . Various beings in Japanese myth are credited with power to delude mortals by creating a mirage of H=orai . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act of exhaling from its mouth a vapor that shapes the apparition of H=orai . But the creature especially wont to produce this illusion is the Hamaguri ,  - -  a Japanese mollusk much resembling a clam . Opening its shell , it sends into the air a purplish misty breath ; and that mist takes form and defines , in tints of mother-of-pearl , the luminous vision of H=orai and the palace of the Dragon-King . Hamaguri no Kuchi aku toki ya , Shinkir=o ! Yo ni shirar'e ken Tatsu-no-miya-him'e ! When the hamaguri opens its mouth -- lo ! Shinkir=o appears ! ... Then all can clearly see the Maiden-Princess of the Dragon-Palace . Shinkir=o --  Tatsu no miyako no Hinagata33 wo Shio-hi no oki ni Misuru hamaguri ! Lo ! in the offing at ebb-tide , the hamaguri makes visible the miniature image of Shinkir=o -- the Dragon-Capital ! Footnote 33 : Hinagata means especially " a model , " " a miniature copy , " " a drawn plan , " etc . V. ROKURO-KUBI The etymological meaning of Rokuro-Kubi can scarcely be indicated by any English rendering . The term rokuro is indifferently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulley , a capstan , a windlass , a turning lathe , and a potter 's wheel . Such renderings of Rokuro-Kubi as " Whirling-Neck " and " Rotating-Neck " are unsatisfactory ; for the idea which the term suggests to Japanese fancy is that of a neck which revolves , and lengthens or retracts according to the direction of the revolution .... As for the ghostly meaning of the expression , a Rokuro-Kubi is either ( 1 ) a person whose neck lengthens prodigiously during sleep , so that the head can wander about in all directions , seeking what it may devour , or ( 2 ) a person able to detach his or her head completely from the body , and to rejoin it to the neck afterwards . ( About this last mentioned variety of Rokuro-Kubi there is a curious story in my " Kwaidan , " translated from the Japanese . ) In Chinese mythology the being whose neck is so constructed as to allow of the head being completely detached belongs to a special class ; but in Japanese folk-tale this distinction is not always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rokuro-Kubi is that of drinking the oil in night-lamps . In Japanese pictures the Rokuro-Kubi is usually depicted as a woman ; and old books tell us that a woman might become a Rokuro-Kubi without knowing it ,  - -  much as a somnambulist walks about while asleep , without being aware of the fact .... The following verses about the Rokuro-Kubi have been selected from a group of twenty in the Ky=oka Hyaku-Monogatari :  --  Nemidar'e no Nagaki kami woba Furi-wak'et'e , Chi hiro ni nobasu Rokuro-Kubi kana ! Oh ! ... Shaking loose her long hair disheveled by sleep , the Rokuro-Kubi stretches her neck to the length of a thousand fathoms ! " Atama naki Bak'emono nari "  - -  to Rokuro-Kubi , Mit'e odorokan Onoga karada we . Will not the Rokuro-Kubi , viewing with astonishment her own body ( left behind ) cry out , " Oh , what a headless goblin have you become ! " Tsuka-no-ma ni Hari we tsutawaru , Rokuro-Kubi K'eta-k'eta warau --  Kao no kowasa yo ! Swiftly gliding along the roof-beam ( and among the props of the roof ) , the Rokuro-Kubi laughs with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her face ! 34 Footnote 34 : It is not possible to render all the double meanings in this composition . Tsuka-no-ma signifies " in a moment " or " quickly " ; but it may also mean " in the space ma between the roof-props " tsuka . " K'eta " means a cross-beam , but k'eta-k'eta warau means to chuckle or laugh in a mocking way . Ghosts are said to laugh with the sound of k'eta-k'eta . Roku shaku no By=obu ni nobiru Rokuro-Kubi Mit'e wa , go shaku no Mi wo chijimi-k'eri ! Beholding the Rokuro-Kubi rise up above the six-foot screen , any five-foot person would have become shortened by fear ( or , " the stature of any person five feet high would have been diminished " ) . 35 Footnote 35 : The ordinary height of a full screen is six Japanese feet . VI . YUKI-ONNA The Snow-Woman , or Snow-Spectre , assumes various forms ; but in most of the old folk-tales she appears as a beautiful phantom , whose embrace is death . ( A very curious story about her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yuki-Onna --  Yos=o kushi mo Atsu k=ori ; Sasu-k=ogai ya K=ori naruran . As for the Snow-Woman ,  - -  even her best comb , if I mistake not , is made of thick ice ; and her hair-pin36 , too , is probably made of ice . Footnote 36 : K=ogai is the name now given to a quadrangular bar of tortoise-shell passed under the coiffure , which leaves only the ends of the bar exposed . The true hair-pin is called kanzashi . Honrai wa K=u naru mono ka , Yuki-Onna ? Yoku-yoku mireba Ichi-butsu mo nashi ! Was she , then , a delusion from the very first , that Snow-Woman ,  - -  a thing that vanishes into empty space ? When I look carefully all about me , not one trace of her is to be seen ! Yo-ak'er'eba Ki'et'e yuku ' e wa Shirayuki37 no Onna to mishi mo Yanagi nari-keri ! Having vanished at daybreak ( that Snow-Woman ) , none could say whither she had gone . But what had seemed to be a snow-white woman became indeed a willow-tree ! Footnote 37 : The term shirayuki , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poets call Keny=ogen , or " double-purpose words . " Joined to the words immediately following , it makes the phrase " white-snow woman " ( shirayuki no onna ) ;  - -  united with the words immediately preceding , it suggests the reading , " whither-gone not-knowing " ( yuku ' e wa shirazu ) . Yuki-Onna Mit'e wa yasathiku , Matsu wo ori Nama-dak'e hishigu Chikara ari-keri ! Though the Snow-Woman appears to sight slender and gentle , yet , to snap the pine-trees asunder and to crush the live bamboos , she must have had strength . Samuk'esa ni Zotto38 wa sur'edo Yuki-Onna ,  --  Yuki or'e no naki Yanagi-goshi ka mo ! Though the Snow-Woman makes one shiver by her coldness , ah , the willowy grace of her form can not be broken by the snow ( i.e. charms us in spite of the cold ) . Footnote 38 : Zotto is a difficult word to render literally : perhaps the nearest English equivalent is " thrilling . " Zotto suru signifies " to cause a thrill " or " to give a shock , " or " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person it is said " Zotto-suru hodo no bijin , "  - -  meaning ! " She is so pretty that it gives one a shock merely to look at her . " The term yanagi-goshi ( " willow-loins " ) in the last line is a common expression designating a slender and graceful figure ; and the reader should observe that the first half of the term is ingeniously made to do double duty here ,  - -  suggesting , with the context , not only the grace of willow branches weighed down by snow , but also the grace of a human figure that one must stop to admire , in spite of the cold . VII . FUNA-Y=UR'E:I The spirits of the drowned are said to follow after ships , calling for a bucket or a water-dipper ( hishaku ) . To refuse the bucket or the dipper is dangerous ; but the bottom of the utensil should be knocked out before the request is complied with , and the spectres must not be allowed to see this operation performed . If an undamaged bucket or dipper be thrown to the ghosts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ship . These phantoms are commonly called Funa-Y=ur'e:i ( " Ship-Ghosts " ) . The spirits of those warriors of the H'e:ik'e clan who perished in the great sea-fight at Dan-no-ura , in the year 1185 , are famous among Funa-Y=ur'e:i . Ta:ira no Tomomori , one of the chiefs of the clan , is celebrated in this weird role : old pictures represent him , followed by the ghosts of his warriors , running over the waves to attack passing ships . Once he menaced a vessel in which Benk'e:i , the celebrated retainer of Yoshitsun'e , was voyaging ; and Benk'e:i was able to save the ship only by means of his Buddhist rosary , which frightened the spectres away .... Tomomori is frequently pictured as walking upon the sea , carrying a ship 's anchor on his back . He and his fellow-ghosts are said to have been in the habit of uprooting and making off with the anchors of vessels imprudently moored in their particular domain ,  - -  the neighborhood of Shimonos'eki . Erimoto y'e Mizu kak'eraruru Kokochi seri , " Hishaku kas'e " ch=o Fun'e no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been sprinkled with cold water ,  - -  so we felt while listening to the voice of the ship-ghost , saying :  --  " Lend me a dipper ! " 39 Footnote 39 : Hishaku , a wooden dipper with a long handle , used to transfer water from a bucket to smaller vessels . Y=urei ni Kasu-hishaku yori Ichi-hayaku Onor'e ga koshi mo Nuk'eru sench=o . The loins of the captain himself were knocked out very much more quickly than the bottom of the dipper that was to be given to the ghost. 40 Footnote 40 : The common expression Koshi ga nuk'eru ( to have one 's loins taken out ) means to be unable to stand up by reason of fear . The suggestion is that while the captain was trying to knock out the bottom of a dipper , before giving it to the ghost , he fell senseless from fright . Benk'e:i no Zuzu no kuriki ni Tomomori no Sugata mo ukamu --  Fun'e no y=ur'e:i . By the virtue of Benk'e:i 's rosary , even the ship-following ghost -- even the apparition of Tomomori -- is saved . Y=ur'e:i wa Ki @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Since any ghost must be an inhabitant of the Yellow Springs , how should a ghost appear on the Blue Sea-Plain ? 41 Footnote 41 : The Underworld of the Dead -- Yomi or K=osen -- is called " The Yellow Springs ; " these names being written with two Chinese characters respectively signifying " yellow " and " fountain . " A very ancient term for the ocean , frequently used in the old Shint=o rituals , is " The Blue Sea-Plain . " Sono sugata , Ikari wo =ot'e , Tsuki-mato:u Fun'e no h'esaki ya Tomomori no r'e:i ! That Shape , carrying the anchor on its back , and following after the ship -- now at the bow and now at the stern -- ah , the ghost of Tomomori. 42 Footnote 42 : There is an untranslatable play upon words in the last two lines . The above rendering includes two possible readings . Tsumi fukaki Umi ni shidzumishi , Y=ur'e:i no " Ukaman " tot'e ya ! Fun'e ni sugar'eru . Crying , " Now perchance I shall be saved ! " The ghost that sank into the deep Sea of Sin clings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is more weirdness in this poem than the above rendering suggests . The word ukaman in the fourth line can be rendered as " shall perhaps float , " or as " shall perhaps be saved " ( in the Buddhist sense of salvation ) , as there are two verbs ukami . According to an old superstition , the spirits of the drowned must continue to dwell in the waters until such time as they can lure the living to destruction . When the ghost of any drowned person succeeds in drowning somebody , it may be able to obtain rebirth , and to leave the sea forever . The exclamation of the ghost in this poem really means , " Now perhaps I shall be able to drown somebody . " ( A very similar superstition is said to exist on the Breton coast . ) A common Japanese saying about a child or any person who follows another too closely and persistently is : Kawa de shinda-y=ur'e:i no yona tsur'e-hoshigaru !  --  " Wants to follow you everywhere like the ghost of a drowned person . " Ukaman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Omo:i naruran . The ghosts following after our ship in their efforts to rise again ( or , " to be saved " ) might perhaps be the ( last vengeful ) thoughts of drowned men. 44 Footnote 44 : Here I can not attempt to render the various plays upon words ; but the term " omo:i " needs explanation . It means " thought " or " thoughts ; " but in colloquial phraseology it is often used as a euphemism for a dying person 's last desire of vengeance . In various dramas it has been used in the signification of " avenging ghost . " Thus the exclamation , " His thought has come back ! "  - -  in reference to a dead man -- really means : " His angry ghost appears ! " Uram'eshiki Sugata wa sugoki Yur'e:i no , Kaji we jama suru Fun'e no Tomomori . With vengeful aspect , the grisly ghost of Tomomori ( rises ) at the stern of the ship to hinder the play of her rudder. 45 Footnote 45 : There is a double meaning given by the use of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stern " of a ship ; mori means " to leak . " So the poem suggests that the ghost of Tomomori not only interferes with the ship 's rudder , but causes her to leak . Ochi-irit'e , Uwo no ' ejiki to Nari ni ken ;  --  Funa-y=ur'e:i mo Nama-kusaki kaz'e . Having perished in the sea , ( those H'e:ik'e ) would probably have become food for fishes . ( Anyhow , whenever ) the ship-following ghosts ( appear ) , the wind has a smell of raw fish ! 46 Footnote 46 : Namakusaki-kaze really means a wind having a " raw stench ; " but the smell of bait is suggested by the second line of the poem . A literal rendering is not possible in this case ; the art of the composition being altogether suggestive . VIII . H'E:IK'EGANI Readers can find in my " Kott=o " a paper about the H'e:ik'e-Crabs , which have on their upper shells various wrinklings that resemble the outlines of an angry face . At Shimono-s'eki dried specimens of these curious creatures are offered for sale .... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the H'e:ik'e warriors who perished at Dan-no-ura . Shiwo-hi ni wa S'e:izoro:e shit'e , H'e:ik'egani Ukiyo no sama we Yoko ni niramitsu . Marshaled ( on the beach ) at the ebb of the tide , the H'e:ik'e-crabs obliquely glare at the apparition of this miserable world. 47 Footnote 47 : Hi , the third syllable of the first line of the poem , does duty for hi , signifying " ebb , " and for hikata , " dry beach . " S'e:izoro:e is a noun signifying " battle-array "  - -  in the sense of the Roman term acies ;  - -  and s'e:izoro'e shit'e means " drawn up in battle-array . " Saikai ni Shizumi-nur'edomo , H'e:ik'egani K=ora no iro mo Yahari aka-hata . Though ( the H'e:ik'e ) long ago sank and perished in the Western Sea , the H'e:ik'e-crabs still display upon their upper shells the color of the Red Standard. 48 Footnote 48 : The ensign of the H'e:ik'e , or Ta:ira clan was red ; while that of their rivals , the Genji or Minamot=o , was white . Mak'e-ikusa Munen to mun'e ni Hasami ken ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pain of defeat , claws have grown on their breasts , I think ;  - -  even the faces of the H'e:ik'e-crabs have become crimson ( with anger and shame ) . Mikata mina Oshi-tsubusar'eshi H'e:ik'egani Ikon we mun'e ni Hasami mochik'eri . All the ( H'e:ik'e ) party having been utterly crushed , claws have grown upon the breasts of the H'e:ik'e-crabs because of the resentment in their hearts. 49 Footnote 49 : The use of the word hasami in the fifth line is a very good example of keny=ogen . There is a noun hasami , meaning the nippers of a crab , or a pair of scissors ; and there is a verb hasami , meaning to harbor , to cherish , or to entertain . ( Ikon wo hasamu means " to harbor resentment against . " ) Reading the word only in connection with those which follow it , we have the phrase hasami mochik'eri , " got claws ; " but , reading it with the words preceding , we have the expression ikon wo mun'e ni hasami , " resentment in their breasts nourishing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the word Yanari ,  - -  only telling us that it means the sound of the shaking of a house during an earthquake . But the word used to mean the noise of the shaking of a house moved by a goblin ; and the invisible shaker was also called Yanari . When , without apparent cause , some house would shudder and creak and groan in the night , folk used to suppose that it was being shaken from without by supernatural malevolence . Tokonoma ni Ik'eshi tachiki mo Taor'e-keri ; Yanari ni yama no Ugoku kak'emono ! Even the live tree set in the alcove has fallen down ; and the mountains in the hanging picture tremble to the quaking made by the Yanari ! 50 Footnote 50 : The tokonoma in a Japanese room is a sort of ornamental recess or alcove , in which a picture is usually hung , and vases of flowers , or a dwarf tree , are placed . X. SAKASA-BASHIRA The term Sakasa-bashira ( in these ky=oka often shortened into saka-bashira ) literally means " upside-down post . " A wooden post or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to the original position of the tree from which it was hewn ,  - -  that is to say , with the part nearest to the roots downward . To erect a house-post in the contrary way is thought to be unlucky ;  - -  formerly such a blunder was believed to involve unpleasant consequences of a ghostly kind , because an " upside-down " pillar would do malignant things . It would moan and groan in the night , and move all its cracks like mouths , and open all its knots like eyes . Moreover , the spirit of it ( for every house-post has a spirit ) would detach its long body from the timber , and wander about the rooms , head-downwards , making faces at people . Nor was this all . A Sakasa-bashira knew how to make all the affairs of a household go wrong ,  - -  how to foment domestic quarrels ,  - -  how to contrive misfortune for each of the family and the servants ,  - -  how to render existence almost insupportable until such time as the carpenter 's blunder should be discovered and remedied . Saka-bashira Tat'eshi wa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shiwaza naruran . Who set the house-pillar upside-down ? Surely that must have been the work of a man with a knot in his heart . Hidayama we Kiri-kit'e tat'eshi Saka-bashira --  Nanno takumi51 no Shiwaza naruran ? That house-pillar hewn in the mountains of Hida , and thence brought here and erected upside-down -- what carpenter 's work can it be ? ( or , " for what evil design can this deed have been done ? " ) Footnote 51 : The word takumi , as written in kana , may signify either " carpenter " or " intrigue , " " evil plot , " " wicked device . " Thus two readings are possible . According to one reading , the post was fixed upside-down through inadvertence ; according to the other , it was so fixed with malice prepense . U:e shita wo Chiga:et'e tat'eshi Hashira ni wa Sakasama-goto no Ur'e:i aranan . As for that house-pillar mistakenly planted upside-down , it will certainly cause adversity and sorrow. 52 Footnote 52 : Lit. , " **25;3527;TOOLONG . " Sakasama-goto , " up-side-down affair , " is a common expression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ni mimi Arit'e , kik'e to ka ? Sakashima ni Tateshi hashira ni Yanari suru oto ! O Ears that be in the wall ! 53 listen , will ye ? to the groaning and the creaking of the house-post that was planted upside-down ! Footnote 53 : Alluding to the proverb , Kab'e ni mimi ari ( " There are ears in the wall " ) , which signifies : " Be careful how you talk about other people , even in private . " Uri-iy'e no Aruji we to:eba , Oto arit'e : War'e m'e ga kuchi wo Aku saka-bashira . When I inquired for the master of the house that was for sale , there came to me only a strange sound by way of reply ,  - -  the sound of the upside-down house-post opening its eyes and mouth ! 54 ( i.e. its cracks ) . Footnote 54 : There is a pun in the fourth line which suggests more than even a free translation can express . War'e means " I , " or " mine , " or " one 's own , " etc. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) might be rendered " its own eyes . " But war'em'e ( one word ) means a crack , rent , split , or fissure . The reader should remember that the term saka-bashira means not only " upside-down post , " but also the goblin or spectre of the upside-down post . Omo:ikiya ! Sakasa-bashira no Hashira-kak'e Kakinishit uta mo Yamai ari to wa ! Who could have thought it !  - -  even the poem inscribed upon the pillar-tablet , attached to the pillar which was planted upside-down , has taken the same ( ghostly ) sickness. 55 Footnote 55 : That is to say , " Even the poem on the tablet is up-side-down , "  - -  all wrong . Hashira-kak'e ( " pillar-suspended thing " ) is the name given to a thin tablet of fine wood , inscribed or painted , which is hung to a post by way of ornament . XI . BAK'E-JIZ:O The figure of the Bodhi-sattva Jiz:o , the savior of children 's ghosts , is one of the most beautiful and humane in Japanese Buddhism . Statues of this divinity may be seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some statues of Jiz:o are said to do uncanny things -- such as to walk about at night in various disguises . A statue of this kind is called a Bak'e-Jiz=o56 ,  - -  meaning a Jiz=o ; that undergoes transformation . A conventional picture shows a little boy about to place the customary child's-offering of rice-cakes before the stone image of Jiz=o , not suspecting that the statue moves , and is slowly bending down towards him . Footnote 56 : Perhaps the term might be rendered " Shape-changing Jiz=o . " The verb bak'eru means to change shape , to undergo metamorphosis , to haunt , and many other supernatural things . Nanig'e naki Ishi no Jiz=o no Sugata sa:e , Yo wa osoroshiki Mikag'e to zo naki . Though the stone Jiz=o looks as if nothing were the matter with it , they say that at night it assumes an awful aspect ( or , " Though this image appears to be a common stone Jiz=o , they say that at night it becomes an awful Jiz=o ; of granite . " 57 ) Footnote 57 : The Japanese word for granite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mikag'e , applied to divinities and emperors , which signifies " august aspect , " " sacred presence , " etc .... No literal rendering can suggest the effect , in the fifth line , of the latter reading . Kag'e signifies " shadow , " " aspect , " and " power "  - -  especially occult power ; the honorific prefix mi , attached to names and attributes of divinities , may be rendered " august . " XII . UMI-B=OZU Place a large cuttlefish on a table , body upwards and tentacles downwards -- and you will have before you the grotesque reality that first suggested the fancy of the Umi-B=ozu , or Priest of the Sea . For the great bald body in this position , with the staring eyes below , bears a distorted resemblance to the shaven head of a priest ; while the crawling tentacles underneath ( which are in some species united by a dark web ) suggests the wavering motion of the priest 's upper robe .... The Umi-B=ozu figures a good deal in the literature of Japanese goblinry , and in the old-fashioned picture-books . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his prey . Ita hito:e Shita wa Jigoku ni , Sumizom'e no B=ozu no umi ni D'eru mo ayashina ! Since there is but the thickness of a single plank ( between the voyager and the sea ) , and underneath is Hell , ' t is indeed a weird thing that a black-robed priest should rise from the sea ( or , " ' t is surely a marvelous happening that , " etc. ! 58 ) Footnote 58 : The puns are too much for me .... Ayashii means " suspicious , " " marvelous , " " supernatural , " " weird , " " doubtful . "  - -  In the first two lines there is a reference to the Buddhist proverb : Funa-ita ichi-mai shita wa Jigoku ( " under the thickness of a single ship's-plank is Hell " ) . ( See my Gleanings in Buddha-Fields , p. 206 , for another reference to this saying . ) XIII . FUDA-H'EGASHI59 Homes are protected from evil spirits by holy texts and charms . In any Japanese village , or any city by-street , you can see these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not visible by day , when the sliding-doors have been pushed back into the tobukuro . Such texts are called o-fuda ( august scripts ) : they are written in Chinese characters upon strips of white paper , which are attached to the door with rice-paste ; and there are many kinds of them . Some are texts selected from sutras -- such as the Sutra of Transcendent Wisdom ( **29;3554;TOOLONG ) , or the Sutra of the Lotos of the Good Law ( **25;3585;TOOLONG ) . Some are texts from the dharanis ,  - -  which are magical . Some are invocations only , indicating the Buddhist sect of the household .... Besides these you may see various smaller texts , or little prints , pasted above or beside windows or apertures , some being names of Shinto gods ; others , symbolical pictures only , or pictures of Buddhas and Bodhi-sattvas . All are holy charms ,  - -  o- fuda : they protect the houses ; and no goblin or ghost can enter by night into a dwelling so protected , unless the o-fuda be removed . Footnote 59 : H'egashi is the causative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " " peel off , " " strip off , " " split off . " The term Fuda-h'egashi signifies " **26;3612;TOOLONG Ghost . " In my Ghostly Japan the reader can find a good Japanese story about a Fuda-h'egashi . Vengeful ghosts can not themselves remove an o-fuda ; but they will endeavor by threats or promises or bribes to make some person remove it for them . A ghost that wants to have the o-fuda pulled off a door is called a Fuda-h'egashi . H'egasan to Rokuji-no-fuda wo , Yur'e:i mo Nam'mai d=a to Kazo:et'e zo mini . Even the ghost that would remove the charms written with six characters actually tries to count them , repeating : " How many sheets are there ? " ( or , repeating , " Hail to thee , O Buddha Amit'abha ! " 60 ) Footnote 60 : The fourth line gives these two readings :  --  Nam'mai da ?  --  " How many sheets are there ? " Namu Amida !  --  " Hail , O Amitabha ! " The invocation , Namu Amida Butsu , is chiefly used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is also used by other sects , and especially in praying for the dead . While repeating it , the person praying numbers the utterances upon his Buddhist rosary ; and this custom is suggested by the use of the word kazo:et'e , " counting . " Tada ichi no Kami no o-fuda wa Sasuga ni mo Norik'e naku to mo H'egashi kan'ek'eri . Of the august written-charms of the god ( which were pasted upon the walls of the house ) , not even one could by any effort be pulled off , though the rice-paste with which they had been fastened was all gone . XIV . FURU-TSUBAKI The old Japanese , like the old Greeks , had their flower-spirits and their hamadryads , concerning whom some charming stories are told . They also believed in trees inhabited by malevolent beings ,  - -  goblin trees . Among other weird trees , the beautiful tsubaki ( Camellia Japonica ) was said to be an unlucky tree ;  - -  this was said , at least , of the red-flowering variety , the white-flowering kind having a better reputation and being prized as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habit : they detach themselves bodily from the stem , when they begin to fade ; and they fall with an audible thud . To old Japanese fancy the falling of these heavy red flowers was like the falling of human heads under the sword ; and the dull sound of their dropping was said to be like the thud made by a severed head striking the ground . Nevertheless the tsubaki seems to have been a favorite in Japanese gardens because of the beauty of its glossy foliage ; and its flowers were used for the decoration of alcoves . But in samurai homes it was a rule never to place tsubaki-flowers in an alcove during war-time . The reader will notice that in the following ky=oka -- which , as grotesques , seem to me the best in the collection -- the goblin-tsubaki is called furu-tsubaki , " old tsubaki .

As the flower-spirits and hamadryads of the Far East are as yet little known to Western readers , the following Chinese story may be found interesting . * * * * * There was a Chinese scholar -- called , in Japanese books , T=o no Busanshi -- who was famous for his love of flowers . He was particularly fond of peonies , and cultivated them with great skill and patience. 64 Footnote 64 : The tree-peony ( botan ) is here referred to ,  - -  a flower much esteemed in Japan . It is said to have been introduced from China during the eighth century ; and no less than five hundred varieties of it are now cultivated by Japanese gardeners . One day a very comely girl came to the house of Busanshi , and begged to be taken into his service . She said that circumstances obliged her to seek humble employment , but that she had received a literary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , into the service of a scholar . Busanshi was charmed by her beauty , and took her into his household without further questioning . She proved to be much more than a good domestic : indeed , the nature of her accomplishments made Busanshi suspect that she had been brought up in the court of some prince , or in the palace of some great lord . She displayed a perfect knowledge of the etiquette and the polite arts which are taught only to ladies of the highest rank ; and she possessed astonishing skill in calligraphy , in painting , and in every kind of poetical composition . Busanshi presently fell in love with her , and thought only of how to please her . When scholar-friends or other visitors of importance came to the house , he would send for the new maid that she might entertain and wait upon his guests ; and all who saw her were amazed by her grace and charm . One day Busanshi received a visit from the great Teki-Shin-Ketsu , a famous teacher of moral doctrine ; and the maid did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself to seek her , being desirous that Teki-Shin-Ketsu should see her and admire her ; but she was nowhere to be found . After having searched the whole house in vain , Busanshi was returning to the guest-room when he suddenly caught sight of the maid , gliding soundlessly before him along a corridor . He called to her , and hurried after her . Then she turned half-round , and flattened herself against the wall like a spider ; and as he reached her she sank backwards into the wall , so that there remained of her nothing visible but a colored shadow ,  - -  level like a picture painted on the plaster . But the shadow moved its lips and eyes , and spoke to him in a whisper , saying :  --  " Pardon me that I did not obey your august call ! ... I am not a mankind-person ;  - -  I am only the Soul of a Peony . Because you loved peonies so much , I was able to take human shape , and to serve you . But now this Teki-Shin-Ketsu has come ,  - -  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dare not keep this form any longer .... I must return to the place from which I came . " Then she sank back into the wall , and vanished altogether : there was nothing where she had been except the naked plaster . And Busanshi never saw her again . This story is written in a Chinese book which the Japanese call " Kai-ten-i-ji . " " ULTIMATE QUESTIONS " A memory of long ago .... I am walking upon a granite pavement that rings like iron , between buildings of granite bathed in the light of a cloudless noon . Shadows are short and sharp : there is no stir in the hot bright air ; and the sound of my footsteps , strangely loud , is the only sound in the street .... Suddenly an odd feeling comes to me , with a sort of tingling shock ,  - -  a feeling , or suspicion , of universal illusion . The pavement , the bulks of hewn stone , the iron rails , and all things visible , are dreams ! Light , color , form , weight , solidity -- all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one infinite ghostliness for which the language of man has not any word .... This experience had been produced by study of the first volume of the Synthetic Philosophy , which an American friend had taught me how to read . I did not find it easy reading ; partly because I am a slow thinker , but chiefly because my mind had never been trained to sustained effort in such directions . To learn the " First Principles " occupied me many months : no other volume of the series gave me equal trouble . I would read one section at a time ,  - -  rarely two ,  - -  never venturing upon a fresh section until I thought that I had made sure of the preceding . Very cautious and slow my progress was , like that of a man mounting , for the first time , a long series of ladders in darkness . Reaching the light at last , I caught a sudden new vision of things ,  - -  a momentary perception of the illusion of surfaces ,  - -  and from that time the world never again appeared to me quite the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * *  - -  This memory of more than twenty years ago , and the extraordinary thrill of the moment , were recently revived for me by the reading of the essay " Ultimate Questions , " in the last and not least precious volume bequeathed us by the world 's greatest thinker . The essay contains his final utterance about the riddle of life and death , as that riddle presented itself to his vast mind in the dusk of a lifetime of intellectual toil . Certainly the substance of what he had to tell us might have been inferred from the Synthetic Philosophy ; but the particular interest of this last essay is made by the writer 's expression of personal sentiment regarding the problem that troubles all deep thinkers . Perhaps few of us could have remained satisfied with his purely scientific position . Even while fully accepting his declaration of the identity of the power that " wells up in us under the form of consciousness " with that Power Unknowable which shapes all things , most disciples of the master must have longed for some chance to ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regard to the prospect of personal dissolution ? " And this merely emotional question he has answered as frankly and as fully as any of us could have desired , perhaps even more frankly . " Old people , " he remarks apologetically , " must have many reflections in common . Doubtless one which I have now in mind is very familiar . For years past , when watching the unfolding buds in the spring , there has arisen the thought , ' Shall I ever again see the buds unfold ? Shall I ever again be awakened at dawn by the song of the thrush ? ' Now that the end is not likely to be long postponed , there results an increasing tendency to meditate upon ultimate questions . " ... Then he tells us that these ultimate questions --  " of the How and the Why , of the Whence and the Whither "  - -  occupy much more space in the minds of those who can not accept the creed of Christendom , than the current conception fills in the minds of the majority of men . The enormity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have permitted themselves to think freely and widely and deeply , with all such aids to thought as exact science can furnish ; and the larger the knowledge of the thinker , the more pressing and tremendous the problem appears , and the more hopelessly unanswerable . To Herbert Spencer himself it must have assumed a vastness beyond the apprehension of the average mind ; and it weighed upon him more and more inexorably the nearer he approached to death . He could not avoid the conviction -- plainly suggested in his magnificent Psychology and in other volumes of his great work -- that there exists no rational evidence for any belief in the continuance of conscious personality after death :  --  " After studying primitive beliefs , and finding that there is no origin for the idea of an after-life , save the conclusion which the savage draws , from the notion suggested by dreams , of a wandering double which comes back on awaking , and which goes away for an indefinite time at death ;  - -  and after contemplating the inscrutable relation between brain and consciousness , and finding that we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the activity of the first ,  - -  we seem obliged to relinquish the thought that consciousness continues after physical organization has become inactive . " In this measured utterance there is no word of hope ; but there is at least a carefully stated doubt , which those who will may try to develop into the germ of a hope . The guarded phrase , " we seem obliged to relinquish , " certainly suggests that , although in the present state of human knowledge we have no reason to believe in the perpetuity of consciousness , some larger future knowledge might help us to a less forlorn prospect . From the prospect as it now appears even this mightiest of thinkers recoiled :  --  ... " But it seems a strange and repugnant conclusion that with the cessation of consciousness at death there ceases to be any knowledge of having existed . With his last breath it becomes to each the same thing as though he had never lived . " And then the consciousness itself -- what is it during the time that it continues ? And what becomes of it when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a specialized and individualized form of that Infinite and Eternal Energy which transcends both our knowledge and our imagination ; and that at death its elements lapse into that Infinite and Eternal Energy whence they were derived . " * * * * *  - -  With his last breath it becomes to each the same thing as though he had never lived ? To the individual , perhaps -- surely not to the humanity made wiser and better by his labors .... But the world must pass away : will it thereafter be the same for the universe as if humanity had never existed ? That might depend upon the possibilities of future inter-planetary communication .... But the whole universe of suns and planets must also perish : thereafter will it be the same as if no intelligent life had ever toiled and suffered upon those countless worlds ? We have at least the certainty that the energies of life can not be destroyed , and the strong probability that they will help to form another life and thought in universes yet to be evolved .... Nevertheless , allowing for all imagined possibilities , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past and all future conditioned-being ,  - -  the tremendous question remains : What signifies the whole of apparitional existence to the Unconditioned ? As flickers of sheet-lightning leave no record in the night , so in that Darkness a million billion trillion universes might come and go , and leave no trace of their having been . * * * * * To every aspect of the problem Herbert Spencer must have given thought ; but he has plainly declared that the human intellect , as at present constituted , can offer no solution . The greatest mind that this world has yet produced -- the mind that systematized all human knowledge , that revolutionized modern science , that dissipated materialism forever , that revealed to us the ghostly unity of all existence , that reestablished all ethics upon an immutable and eternal foundation ,  - -  the mind that could expound with equal lucidity , and by the same universal formula , the history of a gnat or the history of a sun -- confessed itself , before the Riddle of Existence , scarcely less helpless than the mind of a child . But for me the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that in its pathetic statement of uncertainties and probabilities one can discern something very much resembling a declaration of faith . Though assured that we have yet no foundation for any belief in the persistence of consciousness after the death of the brain , we are bidden to remember that the ultimate nature of consciousness remains inscrutable . Though we can not surmise the relation of consciousness to the unseen , we are reminded that it must be considered as a manifestation of the Infinite Energy , and that its elements , if dissociated by death , will return to the timeless and measureless Source of Life .... Science to-day also assures us that whatever existence has been -- all individual life that ever moved in animal or plant ,  - -  all feeling and thought that ever stirred in human consciousness -- must have flashed self-record beyond the sphere of sentiency ; and though we can not know , we can not help imagining that the best of such registration may be destined to perpetuity . On this latter subject , for obvious reasons , Herbert Spencer has remained silent ; but the reader may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " First Principles , "  - -  a paragraph dealing with the hypothesis that consciousness may belong to the cosmic ether . This hypothesis has not been lightly dismissed by him ; and even while proving its inadequacy , he seems to intimate that it may represent imperfectly some truth yet inapprehensible by the human mind :  --  " The only supposition having consistency is that that in which consciousness inheres is the all-pervading ether . This we know can be affected by molecules of matter in motion , and conversely can affect the motions of molecules ;  - -  as witness the action of light on the retina . In pursuance of this supposition we may assume that the ether , which pervades not only all space but all matter , is , under special conditions in certain parts of the nervous system , capable of being affected by the nervous changes in such way as to result in feeling , and is reciprocally capable under these conditions of affecting the nervous changes . But if we accept this explanation , we must assume that the potentiality of feeling is universal , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only under the extremely complex conditions occurring in certain nervous centres . This , however , is but a semblance of an explanation , since we know not what the ether is , and since , by confession of those most capable of judging , no hypothesis that has been framed accounts for all its powers . Such an explanation may be said to do no more than symbolize the phenomena by symbols of unknown natures . "  --  " First Principles , " Section 71 c , definitive edition of 1900.  --  " Inscrutable is this complex consciousness which has slowly evolved out of infantine vacuity -- consciousness which , in other shapes , is manifested by animate beings at large -- consciousness which , during the development of every creature , makes its appearance out of what seems unconscious matter ; suggesting the thought that consciousness , in some rudimentary form , is omnipresent. " 65 Footnote 65 : Autobiography , vol. ii , p. 470.  - -  Of all modern thinkers , Spencer was perhaps the most careful to avoid giving encouragement to any hypothesis unsupported by powerful evidence . Even the simple sum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reservation , as a statement of three probabilities : that consciousness represents a specialized and individualized form of the infinite Energy ; that it is dissolved by death ; and that its elements then return to the source of all being . As for our mental attitude toward the infinite Mystery , his advice is plain . We must resign ourselves to the eternal law , and endeavor to vanquish our ancient inheritance of superstitious terrors , remembering that , " merciless as is the Cosmic process worked out by an Unknown Power , yet vengeance is nowhere to be found in it . " 66 Footnote 66 : Facts and Comments , p. 201. * * * * * In the same brief essay there is another confession of singular interest , an acknowledgment of the terror of Space . To even the ordinary mind , the notion of infinite Space , as forced upon us by those monstrous facts of astronomy which require no serious study to apprehend , is terrifying ;  - -  I mean the mere vague idea of that everlasting Night into which the blazing of millions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the intellect of Herbert Spencer the idea of Space must have presented itself after a manner incomparably more mysterious and stupendous . The mathematician alone will comprehend the full significance of the paragraph dealing with the Geometry of Position and the mystery of space-relations , or the startling declaration that " even could we penetrate the mysteries of existence , there would remain still more transcendent mysteries . " But Herbert Spencer tells us that , apart from the conception of these geometrical mysteries , the problem of naked Space itself became for him , in the twilight of his age , an obsession and a dismay :  --  ... " And then comes the thought of this universal matrix itself , anteceding alike creation or evolution , whichever be assumed , and infinitely transcending both , alike in extent and duration ; since both , if conceived at all , must be conceived as having had beginnings , while Space had no beginning . The thought of this blank form of existence which , explored in all directions as far as imagination can reach , has , beyond that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has traversed is but infinitesimal ,  - -  the thought of a Space compared with which our immeasurable sidereal system dwindles to a point is a thought too overwhelming to be dwelt upon . Of late years the consciousness that without origin or cause infinite Space has ever existed and must ever exist , produces in me a feeling from which I shrink . " * * * * * How the idea of infinite Space may affect a mind incomparably more powerful than my own , I can not know ;  - -  neither can I divine the nature of certain problems which the laws of space-relation present to the geometrician . But when I try to determine the cause of the horror which that idea evokes within my own feeble imagination , I am able to distinguish different elements of the emotion ,  - -  particular forms of terror responding to particular ideas ( rational and irrational ) suggested by the revelations of science . One feeling -- perhaps the main element of the horror -- is made by the thought of being prisoned forever and ever within that unutterable Viewlessness which occupies infinite Space . Behind this feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  - -  there is also the idea of being perpetually penetrated , traversed , thrilled by the Nameless ;  - -  there is likewise the certainty that no least particle of innermost secret Self could shun the eternal touch of It ;  - -  there is furthermore the tremendous conviction that could the Self of me rush with the swiftness of light , with more than the swiftness of light ,  - -  beyond all galaxies , beyond durations of time so vast that Science knows no sign by which their magnitudes might be indicated ,  - -  and still flee onward , onward , downward , upward ,  - -  always , always ,  - -  never could that Self of me reach nearer to any verge , never speed farther from any centre . For , in that Silence , all vastitude and height and depth and time and direction are swallowed up : relation therein could have no meaning but for the speck of my fleeting consciousness ,  - -  atom of terror pulsating alone through atomless , soundless , nameless , illimitable potentiality . And the idea of that potentiality awakens another quality of horror ,  - -  the horror of infinite Possibility . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not at all ,  - -  so subtly that none can feel the flowing of its tides , yet so swiftly that no life-time would suffice to count the number of the oscillations which it makes within the fraction of one second ,  - -  thrills to us out of endlessness ;  - -  and the force of infinity dwells in its lightest tremor ; the weight of eternity presses behind its faintest shudder . To that phantom-Touch , the tinting of a blossom or the dissipation of a universe were equally facile : here it caresses the eye with the charm and illusion of color ; there it bestirs into being a cluster of giant suns . All that human mind is capable of conceiving as possible ( and how much also that human mind must forever remain incapable of conceiving ? ) may be wrought anywhere , everywhere , by a single tremor of that Abyss .... * * * * * Is it true , as some would have us believe , that the fear of the extinction of self is the terror supreme ? ... For the thought of personal perpetuity in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tongue can utter ,  - -  fugitive instants of a horror too vast to enter wholly into consciousness : a horror that can be endured in swift black glimpsings only . And the trust that we are one with the Absolute -- dim points of thrilling in the abyss of It -- can prove a consoling faith only to those who find themselves obliged to think that consciousness dissolves with the crumbling of the brain .... It seems to me that few ( or none ) dare to utter frankly those stupendous doubts and fears which force mortal intelligence to recoil upon itself at every fresh attempt to pass the barrier of the Knowable . Were that barrier unexpectedly pushed back ,  - -  were knowledge to be suddenly and vastly expanded beyond its present limits , perhaps we should find ourselves unable to endure the revelation .... * * * * * Mr. Percival Lowell 's astonishing book , " Mars , " sets one to thinking about the results of being able to hold communication with the habitants of an older and a wiser world , some race of beings more highly evolved than we , both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mysteries that still baffle our science . Perhaps , in such event , we should not find ourselves able to comprehend the methods , even could we borrow the results , of wisdom older than all our civilization by myriads or hundreds of myriads of years . But would not the sudden advent of larger knowledge from some elder planet prove for us , by reason , of the present moral condition of mankind , nothing less than a catastrophe ?  - -  might it not even result in the extinction of the human species ? ... The rule seems to be that the dissemination of dangerous higher knowledge , before the masses of a people are ethically prepared to receive it , will always be prevented by the conservative instinct ; and we have reason to suppose ( allowing for individual exceptions ) that the power to gain higher knowledge is developed only as the moral ability to profit by such knowledge is evolved . I fancy that if the power of holding intellectual converse with other worlds could now serve us , we should presently obtain it . But if , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let us suppose , of some method of ether-telegraphy ,  - -  this power were prematurely acquired , its exercise would in all probability be prohibited .... Imagine , for example , what would have happened during the Middle Ages to the person guilty of discovering means to communicate with the people of a neighboring planet ! Assuredly that inventor and his apparatus and his records would have been burned ; every trace and memory of his labors would have been extirpated . Even to-day the sudden discovery of truths unsupported by human experience , the sudden revelation of facts totally opposed to existing convictions , might evoke some frantic revival of superstitious terrors , some religious panic-fury that would strangle science , and replunge the world in mental darkness for a thousand years . THE MIRROR MAIDEN In the period of the Ashikaga Sh=ogunate the shrine of Ogawachi-My=ojin , at Minami-Is'e , fell into decay ; and the daimy=o of the district , the Lord Kitahatak'e , found himself unable , by reason of war and other circumstances , to provide for the reparation of the building . Then the Shint=o priest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the great daimy=o Hosokawa , who was known to have influence with the Sh=ogun . The Lord Hosokawa received the priest kindly , and promised to speak to the Sh=ogun about the condition of Ogawachi-My=ojin . But he said that , in any event , a grant for the restoration of the temple could not be made without due investigation and considerable delay ; and he advised Matsumura to remain in the capital while the matter was being arranged . Matsumura therefore brought his family to Ky=oto , and rented a house in the old Ky=ogoku quarter . This house , although handsome and spacious , had been long unoccupied . It was said to be an unlucky house . On the northeast side of it there was a well ; and several former tenants had drowned themselves in that well , without any known cause . But Matsumura , being a Shint=o priest , had no fear of evil spirits ; and he soon made himself very comfortable in his new home . * * * * * In the summer of that year there was a great drought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Home-Provinces ; the river-beds dried up , the wells failed ; and even in the capital there was a dearth of water . But the well in Matsumura 's garden remained nearly full ; and the water -- which was very cold and clear , with a faint bluish tinge -- seemed to be supplied by a spring . During the hot season many people came from all parts of the city to beg for water ; and Matsumura allowed them to draw as much as they pleased . Nevertheless the supply did not appear to be diminished . But one morning the dead body of a young servant , who had been sent from a neighboring residence to fetch water , was found floating in the well . No cause for a suicide could be imagined ; and Matsumura , remembering many unpleasant stories about the well , began to suspect some invisible malevolence . He went to examine the well , with the intention of having a fence built around it ; and while standing there alone he was startled by a sudden motion in the water , as of something alive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly reflected in the still surface , the figure of a young woman , apparently about nineteen or twenty years of age . She seemed to be occupied with her toilet : he distinctly saw her touching her lips with b'eni67 At first her face was visible in profile only ; but presently she turned towards him and smiled . Immediately he felt a strange shock at his heart , and a dizziness came upon him like the dizziness of wine , and everything became dark , except that smiling face ,  - -  white and beautiful as moonlight , and always seeming to grow more beautiful , and to be drawing him down -- down -- down into the darkness . But with a desperate effort he recovered his will and closed his eyes . When he opened them again , the face was gone , and the light had returned ; and he found himself leaning down over the curb of the well . A moment more of that dizziness ,  - -  a moment more of that dazzling lure ,  - -  and he would never again have looked upon the sun ... Footnote 67 : A kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Returning to the house , he gave orders to his people not to approach the well under any circumstances , or allow any person to draw water from it . And the next day he had a strong fence built round the well . * * * * * About a week after the fence had been built , the long drought was broken by a great rain-storm , accompanied by wind and lightning and thunder ,  - -  thunder so tremendous that the whole city shook to the rolling of it , as if shaken by an earthquake . For three days and three nights the downpour and the lightnings and the thunder continued ; and the Kamogawa rose as it had never risen before , carrying away many bridges . During the third night of the storm , at the Hour of the Ox , there was heard a knocking at the door of the priest 's dwelling , and the voice of a woman pleading for admittance . But Matsumura , warned by his experience at the well , forbade his servants to answer the appeal . He went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who calls ? " A feminine voice responded :  --  " Pardon ! it is I ,  - -  Yayoi ! 68 ... I have something to say to Matsumura Sama , something of great moment . Please open ! " ... Footnote 68 : This name , though uncommon , is still in use . Matsumura half opened the door , very cautiously ; and he saw the same beautiful face that had smiled upon him from the well . But it was not smiling now : it had a very sad look . " Into my house you shall not come , " the priest exclaimed . " You are not a human being , but a Well-Person .... Why do you thus wickedly try to delude and destroy people ? " The Well-Person made answer in a voice musical as a tinkling of jewels ( tama-wo-korogasu-ko:e. ) :  --  " It is of that very matter that I want to speak .... I have never wished to injure human beings . But from ancient time a Poison-Dragon dwelt in that well . He was the Master of the Well ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Long ago I fell into the water there , and so became subject to him ; and he had power to make me lure people to death , in order that he might drink their blood . But now the Heavenly Ruler has commanded the Dragon to dwell hereafter in the lake called Torii-no-Ik'e , in the Province of Shinsh=u ; and the gods have decided that he shall never be allowed to return to this city . So to-night , after he had gone away , I was able to come out , to beg for your kindly help . There is now very little water in the well , because of the Dragon 's departure ; and if you will order search to be made , my body will be found there . I pray you to save my body from the well without delay ; and I shall certainly return your benevolence . " ... So saying , she vanished into the night . * * * * * Before dawn the tempest had passed ; and when the sun arose there was no trace of cloud in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour for well-cleaners to search the well . Then , to everybody 's surprise , the well proved to be almost dry . It was easily cleaned ; and at the bottom of it were found some hair-ornaments of a very ancient fashion , and a metal mirror of curious form -- but no trace of any body , animal or human . Matusmura imagined , however , that the mirror might yield some explanation of the mystery ; for every such mirror is a weird thing , having a soul of its own ,  - -  and the soul of a mirror is feminine . This mirror , which seemed to be very old , was deeply crusted with scurf . But when it had been carefully cleaned , by the priest 's order , it proved to be of rare and costly workmanship ; and there were wonderful designs upon the back of it ,  - -  also several characters . Some of the characters had become indistinguishable ; but there could still be discerned part of a date , and ideographs signifying , " third month , the third day . " Now the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Month of Increase ) ; and the third day of the third month , which is a festival day , is still called Yayoi-no-sekku . Remembering that the Well-Person called herself " Yayoi , " Matsumura felt almost sure that his ghostly visitant had been none other than the Soul of the Mirror . He therefore resolved to treat the mirror with all the consideration due to a Spirit . After having caused it to be carefully repolished and resilvered , he had a case of precious wood made for it , and a particular room in the house prepared to receive it . On the evening of the same day that it had been respectfully deposited in that room , Yayoi herself unexpectedly appeared before the priest as he sat alone in his study . She looked even more lovely than before ; but the light of her beauty was now soft as the light of a summer moon shining through pure white clouds . After having humbly saluted Matsumura , she said in her sweetly tinkling voice :  --  " Now that you have saved me from solitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am indeed , as you supposed , the Spirit of the Mirror . It was in the time of the Emperor Saimei that I was first brought here from Kudara ; and I dwelt in the august residence until the time of the Emperor Saga , when I was augustly bestowed upon the Lady Kamo , Naishinn=o of the Imperial Court. 69 Thereafter I became an heirloom in the House of Fuji-wara , and so remained until the period of H=ogen , when I was dropped into the well . There I was left and forgotten during the years of the great war. 70 The Master of the Well71 was a venomous Dragon , who used to live in a lake that once covered a great part of this district . After the lake had been filled in , by government order , in order that houses might be built upon the place of it , the Dragon took possession of the well ; and when I fell into the well I became subject to him ; and he compelled me to lure many people to their deaths . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one more favor to beseech : I entreat that you will cause me to be offered up to the Sh=ogun , the Lord Yoshimasa , who by descent is related to my former possessors . Do me but this last great kindness , and it will bring you good-fortune .... But I have also to warn you of a danger . In this house , after to-morrow , you must not stay , because it will be destroyed . " ... And with these words of warning Yayoi disappeared .

Here we find the title " Master " given to a dragon living in a well ; but the guardian of wells is really the god Suijin. * * * * * Matsumura was able to profit by this premonition . He removed his people and his belongings to another district the next day ; and almost immediately afterwards another storm arose , even more violent than the first , causing a flood which swept away the house in which he had been residing . Some time later , by favor of the Lord Hosokawa , Matsumura was enabled to obtain an audience of the Sh=ogun Yoshimasa , to whom he presented the mirror , together with a written account of its wonderful history . Then the prediction of the Spirit of the Mirror was fulfilled ; for the Sh=ogun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bestowed costly presents upon Matsumura , but also made an ample grant of money for the rebuilding of the Temple of Ogawachi-My=ojin . THE STORY OF IT=O NORISUK'E In the town of Uji , in the province of Yamashiro , there lived , about six hundred years ago , a young samurai named It=o Tat'ewaki Norisuk'e , whose ancestors were of the H'e:ik'e clan . It=o was of handsome person and amiable character , a good scholar and apt at arms . But his family were poor ; and he had no patron among the military nobility ,  - -  so that his prospects were small . He lived in a very quiet way , devoting himself to the study of literature , and having ( says the Japanese story-teller ) " only the Moon and the Wind for friends . " One autumn evening , as he was taking a solitary walk in the neighborhood of the hill called Kotobikiyama , he happened to overtake a young girl who was following the same path . She was richly dressed , and seemed to be about eleven or twelve years old . It=o @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon be setting , damsel , and this is rather a lonesome place . May I ask if you have lost your way ? " She looked up at him with a bright smile , and answered deprecatingly : " Nay ! I am a miya-dzukai , 72 serving in this neighborhood ; and I have only a little way to go . " Footnote 72 : August-residence servant . By her use of the term miya-dzukai , It=o knew that the girl must be in the service of persons of rank ; and her statement surprised him , because he had never heard of any family of distinction residing in that vicinity . But he only said : " I am returning to Uji , where my home is . Perhaps you will allow me to accompany you on the way , as this is a very lonesome place . " She thanked him gracefully , seeming pleased by his offer ; and they walked on together , chatting as they went . She talked about the weather , the flowers , the butterflies , and the birds ; about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the famous sights of the capital , where she had been born ;  - -  and the moments passed pleasantly for It=o , as he listened to her fresh prattle . Presently , at a turn in the road , they entered a hamlet , densely shadowed by a grove of young trees . * * * * * Here I must interrupt the story to tell you that , without having actually seen them , you can not imagine how dark some Japanese country villages remain even in the brightest and hottest weather . In the neighborhood of T=oky=o itself there are many villages of this kind . At a short distance from such a settlement you see no houses : nothing is visible but a dense grove of evergreen trees . The grove , which is usually composed of young cedars and bamboos , serves to shelter the village from storms , and also to supply timber for various purposes . So closely are the trees planted that there is no room to pass between the trunks of them : they stand straight as masts , and mingle their crests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Each thatched cottage occupies a clear space in the plantation , the trees forming a fence about it , double the height of the building . Under the trees it is always twilight , even at high noon ; and the houses , morning or evening , are half in shadow . What makes the first impression of such a village almost disquieting is , not the transparent gloom , which has a certain weird charm of its own , but the stillness . There may be fifty or a hundred dwellings ; but you see nobody ; and you hear no sound but the twitter of invisible birds , the occasional crowing of cocks , and the shrilling of cicadae . Even the cicadae , however , find these groves too dim , and sing faintly ; being sun-lovers , they prefer the trees outside the village . I forgot to say that you may sometimes hear a viewless shuttle -- chaka-ton , chaka-ton ;  - -  but that familiar sound , in the great green silence , seems an elfish happening . The reason of the hush is simply that the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some feeble elders , have gone to the neighboring fields , the women carrying their babies on their backs ; and most of the children have gone to the nearest school , perhaps not less than a mile away . Verily , in these dim hushed villages , one seems to behold the mysterious perpetuation of conditions recorded in the texts of Kwang-Tze :  --  " The ancients who had the nourishment of the world wished for nothing , and the world had enough :  - -  they did nothing , and all things were transformed :  - -  their stillness was abysmal , and the people were all composed. " * * * * * ... The village was very dark when It=o reached it ; for the sun had set , and the after-glow made no twilight in the shadowing of the trees . " Now , kind sir , " the child said , pointing to a narrow lane opening upon the main road , " I have to go this way . " " Permit me , then , to see you home , " It=o responded ; and he turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his way . But the girl soon stopped before a small gate , dimly visible in the gloom ,  - -  a gate of trelliswork , beyond which the lights of a dwelling could be seen . " Here , " she said , " is the honorable residence in which I serve . As you have come thus far out of your way , kind sir , will you not deign to enter and to rest a while ? " It=o assented . He was pleased by the informal invitation ; and he wished to learn what persons of superior condition had chosen to reside in so lonesome a village . He knew that sometimes a family of rank would retire in this manner from public life , by reason of government displeasure or political trouble ; and he imagined that such might be the history of the occupants of the dwelling before him . Passing the gate , which his young guide opened for him , he found himself in a large quaint garden . A miniature landscape , traversed by a winding stream , was faintly distinguishable . " Deign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said ; " I go to announce the honorable coming ; " and hurried toward the house . It was a spacious house , but seemed very old , and built in the fashion of another time . The sliding doors were not closed ; but the lighted interior was concealed by a beautiful bamboo curtain extending along the gallery front . Behind it shadows were moving -- shadows of women ;  - -  and suddenly the music of a koto rippled into the night . So light and sweet was the playing that It=o could scarcely believe the evidence of his senses . A slumbrous feeling of delight stole over him as he listened ,  - -  a delight strangely mingled with sadness . He wondered how any woman could have learned to play thus ,  - -  wondered whether the player could be a woman ,  - -  wondered even whether he was hearing earthly music ; for enchantment seemed to have entered into his blood with the sound of it . * * * * * The soft music ceased ; and almost at the same moment It=o found the little miya-dzukai beside him . " Sir , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will honorably enter . " She conducted him to the entrance , where he removed his sandals ; and an aged woman , whom he thought to be the R=ojo , or matron of the household , came to welcome him at the threshold . The old woman then led him through many apartments to a large and well-lighted room in the rear of the house , and with many respectful salutations requested him to take the place of honor accorded to guests of distinction . He was surprised by the stateliness of the chamber , and the curious beauty of its decorations . Presently some maid-servants brought refreshments ; and he noticed that the cups and other vessels set before him were of rare and costly workmanship , and ornamented with a design indicating the high rank of the possessor . More and more he wondered what noble person had chosen this lonely retreat , and what happening could have inspired the wish for such solitude . But the aged attendant suddenly interrupted his reflections with the question : " Am I wrong in supposing that you are It=o Sama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bowed in assent . He had not told his name to the little miya-dzukai , and the manner of the inquiry startled him . " Please do not think my question rude , " continued the attendant . " An old woman like myself may ask questions without improper curiosity . When you came to the house , I thought that I knew your face ; and I asked your name only to clear away all doubt , before speaking of other matters . I have some thing of moment to tell you . You often pass through this village , and our young Him'egimi-Sama73 happened one morning to see you going by ; and ever since that moment she has been thinking about you , day and night . Indeed , she thought so much that she became ill ; and we have been very uneasy about her . For that reason I took means to find out your name and residence ; and I was on the point of sending you a letter when -- so unexpectedly ! you came to our gate with the little attendant . Now , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible ; it seems almost too fortunate a happening to be true ! Really I think that this meeting must have been brought about by the favor of Enmusubi-no-Kami ,  - -  that great God of Izumo who ties the knots of fortunate union . And now that so lucky a destiny has led you hither , perhaps you will not refuse -- if there be no obstacle in the way of such a union -- to make happy the heart of our Him'egimi-Sama ? " Footnote 73 : A scarcely translatable honorific title compounded of the word him'e ( princess ) and kimi ( sovereign , master or mistress , lord or lady , etc . ) . For the moment It=o did not know how to reply . If the old woman had spoken the truth , an extraordinary chance was being offered to him . Only a great passion could impel the daughter of a noble house to seek , of her own will , the affection of an obscure and masterless samurai , possessing neither wealth nor any sort of prospects . On the other hand , it was not in the honorable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking advantage of a feminine weakness . Moreover , the circumstances were disquietingly mysterious . Yet how to decline the proposal , so unexpectedly made , troubled him not a little . After a short silence , he replied :  --  " There would be no obstacle , as I have no wife , and no betrothed , and no relation with any woman . Until now I have lived with my parents ; and the matter of my marriage was never discussed by them . You must know that I am a poor samurai , without any patron among persons of rank ; and I did not wish to marry until I could find some chance to improve my condition . As to the proposal which you have done me the very great honor to make , I can only say that I know myself yet unworthy of the notice of any noble maiden . " The old woman smiled as if pleased by these words , and responded :  --  " Until you have seen our Him'egimi-Sama , it were better that you make no decision . Perhaps you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deign now to come with me , that I may present you to her . " She conducted him to another larger guest-room , where preparations for a feast had been made , and having shown him the place of honor , left him for a moment alone . She returned accompanied by the Him'egimi-Sama ; and , at the first sight of the young mistress , It=o felt again the strange thrill of wonder and delight that had come to him in the garden , as he listened to the music of the koto . Never had he dreamed of so beautiful a being . Light seemed to radiate from her presence , and to shine through her garments , as the light of the moon through flossy clouds ; her loosely flowing hair swayed about her as she moved , like the boughs of the drooping willow bestirred by the breezes of spring ; her lips were like flowers of the peach besprinkled with morning dew . It=o was bewildered by the vision . He asked himself whether he was not looking upon the person of **25;3640;TOOLONG herself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Smiling , the aged woman turned to the fair one , who remained speechless , with downcast eyes and flushing cheeks , and said to her :  --  " See , my child !  - -  at the moment when we could least have hoped for such a thing , the very person whom you wished to meet has come of his own accord . So fortunate a happening could have been brought about only by the will of the high gods . To think of it makes me weep for joy . " And she sobbed aloud . " But now , " she continued , wiping away her tears with her sleeve , " it only remains for you both -- unless either prove unwilling , which I doubt -- to pledge yourselves to each other , and to partake of your wedding feast . " * * * * * It=o answered by no word : the incomparable vision before him had numbed his will and tied his tongue . Maid-servants entered , bearing dishes and wine : the wedding feast was spread before the pair ; and the pledges were given . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the adventure , and the wonder of the beauty of the bride , still bewildered him . A gladness , beyond aught that he had ever known before , filled his heart -- like a great silence . But gradually he recovered his wonted calm ; and thereafter he found himself able to converse without embarrassment . Of the wine he partook freely ; and he ventured to speak , in a self-depreciating but merry way , about the doubts and fears that had oppressed him . Meanwhile the bride remained still as moonlight , never lifting her eyes , and replying only by a blush or a smile when he addressed her . It=o said to the aged attendant :  --  " Many times , in my solitary walks , I have passed through this village without knowing of the existence of this honorable dwelling . And ever since entering here , I have been wondering why this noble household should have chosen so lonesome a place of sojourn .... Now that your Him'egimi-Sama and I have become pledged to each other , it seems to me a strange thing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family . " At this utterance , a shadow passed over the kindly face of the old woman ; and the bride , who had yet hardly spoken , turned pale , and appeared to become painfully anxious . After some moments of silence , the aged woman responded :  --  " To keep our secret from you much longer would be difficult ; and I think that , under any circumstances , you should be made aware of the facts , now that you are one of us . Know then , Sir It=o , that your bride is the daughter of Shig'ehira-Ky=o , the great and unfortunate San-mi Ch:uj=o . " At those words --  " Shig'ehira-Ky=o , San-mi Ch:uj=o "  - -  the young samurai felt a chill , as of ice , strike through all his veins . Shig'ehira-Ky=o , the great H'e:ik'e general and statesman , had been dust for centuries . And It=o suddenly understood that everything around him -- the chamber and the lights and the banquet -- was a dream of the past ; that the forms before him were not people , but shadows of people dead . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the charm returned , and seemed to deepen about him ; and he felt no fear . Though his bride had come to him out of Yomi , out of the place of the Yellow Springs of death , his heart had been wholly won . Who weds a ghost must become a ghost ;  - -  yet he knew himself ready to die , not once , but many times , rather than betray by word or look one thought that might bring a shadow of pain to the brow of the beautiful illusion before him . Of the affection proffered he had no misgiving : the truth had been told him when any unloving purpose might better have been served by deception . But these thoughts and emotions passed in a flash , leaving him resolved to accept the strange situation as it had presented itself , and to act just as he would have done if chosen , in the years of J:u-ei , by Shig'ehira 's daughter . " Ah , the pity of it ! " he exclaimed ; " I have heard of the cruel fate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responded the aged woman , sobbing as she spoke ;  --  " it was indeed a cruel fate . His horse , you know , was killed by an arrow , and fell upon him ; and when he called for help , those who had lived upon his bounty deserted him in his need . Then he was taken prisoner , and sent to Kamakura , where they treated him shamefully , and at last put him to death. 74 His wife and child -- this dear maid here -- were then in hiding ; for everywhere the H'e:ik'e were being sought out and killed . When the news of the Lord Shig'ehira 's death reached us , the pain proved too great for the mother to bear , so the child was left with no one to care for her but me ,  - -  since her kindred had all perished or disappeared . She was only five years old . I had been her milk-nurse , and I did what I could for her . Year after year we wandered from place to place , traveling in pilgrim-garb .... But these tales of grief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her tears ;  --  " pardon the foolish heart of an old woman who can not forget the past . See ! the little maid whom I fostered has now become a Him'egimi-Sama indeed !  - -  were we living in the good days of the Emperor Takakura , what a destiny might be reserved for her ! However , she has obtained the husband whom she desired ; that is the greatest happiness .... But the hour is late . The bridal-chamber has been prepared ; and I must now leave you to care for each other until morning . " Footnote 74 : Shig'ehira , after a brave fight in defense of the capital ,  - -  then held by the Ta:ira ( or H'e:ik'e ) party ,  - -  was surprised and routed by Yoshitsun'e , leader of the Minamoto forces . A soldier named Iy'enaga , who was a skilled archer , shot down Shig'ehira 's horse ; and Shig'ehira fell under the struggling animal . He cried to an attendant to bring another horse ; but the man fled . Shig'ehira was then captured by Iy'enaga , and eventually given up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to be sent in a cage to Kamakura . There , after sundry humiliations , he was treated for a time with consideration , having been able , by a Chinese poem , to touch even the cruel heart of Yoritomo . But in the following year he was executed by request of the Buddhist priests of Nanto , against whom he had formerly waged war by order of Kiyomori . She rose , and sliding back the screens parting the guest-room from the adjoining chamber , ushered them to their sleeping apartment . Then , with many words of joy and congratulation , she withdrew ; and It=o was left alone with his bride . As they reposed together , It=o said :  --  " Tell me , my loved one , when was it that you first wished to have me for your husband . " ( For everything appeared so real that he had almost ceased to think of the illusion woven around him . ) She answered , in a voice like a dove 's voice :  --  " My august lord and husband , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with my foster-mother , that I saw you for the first time . And because of seeing you , the world became changed to me from that hour and moment . But you do not remember , because our meeting was not in this , your present life : it was very , very long ago . Since that time you have passed through many deaths and births , and have had many comely bodies . But I have remained always that which you see me now : I could not obtain another body , nor enter into another state of existence , because of my great wish for you . My dear lord and husband , I have waited for you through many ages of men . " And the bridegroom felt nowise afraid at hearing these strange words , but desired nothing more in life , or in all his lives to come , than to feel her arms about him , and to hear the caress of her voice . * * * * * But the pealing of a temple-bell proclaimed the coming of dawn . Birds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees a-whispering . Suddenly the old nurse pushed apart the sliding screens of the bridal-chamber , and exclaimed :  --  " My children , it is time to separate ! By daylight you must not be together , even for an instant : that were fatal ! You must bid each other good-by . " Without a word , It=o made ready to depart . He vaguely understood the warning uttered , and resigned himself wholly to destiny . His will belonged to him no more ; he desired only to please his shadowy bride . She placed in his hands a little suzuri , or ink-stone , curiously carved , and said :  --  " My young lord and husband is a scholar ; therefore this small gift will probably not be despised by him . It is of strange fashion because it is old , having been augustly bestowed upon my father by the favor of the Emperor Takakura . For that reason only , I thought it to be a precious thing . " It=o , in return , besought her to accept for a remembrance the k=ogai75 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of silver and gold , representing plum-flowers and nightingales . Footnote 75 : This was the name given to a pair of metal rods attached to a sword-sheath , and used like chop-sticks . They were sometimes exquisitely ornamented . Then the little miya-dzukai came to guide him through the garden , and his bride with her foster-mother accompanied him to the threshold . As he turned at the foot of the steps to make his parting salute , the old woman said :  --  " We shall meet again the next Year of the Boar , at the same hour of the same day of the same month that you came here . This being the Year of the Tiger , you will have to wait ten years . But , for reasons which I must not say , we shall not be able to meet again in this place ; we are going to the neighborhood of Ky=oto , where the good Emperor Takakura and our fathers and many of our people are dwelling . All the H'e:ik'e will be rejoiced by your coming . We shall send a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 76 : A kind of palanquin. * * * * * Above the village the stars were burning as It=o passed the gate ; but on reaching the open road he saw the dawn brightening beyond leagues of silent fields . In his bosom he carried the gift of his bride . The charm of her voice lingered in his ears ,  - -  and nevertheless , had it not been for the memento which he touched with questioning fingers , he could have persuaded himself that the memories of the night were memories of sleep , and that his life still belonged to him . But the certainty that he had doomed himself evoked no least regret : he was troubled only by the pain of separation , and the thought of the seasons that would have to pass before the illusion could be renewed for him . Ten years !  - -  and every day of those years would seem how long ! The mystery of the delay he could not hope to solve ; the secret ways of the dead are known to the gods alone . * * * * * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revisited the village at Kotobikiyama , vaguely hoping to obtain another glimpse of the past . But never again , by night or by day , was he able to find the rustic gate in the shadowed lane ; never again could he perceive the figure of the little miya-dzukai , walking alone in the sunset-glow . The village people , whom he questioned carefully , thought him bewitched . No person of rank , they said , had ever dwelt in the settlement ; and there had never been , in the neighborhood , any such garden as he described . But there had once been a great Buddhist temple near the place of which he spoke ; and some gravestones of the temple-cemetery were still to be seen . It=o discovered the monuments in the middle of a dense thicket . They were of an ancient Chinese form , and were covered with moss and lichens . The characters that had been cut upon them could no longer be deciphered. * * * * * Of his adventure It=o spoke to no one . But friends and kindred soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Day by day he seemed to become more pale and thin , though physicians declared that he had no bodily ailment ; he looked like a ghost , and moved like a shadow . Thoughtful and solitary he had always been , but now he appeared indifferent to everything which had formerly given him pleasure ,  - -  even to those literary studies by means of which he might have hoped to win distinction . To his mother -- who thought that marriage might quicken his former ambition , and revive his interest in life -- he said that he had made a vow to marry no living woman . And the months dragged by . At last came the Year of the Boar , and the season of autumn ; but I to could no longer take the solitary walks that he loved . He could not even rise from his bed . His life was ebbing , though none could divine the cause ; and he slept so deeply and so long that his sleep was often mistaken for death . Out of such a sleep he was startled , one bright evening , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his bedside the little miya-dsukai who had guided him , ten years before , to the gate of the vanished garden . She saluted him , and smiled , and said : " I am bidden to tell you that you will be received to-night at : Ohara , near Ky=oto , where the new home is , and that a kago has been sent for you . " Then she disappeared . It=o knew that he was being summoned away from the light of the sun ; but the message so rejoiced him that he found strength to sit up and call his mother . To her he then for the first time related the story of his bridal , and he showed her the ink-stone which had been given him . He asked that it should be placed in his coffin ,  - -  and then he died . * * * * * The ink-stone was buried with him . But before the funeral ceremonies it was examined by experts , who said that it had been made in the period of J=o-an ( 1169 A.D. ) , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the time of the Emperor Takakura . STRANGER THAN FICTION It was a perfect West Indian day . My friend the notary and I were crossing the island by a wonderful road which wound up through tropic forest to the clouds , and thence looped down again , through gold-green slopes of cane , and scenery amazing of violet and blue and ghost-gray peaks , to the roaring coast of the trade winds . All the morning we had been ascending ,  - -  walking after our carriage , most of the time , for the sake of the brave little mule ;  - -  and the sea had been climbing behind us till it looked like a monstrous wall of blue , pansy-blue , under the ever heightening horizon . The heat was like the heat of a vapor-bath , but the air was good to breathe with its tropical odor , an odor made up of smells of strange saps , queer spicy scents of mould , exhalations of aromatic decay . Moreover , the views were glimpses of Paradise ; and it was a joy to watch the torrents roaring down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend stopped the carriage before a gateway set into a hedge full of flowers that looked like pink-and-white butterflies . " I have to make a call here , " he said ;  --  " come in with me . " We dismounted , and he knocked on the gate with the butt of his whip . Within , at the end of a shady garden , I could see the porch of a planter 's house ; beyond were rows of cocoa palms , and glimpses of yellowing cane . Presently a negro , wearing only a pair of canvas trousers and a great straw hat , came hobbling to open the gate ,  - -  followed by a multitude , an astonishing multitude , of chippering chickens . Under the shadow of that huge straw hat I could not see the negro 's face ; but I noticed that his limbs and body were strangely shrunken ,  - -  looked as if withered to the bone . A weirder creature I had never beheld ; and I wondered at his following of chickens . " Eh ! " exclaimed the notary , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to see Madame Floran . " " Moin k'e di , " the goblin responded huskily , in his patois ; and he limped on before us , all the chickens hopping and cheeping at his withered heels . " That fellow , " my friend observed , " was bitten by a fer-de-lance about eight or nine years ago . He got cured , or at least half-cured , in some extraordinary way ; but ever since then he has been a skeleton . See how he limps ! " The skeleton passed out of sight behind the house , and we waited a while at the front porch . Then a m'etisse -- turbaned in wasp colors , and robed in iris colors , and wonderful to behold -- came to tell us that Madame hoped we would rest ourselves in the garden , as the house was very warm . Chairs and a little table were then set for us in a shady place , and the m'etisse brought out lemons , sugar-syrup , a bottle of the clear plantation rum that smells like apple juice , and ice-cold water in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the refreshments ; and then our hostess came to greet us , and to sit with us ,  - -  a nice old lady with hair like newly minted silver . I had never seen a smile sweeter than that with which she bade us welcome ; and I wondered whether she could ever have been more charming in her Creole girlhood than she now appeared , with her kindly wrinkles , and argent hair , and frank , black , sparkling eyes .... * * * * * In the conversation that followed I was not able to take part , as it related only to some question of title . The notary soon arranged whatever there was to arrange ; and , after some charmingly spoken words of farewell from the gentle lady , we took our departure . Again the mummified negro hobbled before us , to open the gate ,  - -  followed by all his callow rabble of chickens . As we resumed our places in the carriage we could still hear the chippering of the creatures , pursuing after that ancient scarecrow . " Is it African sorcery ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chickens ? " " Queer -- is it not ? " the notary responded as we drove away . " That negro must now be at least eighty years old ; and he may live for twenty years more ,  - -  the wretch ! " The tone in which my friend uttered this epithet -- le miserable !  - -  somewhat surprised me , as I knew him to be one of the kindliest men in the world , and singularly free from prejudice . I suspected that a story was coming , and I waited for it in silence . " Listen , " said the notary , after a pause , during which we left the plantation well behind us ; " that old sorcerer , as you call him , was born upon the estate , a slave . The estate belonged to M. Floran ,  - -  the husband of the lady whom we visited ; and she was a cousin , and the marriage was a love-match . They had been married about two years when the revolt occurred ( fortunately there were no children ) ,  - -  the black revolt of eighteen hundred and forty-eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the first to be killed . And the old negro whom we saw to-day -- the old sorcerer , as you call him -- left the plantation , and joined the rising : do you understand ? " " Yes , " I said ; " but he might have done that through fear of the mob . " " Certainly : the other hands did the same . But it was he that killed M. Floran , for no reason whatever ,  - -  cut him up with a cutlass . M. Floran was riding home when the attack was made ,  - -  about a mile below the plantation .... Sober , that negro would not have dared to face M. Floran : the scoundrel was drunk , of course ,  - -  raving drunk . Most of the blacks had been drinking tafia , with dead wasps in it , to give themselves courage . " " But , " I interrupted , " how does it happen that the fellow is still on the Floran plantation ? " " Wait a moment ! ... When the military got control of the mob , search was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could not be found . He was lying out in the cane ,  - -  in M. Floran 's cane !  - -  like a field-rat , like a snake . One morning , while the gendarmes were still looking for him , he rushed into the house , and threw himself down in front of Madame , weeping and screaming , ' A:ie-ya:ie-ya:ie-ya:ie !  - -  moin t'e tchou'e y ! moin t'e tchou'e y !  -- a:ie-ya:ie-ya:ie ! ' Those were his very words :  - -  'I killed him ! I killed him ! ' And he begged for mercy . When he was asked why he killed M. Floran , he cried out that it was the devil -- diabe-a -- that had made him do it ! ... Well , Madame forgave him ! " " But how could she ? " I queried . " Oh , she had always been very religious , " my friend responded ,  --  " sincerely religious . She only said , ' May God pardon me as I now pardon you !

" A LETTER FROM JAPAN Tokyo , August 1 , 1904 . Here , in this quiet suburb , where the green peace is broken only by the voices of children at play and the shrilling of cicadae , it is difficult to imagine that , a few hundred miles away , there is being carried on one of the most tremendous wars of modern times , between armies aggregating more than half a million of men , or that , on the intervening sea , a hundred ships of war have been battling . This contest , between the mightiest of Western powers and a people that began to study Western science only within the recollection of many persons still in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a struggle for national existence . It was inevitable , this struggle , might perhaps have been delayed , but certainly not averted . Japan has boldly challenged an empire capable of threatening simultaneously the civilizations of the East and the West ,  - -  a mediaeval power that , unless vigorously checked , seems destined to absorb Scandinavia and to dominate China . For all industrial civilization the contest is one of vast moment ;  - -  for Japan it is probably the supreme crisis in her national life . As to what her fleets and her armies have been doing , the world is fully informed ; but as to what her people are doing at home , little has been written . To inexperienced observation they would appear to be doing nothing unusual ; and this strange calm is worthy of record . At the beginning of hostilities an Imperial mandate was issued , bidding all non-combatants to pursue their avocations as usual , and to trouble themselves as little as possible about exterior events ;  - -  and this command has been obeyed to the letter . It would be natural to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the contest had thrown their gloom over the life of the capital in especial ; but there is really nothing whatever to indicate a condition of anxiety or depression . On the contrary , one is astonished by the joyous tone of public confidence , and the admirably restrained pride of the nation in its victories . Western tides have strewn the coast with Japanese corpses ; regiments have been blown out of existence in the storming of positions defended by wire-entanglements ; battleships have been lost : yet at no moment has there been the least public excitement . The people are following their daily occupations just as they did before the war ; the cheery aspect of things is just the same ; the theatres and flower displays are not less well patronized . The life of T=oky=o has been , to outward seeming , hardly more affected by the events of the war than the life of nature beyond it , where the flowers are blooming and the butterflies hovering as in other summers . Except after the news of some great victory ,  - -  celebrated with fireworks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotion ; and but for the frequent distribution of newspaper extras , by runners ringing bells , you could almost persuade yourself that the whole story of the war is an evil dream . Yet there has been , of necessity , a vast amount of suffering -- viewless and voiceless suffering -- repressed by that sense of social and patriotic duty which is Japanese religion . As a seventeen-syllable poem of the hour tells us , the news of every victory must bring pain as well as joy :  --  G=ogwai no Tabi teki mikata Gok'e ga fue . Each time that an extra is circulated the widows of foes and friends have increased in multitude . The great quiet and the smiling tearlessness testify to the more than Spartan discipline of the race . Anciently the people were trained , not only to conceal their emotions , but to speak in a cheerful voice and to show a pleasant face under any stress of moral suffering ; and they are obedient to that teaching to-day . It would still be thought a shame to betray personal sorrow for the loss of those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view the events of the war as they would watch the scenes of a popular play . They are interested without being excited ; and their extraordinary self-control is particularly shown in various manifestations of the " Play-impulse . " Everywhere the theatres are producing war dramas ( based upon actual fact ) ; the newspapers and magazines are publishing war stories and novels ; the cinematograph exhibits the monstrous methods of modern warfare ; and numberless industries are turning out objects of art or utility designed to commemorate the Japanese triumphs . But the present psychological condition , the cheerful and even playful tone of public feeling , can be indicated less by any general statement than by the mention of ordinary facts ,  - -  every- day matters recorded in the writer 's diary . * * * * * Never before were the photographers so busy ; it is said that they have not been able to fulfill half of the demands made upon them . The hundreds of thousands of men sent to the war wished to leave photographs with their families , and also to take with them portraits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The nation was being photographed during the past six months . A fact of sociological interest is that photography has added something new to the poetry of the domestic faith . From the time of its first introduction , photography became popular in Japan ; and none of those superstitions , which inspire fear of the camera among less civilized races , offered any obstacle to the rapid development of a new industry . It is true that there exists some queer-folk beliefs about photographs ,  - -  ideas of mysterious relation between the sun-picture and the person imaged . For example : if , in the photograph of a group , one figure appear indistinct or blurred , that is thought to be an omen of sickness or death . But this superstition has its industrial value : it has compelled photographers to be careful about their work ,  - -  especially in these days of war , when everybody wants to have a good clear portrait , because the portrait might be needed for another purpose than preservation in an album . During the last twenty years there has gradually come into existence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , brother , husband , or child , beside the mortuary tablet kept in the Buddhist household shrine . For this reason , also , the departing soldier wishes to leave at home a good likeness of himself . The rites of domestic affection , in old samurai families , are not confined to the cult of the dead . On certain occasions , the picture of the absent parent , husband , brother , or betrothed , is placed in the alcove of the guest-room , and a feast laid out before it . The photograph , in such cases , is fixed upon a little stand ( dai ) ; and the feast is served as if the person were present . This pretty custom of preparing a meal for the absent is probably more ancient than any art of portraiture ; but the modern photograph adds to the human poetry of the rite . In feudal time it was the rule to set the repast facing the direction in which the absent person had gone -- north , south , east , or west . After a brief interval the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and examined . If the lacquered inner surface was thickly beaded with vapor , all was well ; but if the surface was dry , that was an omen of death , a sign that the disembodied spirit had returned to absorb the essence of the offerings . * * * * * As might have been expected , in a country where the " play-impulse " is stronger , perhaps , than in any other part of the world , the Zeitgeist found manifestation in the flower displays of the year . I visited those in my neighborhood , which is the Quarter of the Gardeners . This quarter is famous for its azaleas ( tsutsuji ) ; and every spring the azalea gardens attract thousands of visitors , not only by the wonderful exhibition then made of shrubs which look like solid masses of blossom ( ranging up from snowy white , through all shades of pink , to a flamboyant purple ) but also by displays of effigies : groups of figures ingeniously formed with living leaves and flowers . These figures , life-size , usually represent famous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all -- the bodies and the costumes are composed of foliage and flowers trained to grow about a framework ; while the faces , feet , and hands are represented by some kind of flesh-colored composition . This year , however , a majority of the displays represented scenes of the war , such as an engagement between Japanese infantry and mounted Cossacks , a night attack by torpedo boats , the sinking of a battleship . In the last-mentioned display , Russian bluejackets appeared , swimming for their lives in a rough sea ;  - -  the pasteboard waves and the swimming figures being made to rise and fall by the pulling of a string ; while the crackling of quick-firing guns was imitated by a mechanism contrived with sheets of zinc . It is said that Admiral T=og=o sent to T=oky=o for some flowering-trees in pots -- inasmuch as his responsibilities allowed him no chance of seeing the cherry-flowers and the plum-blossoms in their season ,  - -  and that the gardeners responded even too generously . * * * * * Almost immediately after the beginning of hostilities , thousands of " war pictures " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better than those of the prints issued at the time of the war with China ; but the details were to a great extent imaginary ,  - -  altogether imaginary as to the appearance of Russian troops . Pictures of the engagements with the Russian fleet were effective , despite some lurid exaggeration . The most startling things were pictures of Russian defeats in Korea , published before a single military engagement had taken place ;  - -  the artist had " flushed to anticipate the scene . " In these prints the Russians were depicted as fleeing in utter rout , leaving their officers -- very fine-looking officers -- dead upon the field ; while the Japanese infantry , with dreadfully determined faces , were coming up at a double . The propriety and the wisdom of thus pictorially predicting victory , and easy victory to boot , may be questioned . But I am told that the custom of so doing is an old one ; and it is thought that to realize the common hope thus imaginatively is lucky . At all events , there is no attempt at deception in these pictorial undertakings ;  - -  they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought to be pleasing to the gods . Some of the earlier pictures have now been realized in grim fact . The victories in China had been similarly foreshadowed : they amply justified the faith of the artist .... To-day the war pictures continue to multiply ; but they have changed character . The inexorable truth of the photograph , and the sketches of the war correspondent , now bring all the vividness and violence of fact to help the artist 's imagination . There was something na:ive and theatrical in the drawings of anticipation ; but the pictures of the hour represent the most tragic reality ,  - -  always becoming more terrible . At this writing , Japan has yet lost no single battle ; but not a few of her victories have been dearly won . To enumerate even a tenth of the various articles ornamented with designs inspired by the war -- articles such as combs , clasps , fans , brooches , card-cases , purses -- would require a volume . Even cakes and confectionery are stamped with naval or military designs ; and the glass or paper windows of shops -- not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At night the shop lanterns proclaim the pride of the nation in its fleets and armies ; and a whole chapter might easily be written about the new designs in transparencies and toy lanterns . A new revolving lantern -- turned by the air-current which its own flame creates -- has become very popular . It represents a charge of Japanese infantry upon Russian defenses ; and holes pierced in the colored paper , so as to produce a continuous vivid flashing while the transparency revolves , suggest the exploding of shells and the volleying of machine guns . Some displays of the art-impulse , as inspired by the war , have been made in directions entirely unfamiliar to Western experience ,  - -  in the manufacture , for example , of women 's hair ornaments and dress materials . Dress goods decorated with war pictures have actually become a fashion ,  - -  especially crepe silks for underwear , and figured silk linings for cloaks and sleeves . More remarkable than these are the new hairpins ;  - -  by hairpins I mean those long double-pronged ornaments of flexible metal which are called kanzashi , and are more or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( The kanzashi made for young girls are highly decorative ; those worn by older folk are plain , or adorned only with a ball of coral or polished stone . ) The new hairpins might be called commemorative : one , of which the decoration represents a British and a Japanese flag intercrossed , celebrates the Anglo-Japanese alliance ; another represents an officer 's cap and sword ; and the best of all is surmounted by a tiny metal model of a battleship . The battleship-pin is not merely fantastic : it is actually pretty ! As might have been expected , military and naval subjects occupy a large place among the year 's designs for toweling . The towel designs celebrating naval victories have been particularly successful : they are mostly in white , on a blue ground ; or in black , on a white ground . One of the best -- blue and white -- represented only a flock of gulls wheeling about the masthead of a sunken iron-clad , and , far away , the silhouettes of Japanese battleships passing to the horizon .... What especially struck me in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner in which the Japanese artist had seized upon the traits of the modern battleship ,  - -  the powerful and sinister lines of its shape ,  - -  just as he would have caught for us the typical character of a beetle or a lobster . The lines have been just enough exaggerated to convey , at one glance , the real impression made by the aspect of these iron monsters ,  - -  vague impression of bulk and force and menace , very difficult to express by ordinary methods of drawing . Besides towels decorated with artistic sketches of this sort , there have been placed upon the market many kinds of towels bearing comic war pictures ,  - -  caricatures or cartoons which are amusing without being malignant . It will be remembered that at the time of the first attack made upon the Port Arthur squadron , several of the Russian officers were in the Dalny theatre ,  - -  never dreaming that the Japanese would dare to strike the first blow . This incident has been made the subject of a towel design . At one end of the towel is a comic study of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ballet dancer . At the other end is a study of the faces of the same commanders when they find , on returning to the port , only the masts of their battleships above water . Another towel shows a procession of fish in front of a surgeon 's office -- waiting their turns to be relieved of sundry bayonets , swords , revolvers , and rifles , which have stuck in their throats . A third towel picture represents a Russian diver examining , with a prodigious magnifying-glass , the holes made by torpedoes in the hull of a sunken cruiser . Comic verses or legends , in cursive text , are printed beside these pictures . The great house of Mitsui , which placed the best of these designs on the market , also produced some beautiful souvenirs of the war , in the shape of fukusa . ( A fukusa is an ornamental silk covering , or wrapper , put over presents sent to friends on certain occasions , and returned after the present has been received . ) These are made of the heaviest and costliest silk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a colored picture of the cruisers Nisshin and Kasuga , under full steam ; and upon another has been printed , in beautiful Chinese characters , the full text of the Imperial Declaration of war . But the strangest things that I have seen in this line of production were silk dresses for baby girls ,  - -  figured stuffs which , when looked at from a little distance , appeared incomparably pretty , owing to the masterly juxtaposition of tints and colors . On closer inspection the charming design proved to be composed entirely of war pictures , or , rather , fragments of pictures , blended into one astonishing combination : naval battles ; burning warships ; submarine mines exploding ; torpedo boats attacking ; charges of Cossacks repulsed by Japanese infantry ; artillery rushing into position ; storming of forts ; long lines of soldiery advancing through mist . Here were colors of blood and fire , tints of morning haze and evening glow , noon-blue and starred night-purple , sea-gray and field-green ,  - -  most wonderful thing ! ... I suppose that the child of a military or naval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a robe . But then -- the unspeakable pity of things ! * * * * * The war toys are innumerable : I can attempt to mention only a few of the more remarkable kinds . Japanese children play many sorts of card games , some of which are old , others quite new . There are poetical card games , for example , played with a pack of which each card bears the text of a poem , or part of a poem ; and the player should be able to remember the name of the author of any quotation in the set . Then there are geographical card games , in which each of the cards used bears the name , and perhaps a little picture , of some famous site , town , or temple ; and the player should be able to remember the district and province in which the mentioned place is situated . The latest novelty in this line is a pack of cards with pictures upon them of the Russian war vessels ; and the player should be able to state what has become of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confined in Port Arthur . There is another card game in which the battleships , cruisers , and torpedo craft of both Japan and Russia are represented . The winner in this game destroys his " captures " by tearing the cards taken . But the shops keep packages of each class of warship cards in stock ; and when all the destroyers or cruisers of one country have been put hors de combat , the defeated party can purchase new vessels abroad . One torpedo boat costs about one farthing ; but five torpedo boats can be bought for a penny . The toy-shops are crammed with models of battleships ,  - -  in wood , clay , porcelain , lead , and tin ,  - -  of many sizes and prices . Some of the larger ones , moved by clockwork , are named after Japanese battleships : Shikishima , Fuji , Mikasa . One mechanical toy represents the sinking of a Russian vessel by a Japanese torpedo boat . Among cheaper things of this class is a box of colored sand , for the representation of naval engagements . Children arrange the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ box of sand are sold two fleets of tiny leaden vessels . The Japanese ships are white , and the Russian black ; and explosions of torpedoes are to be figured by small cuttings of vermilion paper , planted in the sand . * * * * * The children of the poorest classes make their own war toys ; and I have been wondering whether those ancient feudal laws ( translated by Professor Wigmore ) , which fixed the cost and quality of toys to be given to children , did not help to develop that ingenuity which the little folk display . Recently I saw a group of children in our neighborhood playing at the siege of Port Arthur , with fleets improvised out of scraps of wood and some rusty nails . A tub of water represented Port Arthur . Battleships were figured by bits of plank , into which chop-sticks had been fixed to represent masts , and rolls of paper to represent funnels . Little flags , appropriately colored , were fastened to the masts with rice paste . Torpedo boats were imaged by splinters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planted to indicate a smokestack . Stationary submarine mines were represented by small squares of wood , each having one long nail driven into it ; and these little things , when dropped into water with the nail-head downwards , would keep up a curious bobbing motion for a long time . Other squares of wood , having clusters of short nails driven into them , represented floating mines : and the mimic battleships were made to drag for these , with lines of thread . The pictures in the Japanese papers had doubtless helped the children to imagine the events of the war with tolerable accuracy . Naval caps for children have become , of course , more in vogue than ever before . Some of the caps bear , in Chinese characters of burnished metal , the name of a battleship , or the words Nippon Teikoku ( Empire of Japan ) ,  - -  disposed like the characters upon the cap of a blue-jacket . On some caps , however , the ship 's name appears in English letters ,  - -  Yashima , Fuji , etc. * * * * * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is shared by the soldiers themselves ,  - -  though most of those called to the front do not expect to return in the body . They ask only to be remembered at the Spirit-Invoking Shrine ( Sh=okonsha ) , where the shades of all who die for Emperor and country are believed to gather . The men of the regiments temporarily quartered in our suburb , on their way to the war , found time to play at mimic war with the small folk of the neighborhood . ( At all times Japanese soldiers are very kind to children ; and the children here march with them , join in their military songs , and correctly salute their officers , feeling sure that the gravest officer will return the salute of a little child . ) When the last regiment went away , the men distributed toys among the children assembled at the station to give them a parting cheer ,  - -  hairpins , with military symbols for ornament , to the girls ; wooden infantry and tin cavalry to the boys . The oddest present was a small clay model of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " If we come back , we shall bring you some real ones . " In the top of the head there is a small wire loop , to which a rubber string can be attached . At the time of the war with China , little clay models of Chinese heads , with very long queues , were favorite toys . * * * * * The war has also suggested a variety of new designs for that charming object , the toko-niwa . Few of my readers know what a toko-niwa , or " alcove-garden , " is . It is a miniature garden -- perhaps less than two feet square -- contrived within an ornamental shallow basin of porcelain or other material , and placed in the alcove of a guest-room by way of decoration . You may see there a tiny pond ; a streamlet crossed by humped bridges of Chinese pattern ; dwarf trees forming a grove , and shading the model of a Shinto temple ; imitations in baked clay of stone lanterns , perhaps even the appearance of a hamlet of thatched cottages . If the toko-niwa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swimming in the pond , or a pet tortoise crawling among the rockwork . Sometimes the miniature garden represents H=orai , and the palace of the Dragon-King . Two new varieties have come into fashion . One is a model of Port Arthur , showing the harbor and the forts ; and with the materials for the display there is sold a little map , showing how to place certain tiny battle-ships , representing the imprisoned and the investing fleets . The other toko-niwa represents a Korean or Chinese landscape , with hill ranges and rivers and woods ; and the appearance of a battle is created by masses of toy soldiers -- cavalry , infantry , and artillery -- in all positions of attack and defense . Minute forts of baked clay , bristling with cannon about the size of small pins , occupy elevated positions . When properly arranged the effect is panoramic . The soldiers in the foreground are about an inch long ; those a little farther away about half as long ; and those upon the hills are no larger than flies . But the most remarkable novelty of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ display at a famous shop in Ginza . A label bearing the inscription , Ka:i-t'e:i no Ikken ( View of the Ocean-Bed ) sufficiently explained the design . The su:ibon , or " water-tray , " containing the display was half filled with rocks and sand so as to resemble a sea-bottom ; and little fishes appeared swarming in the fore-ground . A little farther back , upon an elevation , stood Otohim'e , the Dragon-King 's daughter , surrounded by her maiden attendants , and gazing , with just the shadow of a smile , at two men in naval uniform who were shaking hands ,  - -  dead heroes of the war : Admiral Makaroff and Commander Hiros'e ! ... These had esteemed each other in life ; and it was a happy thought thus to represent their friendly meeting in the world of Spirits . * * * * * Though his name is perhaps unfamiliar to English readers , Commander Takeo Hiros'e has become , deservedly , one of Japan 's national heroes . On the 27th of March , during the second attempt made to block the entrance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help a comrade ,  - -  a comrade who had formerly saved him from death . For five years Hiros'e had been a naval attach'e at St. Petersburg , and had made many friends in Russian naval and military circles . From boyhood his life had been devoted to study and duty ; and it was commonly said of him that he had no particle of selfishness in his nature . Unlike most of his brother officers , he remained unmarried ,  - -  holding that no man who might be called on at any moment to lay down his life for his country had a moral right to marry . The only amusements in which he was ever known to indulge were physical exercises ; and he was acknowledged one of the best j=ujutsu ( wrestlers ) in the empire . The heroism of his death , at the age of thirty-six , had much less to do with the honors paid to his memory than the self-denying heroism of his life . Now his picture is in thousands of homes , and his name is celebrated in every village . It is celebrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sold by myriads . For example , there is a new fashion in sleeve-buttons , called Kinen-botan , or " Commemoration-buttons . " Each button bears a miniature portrait of the commander , with the inscription , Shichi-sh=o h=okoku , " Even in seven successive lives -- for love of country . " It is recorded that Hiros'e often cited , to friends who criticised his ascetic devotion to duty , the famous utterance of Kusunoki Masashig'e , who declared , ere laying down his life for the Emperor Go-Daigo , that he desired to die for his sovereign in seven successive existences . But the highest honor paid to the memory of Hiros'e is of a sort now possible only in the East , though once possible also in the West , when the Greek or Roman patriot-hero might be raised , by the common love of his people , to the place of the Immortals .... Wine-cups of porcelain have been made , decorated with his portrait ; and beneath the portrait appears , in ideographs of gold , the inscription , Gunshin Hiros'e Ch=usa . The character " gun " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  - -  either in the sense of divus or deus , according to circumstances ; and the Chinese text , read in the Japanese way , is Ikusa no Kami . Whether that stern and valiant spirit is really invoked by the millions who believe that no brave soul is doomed to extinction , no well-spent life laid down in vain , no heroism cast away , I do not know . But , in any event , human affection and gratitude can go no farther than this ; and it must be confessed that Old Japan is still able to confer honors worth dying for . * * * * * Boys and girls in all the children 's schools are now singing the Song of Hiros'e Ch=usa , which is a marching song . The words and the music are published in a little booklet , with a portrait of the late commander upon the cover . Everywhere , and at all hours of the day , one hears this song being sung :  --  He whose every word and deed gave to men an example of what the war-folk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : is he really dead ? Though the body die , the spirit dies not . He who wished to be reborn seven times into this world , for the sake of serving his country , for the sake of requiting the Imperial favor ,  - -  Commander Hiros'e : has he really died ? " Since I am a son of the Country of the Gods , the fire of the evil-hearted Russians can not touch me ! "  - -  The sturdy Takeo who spoke thus : can he really be dead ? ... Nay ! that glorious war-death meant undying fame ;  - -  beyond a thousand years the valiant heart shall live ; as to a god of war shall reverence be paid to him .... * * * * * Observing the playful confidence of this wonderful people in their struggle for existence against the mightiest power of the West ,  - -  their perfect trust in the wisdom of their leaders and the valor of their armies ,  - -  the good humor of their irony when mocking the enemy 's blunders ,  - -  their strange capacity to find , in the world-stirring events of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching a melodrama , one is tempted to ask : " What would be the moral consequence of a national defeat ? " ... It would depend , I think , upon circumstances . Were Kuropatkin able to fulfill his rash threat of invading Japan , the nation would probably rise as one man . But otherwise the knowledge of any great disaster would be bravely borne . From time unknown Japan has been a land of cataclysms ,  - -  earth- quakes that ruin cities in the space of a moment ; tidal waves , two hundred miles long , sweeping whole coast populations out of existence ; floods submerging hundreds of leagues of well-tilled fields ; eruptions burying provinces . Calamities like this have disciplined the race in resignation and in patience ; and it has been well trained also to bear with courage all the misfortunes of war . Even by the foreign peoples that have been most closely in contact with her , the capacities of Japan remained unguessed . Perhaps her power to resist aggression is far surpassed by her power to endure .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
