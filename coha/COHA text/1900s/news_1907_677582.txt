txt The Supreme Court of Illinois administered what is generally considered a deathblow to municipal ownership of the street car lines of Chicago to-day . The decision was in the case in which the legality of $75,000,000 worth of Mueller law certificates , which ox-Mayor Dunne wanted issued , was challenged , and the court decided against the certificates . In doing so It practically made the law itself inoperative . The Mueller law still stands intact , but the power of putting it into effect so far as Chicago is concerned has been taken away from it . The city can own and operate street car lines if it wants to , but the method of getting money to buy or build them has been taken away from it . The proposed certificates were declared invalid by the court for the reason that they would be an addition to the bonded indebtedness of Chicago , and this city is already fully up to its constitutional limit . The decision also finds fault with the certificates because they are a mortgage , not only on what street car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the streets o fthe city as well . The Mueller law provides that in case there is a default in the payment of the principal or interest of these certificates the owners of the properties in foreclosure not only would acquire them , but also a twenty-year franchise to operate them . As the case now stands , the only way in which municipal ownership of street car lines is possible in Chicago reduces itself to these alternatives . The city can buy up all its outstanding bonds so as to leave a clear field for the issuance of bonds with which to buy street car lines . At this time it could ndl issue more than $30,000,000 of bonds , and a traction system covering the whole city could not be built or bought for this . It can save up the 55 per cent . net receipts of the companies it will receive under the recently ' adopted ordinances until the total amounts to enough to buy a system . It can take what little money It can raise now , and take over some small line , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may have to spare for the extensions . The decision makes short work of Mayor Dunne 's plan to acquire immediate possession of the street car properties by condemnation proceedings . Neither a municipality or any other corporation can condemn property without the cash in hand to pay for It , and the invalidation of the Mueller law certificates takes it out of the power of the city to raise the money . While the decision does not affect the legality of the traction ordinances recently passed by the Council and approved by the people , it makes them practically twenty-year permits to run , unless somebody is willing to pay a bonus of 20 per cent . on the investment and the city will sanction the  --  purchase . BETWEEN FERRYBOATS . Over Went a Little Sailboat and Her Crew  --  Commotion on the River . Two young amateur sailors in a small rowboat made over into a sailboat , beating against a strong wind up the North River were upset off Gansevoort Street just before 10 o'clock last night . Two ferryboats passed each other in mid stream and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rescue of the lads subsided three police boats , several tugs from the Merritt-Chapman Wrecking Company and the fireboat George B. McClellan had reached the scene , while police reserves all along the river tront had been sent out on a report that the two ferryboats had been in collision . The amateur sailors were Frank Fuchs and his brother , Anton , of 132 Franklin Street , Union Hill , N. J. They had their only sail set and were making good progress when the West Shore ferryboat West Point passed up stream and a Pennsylvania ferryboat came down close together . The little sailboat was burfatted about between the two for less than a minute . Then the West Point hit the boat , which capsized . The two young men clung to the gunwale and shouted for help . Their cries were heard by the crew of the McClellan , and Capt . McCarthy had his men throw the searchlight across the river . Then the McClellan put out to the scene , and the youths were taken from the water and stowed away in the engine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
