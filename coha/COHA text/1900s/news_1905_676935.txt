txt An elevated railroad will be built through Baxter Street and private property to connect the Brooklyn , Williamsburg , and Manhattan Bridges to Brooklyn if the Rapid Transit Commis-. sioners put through the plan upon which they practically decided yesterday . It will cost the city about $5,000,000 , and most of the sum will he a dead loss if the Commissioners stand by their belief that the structure should be merely a temporary one , to be destroyed as soon as possible after five years . Although the plan favored by the Commissioners does not appeal to them as an ideal one , the general sentiment was that it would offer the quickest relief to the present ' crowded transit conditions between Manhattan and Brooklyn . No formal action was taken yesterday , because Mayor McClellan declined to vote on any proposition which later would come before him as Mayor . There are nine members of the board , and six affirmative votes are required to lay out a route or grant a franchise : so . although Controller Grout . President Orr. and Commissioners Claflin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were but ' five votes in the affirmative , as Commissioners Jesup and Starlit were absent . The vote will be . taken next week , however , and in the meantime President Winter of the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company will be consulted to see if his company will take the lease of the elevated line if it is granted for five years merely , with the privilege of terminating the lease and tearing down the structure any time after that on six months ' notice . President Orr brought the subject before the board at the same time that he presented the report of the Committee on Plans and Contracts , - covering the new routes reported on Tuesday . Mr. Orr said that , although a subway connection between the bridges was not impossible , it was inadvisable because it would require a grade of 5. per cent . at the Williamsburg Bridge . of 3 per cent . at the Manhattan Bridge , and of 41/2 per cent . at the Brooklyn Bridge . " Such a grade could be overcome , " said Mr. Orr , " but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Our own engineer , Mr. Rice , says there would be no danger if sufficient power should be provided , but it is certain that if we are to-give speedy relief to Brooklyn it must be by an elevated structure , and ? notbya-a subway . Then , too , the Brooklyn Rapid Transit could not run their cars in a subway because their cars are . too flimsy for such uses , and , again , the Present Subway cars in Manhattan could not be run on the Brooklyn Rapid Transit elevated structure because the structure is not heavy enough to carry them . President Winter has written me that his company would bid for the lease of an elevated loop over private property . He proposes to capitalize the cost of condemnation proceedings of the land and of the construction of the loop , and then to pay the city 31/ per cent . for the lease . " Commissioner Smith wanted to know if the . mermen would consent to giving Baxter Street over to a loop , but neither Mayor McClellan nor Controller Grout would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the bridges had been built for Brooklyn , and , that that . orough was entitled to all of the transit facilities which could be grant ; ed . He said the sentiment of Brooklyn was in favor of an elevated loop . Controller Grout said that the construction would cost 5750,000 , and that the total cost of the , project would be 55,000,000 . He suggested that only a five-year lease be given and the structure torn down at the end of that time , the city paying the loss and getting a new street in return . It finally was decided to offer the lease at five years . William Barclay Parsons sent in his resignation as consulting engineer to the board , and it was accepted . August Belmont wrote to the board as ' President of the Interborough Rapid Transit Company , requesting permission to lengthen the platforms of the local ' stations - in the Subway so that six-car trains can be accommodated in place of five-car trains . Mr. Belmont also said that the limit of capacity of the local service was ant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the New York and Port Chester Railroad , asking for the privilege of constructing a subway in Third Avenue to the Bronx , with " Y " arms extending to ; Port Chester and to Mount Vernon . There also was a bundle of indorsements of the Thirty-fourth Street moving-platform subway . SAYS PISTOL LAW IS VOID . Conflicts with City Charter , Magis ? trate Baker Declares . Magistrate Baker in the Morrisania Court said yesterday that the new city ordinance making it a penalty of six months ' imprisonment or $250 fine or both , for carrying a revolver , is null and void . He said that the city charter , as amended , provided that the punishment should not exceed a fine of $10 . This law , he said , takes precedence over any city ordinance . The only way for the ordinance to become operative , he said , was for the charter provision to tie amended . Magistrate Moss , in the Yorkville Court , when told of Magistrate Baker 's opinion , said that he did not believe the charter superseded the ordinance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordinance a good one , and proposes to see that the man sentenced by him yesterday to three months ' imprisonment shall serve his time . Magistrate Baker holds that any man so sentenced can obtain his release in ten days .
