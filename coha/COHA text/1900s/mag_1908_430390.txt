When five thousand New York merchants signed the call for the Castle Garden meeting to defend the rights of the South to its slaves whether North or South , and the firm of Bowen &; McNamee refused to sign , and declared that their goods and not their principles were for sale , one of the five original owners , afraid of losing his Southern trade , may perhaps be pardoned for having withdrawn from its support and for publishing a card declaring that he had no sympathy with abolition . That left Jonathan Hunt , Seth B. Hunt , Henry C. Bowen and Theodore McNamee to carry th burden . Soon after the two Hunts left New York , one for Europe and t h e other for California . Thinking the paper might have some prospective value , Mr. Bowen and Mr. McNamee p u r - chased the rights of their two associates , and $3,000 was paid for their half-interest . The paper , which had never paid its very modest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a thousand dollars a year to its office editor ? was thus valued at six thousand dollars . For thirteen years the original triumvirate conducted the paper , making it the stout defender of Congregational polity , of theological liberty and of human freedom . It would be interesting to recall the conflicts of those days , when Congregationalism was fighting for its rights of admittance to the territory west of the Connecticut line ; and very few were drawn to it but those who were also Abo litionists . Those were the days when the theological professors at Andover signed a proclamation that slavery was a divine institution , but when one of them , Professor Stowe , vowed that he would never shave his beard till the Fugitive Slave law was repealed . The repeal came in war , and by that time beards had become common . In those days the American Board employed slave-holding missionaries to the Cherokees , and the American Tract Society cut out all condemnation of slavery from the English books it printed . It was then that , at an annual meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s brother tried to shut off debate on the question of its complicity with slavery by calling for a season of prayer , and Dr. Leonard Bacon declared that t h i s was no time for prayer , but a time for action . At last the great conflict burst out in war . and the firm of Bowen &; McNamee , which had still kept a large par : of its Southern trade , tho its customers were careful not to have it known , was compelled to suspend payment , as t h e debts due it from the South were repudiated . TH E INDEPENDENT , which had no real financial value , was put into the temporary nominal possession of a brother-in-law of Mr. Bowen , the Rev. Erastus Dickinson , and at the same time the original triumvirate of editors withdrew , leaving Dr. Leavitt . Mr. Bowen immediately called Mr. Beecher to the editorial chair , and he was aided by Theodore Tilton , who had for several years been a boyish editorial apprentice . But Mr. Beecher was able to give but  |p1347  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ War he was a frequent contributor to THE INDEPENDENT . On our thirtieth anniversary he wrote us a letter in which he said : " THE INDEPENDENT 'S editorial department is ably sustained , its list of contributors large , varied and strong , its ruling spirit without bigotry or dogmatism and its scope such as to include much that pertains to literature , science , art , religious and secular intelligence and the most important events connected with the political history of the country , affording in the aggregate annually a large amount of useful information at a very cheap rate . " Dr. Leavitt was a Congregational minister , had been editor of The Evangelist and The Emancipator , and had taken active part in all the counsels for the organization of the Liberty party and the subsequent Free Soil party . Now he had no voice in the general conduct of THE INDEPENDENT . But he was a man of great experience and wisdom , and I was fortunate to be put under his immediate instruction . He was as tall as Mr. Tilton , and his full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as straight . I recall the day when Mr. Tilton burst jauntily into the back office with the exclamation : " I am going off for a sixweeks ' lecture tour , Doctor ; give me your blessing " ; and Dr. Leavitt rose , even more impressive than Mr. Tilton , put his hand on the younger man 's fair blond head , with its long waving hair , and said : " The Lord bless you ? and make you a good boy ! " It was not exactly what Mr. Tilton had expected . My first duties were to cull the religious news from the papers , and write the column of " Ministerial Register , " which was the record of the ordinations , removals and deaths of ministers . Soon I added departments of foreign mission news , scientific discoveries , and biblical and archelogical investigations , with an occasional dip into editorial writing . But the general editorial drift of the paper could not be much changed so long as Mr. Tilton and Mr. Johnson were in undisturbed management . It was in the issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bowen 's request , I printed under my own name a sketch of the life of Dr. Leavitt on the occasion of his golden wedding . Mr. Johnson did not happen to see it until it appeared in print . In that article I had occasion to draw the contrast between Dr. Leavitt 's attitude toward the Church and the nation and that of Mr. Garrison , who had been the leader of the smaller band of Abolitionists who denounced the State as well as the Church , and refused to vote under it . When Mr. Johnson saw it he was very indignant , and so was Mr. Garrison , who , having fully accepted the results of the War , was no longer in a critical attitude , and was willing that his severe denunciations of Church and State should be forgotten . The next week Mr. Garrison publisht in THE INDEPENDENT a severe reply , in which he charged me with ignorance and youth , and denied the truth of my characterizations . As I had been a reader of The Emancipator and The Liberator from my young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was an older man than Mr. Garrison . and my father and grandfather had been 16 , active in the anti-slavery movement before Mr. Garrison became known , I was confident that I was right ; and I prepared an article in which I defended my position by quoting his words in The Liberator and at the famous anti-Bible meeting at Hartford . When Mr. Johnson refused to allow me to publish such a historical vindication of the attitude of those who had organized the Liberty party as against that of the Garrisonian Abolitionists , I informed Mr. Bowen that I must resign my position . He told me  |p1349  page deleted  |p1350  now of The Outlook ; Susan Hayes Ward ; Dr. E. Munsell Bliss , now of the Census Bureau at Washington , Paul E. More , now of the Nation ; and Maurice Thompson , author and poet . Doubtless I have omitted names of others who do not occur to me ; and many of distinction who have been regular editorial contributors to our various departments of Science , Art , Music , Biblical Research , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this list . Another list must include those who are now my associates ? Hamilton Holt , Frank D. Root , Dr. E. E. Slosson and W. G. Bowdoin . During these fifty years THE INDEPENDENT has made two changes of its form . Up to 1873 it had been the largest blanket sheet in the country ; but in that form enlargement could go no further , and its size was reduced and the number of its pages increased . Again , in July , 1898 , another reduction to the magazine form was made , with another corresponding increase of pages . At the same time the magazine was made less distinctively religious in its plan , while maintaining the religious and pronouncedly ethical spirit with which all treatment of public matters should be permeated . As I turn the leaves of the first issue of THE INDEPENDENT I discover that its future course was admirably foretokened . That issue declared it to be the purpose of the paper to be what its name indicated , " Not so much to reflect public opinion as to act upon it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was the purpose of its young editors . Therefore that first issue reported Dr. William Patton 's anti-slavery Thanksgiving sermon , preached in the now extinct Church of the Puritans . It was perhaps for the same reason that a special word of commendation was given to The Tribune , our most faithful ally in those days , for i t s enterprise in reporting sermons . There was an excellent musical article , and sanitary topics were w e 11 treated in view of an apprehended visitation of the cholera . Missions was a topic fully treated , and a missionary periodical was amusingly credited with an item of information which illustrates the growth of t h e country in these sixty years . It read : " YANKEE ENTERPRISE : A letter in the Missionary Chronicle says : ' Yankee enterprise is already building flour ing mills and selling town lots at the Falls of St. Anthony . ' " But it was the spirit of the paper that offered a revelation and made a revolution in religious journalism . Here was a paper that was warmly religious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the same breath pray for revivals and yet denounce slaveholding ; that did not care for its subscription list if it might help truth and justice ; that began an editorial in its first issue about the American Board with the now familiar words , " This debt must be paid , " and yet could attack the Board for its connivance with slavery . The most marked difference that I observe between its first issue and those of its last forty years is the enterprise of its publishing department . Then there were  |p1351  correspondents in other cities and letters from European countries , but nothing to compare with the magnificent galaxy of writers whom a liberal policy , then unknown in the newspaper world , has since allowed us to gather . This was first made possible by the great extension of our circulation in the late sixties , achieved by a very liberal offer of premiums ? dictionaries , sewing machines and steel engravings . That was the method of the day , now almost forgotten . As I look over the long row of files since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been fairly well realized ; and nothing is so near my heart as that the paper shall always remain true to the Kingdom of Christ , whatever banner his loving followers may carry ; that it may be more than hospitable to new truth , and that it may seek to bring the Church into closer bonds of union ; that it may always defend the wronged and the helpless of whatever race , may assert the widest fellowship of humanity , and that it may ever , in matters of national progress as well as of all righteousness and religion , forget the traditions behind and build new service on the eternal foundations of faith , hope and love , which are also those of liberty , fraternity and equality . And let me add my testimony to that of Mr. Tilton on the occasion of the twenty-first anniversary : " From its origin till now THE INDEPENDENT has never grown cold in its love of liberty , and never slacked its zeal in the service of the opprest . It has never had an editor who could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sin awaits me in the other world ; but this I know , that I have never been guilty of despising a man because he was poor , because he was ignorant , or because he was black . ' Selden 's ancient motto shall ever be ours , Before all else liberty . ' We make common cause with struggling negroes , with disfranchised women , with hunted Indians , and with opprest Chinamen . In a word , both in religion and in politics we believe in the universal and all-comprehensive law enacted by Him who spake as never men spake , when he gave to individuals and nations , to churches and States , this authoritative rule of faith and practice , " Whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you , do ye even so unto them . ' "
