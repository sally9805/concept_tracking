txt A pistol shot was heard amid the bustle of Broadway , near Thirty-fifth Street , just before 4 o'clock yesterday afternoon , and a stoutly built man about 60 yeais old , neatly dressed in black , fell on the sidewalk against the windows of the Herald Building . A crowd rushed to the spot , but after a flicker of the eyelids and a faint sigh the man died . A few minutes before the shooting the man had left in The Herald advertising office a letter addressed to the editor , fit which he announced his intention to do away with himself , with the Lope that the publicity entailed would result in money being sent to his wife to keep her from starvation . In the letter the man wrote that his name was ; Wale . Chase : that he was the son of Daniel Chase , a General of Vo11111-teers in the war of the rebellion , and a cousin of Salmon P.

In the packet with the foregoing statement was a letter , dated at Washington , March 24 , 1900 , from the Secretary of the Navy to Frederick W. Carpenter , private secretary to President Taft , in which the Secretary of the Navy acknowledged ree6ipt from Mr. Carpenter of a letter from Aquino . Chase asking for his reinstatement at the Brooklyn Navy Yard . The note showed that Chase was second on the list for reinstatement in the navy yard . The sound of the shot brought men , women , and children hurrying up from BrOftdway , Sixth Avenue , and the scarcely less crowded crosstown shopping streets in the immediate neighborhood . In a moment the east half of Herald Square was massed with exicted , curious people , hustling and shoving each other to get a look at the man where he lay on the floor of the colonnade , for the word , " A man has shot himself , " had spread quickly . Two policemen made a lane through the tightly wedged mass of people , and by that opening Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's side . He knelt by the man 's side , opened the garments where the blood was soaking through , and presently said : " He is dying . Nothing can be done for him .

" The body was then removed to the station house , where his eventful history and honorable discharge showed that Chase had enlisted when only 13 years of age in Company B , Thirteenth Maine Volunteers , in Augusta , Me .. and was on record as the " youngest soldier in the Union Army , " being 13 years and 10 months old when he served under , Gen. Nathaniel P. Banks in an attlek on New Orleans and in the Red River expedition . After that young Chase was sent to Washington to join the army of the Potomac .

" For the last eleven years Chase had been an employe in the Brooklyn Navy Yard as a joiner . Among the other papers was a receipt for $1 50 from the firm of Ennis &; Stoppanf of 3T , New ' Street , relating to some small stock transactions . The body was taken to his home in Brooklyn . In an interview with a TIMES reporter last night , Mrs. Chase , who was prostrated over her husband 's tragic end , said that they had been married twentytwo years and had lived on the most affectionate terms . They had lived for the last fourteen years on the first floor of the three-story house at 82 Norman Avenue , Greenpoint , which was very comfortably furnished .
