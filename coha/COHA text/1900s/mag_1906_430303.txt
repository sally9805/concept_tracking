 | WHEN a young actress struggling for the highest place attains it , when she has made a great and sudden success in a part , and the play is settling into its stride for a long run , people suppose her position is settled and secure for years to come . They imagine her triumphant , free from care or anxiety of any kind , sinking to rest , wrapped , as it were , in clouds of glory , only to arise to delicate feeding and deep draughts from cups of praise ; for , you see , she has made a great hit . The struggle is past and she has nothing now to fear , they think . And right here I should like to carol a few light notes of incredulity ? tra-la-la ! Because in one case , at least , it was all so different ; and I know , oh yes I know , quite well ? for see now , there were two special nights , and on one , at eight o'clock , a girl , wide-eyed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and absolutely without one friend in it , faced New York City in chill terror . The next night , at eight o'clock , the same girl faced pleased recognition in a myriad of beaming eyes , a forest of outstretched hands , and a sea-like roar of welcome , that shook her to the heart . I know , because I was that girl . Well , that was success , unadulterated , amazing success ; and for a little time I rested upon it content , happy , and very grateful ? but not dazzled , not caught up in golden clouds , not overpowered as by a miracle . And I noticed the odd looks that were turned upon me after curtain calls , overheard comments as to the " easiness " with which I took this success , and as to my awful lack of appreciation , cold bloodedness , etc . And while they wondered at me , so I wondered at them ; for in my verdant young ignorance this was my true thought : Why do they make such a to-do over this ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my best , and people cried and gave me calls ; and here I have a good part , and do my best , and the people forgive the burr in my speech , and cry , and applaud . What 's the difference ? I see nothing so wonderful ! Oh , dear heaven ! oh , loyal and woolly little Westerner ! yet that was my true thought . Then one day one high in the journalistic world sent me an enormous number of papers from far and wide , from Canada to Florida , from east to west , and lo ! each and every one of them had reprinted , at a column 's length , each of the New York papers ' expressed opinion of the Western actress 's debut in the metropolis . Many had editorial comment as well , and then , indeed , my calm was shaken . A great awe crept over me . Well I knew I was of no interest to all the readers these papers represented . It was New York , the great , the powerful , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's opinion that interested the entire country . Had the metropolis gibed at me , contemptuous laughter at my ludicrous presumption would have run north , south , and west like the crackling of thorns in the fire . My knees trembled at the thought . My simple trust in my own honest best was gone . All my careful study in trying to make one scene seem the logical outcome of another seemed wasted . I had suddenly been lifted high into popularity by the whim of the first city in the land , powerful , brilliant , changeable . Ah , there was the rub ? changeable ! I had sprung up in a single night . What had happened once might easily happen again . I knew no more of security . From that moment I began to peer into the future , watching for the woman there just out of sight , who waited for my shoes ; and I straightway resolved never to be dragged down from the high place that had been given me , but at the first sign of frown or weariness to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showing only gratitude for what had been . And there and then began that interminable chain of prayers with which I wearied heaven , that I might be prepared ; that when my successor came I might feel no resentment , no bitterness , no rancor . And to show how near this came to being a fixed idea with me ? as for the first time in my life I had weeks without rehearsals ? I at once took up certain studies , under teachers , that when my place was taken by another , widened and varied interests might lessen the chance of heartbreak . I-laving then got around to the view-point of the ladies of the company , I tried to show them my new appreciation of the marvel of my success , here in their city , and they seemed much gratified . One evening , as we waited in the greenroom , the conversation turned upon the many prominent actors and actresses New York had ? to use the green-room vocabulary ? " sat down upon . " Some one named Eliza Logan , who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , but her disastrous appearance here , at her husband 's theater , was said to have broken her heart . " Ah , but she was so ugly to look at ! " said one of the older ladies . " Something very near genius , but , Lord , how ugly ! " " Well , " I said , " there was Miss Julia Dean , " and was roughly interrupted by the one person in the company who was systematically unkind to me with : " You know nothing of Julia Dean ! " Of course I do not know her personally , " I answered , " but through Mr. Jefferson , Mr. Ellsler , and Mr. Owens I have heard of her delicate , fair beauty . " She was the loveliest woman on the face of God 's earth ! " came in aggressive second interruption . And then a calm , slow voice from the far end of the room was saying : " It 's your reful moderation of speech , old man , that always appeals to my Bostonian training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest was drowned in general laughter . " But could she act , your beautiful Julia Dean ? " called out the deer-eyed Dietz . And in chorus came : " No ! " ? " No ! " " A little ! " ? " Not a bit ! " My " oh , es , she could i " tumbling out the last all , I went on : " Of course , her beauty unted highest in her success elsewhere , and he goodness that people say seemed to emanate from her like perfume from a flower . And she could act , too , with grace and dignity and sweetness such parts as Julia and Parthenia and the younger Shaksperian heroines ! But , " I sighed . ( " But ? " came back the chorus with every head ashake . ) " But it 's queer , " I continued , " Miss Logan had genius , and she was rejected . Miss Dean had beauty , and she , too , was rejected . It 's hard to guess what New York wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " cried my foe , and with a bitter sneer added , " She was waiting for you , my dear ! " I laughed quickly to hide my hurt , and answered : Ah , yes ! I see . You mean that , having neither beauty nor genius , I stand between the two , a living fountain of regretful tears , and as such arouse the attention even of New York ? " As every one knew mine had been a success of tears , a shout of laughter broke forth that was like balm to my hurt . The thrust had been meant to wound , and I want to say for myself that if , as people used laughingly to declare , I , like some others , went through life with a rapier of mockery ever in hand , at least I never failed to keep the saving button of good nature firmly attached , and made no thrust with a naked point . The season was getting on to its last quarter . I was still safe , but one day , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I believed my rival had come into view . She hailed from England , and I closed my eyes as I thought how great must be her ability and value to he thus sent for across the ocean . I heard that she was blond ? artificial or natural deponent saith not ? and verily I bowed my head , for unseen blonds are always fascinating . Now , my prayers had gone steadily on all this time , and though their sincerity was beyond doubt there had been a somewhat marked compactness and brevity about them until the golden-haired dramatic wonder had set sail to conquer New York and thrust her rosy toes into my shoes , when they suffered a sudden expansion of explanations , of entreaties , of promises , of iterations , that might well have won for me a thump on the head from an aerolite ; and while I was still desperately preparing for the worst , she came . The bills were up . Mr. Daly read advance notices , and summoned the French prompter . A French prompter for an English-speaking  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for if any actor " stuck for the word " he stayed stuck till the curtain fell , or the season closed , or he died , or something ; because the French prompter could n't follow the MS. , or if he did he could n't pronounce the needed word . Well , he summoned the prompter , and charged him to be careful about ringing the curtain correctly , as he , Mr. Daly , would be over at the other theater . I turned cold , my shoes seemed to loosen on my feet , the actors ' eyes went through me like skewers , and then the awful night was half over ! Our house was large , but I had to goad myself along to keep up to the standard demanded ? and then Mr. Daly came back . His lips were drawn down contemptuously . Mrs. Gilbert met him , and seemingly questioned him . He waved his hand as if dismissing something , and giving a short laugh came on to me . I said faintly : " You are back early ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You were disappointed ? " I asked surprisedly . He gave me a quick , sharp glance . " Damnably ! " he answered briefly . " She 's a sort of dramatic bolster ? smother-voiced ? shapeless ? characterless ! " " But ? hut , " I almost whispered , " she is blond . " " Well , good Lord ! you ca n't make an actress out of a wisp of hair , can you ? " I smiled a little . I knew tears were rising to my eyes , and I turned away . But he took me by the chin and turning my face back to him , looked at me a moment , then with a mocking laugh he said : " You are a sharp young piece , but ? " He ran his little finger up and down my nose ? " but this seems all right ? not disjointed yet , eh ? " I seemed to be whirling round and round . I caught for a moment at the managerial arm , and held tight , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little fool you are ! There 's your cue ! " And for the time I was safe ! Yet never did I cease my silent watch for the unknown , beautiful , and gifted woman who was coming , slowly or swiftly I knew not , but surely coming , to say to me : " Your shoes , please . I am the new choice of the city . " And I should answer : " With pleasure , " even if I choked blue-black in the face over the gracious falsehood . The second season was drawing to a close . I had played many parts and still held my place with the public , which especially after the burning of our home theater , had been so good , so very good to me , that I could have knelt down and bumped my forehead at its feet , after the Oriental fashion , in expression of my gratitude . We were rehearsing a new play . My fears were almost in a doze ; only now and then I swept the distant horizon for a sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lo I ran straight against her on our own stage ? the creature in whom we all saw my probable successor . That future happenings may be better understood I must explain here that , in one way from first to last , I was ever the cause of travail of spirit , of anxiety , distress , and anger to Mr. Daly ; and though I was sorry from my very heart , I could in no wise help him or myself for not being foreign born , nor foreign trained . I could only act at night , within the magic fiery circle of foot and border lights ; and to his orders , to his entreaties that I should act a scene at rehearsal , with those guying brother-and-sister fiends of mine sitting about , " laying for me , " I could only beg , explain , and finally declare : ; You must either trust me or dismiss me , sir . I can die , but I ca n't act in daylight ! " After his delight in the mad scene of " Article 47 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he vowed he would always trust to the faint indications of the rehearsed scene . But , alas , as soon as a new part was in hand his fears returned , his anger rose , my tears fell , and the old battle was on again . " Madeline Morel " called for a long cast . Every gentleman in the company with , I think , one exception was in it , and all the ladies as well , and among us a funny thing happened . Mrs. Gilbert had a mere scrap of a part ? a peasant woman ? and when the time came she played it with such a wealth of detail and such skill that it loomed up a real character study . Still the part was a scrap , and Mrs. Gilbert ? did not like it . Miss Fanny Morant , whom both Mr. Wallack and Mr. Daly considered the best player of great ladies then on the stage , had a very important French , grande-dame , mother part , but she ? did not like it . Miss Fanny Davenport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to star in : French actress , gorgeous costumes , no morals to speak of , but a darzling wit and a good heart . Heavens ! you could fairly hear the applause as you read it , and she cried loudly she ? did not like it Miss Sara Jewett had a part , a stainless .  | lovely , convent-bred girl , striving to aid the stricken heroine , and she ? did not like it . And 1 , the subdued , the silent , I read over the part of Madeline . Her character was not sharply drawn , was wobbly , uncertain , illogical . Well , open confession is ever good for the soul , and , by gracious , I said I did n't like my part either . A long-faced , darkbrowed group we were , when , creeping like a snail , the generally quick-moving , dapper Jimmy Lewis came in , paler than ever , his small face puckered as if frost-bitten . I asked : " What 's the matter , Jimmy ? Sick ? " He glared at me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sick ? No ! It 's that blasted part ! I do n't like it ! " There was a lightning-like exchange of glances and then a wave of hysterical laughter surged through the room that drowned dead every complaint of every part , and we presently resorted to the stage to begin work , as pleasant-faced a crowd of actresses as any stage-manager could wish to meet ; while Lewis , the non-comprehending , blinked helplessly , muttering : " Well , I 'm hanged , if the whole gang has n't gone crazy ! " One part required a special engagement . The character was that of a very young girl , the only daughter of a noble house ; pretty , spoiled , spirited , as well as spirituelle , and desperately in love with her fiance . We had young people that were handsome , but they were too settled , too stolid , not in the least mignonne , and , although this part only lasted through one act , it was really very important . A young lady had been engaged , but she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Daly proceeded to read her part . That was not an uncommon thing to do , and had he confined himself to reading alone all had been well . But no , he must needs act the girlish passion , the pettish changeableness , and so placed the company upon the rack . Mr. Crisp and I looked on in wicked joy , for we had been the last victims of his passion for arranging and directing love scenes . Never hall I forget that last moment when we on the stage made love to Mr. Daly 's shouted orders from the front of the house . Poor Crisp ? a very good lover by the way ? perspiring and red and mad , held me : " Oh , hold her closer ! " cried Mr. Daly disgustedly . " Relax , Miss Morris , relax ! " " If I relax another bit , " I groaned , " I shall go down flat on the floor ! I ca n't relax any more and stand on my feet ! " " I do n't want you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He should support you completely . Take her around the waist , man , and draw her to you , and ? for heaven 's sake , Crisp , what are you scratching her back like that for ? " It was the end . I dropped flat on the stage in helpless laughter , while Crisp dashed off into a dark place where he said ? I have been told ? many very reprehensible things , while the company held on to the scenery and laughed . And now , oh now ! here was this tall , gaunt , brown-mustached man , crowned with a shocking bad hat , casting his long arms about the shrinking shoulders of handsome George Clarke ? matinee god and good fellow ? who simply writhed under Mr. Daly 's command to put more warmth into his work ; and while we strove to keep our glee from breaking forth in sound , just when Clarke 's ears were red enough to light matches , and Mr. Daly was doing his cooing , coquettish best , there broke upon the air a high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threw up his head angrily : " What was that ? Who did that ? " he demanded looking about . At a little distance , tall and stately , stood the gentle and reserved Charles Fisher , with wide , amazingly innocent blue eyes fixed upon him , as he answered composedly : " I did it , sir ? I ? that is ' er , there are certain incongruities between the words , and ' Cr your appearance , that are , well ' er , that are infernally funny , sir . " We waited for the bolt ? it never fell . There was a slight twitching of the managerial lips , but dignity carried him to the end of the act . Clarke tried to walk aside , but our chief fiend , that crowned king-player of pranks , Louis James , was at his side in a flash , gravely and courteously commending Clarke 's last effort , assuring him that the love scene with Daly was both tender and chaste . The next day the newcomer was there , and before rehearsal was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else was startled and amazed , for , you see , this young girl was about eighteen and looked even younger ; a mere slip of a girl with a graceful , wand-like figure . Her mignonne face , with delicately modeled features , was lighted up with longlashed hazel eyes . She had wavy , yellowbrown hair , and a dimple did the rest . A charming little empty-headed child she  | seemed , who chattered the whole morning through about the beauty of the wonderful wedding-gown she was to wear , and her hopes of being prettier than her bridesmaids , etc . And then her act came on and we began to sit up and take notice . Instead of merely reading her part with bright understanding , she indulged in little airs , graces , and affectations ; in tripping , mincing , and posing ; and once when Mr. Daly said : " no , no , Miss V ? ! that is a trifle too knowing , " she swiftly and cheerfully exclaimed , " oh , do you think so ? Well , perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instantly lowered her head slightly , arched her brows , and lifting rounded eyes , stared with the pretty blankness of a very young calf or a baby that has just emptied a bottle . A man behind me exclaimed : " What nerve ! " and the Boston-bred one standing alone near the bare wall took his hat off and bowed deeply and gravely . But when the love scene came , and she began to warm to her work ; to bill and coo and gurgle ; to cast her slender self about in lovely poses ; to clasp her hands and roll her eyes ; then it was that , figuratively speaking , Mr. Daly prostrated himself , with his brow in the dust , before the creature found at last , who could act at rehearsal , and let a man know what he was to expect at night . He was plainly enraptured . People lo ked curiously my way , and I smiled my self-defensive , try-to-look-pleasant smile until my face ached from the strain . Soon George Clarke ? the champion lover of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this little maid insisting upon doing most of the love-making herself , wreathing her arms about his neck , clinging to his shoulder , or , as he viciously put it , " sagging " from his shoulder ; but the thing that most aggravated that manly actor was a little trick she had of throwing her arms about him bodily just above the elbows , thus holding him a helpless and , he felt , a ludicrous prisoner . And one day , Mr. Daly called out , " Embrace her , George ! What 's the matter that you stand there like a post ? Embrace her ! " " Well , I will , " answered Clarke , with unfailing gentleness but with murder in his eye , " I will if the lady lets go of my arms long enough to give me a chance , " adding in a lower tone to the too , too ardent one : " Say , you 'll make this a sort of catchas-catch can ' scene for me if you do n't stop clipping my arms like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shooting his cuffs , and straightening his coat and tie , and , turning his back to one of the gentlemen , with a petulant laugh asked : " Say , is that girl all off me yet ? Just give me a brush-off to make sure . " Ah , such are the trials of leading men ! As time went on we all saw Mr. Daly 's growing interest and delight , and we all wondered what Miss V ? would not do when under the triple inspiration of lights , of music , and of audience . I took into account her Dresden-china beauty , her extreme youth , her remarkable aplomb , and loosened the latchets of my shoes , while quite unconsciously I fell into the habit of taking mental farewell of many things . So we all waited the new favorite , and only the Boston man , ever silent , smiled grimly and sometimes laughed with his face.to the wall . And so , heavy of heart , I dressed for the first performance . The new-found little pearl of promise did not appear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edge , at his or her best . The play moved steadily on in a rising crescendo of passion and grief . Clarke 's love scene with me ( I being sweetheart No. i ) had been beautifully tender and sincere . Louis James was at his smiling , polished best , showing all the implacable cruelty of the reformed rake , and our unequal but desperate struggle tightened spectators ' nerves almost to the breaking point ; and , so prepared , the great farewell speech swept the house like a tornado . Always chary of allowing his people individual " calls , " Mr. Daly shouted at last against the increasing applause " All right ? take it , and be hanged to them ! " And as I advanced , holding grateful hands out to the first spray as it were of that Niagara of applause , my heart contracted with the violence of physical pain . Something whispered maliciously , " Make the most of it ? it may be the last . This time to-morrow night they may be waiting impatiently to greet with joyful cries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acting of the yet unseen ? the newcomer . " In spite of all honest preparation tears must have rushed into my eyes , because I saw all the smiling crowd dimly as through a fog or mist , and in answer to some faint remonstrance from within I said : " But she will have no need of power of invective , of devouring rage . Her manager will select plays fitted to her powers . when once he hears the mighty city 's choice . "  | One moment I dosed my eyes and swayed helplessly , for the draught of renunciation was very bitter in the swallowing , whatever sweetness might follow later on . And then in a sort of woful gratitude , with pallid smiles I bowed myself away , and some one remarked in a low voice , " She 's nigh to breakin ' down , " and another asked , " Overwork ? " but the first made answer , " Nave , guess she 's scared over that Cathedral scene , because ? " and no more I heard , nor should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staring at a slender , graceful figure , whose trailing white satin glory and crown of orange blossoms alone told me who she was . The lovely Sara Jewett passing by exclaimed , " Did you ever see such a mask of make-up ? " Ah , that was it ! A cruel , extinguishing mask of unnecessarily heavy pastes , powders , paints , pomades ! The delicate modeling of her small features was lost beneath it . 1 n very truth the too intense white , red , and black suggested at a distance a baby clown 's face . " My dear ! my dear ! " expostulated Miss Morant , " you have time in plenty . Run back and change your make-up . Your smooth child 's face requires but a mere dust of powder and a touch of rouge . Run , make the change and be your fresh young self again ! " But she replied quite positively , " Oh , I could n't think of such a thing ! I 'm made up by the French method , which is absolutely correct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " answered the stately Morant , " I had not known , but I 'm ever pleased to sit at the feet of youth and ? learn ! " Most people would have curled up at that tone , that manner ; but Miss V ? simply turned on the baby stare and curled not at all . They were ringing up . I saw Mr. Daly hurrying to his lair in the first entrance . How many times I had seen him there to await my difficult scenes , his eyes anxious , his face palely rigid , and his long fingers clutching desperately at the lapel of his coat . Now he watched with eyes alight , and with a smiling face , and apparently he did not know there was a lapel on his coat ? such was the comfort he derived from one who could act by daylight . The crowd of bridesmaids , mincing and preening about the bride like a flock of pigeons , was charming . Then , then the smile on Mr. Daly 's face began to fade ; he looked puzzled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no elan , no glow . Aplomb so exaggerated as this might easily pass for indifference ! Mr. Daly leaned forward and whispered sharply , " Wake up ! " and , yes , he grabbed at the lapel of his coat . For the love episode was on and what was the matter ? There were the graceful poses , the twining and embracing , the tender protestations , all exactly as they were rehearsed ? and no more . Yes , that was it ? no more ! She had done her very best , let herself all out by day , and , with nothing in reserve , seemed mechanical at night . The scene was lightly applauded . Mr. Daly pulled his hat down to the tops of his ears , and suddenly the scales fell from my eyes . And instead of the radiant , all-gifted rival , who was to push me from my stool , I saw a very pretty , over-confident young girl ? that was all . A great relief swept over me . A sudden new strength thrilled me . Afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing now ? I was reprieved . I would show my gratitude . It was a great night , a glorious one , and after all the noise was over , Mr. Daly said : " Good girl ! you never did better in your life . " And I treasured the words , for if he praised but seldom he was always sincere . With unspeakable extravagance I sent for a cab , that I might get safely home all my many floral monstrosities and a few bunches of long-stemmed , unskewered roses . And as the horse seemed to be walking in his sleep , I leaned back and thought these true thoughts : " Oh , I am safe now , and shall be for some time . This play is sure of a run . The unknown ca n't materialize before the first of next season . I have suffered two false alarms , but that must not prevent me from watching out for the real one . " For though I was happy , very happy , and found a new success ineffably sweet , back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just beyond sight in the near future , who precisely as I had risen in a single night , might in a single night supersede me ; " so let me be prepared dear Lord ! " And that was the considerable , alloy I found in the joy of being a successful leading lady .
