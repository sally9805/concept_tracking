ONE morning , not long ago , as the light streamed in at the windows of the editor 's den , taking a soft , stained-glass tone from its passage through the smoke and steam of the elevated trains , the Easy Chair had one of those Memnonian moments which experience is beginning to teach the editor to expect of it , from time to time . Of course when it actually spoke he knew that it was the tradition of the Easy Chair finding words , and he tried to answer in the reverence which he always tries to feel for a tradition : he is beginning to be a tradition himself . " Have you ever , " the Easy Chair asked , " had your doubts whether a book was especially worth reading because its sale had reached a hundred thousand , or two , or even five hundred thousand ? " The editor looked warily about the den , and seeing that he was quite alone with the Easy Chair , he confessed , " Yes ; I have already expressed grave doubts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and as I do not like to be odd , I do not keep insisting upon mine . " " I am not sure you are right , " said the Easy Chair . " Perhaps other people have them , and if you insisted upon them , you would not find yourself so odd , ' after all . Is the fact that a book has not sold half a million copies proof that it is poor literature ? " " I should be sorry to think so , " said the editor . " I have written books , and I am afraid it would rule mine out , except in the very few cases where they have passed that figure . " " But would you like to have written the books that sell half a million ? Candidly , now ! " " Candidly , then , I would n't . But I would rather write them than read them ; I think it would be easier . A certain kind of man would write one of the recent enormous successes , because if he wished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but to write that kind of book . He would be made so , but no one could be imaginably made so that he must read such a hook , in the sense that the author must write it . " " I do n't know about that , " said the Easy Chair , musingly . " The fact that there are two or three or ten or twenty men who must write trashy books possibly implies the fact that there are two or three or twenty millions who must read them . Have you any philosophy as to the vast popularity of the books that have been lately filling the world with the noise of their publicity ? It used to be called advertising , but I rather like the Gallic neatness of the new word . " " No , unless it is the publicity that does it . Only , the publicity seems not to come first , always . " " It ca n't be the publicity that does it , then , though the publicity helps . The thing seems largely meteorological . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A certain atmospheric pressure in the material world causes it to rain water , and a certain atmospheric pressure in the literary world causes it to rain rubbish . We suppose that in both cases the rain comes from the clouds , from above , but in both cases it comes primarily from the ground , from below . What you want to do in order to account for the literary rubbish which now prevails is not to analyze the authors , who are the mere modes of its discharge , but to ascertain the condition of their readers , from whom they received it as an impercep .. tible exhalation , and who receive it back from the authors in an appreciable form . " " Oh , it 's all very well to say that , " the editor protested . " But the causes are so recondite that no inquiry can reach them , and one conjecture would be as good as another . The phenomenon is not only extraordinary in quality , but in quantity . The rubbish is not only rubbish , but it is rubbish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the rainfall should have been all at once increased tenfold over the whole territory of the United States . The rubbish-fall in the last year of the nineteenth century was greater than ever was known in the history of literature before . How do you account for that ? " as a very simple and very obvious fact . An immeasurably greater area of humanity has been brought under cultivation or reclaimed from absolute illiteracy than ever before . In the material world the analogous sort of thing , the tilling of waste land , increases the rainfall , and in the mental world the upturning of waste mind increases the rubbish-fall , because in both cases the clouds receive a greater exhalation from the space below , and give it back proportionately . " " You mean , in other terms , " said the editor , " that the number of readers has enlarged the number of writers , and the writers are trashy because the readers are . " " Oh , you must n't press the inference too far . Logic can always turn upon us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You will be saying next that popular education is a mistake , and that people should not be taught to read and write because they read and write rubbish . " " Oh , no . I should not go so far as that . But I might say they had better not be taught to write , " " And I , " said the Easy Chair , putting on its traditional air of optimism , " contend that they can safely be taught to do both . You must not regard the present state as final . It is not a state at all , in fact ; it is a stage , and an advance , taking in the whole body of readers , upon any former stage . We must not think the lovers of a half-million-copy novel are recreant lovers of Hawthorne , or George Eliot , or Mr. Thomas Hardy . The most part of them never heard of those authors . To leave the meteorological figure we have been working , up to this point , and try something arborieultural , we may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , when men begin to plant it with trees , they first plant with the coarse , rank cottonwood . After a generation or two of cottonwood , they can grow oaks and elms and maples en the prairie , but not at first . You may be sure that the plains in which the literary cottonwoods now flourish have never grown oaks or elms or maples . Vet CFI ? No. 611. - 98 lip to the time the readers of the recent successes began to read them they had read dime novels and story papers , or they went to the theatres . But the exhalation and precipitation of rubbish can not go on forever ? " " I do n't see why it should n't , " the editor broke in . " Let 's hear by what new metaphor you escape the logic of your postulate . " " I have none that fits , " the Easy Chair frankly owned . " But all the same I feel sure of my position . The forces in the mental world are not governed by the same laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world it must keep on raining water , but it need not rain rubbish always in the mental world . Imperceptibly the conditions will vary , and in the process of time the inspirations will he changed , and the expirations with them . On any vastly extended scale you ca n't expect taste for the best things ; but many people of bad taste would willingly have good taste if they could . No , no , " the Easy Chair continued , " we must never despair of the republic , in anything . We seem of late to have applied the principle of universal suffrage to the criticism of literature in an odd way , and to have decided that the book was best which got the most votes . But should you say the one which got the fewest was the best ? Do you think that any half-dozen failures of the past year are as good as any halfdozen successes ? " " I am not sure , " said the editor . " But T will own that not all the failures are good , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad . " " How can I help doing that ? " the Easy Chair responded , and at this point it manifested by unmistakable signs such a disposition to take the word altogether that the editor willingly yielded it . " The question II whether the actual prodigy is also a portent is something one may much more profitably ask one 's self than those we have been putting to each other . Does publicity constitute a sort of newer criticism , and are we to form our opinions of a book from the proclamations of the advertiser , instead of the reasons of the reviewers ? Is the critic , as we . have hitherto had him , to pass , and is the advertiser to come and to stay ? The critic as we have had him has not altogether contented us . I think I can recall some hard things you said of him yourself when you inhabited The Study . Do you say now that he , the critic , would be preferable to the export advertiser as an arbiter of taste ? " " Ali @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make you observe that the advertiser rather than the critic has always been the arbiter of taste . The novels of TourguCnie ? , twenty years ago , were reviewed round the land as among the most important and most artistic ever written ; but they sold a thousand or two apiece in spite of the consensus of the praiseful critics . At the same time , That Husband of Mine and Helen 's Babies swept the country after the advertiser began to say they were doing so . " " I am not sure just how much such a fact proves , " the Easy Chair resumed . " But if the great commercial successes in - fiction are owing to our lack of a principled and instructed criticism , I am quite willing that the critics should go , and not continue to influence the fate of books . The reading public can quite as safely turn to the last announcements of the publishers , and if The Flaming Sword has sold - five hundred thousand , and Gouts of Blood has sold only four hundred and ninety-nine thousand , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain measure , the success of a book itself is a favorable criticism The fact that it has caught the attention of a large number of people is certainly not against it in the minds of either authors or publishers . The publishers , indeed , accept the fact with genial faith as a positive proof of merit , and the authors are probably waiting each one to write a book whose success shall bring the truth home to him . The author whose books have never sold more than a poor thousand or fifteen hundred would not think the worse of himself if one of his books should suddenly sell - fifteen hundred thousand . But nothing in all this should disable us from asking whether , say , the merit of a book increases in the ratio of its sale . " Certainly the fate of the enormous successes , or the most of them , in the past , is not such as to convince us that they were always of lasting worth . Who reads Tupper 's Proverbial Philosophy now ? Once it was on the marbletopped centre-table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Has any reader of this generation heard of The Lamplighter ? That novel sold , a brief half-century ago , as many copies as Gouts of Blood , if not so many as The Flaming Sword . It will be within the memory of middle-aged men , not to say women , that the story known , or once known , as Called Back ran well into a million copies ; but is Called Back a favorite with the ingenuous youth now gorging themselves with the feast of gory collops spread for them by the neo-romanticists ? The list could be extended , and brought down to that yesterday when the name of Trilby was on every tongue ; but the few instances I have given will suffice to form the excuse of any one who hesitates a doubt of the literary quality of The Flaming Sword or Gouts of Blood , in spite of their immense acceptance with the reading , or the buying , public . If these overwhelming romances are of lasting worth , the doubter may get them hereafter ; and if they are not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he will have saved his money . " What , then , if not their merit , is the cause of their illimitable popularity ? That brings us directly back to the expert advertiser , and to the modern mystery of publicity . It is apparently to the advertiser 's instinct , to his prophetic soul , that the great successes are mostly owing . But just at what moment does ' his instinct , his prophetic soul , become operative ? What intimation from the unknown enables him to declare The Flaming Sword the book of the season , and swiftly upon this proclaim that it has gone to ten thousand , to twenty , to a hundred thousand , to half a million ? It has not reached any of these figures without his skill , but how does he know that his skill can be hopefully brought to bear upon The Flaming Sword ? It is one of a hundred novels no worse if no better . He has the air of knowing , but perhaps ho could not tell if he would . In fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never be solved . A veteran publisher who used to seek my conversation , a good many years ago , before publicity became prophecy , was always puzzled to know why a book when it had sold ten thousand copies should stop selling . Had it reached in that number just the number of people who wished to read it ? With the momentum it had got by such a start , why should not it keep going ? What laws or chances arrested it ? He gave the conundrum up in the fact of asking it ; but perhaps the modern advertiser could answer it . " In this case the only difficulty would be to get at the advertiser . He is probably not one with the publisher , but is a prophet in the publisher 's pay , and is very likely a young and bustling seer who could be hired away from his employer by some one bidding more for the use of his gift . Possibly , of course , he has a conscience , and might refuse to prophesy promiscuously . When we see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the year , ' or the book of the season , ' or the new success in fiction , ' we can hardly help believing that he can foresway as well as foretell literary events , and that by appealing to his conscience the children of light could enlist his interest as successfully as the children of darkness , who seem to have written most of the prodigious triumphs in the book world of late . Is not there a gleam of hope in that direction ? ' The editor allowed that there might be . He said that out of those triumphs he could think of one that was not half bad , and of another that was three-quarters good ; and if these were the effect of a quickened conscience in the advertiser , the future was not so black as it painted itself . The first thing would be to find nut whether the advertiser was one or many , or had that remarkable unity of style which distinguishes his inspirations by virtue of incorporation as a trust . When the fact was ascertained , we should know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we could make a test case . " For instance , " said the editor , " I should like to try him with a recent Filipino novel , which the American publishers have called An Eagle Flight , in its version from the Spanish . It was written by that beautiful soul Jose Rizal , whom the Spanish despatched to his last account in pure despair of finding any charge against him , a few years before we bought a controlling interest in their crimes against his country . It would have been interesting to know what we would have done with such a political prisoner , if they had handed him over to us , and whether , perplexed by the problem of a man who could be accused of nothing , but whose whole generous life accused the alien oppression , we should simply have shot him , as the Spaniards did . But he is gone , and his book remains , and though we might have a copy of it publicly burnt , that would probably not put an end to it . In fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the hope of getting it forbidden in the mails . I should like to suggest some such measure to him , though I am afraid he might be disappointed when he came to look at the book and found it merely an exquisite work of art , with no imaginable leze-America in it . " I do n't know whether it ought to be astonishing or not that a little saffron man , somewhere in that unhappy archipelago , should have been born with a gift so far beyond that of any or all the authors of our roaring literary successes ; but those things are strangely ordered by Providence , and no one who reads this pathetic novel can deny its immeasurable superiority . The author learned his trade apparently from the modern Spanish novelists , who are very admirable teachers of simplicity and directness , with a Latin grace of their own . But he has gone beyond them in a certain sparing touch , with which he presents situation and character by mere statement of fact , without explanation or comment . He has to tell the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , well born , nurtured in luxury , and sent out to Spain to be educated , who returns to the Philippines to find his father dead and his memory dishonored by the monks whom the son supposed his friends . The son inherits their enmity ; they break off his marriage with the girl to whom he has been betrothed from childhood , involve him in a pretended conspiracy , and compass his ruin and death . A multitude of figures , men , women , and children , peasants , townsfolk , cleric and laic , of all the mixtures of race , from the pure Spanish to the pure Filipino , pour through a succession of scenes without confusion or huddling . The many different types and characters are rendered with unerring delicacy and distinctness , and the effect of all those strange conditions is given so fully by the spare means that while you read you are yourself of them , and feel their hopeless weight and immeasurable pathos , with something of the sad patience which pervades all . There are touches of comedy throughout ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has a tragedy in hand , but life has taught him that not all , or even most , spectators of tragedy are of serious make or behavior . His story has the reliefs without which a world where death is would not be habitable ; but even in the extreme of apparent caricature you feel the self-control of the artistic spirit which will not wreak itself either in tears or laughter . It is a great novel , of which the most poignant effect is in a sense of its unimpeachable veracity . " Iv The editor ceased , and the Easy Chair for a time was silent . Then it asked , " And is this the sort of book you thought of commending to the ministrations of the advertiser in the hope that he could make it sell half a million copies ? " " Why not ? If the advertiser should apply both skill and conscience to the task , why should not he succeed with a beautiful work of art like that , amusing , exciting , touching , heart - breaking , human ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see , " said the Easy Chair , " you are making your old mistake of those times in the Study when you used to argue that because a thing was good it ought to be liked . But a good thing can be liked only by those who are good enough to like it . The books that sweep the country must be of the cheapness of the average person . That book which you mentioned just now as not half bad , and that other book which was three-quarters good , succeeded each by the combination of its qualities with the defects of the great popular successes which had no qualities . Those two books had a strain of silliness or a strain of sentimentality which had the same force as the glorification of the bad passions to take people out of themselves . That is what people want , and is it any wonder , considering what people mostly are ? " " Oh , come ! " cried the editor . " If you are anything at all you are a tradition of faith in human perfectibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and insinuating the most cynical despair of it . " " Ala there I should wish to distinguish , " said the Easy Chair . " I am a tradition of the ethical , not the assthetical , perfectibility of humanity . Heaven is probably full of kind souls of no taste whatever , who would not know a good novel from a bad one . No , no ! You must not confound the two sorts of excellence . The advertiser could n't hopefully take hold of your Filipino novel ; but I do n't lose my hopes of him on that account . I believe that he is morally perfectible too . Come ! If we can not have critical taste any longer to guide us in the choice of books , why should not we have commercial honor ? Why should n't the literary advertiser rise to the level of the drygoods advertiser , and a publishing-house announce its wares qualitatively ; and than quantitatively , with the frankness of a department store , owning one of less value than another ? " " Because books have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the publishing-house discriminated in value it would have to discriminate in price , as the department store does . " " Well ? " " Well , that is impossible . Commercial honor can do a good deal , but it can not do that . " " Then , " said the Easy Chair , " we must hope that we are not in as bad a way as we seem . We probably arc not . Good books are still read ; names worth having are still made . Let us never despair of the Republic of Letters . "
