txt The first international balloon race in America under the auspices of the Aero Club , which was to have started this afternoon and which was postponed until to-morrow on account of the high winds prevailing , will not take place , as the balloon owned by Leo Stevens , broke away in a sudden gale at 9:25 o'clock to-night and possibly is sailing somewhere over the Atlantic Ocean if it has not been wrecked . The second balloon , L'Alouette , owned by Charles Levee , the French aeronaut , also broke away , but hit an iron post In the grounds of the Pittsfield gas works , and was ripped open and collapsed . The silk was saved , and is not too badly damaged to be repaired and used , but Stevens 's is gone beyond recall . The two balloons were anchored in the field from which they were to ascend on the property of the Pittsfield Gas Works . They had been filled with coal gas during the early morning and afternoon and were ready to ascend at 4 o'clock . It had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interference of the wind , but the task was finally accomplished . By means of numerous sand bags they were weighted to the ground and the dying of the wind awaited to make a start . But the wind did not die , and it was decided to postpone the start until to-morrow morning . It was necessary to impress a number of spectators gathered to witness the ascents to keep the huge globes under control . Even then , Charles Levee 's L'Alouette broke away and was hurled against the crowds of spectators , dragging its sandbags behind it . Its network was broken in a dozen places , but the quickness of those in charge of the experiments enabled them to secure it before serious damage was done . The breaks were repaired and the huge spheres more securely fastened . But no one reckoned on such a gale as sprung up to-night , and in spite of ail precautions the tethering ropes of both were broken . Stevens 's loss is set at $1,290 . Levee 's damage can be repaired for $100 . Levee advised against allowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were protected and would ride out the gale . The Blue Hill Observatory near Boston has been instructed to watch out for Stevens 's balbloon , and there is a faint hope that it may e recovered , The balloon was made at Stevens 's airship works in Ninth Avenue , New York , for the Aero Club , and the race which was to have been made to-morrow was to test the relative qualities of the French and American balloons . It had a capacity of 345 cubic meters of gas and was about three-quarters ful . It weighed about a , ton filled and was about forty feet in diameter . The balloon was marked in large , , distinctive lettering " Aero Club , No. , 1 , New York , Leo Stevens . " Watchmen at the field say that the wind threw off the sand bags and extra bags with which the balloon was weighted down , and that it slipped out from under the net and rose high up into the air and proceeded in an easterly direction. , Augustus Post and Cortlandt Field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night . announced that experiments here would be postponed for a time , and it is understood there will be no further attempts at ascensions until there is mild weather , probably not until May . Ten thousand people stood for hours in the chilling air , hoping that the weather would moderate . At 4:30 o'clock the balloons were filled . It was decided to send up a pilot balloon to ascertain the direction of the wind , and one went swinging away to the east with a rush and sailed out of sight over the Hoosac range of hills . It was while this was , under way that Stevens 's balloon , " Aero Club , No . I. , " suddenly burst away from its anchorage and at a single bound cleared thirty feet , knocking down a row of spectators and dragging its sand ballast after It . There was a stampede of spectators , but the call for assistance brought half a hundred to Steven 's aid in subduing it .
