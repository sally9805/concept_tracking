txt Edward H. Harriman , head of one of the greatest railroad systems in the United . States , is of opinion that the country is already beginning to recover from the severe shock received In the recent panic . He sees signs all over thetland of a renewal of that public confidence without which there can be no prosperity . Mills which shut down when the first shock came are beginnineto reopen , and Mr. Harriman believes that it will not be long before tire business of ' the country again will be in a normal condition . What Mr. Harriman sees as the best evidence of a return to healthful conditions is the fact that the recovery which has set In is not going on so quickly that there is danger of having to open the wound again . On the other hand , while it Is steady , it is not so slow as to check the confidence of the financiers of the country in making further ? investments for sober industrial and commercial development . No Stop Now in Progress . When seen today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the depression , and we are in it to stay . There will be ' no falling back  --  each step that we are taking ' Is firm . Underneath the whole situation there is an industrial stability . There Is too much work to be done and too great capacity for doing it to allow a long drawn out depression . " " Do you think public confidence is being restored ? " " I certainly do . There are Indications of it everywhere . This country Is too big , and its people as a whole too sensible , to allow the acts of a few men to shake their faith In the integrity of our great financiers and business men as a whole . Naturally there Was a little scare at first , but when the people saw that there were rotten spots only hero and there they quickly recovered from their fright . " " Of course , you must not expect all at once to see every line of commercial business as active as It has been during the last two years , and perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not so be . 6.000 Men Go Back to Work . No better evidence that Mr. Harriman believes business Is on the mend can be found than In the fact that he has just ordered back to work 6,000 menon his railroads . At the beginning of the panic , when even the wisest men could . not foresee how far It would go , Mr. Harriman began to retrench . He temporarily halted the great work of Improvement which is being ca:ried on on the ' Union Pacific and Southern Pacific lines and ordered the discharge of 8,000 laborers . Now ' the greater part of these already are back and the original plans are being rapidly carried out . " I put tile.merr back In the Interest of the Union , Pacific and the Southern Pacific , " said Mr. Harriman . " There is only one proper way to rune railroad or any Other kind of business . You ' must have effielenby . That.is the keynote of all success . In a railroad there can be no efficiency unless that railroad Is kept up to the highest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
