txt An exhibition of color prints by Arlent Edwards at the Wunderlich Gallery shows the range of this revived art in many fine impressions , As is generally known , Mr. Edwards engraves his subject on the copper and then paints it , printing from the painted plate , without retouching . He uses , of course , printers ' colors , and here his limitation becomes apparent , a limitation that is inevitable in the present state of color making . In order , for example , to guard against the fugitive quality of the reds , especially the madders , he is forced to use them fuller and brighter than perfectly represents the original of the print . in a few instances where this was not done the paler tones already seem to have gone off a bit . And of course the reds and blues can not be those of the great painters . In the reproductions of Italian pictures In especial we see how far they miss the depth and splendor of the originals . As a matter of fact , however , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant to suggest rather than reproduce , but with other color prints , and in this comparison they come out with excellent effect . In the French subjects particularly , where the color harmony is not so profound , they are charming . It would be difficult to improve upon the " Sophie Elizabeth : After Nattier , " a nonchalant figure reclining and playing with flowers , gay and soft in color and seen against a lovely background of foliage and clouded sky . The " SYmPany ; After Greuze , " also is delightful In the cool , bluish gray of the gown against the darker blue shawl . " The Music Lesson ; After Lancret , " is very successful in the pinks , more so perhaps than the " Garden Party , " after the same painter ; but perhaps the difference corresponds to the difference between the originals . Among the Italian subjects Peruglne 's " Madonna " is the most satisfactory , the tone of the flesh having a rich quality , such as characterizes the melancholy gentle ladies of that master , albeit the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide for future deterioration . There are almost no Dutch masters represented . There is a print of Rembrandt 's " Mother Plucking a Fowl " in which the shadows are rather empty ; but there is also a reproduction of the Cassel Saskia , which In its reserve and admirable tonality is far and away the most beautiful print in the collection . Mr. Edwards has wisely not attempted to give the strength of the red In the hat or even the red-gold of the hair clinging about the sort forehead . He has contented himself with rendering the rich crimson of the velvet bodice and merely hints at the colors in the numerous ornaments . The embroidered collar and fine under sleeve he has rendered with a pale brown tone that harmonizes with the dark fur of the mantle , and by this free interpretation he has managed to give far more of the effect of the Inimitable original than any reproduction in the actual colors could achieve . The exhibition as a whole is one that can hardly fail to increase Mr. Edwards 's already enviable reputation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the word , and consistently striving toward the best effects possible to his medium instead of resting content with those already mastered in the past . At the Pen and Brush Club this week is a little exhibition of pictures and studies for decoration by Miss Ida J. Burgess , very pleasant in character and interesting technically as showing the excellent results obtained from the much discussed Raffaelli paint-sticks . " Afternoon . Washington Square , " is a study on blue paper in which the use of these sticks has given a. remarkable effect of solidity joined to lightness . The sharp outline and the suggestive touches of pale but lively color are quite in Retie own manner . " Evening . Central Park , " is another example in which the color on the houses and the crisp drawing of a group of trees enframing the scene with their light branches give an appearance of spontaneity and an accidental quality that is most agreeable in art of modest pretensions . Miss Burgess uses transparent watercolor when she works in that medium and shows facility in keeping it within its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from ancient glass windows in the Continental cathedrals , Amiens . Chartres . Friburg , and others . She has also several studies for original compositions in stained glass , and shows one window , a portrait of Julia Marlowe as Juliet . A collection of sketches made in Egypt and Brittany by Mr. Louis C. Tiffany is on exhibition at the Tiffany Studios . They are marked by a certain daintiness of handling and the decorative instinct characteristic of the artist . In a " Snow Scene , " a study for a window , the masses of snow on the tree branches form a striking and agreeable pattern , and in the " Study of an Olive Tree " under the careful realism of the drawing one perceives the analysis of picturesque forms and the delicate accentuation of the decorative lines in the original . In the " Interior of a Mosque ; Algiers , Africa , " and in a studio interior , we have a remarkably close rendering of detail without pre-Raphaelite dryness and with a very successful keeping of the general tone . Rug patterns , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine sense of the character of each , and the whole forms unmistakably a picture as opposed to a chart of individual forms . Perhaps the most attractive examples , however , were the street subjects . Morlaix , France ; Rothenburg , Germany , and Cairo , Egypt , are drawn upon for these , and the irregular lines of frontage , the . 1 interruption of staircases and overhanging balconies , the rich aspect of age and crowded humanity , the Interesting play of sunlight and shadow over the broken surfaces , give to these subjects an inexhaustible charm , especially where they are as sympathetically interpreted as by Mr. Tiffany . In the Brittany studies , too , less Is made of costume and more of the general look of picturesque street architecture , if these canopied booths and sheds can be dignified by that name , is Impressed upon the observer than in the ordinary Brfttany picture . Among the more purely decorative work is a large panel showing a seated figure partly draped at the left , holding a butterfly in one hand . A peacock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right the branches of a small leaved tree make a nice framework for the group . The color scheme is bright and gay and in harmony with the bird 's plumage .
