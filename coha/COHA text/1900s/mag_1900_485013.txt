The President 's message , after the usual introductory clauses on the blessings of self-government , takes up the Chinese question as the dominant one in our relations with foreign Powers . It first gives a narrative sketch of the Boxer outbreak and of the attack upon the legations at Pekin . It is interesting to note that practically the President supports the contention expressed by Sir Robert Hart in the Fortnightly Review , that the great peril into which the legations were thrown was caused by the bombardment of the Taku forts by the allied fleet , in which the United States forces did not join . Thereupon the legations were ordered by the Chinese authorities to leave Pekin within twenty-four hours under a promised escort . They asked for more time , and also asked for an ' interview with the Tsung-Li Yamen . As an immediate answer was not returned , Baron von Ketteler , the German Minister , set out for the Yamen to obtain a response and was murdered on the way to the palace . This is nearly identical with Sir Robert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as regards the Chinese Government , and it shows conclusively that , until the allied fleet bombarded the forts , the outbreak was in the nature of a riot . After that event the Chinese uniformed troops took part in the attack on the legations under their regular officers , and members of the TsungLi Yamen who counselled protection to foreigners were beheaded . In notable contrast to the action of the Government at Pekin was the friendly action of the Viceroys of the southern and eastern provinces , who made every exertion to preserve peace and to protect all foreigners within their jurisdiction . The policy of the United States , the message shows , has been a consistent effort to allay the evil in China , not to aggravate it . To this end our military forces were withdrawn en soon as the legations were properly safeguarded , and the Russian proposal for the restoration of the Imperial Government at Pekin was agreed to by us . The President " favorably inclines " also to the Russian proposal that , in the event of protracted divergence among the Powers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the matter be referred to the Court of Arbitration at The Hague . If this may be construed as an acceptance by us of the principle of arbitration touching this matter , it is the most important step yet taken toward final settlement . We are sure that it will be approved by the majority of the people of the United States , as the general policy of the Administration in China has been heretofore . The announcement is made that ratification of the- Hague treaty has been given by the United States , Austria , Belgium , Denmark , England , France , Ger ' many , Italy , Persia , Portugal , Rumania , Russia , Siam , Spain , Sweden and Norway , the Netherlands , and Japan . As arbitrators under the treaty , the President has appointed ex-President Harrison , Chief-Justice Fuller , Attorney-General Griggs , and the Hon. George Gray to represent this country . Taking the lynching of Italians at Tallulah as a text , the President renews his recommendation that Federal courts have jurisdiction in international cases where the ultimate responsibility of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conclusion that Congress make provision for indemnity to these Italian sufferers in the same form and proportion as heretofore . He improves the occasion to repeat the words of a previous message that " lynching must not be tolerated in a great and civilized country like the United States , " but does not suggest any method of putting an end to it . The most important question in our foreign relations next to the Chinese affair , and perhaps more important than that , relates to the Isthmian Canal and the pending Hay-Pauncefote treaty . The President passes over this subject lightly , and does not commit himself to anything . He says that overtures from Nicaragua " for a convention to effect the building of a canal under the auspices of the United States are under consideration , " but he thinks that they may be properly postponed to await the report of the commission appointed to examine the comparative merits of the various trans-Isthmian ship-canal projects . The Hay-Pauncefote treaty is rather dryly " commended to the early attention of the Senate . " Coming to domestic affairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The recommendation of most importance under this head is one which has been urged in our columns , that the defect in the Act of March 14 , 1900 , shall be cured so that it shall be really a Gold-Standard Act . " Whatever further legislation is needed to insure the continued parity , under all conditions , of our two forms of metallic money , silver and gold , " he considers it the duty of Congress to supply . He recommends a reduction of internal-revenue taxes by the sum of $80,000,000 , and especially points out the legacy tax on bequests to public institutions as one to be wholly removed . He refers to our remarkable progress in steel-manufacturing and ship-building as reasons for adopting a policy of ship subsidies , which he says will increase transportation facilities and reduce freight charges in the vast volume of products brought from the interior to - the seaboard for export . The curious THE CHARTER REVISION . The reception by the public of the Charter Commission 's report is as favorable as could be expected . It would be impossible for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delicate a task , and reach conclusions which would command unquestioning support from all classes in a city of three and a half million people . The most that could possibly be hoped for would be a general recognition of the non-partisan spirit which has characterized the work , and an equally general endorse meat of the wisdom manifested in some of the most important recommenda tons . This we already see , and discussion can only strengthen the tendency to accept the main conclusions of the Commission as sound . The principle of centralizing responsibility , which underlies some of the most radical changes , is one that must be accepted before we can secure reforms which are urgently needed . The Mayor new has the power to remove officials only during the first eighth of his four years ' term . He may get rid of every head of department whom ha finds in office during his first six months , but if he discovers , a year later , that he has made a bad mistake in some selection of his own , he can not get rid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall enjoy the power of removal at all times . They propose also that his appointees shall hold office without definite term . Having thus made the position even more influential than it now is , they would have him hold office for four years . There is much to be said for a system under which a bad Mayor may be got out of office in two years , but it is urged with great force that the people are more likely to elect a good Mayor if they realize that he will wield his power for a long term . The provision for a single-headed Police Commission is another application of the same principle of undivided responsibility . The existing " bi-partisan " system has been tried a great while . and it has always worked badly . The single-headed Police Department was tried for many years in Brooklyn before consolidation , and it was successful . The present regime is so offensive that neither Tammany nor the Republican machine has been inclined for some time past to defend it . The provision that the Chief of Police may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wise , but the requirement of the Mayor 's approval for the removal of that official by the Commissioner is an exception to the rule of undivided responsibility . We suppose that the explanation must be the feeling of the Commission that the position of Chief of Police is so important that such a change should not be made with-out the consent of the Executive , but that argument would seem to apply as well to the original choice of a chief , and here the Commissioner is wisely given sole power . The Commission report that all who expressed an opinion on the subject were opposed to the perpetuation of the present two-Chambered Municipal Council . Here again the professional politicians have been forced by the test of experience to change their ground , and it would stagger an " organization " man in either party to make an effective plea for the maintenance of the existing system . The Commission recommend that the one legislative body which they would substitute shall be much larger than the present Board of Aldermen , and that its power shall be increased The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be against so large a Board as the 123 provided for , and experience with State legislatures has not always sustained the theory that , " the larger the body , the more difficult it will be to improperly influence it " ; but it is reasonable to expect that there would be more men in the larger body vigilant to oppose bad measures , and that the body would be more representative of the various interests and localities concerned . The borough system has been for the most part a failure thus far . It ought to be either abolished or radically changed . The argument from theory is so strong for the preservation of the principle that it would have been a serious mistake to recommend abolition . What the Commission have done is to advise an increase of power for the Presidents of the boroughs , and to make local improvement boards more important than before . Feeling about this matter will be more pronounced in the other boroughs than in Manhattan , but no reason appears why the changes proposed should not be endorsed One feature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place in the very important Board of Estimate and Apportionment , which would be composed entirely of officials elected by the people . This is a sound principle , and by giving the various members of this board votes according to the importance of their offices , the Presidents can not outvote the Mayor , Collin-troller , and President of the Board of Aldermen , who are elected by the city at large . The removal of the power to fix the salaries of his subordinates from the head of a department is most commendable . The work of the Commission is so comprehensive and detailed that only the most salient features can be treated in a single article . As to all important features it merits hearty praise , and public opinion should be organized to secure the ratification of its recommendations by the Legislature , PATRIOTISM- BY MANUAL . There is a theory abroad that every thing must be taught . Earlier it was believed that certain primitive instincts came by nature , while the higher moral qualities were the gift of God . Now , no modern Dogberry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be taught , including patriotism . There lies before us a ' Manual of Patriotism ' for use in the public schools of the State of New York . The manual is authorizedby act of the Legislature , and compiled , arranged , and edited under the direction of Charles R. Skinner , State Superintendent of Public Instruction . But Mr. Skinner lends only his name and authority , as a kind of Shaksperian " only begetter " of the work . It is Prof. William R. Wickes of Syracuse to whom the actual pains of editorship have fallen . The book has been prepared in accordance with Chapter 481 of the Laws of New York ( 1898 ) : " An act to provide for the display of the United States flag on the schoolhouses of the State , in connection with the public schools , and to encourage patriotic exercises in such schools . " The idea of displaying the flag and of celebrating its daily raising by a brief ceremony has something to be said for it It would seem , however , as though such exercises should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the young on the general matter of patriotism appears as inappropriate as introducing revivalistic appeals at the daily morning prayers nould be . So a plain citizen might think . Das scholasticis ulster VISM712 . The compilers of the book before us have constructed an elaborate flag-ritual , a kind of patriotic year , with ' Old-Glorification " as its informing Spirit . The line for a critical analysis of this new flag-cult is marked out in certain prefatory " suggestions to teachers " " Do not look upon this manual as a text-book in American history , " is implored ; " seek the philosophy of events and teach it as far as possible . But - Mien you take this book in your hands . let the light of sentiment and imagination play over facts and theories -- tinge ing all as with the beautiful Red , White , and Blue of the Flag . " Following these directions , let us also allow the light of sentiment and imagination to play over this book , tingeing it with as favorable colors as may be . First come some forty daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is always a patriotic song to be sung , a number of patriotic extracts in prose or verse  --  these often well selected  --  prefaced by a patriotic exordium of the editor , which apparently is to be lead before the school . Each exercise centres around some single American idea  --  the home , the stars , the stripes . In lieu of criticism we here reprint the epening remarks on " The School ? " " Let us all praise and thank the Legislature of our great Empire State for that law whichcompels every schoolhouse to keep the flag flying during school time . For if home is ' the dearest spot , ' hardly less pleasant should the schoolhouse be . And what can help so much to make it pleasant as the sight of the flag ? Faces of the sunniest teachers will sometimes be overcast with clouds , pleasantest voices sometimes be edged with sharpness , sweetest tempers sometimes grow sour , like the richest cream after a thunder-storm , but the flag , ah , the flag ' As it floats over the proudest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you in the morning wtih a smile of welcome on its pleasant face , and when you start home , waves its benediction over you , and shakes out from its folds this cheery voice ? ' Come again ! be here to greet you ' " Here , we presume , teacher and scholars say Amen , with no unpatriotic grin on their pleasant faces . Continu ing the exercise , all break into a song of which the second verse runs : " Thy safeguard Liberty , The school shall ever be , ? Our nation 's pride ! No tyrant 's band shall smite , While with encncling might All here are taught the Eight With truth allied " Then follow two elegant extracts from the State Superintendent , Mr. Skinner , ( " only begetter " of the volume , it will be remembered ) , and an interview with General Francis Marion , all arguing the desirability of universal education So much for a specimen patriotic day as we are to have it in our schools . We pass on to , that part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anniversaries These are , in a word , only the daily exercises writ large , and a , few of the rubrics will show that the tone is unchanged For example " The Flag hallows Memorial Day , " " The Flag consecrates the Birthday of George Washington , " " The Flag blesses the Birthday of Abraham Lincoln , " " Flag-day makes sacred June 14 . " But enough of this quite idiotic flag-fetishism . Suffice it to , say that the whole raison , ci'dtre of the book lies in a belief that the sight of the flag is a signal for emotional hysterics , that Nature can not be left to direct these transports , but they must receive the form of pedagogical art ; that patriotism must be uttered periodically and by book , or die . What solemn nonsense it all is ' Men loved the flag before they called it " Old Glory " ; men died willingly for their country without special instruction in color symbolism ; statesmen gave their lives to the public service without repeating a flag pledge every day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flag 's " pleasant face , " and were good patriots withal . Has the State Board really found a more excellent way ? Reading drivel to children and making them sing doggerel can hardly have any effect except to vulgarize them . We believe that there is left enough of the old saving grace of humor to , send this big and foolish book into the obscur ity which yawns for the bathetic . What is really serious  --  and the only thing that warrants our giving it a moment 's attention  --  is that it bears the imprimatur of the State Superintendent , and that it is to be inflicted upon our schools . THE ATTRACTION OF GREAT MEN FOR CRANKS One of the smiling pages in the re cent Life of Huxley is that wherein his son gives a condensed account of the various kinds of folly that used to press into the Professor 's presence . Huxley often vowed that " suffer fools gladly " was a " pet aphorism " of his ; though it sometimes did look as if he read the injunction , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they pursued him as assiduously and relentlessly as Wellington complained that they did him The man who could demonstrate that the world is flat ; the investigator who could prove that the atmosphere has no weight , people with ten thousand pages of manuscript which they would like arranged and published in the proceedings of some learned society ? Huxley was fair game for such mighty hunters , of course . Among the more remarkable applications of the sort made to him was a communication by cable from the United States in 1892 . It ran as follows . " Unless all reason and all nature have deceived me , I have found the truth It is my intention to cross the ocean to consult with those who have helped me to find it . Shall I be welcome ? Please answer at my expense , and God grant we all meet in life on earth " Mr. Leonard Huxley does not tell us whether his father took advantage of the tempting " reply-paid " to answer a fool according to his folly . Darwin had a printed form for use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great man was so great in gentleness and kindness that he rarely had the heart to return it even to the most starkly crazy correspondent . He gave a civil answer even to the wonderful young man who , being exceedingly busy , and having to maintain the doctrine of evolution in a debating society , would , as lie was without time to do any reading himself , be deeply indebted to Darwin if he would write out a handy little sketch of his views . It is but the common lot of great men . The unbalanced , the feeble-minded , the buffeted and disheartened , are drawn like moths to the flame of a brilliantly successful intellect . Think of the poetry that Tennyson had to read ( or look at ) and keep a grave face ! Hallam Tennyson re cords one " pathetic incident of this kind , " as his father thought it . " A Waterloo soldier brought twelve large cantos on the battle of Waterloo The veteran had actually taught himself in his old age to read and write that he might thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some time under the sofa in my father 's study , and was a source of much anxiety to him . How could he go through such a vast poem ? One day he mustered up courage and took a portion out . It opened on the heading of a canto ' The Angels encamped above the field of Waterloo ' On that day , at least , he ' read no more . ' He gave the author , when he . called for his manuscript , this criticism ' Though great images loom here and there , your poem could not be published as a whole ' The old man answered nothing , wrapped up each of the twelve cantos carefully , placed them m a strong oak case , and carried them off He was asked to come again , but he never came . " This attraction which men of distinction have for aspiring but cracked brains has its admirable and even useful side . It is often a kind of instinctive hero-worship . Sometimes it runs into dog-like devotion . The wife of a fervid New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Why is it that you seem to have such a strong fascination for crazy people ? " Perhaps the theory of Dryden that great wits are sure to madness near allied partly accounts for it ; but there is a deeper truth hi it , namely , that certain kinds of desperate work can be done in this world only by men who wreak themselves upon it with a species of fanatic fury . Appearing almost insane in their absorbing life-passion , it is not strange that the completely mad sometimes hail them as fellows . At several removes from the lunatic , we have the plain ass who hangs upon great men . Now if he happens to be , not merely an ass , but what Disraeli called " a clever ass , " he may prove a kind of Boswell to help perpetuate the fame and name of the hero upon whom he dotes . Lord Rosebery thinks he has found in Gourgaud , chronicler of Napoleon 's last days at St. Helena , a serviceable donkey of this sort . The other memoirists and letter-writers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ass that it must be he tells the truth . There must , however , be a vein of cleverness in the ass . Carlyle was quite right in contending , against Macaulay , that a feel , qua fool , could never have produced Boswell 's Life of Johnson . Doubtless another reason why the poor routed leavings of humanity have such a fondness for the society of the great is that they think eminence and recognition the result of luck . It is only chance , they say , that our theories of gravitation have not been accepted in place of Newton 's ; it is only because Helmholtz happened to get the ear of the world that his views on optics are preferred to ours . This datum firmly fixed in their minds , their motive in approaching the successful man is twofold . In the first place , they count upon tolerance and sympathy . Huxley will have no illusions about his own distinction ; he will know that it was a piece of pure good fortune . So he will naturally be kind to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his pocket . As distinguished men usually are , in fact , exceeding kind to the fools who devastate their day , the fools go away more strongly than ever of the opinion that they are right and all the world wrong , and that nothing but an unkind fate has prevented them from directing the course of thought for mankind . If they could only get a hearing , all would be well yet . That is their second main object in storming the doors of the great . If Darwin would only help the wild-eyed man from Tasmania to get his refutation of Pasteur published , biology would be re-created , and the learned world would recognize its new master . So the foolish besieging goes on , and will to the end of time . As long as intellectual eminence exists , so long will it he a shining mark for folly , and so long will the intellectually eminent be subject to such alarms as the one which Huxley described in the last year of his life : " I had a letter from a fellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my essays , thought I was just the man to spend a month with , and was coming down by the five o'clock train , attended by his seven children and his mother-sit-law ! Frost being over , there was lots of boiling water ready for him , but he did not turn up " FRANCIS PARKMAN . I have been reading with much interest the lately published life of Francis Park-man , recently reviewed in your columns It was not an eventful life . owing to the state of his health He may be said , in the stricter sense , to have " pursued the even tenor of his way " for thirty years . While I really have nothing to add to his biography , there are some traits to which I could wish that more prominence had been given by Mr. Farnham , and , with your permission , I should like to call attention to them I made Parkman 's acquaintance in 1863 at the house of Mr. Charles Eliot Norton , in Cambridge , and my later intercourse with him was , if not frequent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some hours in his company , either at Milton or at his house in Chestnut Street There were few subjects of the day on which I did not become intimately acquainted with his views , and I can safely say that he impressed me , of all the men I have ever known , as the most of an American His tastes were singularly American , as a traveller and an explorer . He cared little for the works of man , either here or in Europe , but a great deal for those of nature , and had certain fixed views concerning American politics and society . Our last interview was about a year before his death , and he then had nothing to alter or retract of the things I had heard from him when we first met To sum up , he had , in the rarest degree , that virtue which the Romans called " constantia , " and placed so high among the qualities of character " Constantia " was , in fact , simply the firmness of a man who , before adopting any opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all sides the reasons for which he thought and acted . I do not think I perceived , in my last talk with him , the least variation in his views on conduct or policy in Church or State . This ought not to be a singular thing among educated men , but , as a matter of fact , nothing is rarer . One of the effects of democracy , on which he often dwelt , and concerning which , I confess , I agreed with him , was the disappearance of what might be called " the men of light and leading , " for to be a man of light and leading one must certainly provide himself , early in life , with a set of opinions which will bear rough usage When I was a young man , there were several men , Seward , Calhoun , Webster , Clay , and the like , who were acknowledged to have occupied such a position , and to have furnished numerous disciples with thought and arguments Such disciples were found in every . State , ready to solve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not in the words , of their master But men of this type have disappeared wholly from public gaze . We have hardly a public man among us who does not change his political clothing , from his skin out , for no other reason than that the majority has differed from him . At the outbreak of the war with Spain , I remember a general in the Mississippi valley who was a noted Anti-Imperialist . Within a month he was an equally violent Imperialist , for the simple reason that " the people of the Mississippi valley , " he said , " knew better than he what was best " ? which was not true , as he had studied the matter , while they knew nothing about it In fact , the number of those who are able to stand defeat , and continue the work in a losing fight , is very small This increasing tendency of democracy to kill opposition by sheer weight of numbers was a subject I often discussed with Mr Park-man , and found that he had paid more attention to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among Americans of what they call " getting left , " meaning thereby being left in a minority Nothing seemed to fill them with more dread than being abandoned by the larger number of voters In fact , the greatest use I see of an aristocracy in a free country is the supply of a number of men , however small , who are not afraid to stand alone , whose faith in their own opinions is not shaken by the fact that most people do not hold them . As I have said before , Parkman , though a fervent Democrat , believed only in what might be called a " led democracy " ? that is , a democracy whose opinions are shaped and whose action is determined by a few men of known capacity . That any good can eventually come from " buffalo stampedes , " either in Congress or in the country , of an ignorant and excited multitude , he refused to believe . That way , he considered , the danger lay . To the effect of this on young men I need not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is formed and guides are adopted for conduct through life . This is something to which , as far as I can see , our colleges pay little heed . Our college youths are harrowed by agitators , just as much as the mobs in our streets At the outbreak of the late war , a swashbuckler was allowed to raid our undergraduates , and carry them off in considerable numbers from their studies , to serve as recruits in a contest of whose causes and objects they were equally ignorant . Parkman was a man who had none of the recently begotten horror of war , he was as much prepared to fight as anybody , in defence of his country , but he was not prepared to attack anybody without cause . This cause being given , I never looked him in the face without seeing the pos sibility , if engaged in a fight which he understood , of his using Henri de la Roche ' Jaquelm 's address to his Bretons , " Si j'aVance , suivez-moi ; si je me recule , tuez-raoi , si je @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are accustomed , I know not with how much correctness , to consider an indication of unconquerable resolution , of " courage never to submit or yield " One of the reasons for which I most regretted his invalidism was that it prevented his taking a more prominent place in the education of American youth Parkman often reminded me of Walter Scott His mental make-up was very much the same , he had the same deep and abiding love of his native land , of " the brown heath and shaggy woods , " in which his boyhood had been passed , and the same reverence for the America of his ancestors that Scott felt for the Borderland It was the respectability and social station of such men , and their high standards , which touched him a great deal more than the growth of the population and the immense exports of hogs and corn of later days . His imagination was fired by far other things about his country than these , and he was not kindled by the thought of being " a world power " In fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state of mind about Expansion that Scott was about the gradual effacement of the house of Buccleuch . He was affected far more by the quality of his fellow-citizens , by their fitness or unfitness for the management of a great state , than by their numbers I can imagine how much he would have suffered , bad he lived to see open abuse or depreciation of the Constitution by its paid agents , and the ship of state sent adrift on the stormy waves of one-man power Of course , it is a misfortune to be no longer in tune with the tendencies of one 's day , and , perhaps , it is as well that he did not live to see the wreck of early hopes . Taking him for all in all , we probably shall never look upon his like again . E. L. G.
