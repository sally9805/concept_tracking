txt Slow moving In the fog and amid a maze of shipping , incoming and outgoing , the big British freighter Catalone , from Boston , late yesterday afternoon ran down and sank the steamer Daghestan off Sandy Hook , at the entrance to the Gedney Channel . The latter sank slowly , and the crew , some thirty-five men , were able to launch their boats and get away without loss of life , ' so far as is now known . The Daghestan , also under the British flag . was feeling her way slowly toward the open sea , going cautiously , with her whistie sounding . This is the second accident of the Winter to happen off the Hook during the fog , Last night the Daghestan lay within half a mile of where the Panama liner Finance was sunk by the White Star liner Georgic on Thanksgiving Day . The news of the collision reached Quarantine late last night . It was brought by the skipper of the steamer Esperanza . The MerrittChapman Wrecking Company and J. H. Winchester , the agent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be taken for saving the cargo of the DaghesI tan and raising the vessel . Many of the details of the accident are missing . The Catalone was 500 yards south of the sea end of the channel , and was coming slowly toward it , when the hull of the Daghestan was made out almost dead ahead . The weather was very thick , and both vessels were groping their way . The outgoing vessel loomed up so suddenly that there was not much chance of lessening the blow . A quick signal to reverse , full speed astern from the bridge to the engine room of the Catalone , but this did not check her headway . With a crash her steel cutwater struck the port side of the Daghestan , ripping up her plates , and cutting a gaping hole in her side . As the two craft fell apart the water began to pour into the hole in the Daghestan , and within a very few minutes she began to settle . Capt . Haig of the Daghestan , when he saw that the Catalone was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get out of her way . There was a quick jangling of bells in the engine room , the shock of the sudden reversal of her screws , and then the crash that sent the men tumbling to the decks . From out of the fog blanket came the whistles of other craft , and as the steamers smashed together a few small craft crept out of the fog , their skippers straining to see through the fog what had happened , while with one hand they kept their whistle cords taut . From the Catalone the sharp rattle of her anchor chain was heard , as the order was given to let go the anchor . On the Daghestan was activity and some excitement , but on the whole the crew acted in art orderly manner . As the vessel began to fill , from her engine room and stoke hole , the firemen poured on deck . They got there in time to assist in lowering the boats . Some of the watch , who had been on deck when the vessels came together , managed to scramble up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Daghestan , working desperately , managed to get their boats into the water without accident . They rowed away and were some distance off when the steamer gradually sank until she rested on the bottom . So far as those who were near by at the time knew every one got away in safety . The feet that they did so is evidence of good seamanship , for at the time the weather was rough . A stiff breeze was kicking up a heavy sea . Occasionally there was a dash of sleet , and this made the life-saving work difficult . The pilot boat New York was near by , and hurrying to the side of the sinking vessel , made as sure as was possible in a limited time that every one was off the sinking steamer . The crew of the Daghestan rowed to the Catalone , but were taken off a little later by the pilotboat . Incoming and very near at the time were the steamer Esperanza and the Ward liner Bayern ? .

It is presumed that she is not seriously damaged , but as sho is not fitted with a wireless outfit communication with her was impossible last night . The Daghestan was on her way to Marseilles . She cleared on Dec. 16 , and got caught In the fog . She had on board a valuable cargo of miscellaneous merchandise .
