txt After almost eight years , spent in the process of dissolution , the Republio Savings and Loan Association will pay to its shareholders 6 cents on the dollar , according to the report filed yesterday in the Supreme Court , Brooklyn , by Referee Alexander , who was appointed on Feb. 27 , 1907 , to examine into the receivership of Edward G. Riggs and Otto Kelsey and report on the objections to the receivers ' accounts filed by shareholders In the company . According to the testimony taken by the referee . which comprises 1,916 typewritten pages , there remains for the victims of the ill-fated concern but $30,000 . The last official report of the company put the estimated value of assets at $1 , - 086,000 , and declared that at least $904 , - 000 could be realized on them . The actual ' amount realized by the receivers , however , was only $275,000 , while the cost of administrating the company 's affairs was $103,000 . Of this amount the receivers ' fees amounted to $14,000 , while $179,000 was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and for incidental expenses . The capital stock of the come pany is $500.000 . Referee reports that on Nov. 5 an agreement was reached between the attorneys for the shareholders and counsel far the receivers , subject to the approval of the courts . This agreement , which is embodied in the report , provides as follows : ( 1 ) That the receivers shall not allow any of the funds remaining to go into any other hands without an order from the court ; ( 2 ) that no further loans or disbursements shall be paid I to attorneys for the receivers except those confirmed in the report of the referee ; 1 ( 3 ) that the receivers shall be surcharged the sum of $2,000 each ; ( 4 ) that the peoplel of the State of New York , as plaintiffs , I shall withdraw objections to and accept ' the receivers ' accounts . This agreement , which Referee urges the court to approve , obtains for the shareholders , he declares , all the concessions which could possibly result from further and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ referee says , has been due wholly to the enormous attorneys ' fees and the accounting-for them , which ' was unnecessarily prolonged . The report . continues : " It is , indeed . a very unfortunate situation for the shareholders to find that the assets of this corporation , which were placed by the State Banking Department just prior to the appointment of the receivers at $1,086,000 , and subsequently fixed by the receivers themselves at $001,000 , have shrunk to about $30,000 , as appears by the receivers ' final account . This was apparently due to two causes : " First  --  to the improvement and reckless investments made by the officers of the corporation . " Second  --  to the expenses of the ad , ministration of the receivership . " We find that by the receivers ' account the assets , which were placed at $1,086 , - 000 , realized only $215,000 , and of the $275,000 it cost $103,000 to administer the same . Of this sum the receivers obtained only $14,000 between them for their fees in the proceeding ; the remainder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disbursements of counsel , salaries of clerks and rent . " It will be observed that the receivers got a very small part of this outlay , the bulk of it being expended primarily for legal expenses . " The receivers impressed me favorably with their apparent desire to aid the court in every Way possible and to explain every detail of expense and necessity for the same , of which they had any knowledge , but it did appear to me that their attorneys had unnecessarily prolonged these proceedings , which should have been closed some time ago . " It should in fairness be said that the administration of this property is in no wise different from or relatively more ex- II pensive than that of the average receiv. ership in New York State to-day . Oure statutes have permitted the growth a a system which has received the positive , if not active , approval of the courts , whererby the sole administration of affaire usually Is placed in the hands of the re . ' ceivers ' attorneys , who envelop the most trifling matters in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business experience should suffice . " The purpose is , of course , to protect the receivers and have them act in strict accordance with the law . The result is , however , as demonstrated in this case . that the expense of administration is nearly 70 per cent . of the entire assets . Otto C. Kelsey , one of the receivers , whose work has been approved by Mr. , is the State Superintendent of Insurance . KILLED , PUT ON THE TRACK . Italian Dead Before Staten Island Train Hit Him . An autopsy made on the body of an Italian , which was picked up yesterday morning after a train had passed over it near Tottenville , S. ta showed that instead of being the victim of accident , the man was undoubtedly murdered and his body put on the tracks .
