A CROWD civilization produces , as is matter of course , crowd art and art for crowded conditions . This fact is at once the glory and the weakness of the kind of art a democracy is bound to have . The most Batumi evidence to turn to first ? of the crowd in a crowd age ? is such as can be found in its literature , especially in its masterpieces . The significance of shaking hands with a Senator of the United States is that it is a convenient and labor-saving way of shaking hands with two or three million people . The impressiveness of the Senator 's Washington voice , the voice on the floor of the Senate , consists in the mystical undertone , ? the chorus in it , ? multitudes in smoking cities , men and woolen , rich and poor , who are speaking when this man speaks , and who are silent when he is silent , in the government of the United States . The typical fact that the Senator stands for in modern life has a corresponding typical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literature is the epigram , the senatorial sentence , ? the sentence that immeasurably represents what it does not say . The difference between democracy in Washington and democracy in Athens may be said to be that in Washington we have an epigram government , a government in which seventy million people are crowded into two rooms to consider what to do , and in which seventy million people are made to sit in one chair to see that it is done . In Athens every man represented himself . It may be said to be a good working distinction between modern and classic art that in modern art words and colors and sounds stand for things , and in classic art they said them . In the art of the Greek , things were what they seemed , and they were all there . Hence simplicity . It is a quality of the art of to-day that things are not what they seem in it . If they were , we should not call it art at all . Everything stands not only for itself and for what it says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . Every sound in music is the senator of a thousand sounds , thoughts , and associations , and in literature every word that is allowed to appear is the representative in three syllables of three pages of a dictionary . The whistle of the lo- // comotive , and the ring of the telephone , : mil the still , swift rush of the elevator are making themselves felt in the ideal world . They are proclaiming to the ideal world that the real world is outstripping it . The twelve thousand horse steamer does not find itself : w-power curately expressed in iambics on the leisurely fleet of Ulysses . It is seek-log new expression . The command has gone forth over all the beauty and over all the art of the present world , crowded for time and crowded for space . " Telegraph ! " To the nine Muses the order Hies . One can hear it on every side . " Telegraph ! " The result is symbolism , this Morse alphabet of art and " types , " the epigrams of Inunafi nature , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ epic is telescoped into the sonnet , and the sonnet is compressed into quatrains or ' Faiths of poetry , and couplets are signed as masterpieces . The novel has come into being , ? several hundred pages of crowded people in crowded sentences , jostling each other to oblivion ; and now the novel , jostled into oblivion by the next novel , is becoming the short story . Kipling 's short stories sum the situation up . So far as skeleton or plot is concerned , they are built up out of a bit of nothing put with an infinity of Kipling ; so far as meat is concerned , they are the Liebig Beef Extract of fiction . A single jar of Kipling contains a whole herd of old-time novels lowing on a hundred hills . The classic of any given world is a work of art that has passed through the same process in being a work of art that that world has passed through in being a world . Mr. Kipling represents a crowd age , because he is crowded with it ; because , above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the way the age he lives in is producing everything else . This is no mere circumstance of democracy . It is its manifest destiny that it shall produce art for crowded conditions , that it shall have crowd art . The kind of beauty that can be indefinitely mul- tiplied is the kind of beauty in which , in the nature of things , we have made our most characteristic and most impo ? - tant progress . Our most considerable success in pictures could not be otherwise than in black and white . Blackand-white art is printing-press art , and art that can be produced in endless copies , that can be subscribed for by crowds , finds an extraordinary demand , and artists have applied themselves to supplying it . All the improvements , ? moving on through the use of wood and steel and copper , and the process of etching , to the photogravure , the lithograph , and the latest photograph in color , ? whatever else may he said of them from the point of view of Titian or Michael Angelo , constitute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view of making art a democracy , of making the rare and the beautiful minister day and night to crowds . The fact that the mechanical arts are so prominent in their relation to the fine arts may not seem to argue a high ideal amongst us ; but as the mechanical arts are the body of beauty , and the fine arts are the soul of it , it is a necessary part of the ideal to keep body and soul together until we can do better . Mourning with Ruskin is not so much to the point as going to work with William Morris . If we have deeper feelings about wall papers than we have about other things , it is going to the root of the matter to begin with wall papers , ? to make machinery say something as beautiful as possible , inasmuch as it is bound to have , for a long time at least , about all the say there is . The photograph does not go about the world doing Murillos everywhere by pressing a button , but the camera habit is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of great masses of men to where they enjoy beauty in the world than Leonardo do Vinci would have dared to dream in his far-off day ; and Leonardo 's pictures ? thanks to the same photograph ? and everybody 's pictures , films of paper , countless spirits of themselves , pass around the world to every home in Christendom . The printing press made literature a democracy , and machinery is making all the arts democracies . The symphony piano , an invention for making vast numbers of people who can play only a few very poor things play very poorly a great many good ones , is a consummate instance both of the limitation and the value of our contemporary tendency in the arts . The pipe organ , though on a much higher plane , is an equally characteristic contrivance , making it possible for a man to be a complete orchestra and a conductor all by himself , playing on a crowd of instruments , to a crowd of people , with two hands and one pair of feet . It is a crowd invention . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of republic of sound , the unseen spirit of the many in one ? is the sublimest expression yet attained of the crowd music , which is , and must be , the supreme music of this modern day , the symphony . Richard Wagner comes to his triumph because his music is the voice of multitudes . The opera ? a crowd of sounds accompanied by a crowd of sights , presented by one crowd of people on the stage to another crowd of people in the galleries ? stands for the same tendency in art that the syndicate stands for in commerce . It is syndicate music ; and in proportion as a musical composition in this present day is an aggregation of multitudinous moods , in proportion as it is suggestive , complex , paradoxical , the way a crowd is complex , suggestive , and paradoxical , ? provided it be wrought at the same time into some vast and splendid unity , just in this proportion is it modern music . It gives itself to the counterpoints of the spirit , the passion of variety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is it not descended upon us ? ? the spirit of a thousand nations ? All our arts are thousand-nation arts , shadows and echoes of dead worlds play . ing upon our own . Italian music , eat of its feudal kingdoms , comes to as as essentially solo music , ? melody ; and the civilization of Greece , being a eivi. lization of heroes , individuals , comes to us in its noble array with its solo arts , its striding heroes everywhere in front of all , and with nothing nearer to the people in it than the Greek Chorus , which , out of limbo , pale and featureless across all ages , sounds to us as the first far faint coming of the crowd to the arts of this groping world . Modern art , inheriting each of these and each of all things , is revealed to us as the struggle to express all things at once . Democracy is democracy for this very reason , and for no other : that all things may be expressed at once in it , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expressed at once in it . Being a race of hero worshipers , the Greeks said the best , perhaps , that could be said in sculpture ; but the marbles and bronzes of a democracy , having average men for subjects , and being done by average men , are average marbles and bronzes . We express what we have . We are in a transition stage . It is not without its significance , however , that we have perfected the plaster cast , ? the establishment of democracy among statues , ? and mobs of Greek gods mingling with the people can be seen almost any day in every considerable city of the world . The same principle is working itself out in our architecture . It is idle to contend against the principle . The way out is the way through . However eagerly we gaze at Parthenons on their ruined hills , if twenty-one-story blocks are in our souls , twenty-one-story blocks will be our masterpieces , whether we like it or not . They will be our masterpieces because they tell the truth about us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the thing that must be told first before beauty can begin . The beauty we arc to have shall only . be worked out from the // truth we have . Living as we do in a new era , not to see that the twenty-one-story block is the expression of a new truth is to turn ourselves away from the one way that beauty can ever be found by men , whether in this era or in any other . What is it that the twenty-one-story block is trying to say about us ? The twenty-one-story block is the masterpiece of mass , of immensity , of numbers ; with its 1425 windows and its 497 offices , and its crowds of lives piled upon lives , it is expressing the one supreme and characteristic thing that is taking place in the era in which we live . The city is the main fact that modern civilization stands for , and crowding is the logical architectural form of the city idea . The twenty-one-story block is the statue of a crowd . It stands for a spiritual fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful . The only way to make the twenty - one - story block beautiful ( the crowd expressed by the crowd ) is to make the crowd beautiful . The most artistic , the only artistic thing the world lower stories of the sky , were not possible in the ancient world , because steel load not been invented ; and the invention of steel , which is not the least of our triumphs in the mechanical arts , is in many ways the most characteristic . Steel is republican for stone . Putting whole quarries into a single girder , it makes room for crowds ; and what is more significant than this , inasmuch as the steel pillar is an invention that makes it possible to put floors up first , and build the walls around the floors , instead of putting the walls up first , and supporting the floors upon the walls , as in the ancient world , it has come to pass that the modern world being the ancient world turned upside down , modern architecture is ancient architecture turned inside out , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall of individuals , supporting floor after floor and stage after stage of society , from the lowest to the highest ; and it is a typical fact in this modern democratic world that it grows from the inside , and that it supports itself from the inside . When the mass in the centre has been finished , an ornamental stone facing of great individuals will be built around it and supported by it , and the work will be considered done . ifhe modern spirit has much to boast of in its mechanical arts , and in its fine arts ahnost nothing at all , because the mechanical arts are studying what men are needing to-day , and the fine arts are studying what the Greeks needed three thousand years ago . To be a real classic is , first , to be a contemporary of one 's own time ; second , to be a contemporary of one 's own time so deeply and widely as to be a contemporary of all time . The true Greek is a man who is doing with his own age what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bear upon it , interpreting it . As long as the fine arts miss the fundamental principle of this present age , ? the crowd principle , ? and the mechanical arts do not , the mechanical arts are bound to have their way with us . And it were vastly better that they should . Sincere and straightforward mechanical arts are not only more beautiful than affected fine ones , but they are more to the point ; they are the one sure sign we have of where we are going to be beautiful next . It is impossible to love the fine arts in the year 1901 without studying the mechanical ones ; without finding one 's self looking for artistic material in the things that people are using , and that they are obliged to use . The determining law of a thing of beauty being , in the nature of things , what it is for , the very essence of the classic attitude in a utilitarian age is to make the beautiful follow the useful and inspire the useful with its spirit . The fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transfiguring of the mechan- 244 Making the Crowd Beautifid. ical arts . The modern hotel , having been made necessary by great natural forces in modern life , and having been made possible by new mechanical arts , now puts itself forward as the next great opportunity of the fine arts . One of the characteristic achievements of the immediate future shall be the twentieth-century Parthenon , ? a Parthenon not of the great and of the few and of the gods , but of the great many , where , through mighty corridors , day and night , democracy wanders and sleeps and chatters and is sad , and lives and dies , the streets rumbling below . The hotel , ? the crowd fireside , ? being more than any other one thing , perhaps , the thing that this civilization is about , the token of what it loves and of how it lives , is bound to be a masterpiece sooner or later that shall express democracy . The hotel rotunda , the parlor for multitudes , is bound to be made beautiful in ways we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never wanted parlors before . The idea of a parlor has been to get out of a multitude . All the inevitable problems that come of having a whole city of families live in one house have yet to be solved by the fine arts as well as by the mechanical ones . We have barely begun . The time is bound to come when the radiator , the crowd 's fireplace-in-a-pipe , shall be made beautiful ; and when the electric light shall be taught the secret of the candle ; and when the especial problem of modern life , of how to make two rooms as good as twelve , shall be mastered aesthetically as well as mathematically ; and when even the piano - folding- bed - bookcase - toiletstand-writing-desk ? a crowd invention for living in a crowd ? shall either take beauty to itself , or lead to beauty that serves the same end . While for the time being it seems to be true that the fine arts are looking to the past , the mechanical arts are producing conditions in the future that will bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be brought to terms or not . The mechanical arts hold the situation in their hands . It is decreed that people who can not begin by making the things they use beautiful shall be allowed no beauty in other things . We may wish that Parthenons and cathedrals were within our souls ; but what the cathe. dral said of an age that had the cathedral mood , that had a cathedral civilize. lion and thrones and popes in it , we are bound to say in some stupendous fashion of our own , ? something which , when it is built at last , will be left worshiping upon the ground beneath the sky when we are dead , as a memorial that we too have lived . ? The great cathedrals , with the feet of the huddled and dreary poor upon their floors , and saints and heroes shining on their pillars , and priests behind the chancel with God to themselves , and the vast and vacant nave , symbol of the heaven glimmering above that few could reach , ? it is not to these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nations that are now unborn ; rather , though it be strange to say it , we shall look to something like the ocean steamship ? cathedral of this huge unresting modern world ? under the wide heaven , on the infinite seas , with spars for towers and the empty nave reversed filled with human beings , souls , ? the cathedral of crowds hurrying to crowds . There are hundreds of them throbbing and gleam-big in the night , ? this very moment , ? lonely cities in the hollow of the stars , bringing together the nations of the earth . When the spirit of a thing , the idea of it , the fact that it stands for , has found its way at last into the minds of artists , masterpieces shall come to us out of every great and living activity in our lives . Art shall tell the things these lives are about . When this fact is once realized in America as it was in Greece , the fine arts shall cover the other arts as the waters cover the sea . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sky and sea , comes nearer to being a work of art than almost anything we possess to-day , because it tells the truth , because it is the material form of a spiritual idea , because it is a sublime and beautiful expression of New York in the way that the Acropolis was a sublime and beautiful expression of Athens . The Acropolis was beautiful because it was the abode of heroes , of great individuals ; and the Brooklyn Bridge , because it expresses the bringing together of millions of men . It is the architecture of crowds , ? this Brooklyn Bridge , ? with winds and sunsets and the dark and the tides of souls upon it ; it is the type and symbol of the kind of thing that our modern genius is bound to make beautiful and immortal before it dies . The very word " bridge " is the , symbol of the future of art and of everything else , the bringing together of things that are apart , ? democracy . The bridge , which makes land across the water , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the cable , which makes land and water alike , ? these are the physical forms of the spirit of modern life , the democracy of matter . But the spirit has countless forms . They are all new , and they are all waiting to be made beautiful . The dumb crowd waits in them . We have electricity , ? the life current of the republican idea , ? characteristically our foremost invention , because it takes all power that belongs to individual places and puts it on a wire and carries it to all places . We have the telephone , an invention which makes it possible for a man to live on a back street and be a next-door neighbor to boulevards ; and we have the trolley , the modern reduction of the private carriage to its lowest terms , so that any man for five cents can have as much carriage power as Napoleon with all his chariots . We have the phonograph , an invention which gives a man a thousand voices ; which sets him to singing a thousand songs at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible for the commonest man to hear the whisper of Bismarck or Gladstone , to unwind crowds of great men by the firelight of his own house . We have the elevator , an invention for making the many as well off as the few , an approximate arrangement for giving first floors to everybody , and putting all men on a level at the same price , ? one more of a thousand instances of the extraordinary manner in which the mechanical arts have devoted themselves from first to last to the Constitution of the United States . While it can not be said of many of these tools of existence that they are beautiful now , it is enough to affirm that when they are perfected they will be beautiful ; and that if we can not make beautiful the things that we need , we can not expect to make beautiful the things that we merely want . When the beauty of these things is at last brought out , WO shall have attained the most characteristic and original and expressive and beautiful art that is in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell unprecedented truths . It was the mission of ancient art to express states of being and individuals , and it may be said to be in a general way the mission of our modern art to express the beautiful in endless change , the movement of masses , coming to its sublimity and immortality at last by revealing the beauty of the things that move and that have to do with ' notion , the bringing of all things and of all souls together on the earth . The fulfillment of the word that has been written , " Your valleys shall be exalted , and your mountains shall be made low , " is by no means a beautiful process . Democracy is the grading principle of the beautiful . The natural tendency the arts have had from the first to rise from the level of the world , to make themselves into Switze ? lands in it , is finding itself confronted with the Constitution of the United States , ? a Constitution which , whatever it may be said to mean in the years to come , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present time , at least , as standing for the table-land . The very least that can be granted to this Constitution is that it is so consummate a political document that it has made itself the creed of our theology , philosophy , and sociology ; the principle of our commerce and industry ; the law of production , education , and journalism ; the method of our life ; the controlling characteristic and the significant force in our literature ; and the thing our religion and our arts are about . If it is true , as events now seem to point out , that whatever is accomplished in a crowd civilization ? that is , a modern civilization ? is being accomplished by the crowd for the crowd , we are brought face to face with what must soon be recognized as the great challenge of modern life . Nothing beautiful can be accomplished in a crowd civilization , by the crowd for the crowd , unless the crowd is beautiful . No man who is engaged in looking under the lives about him , who wishes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to-day , will find himself able to avoid this last and most important fact in the history of the world , ? the fact that , whatever it may mean , or whether it is for better or worse , the world has staked all that it is and has been , and all that it is capable of being , on the one supreme issue , " How can the crowd be made beautiful ? " The answer to this question involves two difficulties : ( 1 . ) A crowd can not snake itself beautiful . ( 2 . ) A crowd will not let any one else make it beautiful . The men who have been on the whole the most eager democrats of history , ? the real-idealists , that is , ? the men who love the crowd and the beautiful too , and who can have no honest or human pleasure in either of them except as they are being drawn together , are obliged to admit that living in a democratic country , a country where politics and aesthetics can no longer be kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large part of the time with heavy hearts . We are obliged to admit that it is a country where paintings have little but the Constitution of the United States wrought into them ; where sculpture is voted and paid for by the common people ; where music is composed for majorities ; where poetry is sting to a circulation ; where literature itself is scaled to subscription lists ; where all the creators of the True and the Beautiful and the Good may be seen almost any day , tramping the table-land of the average snap . fed by the average man , allowed to live by the average man , plodding along with weary and dusty steps to the average man 's forgetfulness . And indeed , it is no least trait of this same average man that he forgets , that he is forgotten , that all his slaves are forgotten ; that the world remembers only those who have been his masters . On the other hand , the literature of finding fault with the average man ( which is what the larger part of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of literature that can do anything to mend matte 's . The art of finding fault with the average man , with the fact that the world is made convenient for him , is inferior art because it is helpless art . The world is made convenient for the average man because it has to be , to get him to live in it ; and if the world were not made convenient for bins , the man of genius would find living with him a great deal more uncomfortable than he does . Ile would not even be allowed the comfort of saying how uncomfortable . The world belongs to the average man , and , excepting the stars and other things that are too big to belong to him , the moment the average man deserves anything better in it or more beautiful in it than he is getting , some man of genius rises by his side , in spite of him , and claims it for him . Then he slowly claims it for himself . The last thing to do , to make the world a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make it a world with nothing but average men in it . If it is the ideal of democracy that there shall be a slow massive lifting , a grading up of all things at once ; that whatever is highest in the True and the Beautiful , and whatever is lowest in it , shall be graded down and graded up to the middle height of human life , where the greatest numbers shall make their home and live upon it ; if the ideal of democracy is table-land , ? that is , mountains for everybody , ? a few mountains most be kept on hand to make table-land out of . Two solutions , then , of a crowd civilization ? having the extraordinary men crowded out of it as a convenience to the average ones , and having the average men crowded out of it as a convenience to the extraordinary ones ? are equally impracticable . This brings us to the horns of our dilemma . If the crowd can not be made beautiful by itself , and if the crowd will not allow itself to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can only be made beautiful by a man who lives so great a life in it that he can make a crowd beautiful whether it allows bins to or not . When this man is born to us and looks out on the conditions around him , Ise will find that to be born in a crowd civilization is to be born in a civilization , first , in which every man can do as he pleases ; second , in which nobody does . Every man is given by the government absolute freedom ; and when it has given him absolute freedom , the government says to him , " Now , if you can get enough other men , with their absolute freedom , to put their absolute freedom with your absolute freedom , you can use your absolute freedom in any way you want . " Democracy , seeking to free a man from being a slave to one master , has simply increased the number of masters a man shall have . He is hemmed in with crowds of masters . He can not see his master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his master and reason with him . He can not even plead with him . You can cry your heart out to one of these modern ballot boxes . You have but one ballot . They will not count tears . The ultimate question in a crowd civilization becomes , not " What does a thing mean ? " or " What is it worth ? " but " How much is there of it ? " " If thou art a great man , " says Civilization , " get thou a crowd for thy greatness . Then come with thy crowd , and we will deal with thee . It shall be even as thou wilt . " The pressure has become so great , as is obvious on every side , that men who are of small or ordinary calibre can only be more pressed by it . They are pressed smaller and smaller , ? the more they are civilized , the smaller they are pressed ; and we are being daily brought face to face with the fact that the one solution a crowd civilization can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man in the crowd who can withstand the pressure of ; die crowd ; that is to say , the one solution of a crowd civilization is the great-man solution , ? a solution which is none the less true because by name , at least , it leaves most of us out , or because it is so familiar that we have forgotten it . The one method by which a crowd can be freed and can be made to realize itself is the great-mall method , ? the method of crucifying and worshiping great men , until by crucifying and worshiping great men enough , inch by inch and era by era , it is lifted to greatness itself . Not very many years ago , certain great and good men , who at the cost of infinite pains were standing at the time on a safe and lofty rock , protected from the fury of their kind by the fury of the sea , co/strived to say to the older nations of the earth , " All men are created equal . " It is a thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who declared that all men were created equal , had not been some several hundred per cent better men than the men they said they were created equal to , it would sot have made any difference to us or to any one else whether they had said that all men were created equal or not , or whether the Republic had ever been started or not , in which every man , for hundreds of years , should look up to these men and worship them , as the kind of men that every man in America was free to try to equal . A civilization by numbers , a crowd civilization , if it had not been started by heroes , could never have been started at all ; and on whether or not this civilization shall attempt to live by the crowd principle , without men in it who are living by the hero principle , depends the question whether this civilization , with all its crowds , shall stand or fall among the civilizations of the earth . The main difference between the heroes of Plymouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the heroes who must contrive to proclaim freedom now is that tyranny now is crowding around the Rock , and climbing up on the Rock , seventy-five million strong , and that tyranny then was a half-idiot king three thousand nines away . ITI . Bearing in mind the extraordinary and almost impossible terms the crowd civilization makes with the Individual , the question arises , " If the crowd is to be made beautiful by the Individual , ? by the great man in it , ? what kind of a great man is it going to be necessary for a man to be , and what kind of a life shall he live % " Looking at the matter from the historical point of view , whatever else this man may be , he will be an artist ( using the word in the heroic and more generous sense ) , and he will live the life of the artist . A crowd can only be made beautiful by a man who defies it and delights in it at once . A crowd can only be defied by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it can not be delighted in or helped except by a man who has re . sources inside the crowd , who is identified with it . The man who masters the crowd enough to serve it can only do it by attacking it from the outside and the inside at the same time , by putting his inside and outside resources together . He must be a man who has the spirit of the artist , who is a sharer and spectator at once ; living above the crowd enough to lift it , and living in the midst of the crowd enough to be loved by it , so that it will let him lift it . The man who lives in two worlds , ? the world the crowd has , and the world it ought to have ; who insists on keeping up a complete establishment in each of them ; who moves from one to the other as his work demands , avoiding the disadvantages of both worlds , and claiming the advantages of both , is the only man who can be free and independent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the method ? either in matter or in it ? that world-lifting calls for . It is impossible for a man to become interested in world-lifting ? to feel , as many men do , that it is the only exercise that has joy enough in it to be worth while ? without coining to the conclusion very soon that the only way to move anything as large as a world is to get hold of another world to move it with , one that is at least one size larger than this one The world that is one size larger than this one is the ideal world . By this is not meant the one our ditties are about ( mainly remarkable for being one size smaller than this one ) , but the ideal world which is the to-morrow of this one , ? of this one as it actually is , ? the real-ideal world , unashamed of nature , based upon an apocalypse of facts . The men who most habitually demand the freedom of two worlds to do their living in are found to be , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every generation , the artists of that generation . Artists may be defined as the men in // all classes of society and in every walk of life who are pre8minent for seeing things for themselves , and who are engaged in making over the things that they see for themselves into things that others can see . They may stiffer as regards the substances they are dealing with , and the spirit they are expressing in the substances , or they may differ in degree in their power of seeing what they see and embodying it , but they all have the same class of power in theist , and they can differ only in their degree of power . When a man sees with such vividness that vision overflows from him on all the lives around him , and he lights all men up to themselves ; when he sees so deeply and clearly that he has merely to say the thing that he sees , to snake other men do it , he is an artist of the first degree of power , like Ralph Waldo Emerson or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sees the thing he sees clearly enough to do it himself , like William Morris or Thomas Edison , ? two men who have lived their lives on the opposite sides of Wonder , both artists with it , as far around it as they could see , but who , like most artists of the second degree , are scarcely on speaking terms with each other . Laying all matters of degree aside , however , the important fact remains , that whether it is a great commercial enterprise , a new-dreamed loom , or dynamo , or telephone , or water color , or symphony , any man who is a seer in matter and spirit is an artist ; and all artists stray be said to belong to the same class , ? that is , the master class . They are all two-world men , engaged in making an ideal something in the world within them over into a real something in the world outside them . It is these men who have made the world , and the history of their lives is the history of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in men like these are as if they had never been , to us . They have but rearranged Dust on the edge of the globe . They blow like an empty wind on it , and vanish . Nations do things . Ages are full of achievements . They pile and unpile , and die ; but at last , in the great dim gallery of the years , the nation that has lived and struggled and died , and piled and unpiled , shall be but the sound of a Voice to us , or a bit of color , or a vision to light it world with , or a few beautiful words . It shall be what some lutist did with it . It shall say in clay and spirit what he ; mule it say ; and if he can not make it say anything , if it is a world that will not let him snake it say anything , men shall not know that world . They shall not even know that it is silent . We are not making too large a claim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world two thousand years after they are dead were the real masters of it when they lived , whether any one knew it or not . And it is the mess who are the most like these , the two-world men , the artists , who are the real masters of it now . Iv . If the only way that our modern civilization Call be made beautiful is to make the crowd beautiful ; and if the crowd will not snake itself beautiful , and will not let any one else make it beautiful ; and if it can only be made beautiful by the great man in it delighting in it and defying it ; and if the only way a man can be a great man in a crowd civilization is to be a two-world man , ass artist , the next question that confronts us is , considering the trend of a crowd civilization , " What kind of an strtist will he be ? " He will be a novelist . Whatever his art form may be called , and whether he literally writes novels or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habit , and the temperament of the great novelist . The crowd can only be made beautiful in proportion as every man in the crowd is interpreted to every other mass in the crowd . The reason that the crowd is not beautiful now is that interprets. - 250 Making the Crowd Beautiful . thin has not taken place . Every man in the crowd is spending his time in struggling against every other man instead of in understanding him . The more time such men spend in doing " practical things , " ? that is , in struggling against one another 's lives to get a living , ? the less they understand one another 's lives . The man who is going to be able to make every man , living in his pigeonhole in the crowd , understand every other man will be a man who spends a great deal of time in understanding every man in the crowd ; that is , in watching all of the crowd 's pigeonholes instead of merely struggling inside one of them . The man who comes nearest to doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artist , in conditions like these , in proportion as lie is a novelist . The great artist of the modern age can not help being a novelist . The novel is what the modern age is for . It tells what every man in it is for . The only artist who can either get or hold the attention of men who are living in a modern age is the artist who will tell these men what they are for , and who will tell them what other men are for . The artist who shall be able to put himself in the place of the most men shall he the greatest artist a modern age can produce , because he will be the most practical man in it , ? the man who is most to the point in it . He may make his point by being a novelist who writes poems , as Browning did ; or by being a novelist in oils , like Sargent or Millet ; or a novelist with an orchestra , like Wagner ; but in proportion as lie is a powerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of persons . To say that the power to do this is a beautiful or graceful accomplishment , that it ought to be held in honor by a practical world , is not enough . The power of putting one 's self in the place of other men is the most direct and practical and lasting force of human history . It is the primal energy of it . It is what the ages and nations are for . Every-government that has lived has lived lee . cause it could put itself in the place of more men than the governments before it , and it has died because it could not put itself in the place of men enough . A man 's ability to put himself in the place of others is religion and economics , literature and art , theology , sociology , and politics , all in one . The typical man who has this ability is the artist , and the typical artist who has it is the novelist . This truth is so true that , like all reaching-under truths , it applies to all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a force in it , a maker of the crowd beautiful , in proportion as he is his own novelist , goes op and down in it , living his life with the instincts of the novelist . The man we call great in history is a great or less great man according to the repertoire of the men he might have been , flee different kinds of lives he might have lived . The preeminence of Shakespeare is that he might have been almost any one else . that he had a many-peopled typically modern mind . As far as he went , Shakespeare ( like most men of genius ) may be characterized as a pagan who had the abilities of Christ ; and the one ability Christ had , that included all the others , was his ability to he all men in one , ? the comprehensiveness of his temperament . His supreme doctrine was his ability , and it was his abilities rather than his doctrines that lie sought to convey to others . The degree of a man 's Christianity in any age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the kinds of men he can put himself in the place of . The Golden Rule was offered to the world as an ability , and not as a precept . This ability , by whatever theological name it is called , is the typical ability of the artist ; and it is the one ability that can ever draw the crowd together , that can ever make the crowd beautiful . The man who spends his days in weaving light and energy into the inner essence of every life about him , whether he does it with his hands or with his lips , or by holding up a light to it ( whit h men call art ) . fulfills the supreme office of history . ills work , whatever its art form or life form may be , is at once the spirit and the fibre of progress and the method of it . Acts of the legislature , park grants , and eight-hour laws are but symptoms that the method is working , that men are seeing and living in one another 's lives . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it are deceived by appearances . They can not understand one another 's lives as they would like to live them . So they do not let one another live them . The only men in the crowd who can be said to be doing any real living in it ( so far as they go ) are those whose lives are so small that the crowd can comprehend them , or so convenient that the crowd can use them without needing to comprehend them . Inasmuch as the majority even of the commonest people are hard to comprehend , the more people there are in a crowd , the fewer people there are living in it . It is this not being able to live which the average man calls life . He calls it life with a sad shake of the head ; but the shake of the head is as far as he gets with it . Reduced to its last analysis , this not being able to live , called life , consists in being afraid to live . Being afraid to live , the man in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not so hard as living . The few men he knows in the crowd who really are living ? who are living their own lives in it ? are paying , so far as he has observed , a great deal more for their lives than their lives are worth . The crowd cuts itself off from them . As long as the crowd Is deceived by appearances , persecutes men for living , and hollers men for looking as if they were living , it can not be free , and therefore it can not be beautiful . So it comes to pass that the solution of the crowd civilization is not going to be a mere great-man solution , ? a museum of heroes en pedestals , as Carlyle would have it ; nor is it going to be an endless row of pleasant and proper persons , as the average church would have it ; nor is it going to be infinite soup kitchens , parks with benches and fountains in them , and acts of the legislature , as philanthropists would have it ; nor is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge , happy world windlass , hauling all men up to a prairie heaven of bliss , in a kind of colossal clattering belt of buckets , as the socialist would have it . The solution of the crowd civilization is going to be the man who shall have it in him to be a crowdin-spirit . The man who is the crowd spirit , when the crowd finds out that he is its spirit , shall be the crowd 's hero ; and being the crowd 's hero , like all heroes he shall draw it together . The character of Christ is not merely the greatest spectacle in history . It is the greatest energy in history because it is the greatest spectacle . History is made by seeing things so . clearly that they can not help being clone ; by conceiving a great human life so clearly that it has to be lived . When the spectacle of a human life with all men 's lives in it is before the world , all lives draw together in it , ? great ones and little ones , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun . The man who understands everybody brings all men together . Their understanding him and wanting to understand him brings them together . They can not understand him ? all of him ? except they are together . " I , if I be lifted up , will draw all men unto me , " was not the assertion of a heroic egoism . It was the assertion of a world process , ? the one process by which a world can be lifted , and by which every man can help in lifting it . The more religion and economics , literature and art , are looked in the face , the more we see that the difficulties in all of them are due to small individuals in all of them , men who separate . No solution is , or has been , or can be lasting , in any one of them , except through producing comprehensive individuals , ? men who bring together . It is the law of democracy that little men , being born in the world , must be served in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall be served by great ones . When we have enough small democracies , enough great men who are democracies all by themselves , there will be a great democracy . Human society , swinging its thousands of years from ballot box to dynasty , and from dynasty to ballot box again , faces the true secret of government , namely , that the typo of the ideal democrat is the true king , the man who represents everybody . In his own life he shall prove that the crowd can be beautiful , and the crowd shall look in his face and know that it can be beautiful . By looking in his face it shall become beautiful . This civilization is a crowd civilization . The only beauty of art or life that such a civilization can produce must be produced by making the crowd beautiful . The crowd can only be made beautiful by the great man in it . A man can only be great in it by being a two-world man , an artist . He can only be a great artist by possessing and expressing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ novelist , making the crowd beautiful by being a crowd in himself . In its last analysis , the solution of the crowd is the most practical man in it ; that is , the diviner , the interpreter of persons . He sees so much that he makes no all see . He is the lifter of the horizons in which we live our lives . He is the man whose seeing is so deep a seeing that it is a kind of colossal doing , ? who goes about amongst us , world-making with his eyes . He gazes on each of us through the world 's heart . He is the eye of a thousand years . It takes a thousand years for the world to make him ; and when he is made , he makes the world for a thousand years . Men shall be born , troops of generations of them , and go through their days and die . that the visions of a man like this may he lived upon the platform of the earth . History is the long slow pantomime acted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now in joy ? of the dreams of a man like this . We can not escape him . He is univer. sal . Only by being out of the universe can we escape him . The stars are his footlights . We are born in the cast of his dreams . He is the playwright over us all . He shall master the crowd and make it beautiful by glorying in all of its lives . His soul shall go up and down in it , crying : " What a miracle is Man , that I should call him Brother , that I should commune with his spirit ! The globe is his gate . The sea is flashed through with his thought . He warms himself with the hearts of mountains , and his hand is upon the poles of the earth ? four thousand headlights boring the night for him , the trail of their glimmering trains ? hands of his bands , feet of his feet ? flying and plying fate for him ; while he lies in his bed and sleeps , dreams that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a thousand hills . Four thousand ships with their flocks of smoke , shut in with space by ( lay , spirits of light by night , signal his soul on the roofs of skies beneath the boundaries of the earth . " When a man like this ? the Maker of the Crowd-Beautiful ? shall come to us , there will be No One to take him away . He shall haunt all life . To stand in the hurrying great highway shall be to be crowded and jostled by him . The ceaseless pouring of The Face of the Street ? the long , hot , hissing wave of it ? on our souls , its awful current of pais and joy , shall be as the sweep of his heart upon us , flowing over us , on with us . . . . Whatever his singing may be , whether he prints it , or paints it , or builds it , the rhythm of the pave ! Incas shall be in it , and the footfall of the crowd . His soul shall be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street , as in some vast transcendent shell on the shore of the Day and the Night , we shall hear the songs of ages and nations , and of Death and Life , and , across spaces we can not go and years that are not , the low , far singing of God .
