The principles of physical geology come first ; the several chapters are arranged in what is believed to be a natural order , appropriate to the greatest part of our country , so that from a simple beginning a logical sequence of topics leads through the whole subject . The historical view of the science comes second , with many specific illustrations of the physical processes previously studied , but now set forth as part of the story of the earth , with its many changes of aspect and its succession of inhabitants . Special attention is here given to North America , and care is taken to avoid overloading with details. @# With respect to method of presentation , it must not be forgotten that the text-book is only one factor in good teaching , and that in geology , as in other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local field are other factors , each of which should play an appropriate part . The text suggests observational methods , but it can not replace observation in field or laboratory ; it offers certain exercises , but space can not be taken to make it a laboratory manual as well as a book for study ; it explains many problems , but its statements are necessarily more terse than the illustrative descriptions that a good and experienced teacher should supply . Frequent use is made of induction and inference in order that the student may come to see how reasonable a science is geology , and that he may avoid the too common error of thinking that the opinions of " authorities " are reached by a private road that is closed to him . The further extension of this method of presentation is urged upon the teacher , so that the young geologist may always learn the evidence that leads to a conclusion , and not only the conclusion itself. @# W.

It learns from their composition and structure how the rocks were made and how they have been modified . It ascertains how they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their various topographic forms , such as hills and valleys , plains and mountains . It studies the vestiges which the rocks preserve of ancient organisms which once inhabited our planet . Geology is the history of the earth and its inhabitants , as read in the rocks of the earth ' s crust. @# To obtain a general idea of the nature and method of our science before beginning its study in detail , we may visit some valley , such as that illustrated in the frontispiece , on whose sides are rocky ledges . Here the rocks lie in horizontal layers . Although only their edges are exposed , we may infer that these layers run into the upland on either side and underlie the entire district ; they are part of the foundation of solid rock which everywhere is found beneath the loose materials of the surface. @# The ledges of the valley of our illustration are of sandstone . Looking closely at the rock we see that it is composed of myriads of grains of sand cemented together . These grains have been worn and rounded . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about of a size . By some means they have been brought hither from some more ancient source . Surely these grains have had a history before they here found a resting place ,  --  a history which we are to learn to read. @# The successive layers of the rock suggest that they were built one after another from the bottom upward . We may be as sure that each layer was formed before those above it as that the bottom courses of stone in a wall were laid before the courses which rest upon them. @# We have no reason to believe that the lowest layers which we see here were the earliest ever formed . Indeed , some deep boring in the vicinity may prove that the ledges rest upon other layers of rock which extend downward for many hundreds of feet below the valley floor . Nor may we conclude that the highest layers here were the latest ever laid ; for elsewhere we may find still later layers lying upon them. @# A short search may find in the rock relics of animals , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deposited ; and as these are of kinds whose nearest living relatives now have their home in the sea , we infer that it was on the flat sea floor that the sandstone was laid . Its present position hundreds of feet above sea level proves that it has since emerged to form part of the land ; while the flatness of the beds shows that the movement was so uniform and gentle as not to break or strongly bend them from their original attitude. @# The surface of some of these layers is ripple-marked . Hence the sand must once have been as loose as that of shallow sea bottoms and sea beaches to-day , which is thrown into similar ripples by movements of the water . In some way the grains have since become cemented into firm rock. @# Note that the layers on one side of the valley agree with those on the other , each matching the one opposite at the same level . Once they were continuous across the valley . Where the valley now is was once a continuous upland built of horizontal layers ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the valley sides because they have been cut by the valley trench. @# The rock of the ledges is crumbling away . At the foot of each step of rock lie fragments which have fallen . Thus the valley is slowly widening . It has been narrower in the past ; it will be wider in the future. @# Through the valley runs a stream . The waters of rains which have fallen on the upper parts of the stream ' s basin are now on their way to the river and the sea . Rock fragments and grains of sand creeping down the valley slopes come within reach of the stream and are washed along by the running water . Here and there they lodge for a time in banks of sand and gravel , but sooner or later they are taken up again and carried on . The grains of sand which were brought from some ancient source to form these rocks are on their way to some new goal . As they are washed along the rocky bed of the stream they slowly rasp and wear it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it has been less deep in the past. @# In this little valley we see slow changes now in progress . We find also in the composition , the structure , and the attitude of the rocks , and the land forms to which they have been sculptured , the record of a long succession of past changes involving the origin of sand grains and their gathering and deposit upon the bottom of some ancient sea , the cementation of their layers into solid rock , the uplift of the rocks to form a land surface , and , last of all , the carving of a valley in the upland . Everywhere , in the fields , along the river , among the mountains , by the seashore , and in the desert , we may discover slow changes now in progress and the record of similar changes in the past . Everywhere we may catch glimpses of a process of gradual change , which stretches backward into the past and forward into the future , by which the forms and structures of the face of the earth are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with this long process is geology . Geology treats of the natural changes now taking place upon the earth and within it , the agencies which produce them , and the land forms and rock structures which result . It studies the changes of the present in order to be able to read the history of the earth ' s changes in the past. @# The various agencies which have fashioned the face of the earth may. be divided into two general classes . In Part I we shall consider those which work upon the earth from without , such as the weather , running water , glaciers , the wind , and the sea . In Part II we shall treat of those agencies whose sources are within the earth , and among whose manifestations are volcanoes and earthquakes and the various movements of the earth ' s crust . As we study each agency we shall notice not only how it does its work , but also the records which it leaves in the rock structures and the land forms which it produces . With this preparation we shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the rocks the history of our planet and the successive forms of life which have dwelt upon it. @# @# @# PART I @# EXTERNAL GEOLOGICAL AGENCIES @# CHAPTER I @# THE WORK OF THE WEATHER @# In our excursion to the valley with sandstone ledges we witnessed a process which is going forward in all lands . Everywhere the rocks are crumbling away ; their fragments are creeping down hillsides to the stream ways and are carried by the streams to the sea , where they are rebuilt into rocky layers . When again the rocks are lifted to form land the process will begin anew ; again they will crumble and creep down slopes and be washed by streams to the sea . Let us begin our study of this long cycle of change at the point where rocks disintegrate and decay under the action of the weather . In studying now a few outcrops and quarries we shall learn a little of some common rocks and how they weather away. @# STRATIFICATION AND JOINTING . At the sandstone ledges we saw that the rock was divided into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the thin leaves into which each stratum may sometimes be split are termed LAMINAE . To a greater or less degree these layers differ from each other in fineness of grain , showing that the material has been sorted . The planes which divide them are called BEDDING PLANES. @# Besides the bedding planes there are other division planes , which cut across the strata from top to bottom . These are found in all rocks and are known as joints . Two sets of joints , running at about right angles to each other , together with the bedding planes , divide the sandstone into quadrangular blocks. @# SANDSTONE . Examining a piece of sandstone we find it composed of grains quite like those of river sand or of sea beaches . Most of the grains are of a clear glassy mineral called quartz . These quartz grains are very hard and will scratch the steel of a knife blade . They are not affected by acid , and their broken surfaces are irregular like those of broken glass. @# The grains of sandstone are held together by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soluble carbonate of lime . In brown sandstones the cement is commonly ferruginous ,  --  hydrated iron oxide , or iron rust , forming the bond , somewhat as in the case of iron nails which have rusted together . The strongest and most lasting cement is siliceous , and sand rocks whose grains are closely cemented by silica , the chemical substance of which quartz is made , are known as quartzites. @# We are now prepared to understand how sandstone is affected by the action of the weather . On ledges where the rock is exposed to view its surface is more or less discolored and the grains are loose and may be rubbed off with the finger . On gentle slopes the rock is covered with a soil composed of sand , which evidently is crumbled sandstone , and dark carbonaceous matter derived from the decay of vegetation . Clearly it is by the dissolving of the cement that the rock thus breaks down to loose sand . A piece of sandstone with calcareous cement , or a bit of old mortar , which is really an artificial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be treated in a test tube with hydrochloric acid to illustrate the process. @# A LIMESTONE QUARRY . Here also we find the rock stratified and jointed ( Fig. 2 ) . On the quarry face the rock is distinctly seen to be altered for some distance from its upper surface . Below the altered zone the rock is sound and is quarried for building ; but the altered upper layers are too soft and broken to be used for this purpose . If the limestone is laminated , the laminae here have split apart , although below they hold fast together . Near the surface the stone has become rotten and crumbles at the touch , while on the top it has completely broken down to a thin layer of limestone meal , on which rests a fine reddish clay. @# Limestone is made of minute grains of carbonate of lime all firmly held together by a calcareous cement . A piece of the stone placed in a test tube with hydrochloric acid dissolves with brisk effervescence , leaving the insoluble impurities , which were disseminated through it , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We can now understand the changes in the upper layers of the quarry . At the surface of the rock the limestone has completely dissolved , leaving the insoluble residue as a layer of reddish clay . Immediately below the clay the rock has disintegrated into meal where the cement between the limestone grains has been removed , while beneath this the laminae are split apart where the cement has been dissolved only along the planes of lamination where the stone is more porous . As these changes in the rock are greatest at the surface and diminish downward , we infer that they have been caused by agents working downward from the surface. @# At certain points these agencies have been more effective than elsewhere . The upper rock surface is pitted . Joints are widened as they approach the surface , and along these seams we may find that the rock is altered even down to the quarry floor. @# A SHALE PIT . Let us now visit some pit where shale  --  a laminated and somewhat hardened clay  --  is quarried for the manufacture of brick . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cardboard in places , and close joints may break the rock into small rhombic blocks . On the upper surface we note that the shale has weathered to a clayey soil in which all traces of structure have been destroyed . The clay and the upper layers of the shale beneath it are reddish or yellow , while in many cases the color of the unaltered rock beneath is blue. @# THE SEDIMENTARY ROCKS . The three kinds of layered rocks whose acquaintance we have made  --  sandstone , limestone , and shale  --  are the leading types of the great group of stratified , or sedimentary , rocks . This group includes all rocks made of sediments , their materials having settled either in water upon the bottoms of rivers , lakes , or seas , or on dry land , as in the case of deposits made by the wind and by glaciers . Sedimentary rocks are divided into the fragmental rocks  --  which are made of fragments , either coarse or fine  --  and the far less common rocks which are constituted of chemical precipitates. @# The sedimentary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classes : @# 1 . The arenaceous , or quartz rocks , including beds of loose sand and gravel , sandstone , quartzite , and conglomerate ( a rock made of cemented rounded gravel or pebbles ) . @# 2 . The calcareous , or lime rocks , including limestone and a soft white rock formed of calcareous powder known as chalk. @# 3 . The argillaceous , or clay rocks , including muds , clays , and shales . These three classes pass by mixture into one another . Thus there are limy and clayey sandstones , sandy and clayey limestones , and sandy and limy shales. @# GRANITE . This familiar rock may be studied as an example of the second great group of rocks ,  --  the unstratified , or igneous rocks . These are not made of cemented sedimentary grains , but of interlocking crystals which have crystallized from a molten mass . Examining a piece of granite , the most conspicuous crystals which meet the eye are those of feldspar . They are commonly pink , white , or yellow , and break along smooth cleavage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mica may be recognized by its glittering plates , which split into thin elastic scales . A third mineral , harder than steel , breaking along irregular surfaces like broken glass , we identify as quartz. @# How granite alters under the action of the weather may be seen in outcrops where it forms the bed rock , or country rock , underlying the loose formations of the surface , and in many parts of the northern states where granite bowlders and pebbles more or less decayed may be found in a surface sheet of stony clay called the drift . Of the different minerals composing granite , quartz alone remains unaltered . Mica weathers to detached flakes which have lost their elasticity . The feldspar crystals have lost their luster and hardness , and even have decayed to clay . Where long- weathered granite forms the country rock , it often may be cut with spade or trowel for several feet from the surface , so rotten is the feldspar , and here the rock is seen to break down to a clayey soil containing grains of quartz and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the surface changes which some of the common kinds of rocks undergo . The agencies by which these changes are brought about we will now take up under two divisions ,  --  CHEMICAL AGENCIES producing rock decay and MECHANICAL AGENCIES producing rock disintegration. @# THE CHEMICAL WORK OF WATER @# As water falls on the earth in rain it has already absorbed from the air carbon dioxide ( carbonic acid gas ) and oxygen . As it sinks into the ground and becomes what is termed ground water , it takes into solution from the soil humus acids and carbon dioxide , both of which are constantly being generated there by the decay of organic matter . So both rain and ground water are charged with active chemical agents , by the help of which they corrode and rust and decompose all rocks to a greater or less degree . We notice now three of the chief chemical processes concerned in weathering ,  --  solution , the formation of carbonates , and oxidation. @# SOLUTION . Limestone , although so little affected by pure water that five thousand gallons would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dissolved in water charged with carbon dioxide . In limestone regions well water is therefore " hard . " On boiling the water for some time the carbon dioxide gas is expelled , the whole of the lime carbonate can no longer be held in solution , and much of it is thrown down to form a crust or " scale " in the kettle or in the tubes of the steam boiler . All waters which flow over limestone rocks or soak through them are constantly engaged in dissolving them away , and in the course of time destroy beds of vast extent and great thickness. @# The upper surface of limestone rocks becomes deeply pitted , as we saw in the limestone quarry , and where the mantle of waste has been removed it may be found so intricately furrowed that it is difficult to traverse. @# Beds of rock salt buried among the strata are dissolved by seeping water , which issues in salt springs . Gypsum , a mineral composed of hydrated sulphate of lime , and so soft that it may be scratched with the finger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the water of wells and springs a peculiar hardness difficult to remove. @# The dissolving action of moisture may be noted on marble tombstones of some age , marble being a limestone altered by heat and pressure and composed of crystalline grains . By assuming that the date on each monument marks the year of its erection , one may estimate how many years on the average it has taken for weathering to loosen fine grains on the polished surface , so that they may be rubbed off with the finger , to destroy the polish , to round the sharp edges of tool marks in the lettering , and at last to open cracks and seams and break down the stone . We may notice also whether the gravestones weather more rapidly on the sunny or the shady side , and on the sides or on the top. @# The weathered surface of granular limestone containing shells shows them standing in relief . As the shells are made of crystalline carbonate of lime , we may infer whether the carbonate of lime is less soluble in its granular or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In attacking minerals water does more than merely take them into solution . It decomposes them , forming new chemical compounds of which the carbonates are among the most important . Thus feldspar consists of the insoluble silicate of alumina , together with certain alkaline silicates which are broken up by the action of water containing carbon dioxide , forming alkaline carbonates . These carbonates are freely soluble and contribute potash and soda to soils and river waters . By the removal of the soluble ingredients of feldspar there is left the silicate of alumina , united with water or hydrated , in the condition of a fine plastic clay which , when white and pure , is known as KAOLIN and is used in the manufacture of porcelain . Feldspathic rocks which contain no iron compounds thus weather to whitish crusts , and even apparently sound crystals of feldspar , when ground to thin slices and placed under the microscope , may be seen to be milky in color throughout because an internal change to kaolin has begun. @# OXIDATION . Rocks containing compounds of iron weather to reddish crusts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with rusty films . Oxygen and water have here united with the iron , forming hydrated iron oxide . The effects of oxidation may be seen in the alteration of many kinds of rocks and in red and yellow colors of soils and subsoils. @# Pyrite is a very hard mineral of a pale brass color , found in scattered crystals in many rocks , and is composed of iron and sulphur ( iron sulphide ) . Under the attack of the weather it takes up oxygen , forming iron sulphate ( green vitriol ) , a soluble compound , and insoluble hydrated iron oxide , which as a mineral is known as limonite . Several large masses of iron sulphide were placed some years ago on the lawn in front of the National Museum at Washington . The mineral changed so rapidly to green vitriol that enough of this poisonous compound was washed into the ground to kill the roots of the surrounding grass. @# AGENTS OF MECHANICAL DISINTEGRATION @# HEAT AND COLD . Rocks exposed to the direct rays of the sun become strongly heated by day and expand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the difference in temperature between day and night is considerable , the repeated strains of sudden expansion and contraction at last become greater than the rocks can bear , and they break , for the same reason that a glass cracks when plunged into boiling water ( Fig. 5 ) . @# Rocks are poor conductors of heat , and hence their surfaces may become painfully hot under the full blaze of the sun , while the interior remains comparatively cool . By day the surface shell expands and tends to break loose from the mass of the stone . In cooling in the evening the surface shell suddenly contracts on the unyielding interior and in time is forced off in scales. @# Many rocks , such as granite , are made up of grains of various minerals which differ in color and in their capacity to absorb heat , and which therefore contract and expand in different ratios . In heating and cooling these grains crowd against their neighbors and tear loose from them , so that finally the rock disintegrates into sand. @# The conditions for the destructive action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regions when vegetation is wanting for lack of sufficient rain . The soil not being held together by the roots of plants is blown away over large areas , leaving the rocks bare to the blazing sun in a cloudless sky . The air is dry , and the heat received by the earth by day is therefore rapidly radiated at night into space . There is a sharp and sudden fall of temperature after sunset , and the rocks , strongly heated by day , are now chilled perhaps even to the freezing point. @# In the Sahara the thermometer has been known to fall 131 degrees F. within a few hours . In the light air of the Pamir plateau in central Asia a rise of 90 degrees F. has been recorded from seven o ' clock in the morning to one o ' clock in the afternoon . On the mountains of southwestern Texas there are frequently heard crackling noises as the rocks of that arid region throw off scales from a fraction of an inch to four inches in thickness , and loud reports are made as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exposure to heat and cold have been shivered to fine sharp-pointed fragments on being placed in sand heated to 180 degrees F. Beds half a foot thick , forming the floor of limestone quarries in Wisconsin , have been known to buckle and arch and break to fragments under the heat of the summer sun. @# FROST . By this term is meant the freezing and thawing of water contained in the pores and crevices of rocks . All rocks are more or less porous and all contain more or less water in their pores . Workers in stone call this " quarry water , " and speak of a stone as " green " before the quarry water has dried out . Water also seeps along joints and bedding planes and gathers in all seams and crevices . Water expands in freezing , ten cubic inches of water freezing to about eleven cubic inches of ice . As water freezes in the rifts and pores of rocks it expands with the irresistible force illustrated in the freezing and breaking of water pipes in winter . The first rift in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widened little by little by the wedges of successive frosts , and finally the rock is broken into detached blocks , and these into angular chip-stone by the same process. @# It is on mountain tops and in high latitudes that the effects of frost are most plainly seen . " Every summit " says Whymper , " amongst the rock summits upon which I have stood has been nothing but a piled-up heap of fragments " ( Fig. 7 ) . In Iceland , in Spitsbergen , in Kamchatka , and in other frigid lands large areas are thickly strewn with sharp-edged fragments into which the rock has been shattered by frost. @# ORGANIC AGENTS @# We must reckon the roots of plants and trees among the agents which break rocks into pieces . The tiny rootlet in its search for food and moisture inserts itself into some minute rift , and as it grows slowly wedges the rock apart . Moreover , the acids of the root corrode the rocks with which they are in contact . One may sometimes find in the soil a block of limestone wrapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a little furrow where it has eaten into the stone. @# Rootless plants called lichens often cover and corrode rocks as yet bare of soil ; but where lichens are destroying the rock less rapidly than does the weather , they serve in a way as a protection. @# CONDITIONS FAVORING DISINTEGRATION AND DECAY . The disintegration of rocks under frost and temperature changes goes on most rapidly in cold and arid climates , and where vegetation is scant or absent . On the contrary , the decay of rocks under the chemical action of water is favored by a warm , moist climate and abundant vegetation . Frost and heat and cold can only act within the few feet from the surface to which the necessary temperature changes are limited , while water penetrates and alters the rocks to great depths. @# The pupil may explain. @# In what ways the presence of joints and bedding planes assists in the breaking up and decay of rocks under the action of the weather. @# Why it is a good rule of stone masons never to lay stones on edge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fresh from the quarry sometimes go to pieces in early winter , when stones which have been quarried for some months remain uninjured. @# Why quarrymen in the northern states often keep their quarry floors flooded during winter. @# Why laminated limestone should not be used for curbstone. @# Why rocks composed of layers differing in fineness of grain and in ratios of expansion do not make good building stone. @# Fine-grained rocks with pores so small that capillary attraction keeps the water which they contain from readily draining away are more apt to hold their pores ten elevenths full of water than are rocks whose pores are larger . Which , therefore , are more likely to be injured by frost ? @# Which is subject to greater temperature changes , a dark rock or one of a light color ? the north side or the south side of a valley ? @# THE MANTLE OF ROCK WASTE @# We have seen that rocks are everywhere slowly wasting away . They are broken in pieces by frost , by tree roots , and by heat and cold . They dissolve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various corrosive substances which it contains , leaving their insoluble residues as residual clays and sands upon the surface . As a result there is everywhere forming a mantle of rock waste which covers the land . It is well to imagine how the country would appear were this mantle with its soil and vegetation all scraped away or had it never been formed . The surface of the land would then be everywhere of bare rock as unbroken as a quarry floor. @# THE THICKNESS OF THE MANTLE . In any locality the thickness of the mantle of rock waste depends as much on the rate at which it is constantly being removed as on the rate at which it is forming . On the face of cliffs it is absent , for here waste is removed as fast as it is made . Where waste is carried away more slowly than it is produced , it accumulates in time to great depth. @# The granite of Pikes Peak is disintegrated to a depth of twenty feet . In the city of Washington granite rock is so softened to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pick and shovel . About Atlanta , Georgia , the rocks are completely rotted for one hundred feet from the surface , while the beginnings of decay may be noticed at thrice that depth . In places in southern Brazil the rock is decomposed to a depth of four hundred feet. @# In southwestern Wisconsin a reddish residual clay has an average depth of thirteen feet on broad uplands , where it has been removed to the least extent . The country rock on which it rests is a limestone with about ten per cent of insoluble impurities . At least how thick , then , was that portion of the limestone which has rotted down to the clay ? @# DISTINGUISHING CHARACTERISTICS OF RESIDUAL WASTE . We must learn to distinguish waste formed in place by the action of the weather from the products of other geological agencies . Residual waste is unstratified . It contains no substances which have not been derived from the weathering of the parent rock . There is a gradual transition from residual waste into the unweathered rock beneath . Waste resting on sound rock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @# In certain regions of southern Missouri the land is covered with a layer of broken flints and red clay , while the country rock is limestone . The limestone contains nodules of flint , and we may infer that it has been by the decay and removal of thick masses of limestone that the residual layer of clay and flints has been left upon the surface . Flint is a form of quartz , dull-lustered , usually gray or blackish in color , and opaque except on thinnest edges , where it is translucent. @# Over much of the northern states there is spread an unstratified stony clay called the drift . It often rests on sound rocks . It contains grains of sand , pebbles , and bowlders composed of many different minerals and rocks that the country rock can not furnish . Hence the drift can not have been formed by the decay of the rock of the region . A shale or limestone , for example , can not waste to a clay containing granite pebbles . The origin of the drift will be explained in subsequent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their soluble than to their insoluble constituents . The latter are few in number and are much the same in rocks of widely different nature , being chiefly quartz , silicate of alumina , and iron oxide . By the removal of their soluble parts very many and widely different rocks rot down to a residual clay gritty with particles of quartz and colored red or yellow with iron oxide. @# In a broad way the changes which rocks undergo in weathering are an adaptation to the environment in which they find themselves at the earth ' s surface ,  --  an environment different from that in which they were formed under sea or under ground . In open air , where they are attacked by various destructive agents , few of the rock- making minerals are stable compounds except quartz , the iron oxides , and the silicate of alumina ; and so it is to one or more of these comparatively insoluble substances that most rocks are reduced by long decay. @# Which produces a mantle of finer waste , frost or chemical decay ? which a thicker mantle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of waste would differ in warm humid lands like India , in frozen countries like Alaska , and in deserts such as the Sahara ? @# THE SOIL . The same agencies which produce the mantle of waste are continually at work upon it , breaking it up into finer and finer particles and causing its more complete decay . Thus on the surface , where the waste has weathered longest , it is gradually made fine enough to support the growth of plants , and is then known as soil . The coarser waste beneath is sometimes spoken of as subsoil . Soil usually contains more or less dark , carbonaceous , decaying organic matter , called humus , and is then often termed the humus layer . Soil forms not only on waste produced in place from the rock beneath , but also on materials which have been transported , such as sheets of glacial drift and river deposits . Until rocks are reduced to residual clays the work of the weather is more rapid and effective on the fragments of the mantle of waste than on the rocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Any fresh excavation of cellar or cistern , or cut for road or railway , will show the characteristics of the humus layer . It may form only a gray film on the surface , or we may find it a layer a foot or more thick , dark , or even black , above , and growing gradually lighter in color as it passes by insensible gradations into the subsoil . In some way the decaying vegetable matter continually forming on the surface has become mingled with the material beneath it. @# HOW HUMUS AND THE SUBSOIL ARE MINGLED . The mingling of humus and the subsoil is brought about by several means . The roots of plants penetrate the waste , and when they die leave their decaying substance to fertilize it . Leaves and stems falling on the surface are turned under by several agents . Earthworms and other animals whose home is in the waste drag them into their burrows either for food or to line their nests . Trees overthrown by the wind , roots and all , turn over the soil and subsoil and mingle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contribute to its enrichment . The animals living in the mantle do much in other ways toward the making of soil . They bring the coarser fragments from beneath to the surface , where the waste weathers more rapidly . Their burrows allow air and water to penetrate the waste more freely and to affect it to greater depths. @# ANTS . In the tropics the mantle of waste is worked over chiefly by ants . They excavate underground galleries and chambers , extending sometimes as much as fourteen feet below the surface , and build mounds which may reach as high above it . In some parts of Paraguay and southern Brazil these mounds , like gigantic potato hills , cover tracts of considerable area. @# In search for its food  --  the dead wood of trees  --  the so-called white ant constructs runways of earth about the size of gas pipes , reaching from the base of the tree to the topmost branches . On the plateaus of central Africa explorers have walked for miles through forests every tree of which was plastered with these galleries of mud . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cemented by slime as it is laid in place by the ant , and is thus acted on by organic chemical agents . Sooner or later these galleries are beaten down by heavy rains , and their fertilizing substances are scattered widely by the winds. @# EARTHWORMS . In temperate regions the waste is worked over largely by earthworms . In making their burrows worms swallow earth in order to extract from it any nutritive organic matter which it may contain . They treat it with their digestive acids , grind it in their stony gizzards , and void it in castings on the surface of the ground . It was estimated by Darwin that in many parts of England each year , on every acre , more than ten tons of earth pass through the bodies of earthworms and are brought to the surface , and that every few years the entire soil layer is thus worked over by them. @# In all these ways the waste is made fine and stirred and enriched . Grain by grain the subsoil with its fresh mineral ingredients is brought to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animals have taken from the atmosphere is plowed under . Thus Nature plows and harrows on " the great world ' s farm " to make ready and ever to renew a soil fit for the endless succession of her crops. @# The world processes by which rocks are continually wasting away are thus indispensable to the life of plants and animals . The organic world is built on the ruins of the inorganic , and because the solid rocks have been broken down into soil men are able to live upon the earth. @# SOLAR ENERGY . The source of the energy which accomplishes all this necessary work is the sun . It is the radiant energy of the sun which causes the disintegration of rocks , which lifts vapor into the atmosphere to fall as rain , which gives life to plants and animals . Considering the earth in a broad way , we may view it as a globe of solid rock ,  --  the lithosphere ,  --  surrounded by two mobile envelopes : the envelope of air ,  --  THE ATMOSPHERE , and the envelope of water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy these envelopes are in constant motion . Water from the hydrosphere is continually rising in vapor into the atmosphere , the air of the atmosphere penetrates the hydrosphere ,  --  for its gases are dissolved in all waters ,  --  and both air and water enter and work upon the solid earth . By their action upon the lithosphere they have produced a third envelope ,  --  the mantle of rock waste. @# This envelope also is in movement , not indeed as a whole , but particle by particle . The causes which set its particles in motion , and the different forms which the mantle comes to assume , we will now proceed to study. @# MOVEMENTS OF THE MANTLE OF ROCK WASTE @# At the sandstone ledges which we first visited we saw not only that the rocks were crumbling away , but also that grains and fragments of them were creeping down the slopes of the valley to the stream and were carried by it onward toward the sea . This process is going on everywhere . Slowly it may be , and with many interruptions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downward to the sea . We may divide its course into two parts ,  --  the path to the stream , which we will now consider , and its carriage onward by the stream , which we will defer to a later chapter. @# GRAVITY . The chief agent concerned in the movement of waste is gravity . Each particle of waste feels the unceasing downward pull of the earth ' s mass and follows it when free to do so . All agencies which produce waste tend to set its particles free and in motion , and therefore cooperate with gravity . On cliffs , rocks fall when wedged off by frost or by roots of trees , and when detached by any other agency . On slopes of waste , water freezes in chinks between stones , and in pores between particles of soil , and wedges them apart . Animals and plants stir the waste , heat expands it , cold contracts it , the strokes of the raindrops drive loose particles down the slope and the wind lifts and lets them fall . Of all these movements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are uphill . On the whole , therefore , the downhill movements prevail , and the mantle of waste , block by block and grain by grain , creeps along the downhill path. @# A slab of sandstone laid on another of the same kind at an angle of 17 degrees and left in the open air was found to creep down the slope at the rate of a little more than a millimeter a month . Explain why it did so. @# RAIN . The most efficient agent in the carriage of waste to the streams is the rain . It moves particles of soil by the force of the blows of the falling drops , and washes them down all slopes to within reach of permanent streams . On surfaces unprotected by vegetation , as on plowed fields and in arid regions , the rain wears furrows and gullies both in the mantle of waste and in exposures of unaltered rock ( Fig. 17 ) . @# At the foot of a hill we may find that the soil has accumulated by creep and wash to the depth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the soil may be exceedingly thin , or quite absent , because removed about as fast as formed . Against the walls of an abbey built on a slope in Wales seven hundred years ago , the creeping waste has gathered on the uphill side to a depth of seven feet . The slow-flowing sheet of waste is often dammed by fences and walls , whose uphill side gathers waste in a few years so as to show a distinctly higher surface than the downhill side , especially in plowed fields where the movement is least checked by vegetation. @# TALUS . At the foot of cliffs there is usually to be found a slope of rock fragments which clearly have fallen from above . Such a heap of waste is known as talus . The amount of talus in any place depends both on the rate of its formation and the rate of its removal . Talus forms rapidly in climates where mechanical disintegration is most effective , where rocks are readily broken into blocks because closely jointed and thinly bedded rather than massive , and where they are firm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of in fine grains . Talus is removed slowly where it decays slowly , either because of the climate or the resistance of the rock . It may be rapidly removed by a stream flowing along its base. @# In a moist climate a soluble rock , such as massive limestone , may form talus little if any faster than the talus weathers away . A loose-textured sandstone breaks down into incoherent sand grains , which in dry climates , where unprotected by vegetation , may be blown away as fast as they fall , leaving the cliff bare to the base . Cliffs of such slow-decaying rocks as quartzite and granite when closely jointed accumulate talus in large amounts. @# Talus slopes may be so steep as to reach THE ANGLE OF REPOSE , i. e. the steepest angle at which the material will lie . This angle varies with different materials , being greater with coarse and angular fragments than with fine rounded grains . Sooner or later a talus reaches that equilibrium where the amount removed from its surface just equals that supplied from the cliff above . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retreats together with the retreat of the cliff , as seen in Figure 9. @# GRADED SLOPES . Where rocks weather faster than their waste is carried away , the waste comes at last to cover all rocky ledges . On the steeper slopes it is coarser and in more rapid movement than on slopes more gentle , but mountain sides and hills and plains alike come to be mantled with sheets of waste which everywhere is creeping toward the streams . Such unbroken slopes , worn or built to the least inclination at which the waste supplied by weathering can be urged onward , are known as GRADED SLOPES. @# Of far less importance than the silent , gradual creep of waste , which is going on at all times everywhere about us , are the startling local and spasmodic movements which we are now to describe. @# AVALANCHES . On steep mountain sides the accumulated snows of winter often slip and slide in avalanches to the valleys below . These rushing torrents of snow sweep their tracks clean of waste and are one of Nature ' s normal methods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another common and abrupt method of delivering waste to streams is by slips of the waste mantle in large masses . After long rains and after winter frosts the cohesion between the waste and the sound rock beneath is loosened by seeping water underground . The waste slips on the rock surface thus lubricated and plunges down the mountain side in a swift roaring torrent of mud and stones. @# We may conveniently mention here a second type of landslide , where masses of solid rock as well as the mantle of waste are involved in the sudden movement . Such slips occur when valleys have been rapidly deepened by streams or glaciers and their sides have not yet been graded . A favorable condition is where the strata dip ( i. e. incline downwards ) towards the valley ( Fig. 11 ) , or are broken by joint planes dipping in the same direction . The upper layers , including perhaps the entire mountain side , have been cut across by the valley trench and are left supported only on the inclined surface of the underlying rocks . Water may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the upper and the underlying strata by converting the upper surface of a shale to soft wet clay , by dissolving layers of a limestone , or by removing the cement of a sandstone and converting it into loose sand . When the inclined surface is thus lubricated the overlying masses may be launched into the valley below . The solid rocks are broken and crushed in sliding and converted into waste consisting , like that of talus , of angular unsorted fragments , blocks of all sizes being mingled pellmell with rock meal and dust . The principal effects of landslides may be gathered from the following examples. @# At Gohna , India , in 1893 , the face of a spur four thousand feet high , of the lower ranges of the Himalayas , slipped into the gorge of the headwaters of the Ganges River in successive rock falls which lasted for three days . Blocks of stone were projected for a mile , and clouds of limestone dust were spread over the surrounding country . The debris formed a dam one thousand feet high , extending for two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barrier , gradually rising until it overtopped it in a little less than a year . The upper portion of the dam then broke , and a terrific rush of water swept down the valley in a wave which , twenty miles away , rose one hundred and sixty feet in height . A narrow lake is still held by the strong base of the dam. @# In 1896 , after forty days of incessant rain , a cliff of sandstone slipped into the Yangtse River in China , reducing the width of the channel to eighty yards and causing formidable rapids. @# At Flims , in Switzerland , a prehistoric landslip flung a dam eighteen hundred feet high across the headwaters of the Rhine . If spread evenly over a surface of twenty-eight square miles , the material would cover it to a depth of six hundred and sixty feet . The barrier is not yet entirely cut away , and several lakes are held in shallow basins on its hummocky surface. @# A slide from the precipitous river front of the citadel hill of Quebec , in 1889 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and causing the death of forty-five persons . The strata here are composed of steeply dipping slate. @# In lofty mountain ranges there may not be a single valley without its traces of landslides , so common there is this method of the movement of waste , and of building to grade over-steepened slopes. @# ROCK SCULPTURE BY WEATHERING @# We are now to consider a few of the forms into which rock masses are carved by the weather. @# BOWLDERS OF WEATHERING . In many quarries and outcrops we may see that the blocks into which one or more of the uppermost layers have been broken along their joints and bedding planes are no longer angular , as are those of the layers below . The edges and corners of these blocks have been worn away by the weather . Such rounded cores , known as bowlders of weathering , are often left to strew the surface. @# DIFFERENTIAL WEATHERING . This term covers all cases in which a rock mass weathers differently in different portions . Any weaker spots or layers are etched out on the surface , leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pitted where the weather drills out the weaker portions . In these pits , when once they are formed , moisture gathers , a little soil collects , vegetation takes root , and thus they are further enlarged until the limestone may be deeply honeycombed. @# On the sides of canyons , and elsewhere where the edges of strata are exposed , the harder layers project as cliffs , while the softer weather back to slopes covered with the talus of the harder layers above them . It is convenient to call the former cliff makers and the latter slope makers. @# Differential weathering plays a large part in the sculpture of the land . Areas of weak rock are wasted to plains , while areas of hard rock adjacent are still left as hills and mountain ridges , as in the valleys and mountains of eastern Pennsylvania . But in such instances the lowering of the surface of the weaker rock is also due to the wear of streams , and especially to the removal by them from the land of the waste which covers and protects the rocks beneath. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some , such as beds of loose sand , are soft and easily worn by rains ; some , as limestone and gypsum for example , are soluble . Even hard insoluble rocks are weak under the attack of the weather when they are closely divided by joints and bedding planes and are thus readily broken up into blocks by mechanical agencies. @# OUTLIERS AND MONUMENTS . As cliffs retreat under the attack of the weather , portions are left behind where the rock is more resistant or where the attack for any reason is less severe . Such remnant masses , if large , are known as outliers . When @# Note the rain furrows on the slope at the foot of the monuments . In the foreground are seen fragments of petrified trunks of trees , composed of silica and extremely resistant to the weather . On the removal of the rock layers in which these fragments were imbedded they are left to strew the surface in the same way as are the residual flints of southern Missouri. flat-topped , because of the protection of a resistant horizontal capping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applied also to the flat-topped portions of dissected plateaus ( Fig. 129 ) . Retreating cliffs may fall back a number of miles behind their outliers before the latter are finally consumed. @# Monuments are smaller masses and may be but partially detached from the cliff face . In the breaking down of sheets of horizontal strata , outliers grow smaller and smaller and are reduced to massive rectangular monuments resembling castles ( Fig. 17 ) . The rock castle falls into ruin , leaving here and there an isolated tower ; the tower crumbles to a lonely pillar , soon to be overthrown . The various and often picturesque shapes of monuments depend on the kind of rock , the attitude of the strata , and the agent by which they are chiefly carved . Thus pillars may have a capital formed of a resistant stratum . Monuments may be undercut and come to rest on narrow pedestals , wherever they weather more rapidly near the ground , either because of the greater moisture there , or  --  in arid climates  --  because worn at their base by drifting sands. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which protect the softer material beneath from the vertical blows of raindrops , and thus come to stand on pedestals of some height . One may sometimes see on the ground beneath dripping eaves pebbles left in the same way , protecting tiny pedestals of sand. @# MOUNTAIN PEAKS AND RIDGES . Most mountains have been carved out of great broadly uplifted folds and blocks of the earth ' s crust . Running water and glacier ice have cut these folds and blocks into masses divided by deep valleys ; but it is by the weather , for the most part , that the masses thus separated have been sculptured to the present forms of the individual peaks and ridges. @# Frost and heat and cold sculpture high mountains to sharp , tusklike peaks and ragged , serrate crests , where their waste is readily removed. @# The Matterhorn of the Alps is a famous example of a mountain peak whose carving by the frost and other agents is in active progress . On its face " scarcely a rock anywhere is firmly attached , " and the fall of loosened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its base tell how huge rocks from time to time come leaping down its precipices , followed by trains of dislodged smaller fragments and rock dust ; and how at night one may trace the course of the bowlders by the sparks which they strike from the mountain walls . Mount Assiniboine , Canada ( Fig. 20 ) , resembles the Matterhorn in form and has been carved by the same agencies. @# " The Needles " of Arizona are examples of sharp mountain peaks in a warm arid region sculptured chiefly by temperature changes. @# Chemical decay , especially when carried on beneath a cover of waste and vegetation , favors the production of rounded knobs and dome-shaped mountains. @# THE WEATHER CURVE . We have seen that weathering reduces the angular block quarried by the frost to a rounded bowlder by chipping off its corners and smoothing away its edges . In much the same way weathering at last reduces to rounded hills the earth blocks cut by streams or formed in any other way . High mountains may at first be sculptured by the weather to savage peaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their life history they wear down to rounded hills ( Fig. 182 ) . The weather curve , which may be seen on the summits of low hills ( Fig. 21 ) , is convex upward. @# In Figure 22 , representing a cubic block of stone whose faces are a yard square , how many square feet of surface are exposed to the weather by a cubic foot at a corner a ; by one situated in the middle of an edge b ; by one in the center of a side c ? How much faster will a and b weather than c , and what will be the effect on the shape of the block ? @# THE COOPERATION OF VARIOUS AGENCIES IN ROCK SCULPTURE . For the sake of clearness it is necessary to describe the work of each geological agent separately . We must not forget , however , that in Nature no agent works independently and alone ; that every result is the outcome of a long chain of causes . Thus , in order that the mountain peak may be carved by the agents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  a work done by many agents , including some which we are yet to study ; and in order that the waste may be removed as fast as formed , the region must first have been raised well above the level of the sea , so that the agents of transportation could do their work effectively . The sculpture of the rocks is accomplished only by the cooperation of many forces. @# The constant removal of waste from the surface by creep and wash and carriage by streams is of the highest importance , because it allows the destruction of the land by means of weathering to go on as long as any land remains above sea level . If waste were not removed , it would grow to be so thick as to protect the rock beneath from further weathering , and the processes of destruction which we have studied would be brought to an end . The very presence of the mantle of waste over the land proves that on the whole rocks weather more rapidly than their waste is removed . The destruction of the land is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away. @# We have now learned to see in the mantle of waste the record of the destructive action of the agencies of weathering on the rocks of the land surface . Similar records we shall find buried deeply among the rocks of the crust in old soils and in rocks pitted and decayed , telling of old land surfaces long wasted by the weather . Ever since the dry land appeared these agencies have been as now quietly and unceasingly at work upon it , and have ever been the chief means of the destruction of its rocks . The vast bulk of the stratified rocks of the earth ' s crust is made up almost wholly of the waste thus worn from ancient lands. @# In studying the various geological agencies we must remember the almost inconceivable times in which they work . The slowest process when multiplied by the immense time in which it is carried on produces great results . The geologist looks upon the land forms of the earth ' s surface as monuments which record the slow action of weathering and other agents during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rounded hill , the wide plain which lies where hills and mountains once stood , tell clearly of the great results which slow processes will reach when given long time in which to do their work . We should accustom ourselves also to think of the results which weathering will sooner or later bring to pass . The tombstone and the bowlder of the field , which each year lose from their surfaces a few crystalline grains , must in time be wholly destroyed . The hill whose rocks are slowly rotting underneath a cover of waste must become lower and lower as the centuries and millenniums come and go , and will finally disappear . Even the mountains are crumbling away continually , and therefore are but fleeting features of the landscape. @# @# @# CHAPTER II @# THE WORK OF GROUND WATER @# LAND WATERS . We have seen how large is the part that water plays at and near the surface of the land in the processes of weathering and in the slow movement of waste down all slopes to the stream ways . We now take up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  --  a corrosive agent still , and carrying in solution as its load the invisible waste of rocks derived from their soluble parts. @# Land waters have their immediate source in the rainfall . By the heat of the sun water is evaporated from the reservoir of the ocean and from moist surfaces everywhere . Mingled as vapor with the air , it is carried by the winds over sea and land , and condensed it returns to the earth as rain or snow . That part of the rainfall which descends on the ocean does not concern us , but that which falls on the land accomplishes , as it returns to the sea , the most important work of all surface geological agencies. @# The rainfall may be divided into three parts : the first DRIES UP , being discharged into the air by evaporation either directly from the soil or through vegetation ; the second RUNS OFF over the surface to flood the streams ; the third SOAKS IN the ground and is henceforth known as GROUND or UNDERGROUND WATER. @# THE DESCENT OF GROUND WATER . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the pores and crevices of the underlying rock . All rocks of the upper crust of the earth are more or less porous , and all drink in water . IMPERVIOUS ROCKS , such as granite , clay , and shale , have pores so minute that the water which they take in is held fast within them by capillary attraction , and none drains through . PERVIOUS ROCKS , on the other hand , such as many sandstones , have pore spaces so large that water filters through them more or less freely . Besides its seepage through the pores of pervious rocks , water passes to lower levels through the joints and cracks by which all rocks , near the surface are broken. @# Even the closest-grained granite has a pore space of 1 in 400 , while sandstone may have a pore space of 1 in 4 . Sand is so porous that it may absorb a third of its volume of water , and a loose loam even as much as one half. @# THE GROUND-WATER SURFACE is the name given the upper surface of ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In dry seasons the ground-water surface sinks . For ground water is constantly seeping downward under gravity , it is evaporated in the waste and its moisture is carried upward by capillarity and the roots of plants to the surface to be evaporated in the air . In wet seasons these constant losses are more than made good by fresh supplies from that part of the rainfall which soaks into the ground , and the ground-water surface rises. @# In moist climates the ground-water surface ( Fig. 24 ) lies , as a rule , within a few feet of the land surface and conforms to it in a general way , although with slopes of less inclination than those of the hills and valleys . In dry climates permanent ground water may be found only at depths of hundreds of feet . Ground water is held at its height by the fact that its circulation is constantly impeded by capillarity and friction . If it were as free to drain away as are surface streams , it would sink soon after a rain to the level of the deepest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made in permeable rocks below the ground-water surface fill to its level and are known as wells . Where valleys cut this surface permanent streams are formed , the water either oozing forth along ill-defined areas or issuing at definite points called springs , where it is concentrated by the structure of the rocks . A level tract where the ground-water surface coincides with the surface of the ground is a swamp or marsh. @# By studying a spring one may learn much of the ways and work of ground water . Spring water differs from that of the stream into which it flows in several respects . If we test the spring with a thermometer during successive months , we shall find that its temperature remains much the same the year round . In summer it is markedly cooler than the stream ; in winter it is warmer and remains unfrozen while the latter perhaps is locked in ice . This means that its underground path must lie at such a distance from the surface that it is little affected by summer ' s heat and winter ' s cold. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ washed into it by rains , the spring remains clear ; its water has been filtered during its slow movement through many small underground passages and the pores of rocks . Commonly the spring differs from the stream in that it carries a far larger load of dissolved rock . Chemical analysis proves that streams contain various minerals in solution , but these are usually in quantities so small that they are not perceptible to the taste or feel . But the water of springs is often well charged with soluble minerals ; in its slow , long journey underground it has searched out the soluble parts of the rocks through which it seeps and has dissolved as much of them as it could . When spring water is boiled away , the invisible load which it has carried is left behind , and in composition is found to be practically identical with that of the soluble ingredients of the country rock . Although to some extent the soluble waste of rocks is washed down surface slopes by the rain , by far the larger part is carried downward by ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limestone regions springs are charged with calcium carbonate ( the carbonate of lime ) , and where the limestone is magnesian they contain magnesium carbonate also . Such waters are " hard " ; when used in washing , the minerals which they contain combine with the fatty acids of soap to form insoluble curdy compounds . When springs rise from rocks containing gypsum they are hard with calcium sulphate . In granite regions they contain more or less soda and potash from the decay of feldspar. @# The flow of springs varies much less during the different seasons of the year than does that of surface streams . So slow is the movement of ground water through the rocks that even during long droughts large amounts remain stored above the levels of surface drainage. @# MOVEMENTS OF GROUND WATER . Ground water is in constant movement toward its outlets . Its rate varies according to many conditions , but always is extremely slow . Even through loose sands beneath the beds of rivers it sometimes does not exceed a fifth of a mile a year. @# In any region two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OF FLOW extends from the ground-water surface downward through the waste mantle and any permeable rocks on which the mantle rests , as far as the first impermeable layer , where the descending movement of the water is stopped . The DEEP ZONES OF FLOW occupy any pervious rocks which may be found below the impervious layer which lies nearest to the surface . The upper zone is a vast sheet of water saturating the soil and rocks and slowly seeping downward through their pores and interstices along the slopes to the valleys , where in part it discharges in springs and often unites also in a wide underflowing stream which supports and feeds the river ( Fig. 24 ) . @# A city in a region of copious rains , built on the narrow flood plain of a river , overlooked by hills , depends for its water supply on driven wells , within the city limits , sunk in the sand a few yards from the edge of the stream . Are these wells fed by water from the river percolating through the sand , or by ground water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sewage of the town ? @# At what height does underground water stand in the wells of your region ? Does it vary with the season ? Have you ever known wells to go dry ? It may be possible to get data from different wells and to draw a diagram showing the ground-water surface as compared with the surface of the ground. @# FISSURE SPRINGS AND ARTESIAN WELLS . The DEEPER ZONES OF FLOW lie in pervious strata which are overlain by some impervious stratum . Such layers are often carried by their dip to great depths , and water may circulate in them to far below the level of the surface streams and even of the sea . When a fissure crosses a water- bearing stratum , or AQUIFIER , water is forced upward by the pressure of the weight of the water contained in the higher parts of the stratum , and may reach the surface as a fissure spring . A boring which taps such an aquifer is known as an artesian well , a name derived from a province in France where wells of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water in artesian wells , and in fissure springs also , depends on the following conditions illustrated in Figure 29 . The aquifer dips toward the region of the wells from higher ground , where it outcrops and receives its water . It is inclosed between an impervious layer above and water- tight or water-logged layers beneath . The weight of the column of water thus inclosed in the aquifer causes water to rise in the well , precisely as the weight of the water in a standpipe forces it in connected pipes to the upper stories of buildings. @# Which will supply the larger region with artesian wells , an aquifer whose dip is steep or one whose dip is gentle ? Which of the two aquifers , their thickness being equal , will have the larger outcrop and therefore be able to draw upon the larger amount of water from the rainfall ? Illustrate with diagrams. @# THE ZONE OF SOLUTION . Near the surface , where the circulation of ground water is most active , it oxidizes , corrodes , and dissolves the rocks through which it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other soluble minerals upon which plants depend for their food . It takes away the soluble cements of rocks ; it widens fissures and joints and opens winding passages along the bedding planes ; it may even remove whole beds of soluble rocks , such as rock salt , limestone , or gypsum . The work of ground water in producing landslides has already been noticed . The zone in which the work of ground water is thus for the most part destructive we may call the zone of solution. @# CAVES . In massive limestone rocks , ground water dissolves channels which sometimes form large caves ( Fig. 30 ) . The necessary conditions for the excavation of caves of great size are well shown in central Kentucky , where an upland is built throughout of thick horizontal beds of limestone . The absence of layers of insoluble or impervious rock in its structure allows a free circulation of ground water within it by the way of all natural openings in the rock . These water ways have been gradually enlarged by solution and wear until the upland is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one county. @# Mammoth Cave , the largest of these caverns , consists of a labyrinth of chambers and winding galleries whose total length is said to be as much as thirty miles . One passage four miles long has an average width of about sixty feet and an average height of forty feet . One of the great halls is three hundred feet in width and is overhung by a solid arch of limestone one hundred feet above the floor . Galleries at different levels are connected by well-like pits , some of which measure two hundred and twenty-five feet from top to bottom . Through some of the lowest of these tunnels flows Echo River , still at work dissolving and wearing away the rock while on its dark way to appear at the surface as a great spring. @# NATURAL BRIDGES . As a cavern enlarges and the surface of the land above it is lowered by weathering , the roof at last breaks down and the cave becomes an open ravine . A portion of the roof may for a while remain , forming a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ channels under ground may become so well developed that the water of rains rapidly drains away through them . Ground water stands low and wells must be sunk deep to find it . Little or no surface water is left to form brooks. @# Thus across the limestone upland of central Kentucky one meets but three surface streams in a hundred miles . Between their valleys surface water finds its way underground by means of sink holes . These are pits , commonly funnel shaped , formed by the enlargement of crevice or joint by percolating water , or by the breakdown of some portion of the roof of a cave . By clogging of the outlet a sink hole may come to be filled by a pond. @# Central Florida is a limestone region with its drainage largely subterranean and in part below the level even of the sea . Sink holes are common , and many of them are occupied by lakelets . Great springs mark the point of issue of underground streams , while some rise from beneath the sea . Silver Spring , one of the largest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty feet deep a little river navigable for small steamers to its source . About the spring there are no surface streams for sixty miles. @# THE KARST . Along the eastern coast of the Adriatic , as far south as Montenegro , lies a belt of limestone mountains singularly worn and honeycombed by the solvent action of water . Where forests have been cut from the mountain sides and the red soil has washed away , the surface of the white limestone forms a pathless desert of rock where each square rod has been corroded into an intricate branch work of shallow furrows and sharp ridges . Great sink holes , some of them six hundred feet deep and more , pockmark the surface of the land . The drainage is chiefly subterranean . Surface streams are rare and a portion of their courses is often under ground . Fragmentary valleys come suddenly to an end at walls of rock where the rivers which occupy the valleys plunge into dark tunnels to reappear some miles away . Ground water stands so far below the surface that it can not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water stored for household uses . The finest cavern of Europe , the Adelsberg Grotto , is in this region . Karst , the name of a part of this country , is now used to designate any region or landscape thus sculptured by the chemical action of surface and ground water . We must remember that Karst regions are rare , and striking as is the work of their subterranean streams , it is far less important than the work done by the sheets of underground water slowly seeping through all subsoils and porous rocks in other regions. @# Even when gathered into definite channels , ground water does not have the erosive power of surface streams , since it carries with it little or no rock waste . Regions whose underground drainage is so perfect that the development of surface streams has been retarded or prevented escape to a large extent the leveling action of surface running waters , and may therefore stand higher than the surrounding country . The hill honeycombed by Luray Cavern , Virginia , has been attributed to this cause. @# CAVERN DEPOSITS . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deposit as well as erode . As it trickles from the roof of caverns , the lime carbonate which it has taken into solution from the layers of limestone above is deposited by evaporation in the air in icicle-like pendants called STALACTITES . As the drops splash on the floor there are built up in the same way thicker masses called STALAGMITES , which may grow to join the stalactites above , forming pillars . A stalagmitic crust often seals with rock the earth which accumulates in caverns , together with whatever relics of cave dwellers , either animals or men , it may contain. @# Can you explain why slender stalactites formed by the drip of single drops are often hollow pipes ? @# THE ZONE OF CEMENTATION . With increasing depth subterranean water becomes more and more sluggish in its movements and more and more highly charged with minerals dissolved from the rocks above . At such depths it deposits these minerals in the pores of rocks , cementing their grains together , and in crevices and fissures , forming mineral veins . Thus below the zone of solution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the zone of cementation where its work is chemical deposit . A part of the invisible load of waste is thus transferred from rocks near the surface to those at greater depths. @# As the land surface is gradually lowered by weathering and the work of rain and streams , rocks which have lain deep within the zone of cementation are brought within the zone of solution . Thus there are exposed to view limestones , whose cracks were filled with calcite ( crystallized carbonate of lime ) , with quartz or other minerals , and sandstones whose grains were well cemented many feet below the surface. @# CAVITY FILLING . Small cavities in the rocks are often found more or less completely filled with minerals deposited from solution by water in its constant circulation underground . The process may be illustrated by the deposit of salt crystals in a cup of evaporating brine , but in the latter instance the solution is not renewed as in the case of cavities in the rocks . A cavity thus lined with inward-pointing crystals is called a GEODE. @# CONCRETIONS . Ground water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throughout them into nodular masses called concretions . Thus silica disseminated through limestone is gathered into nodules of flint . While geodes grow from the outside inwards , concretions grow outwards from the center . Nor are they formed in already existing cavities as are geodes . In soft clays concretions may , as they grow , press the clay aside . In many other rocks concretions are made by the process of REPLACEMENT . Molecule by molecule the rock is removed and the mineral of the concretion substituted in its place . The concretion may in this way preserve intact the lamination lines or other structures of the rock . Clays and shales often contain concretions of lime carbonate , of iron carbonate , or of iron sulphide . Some fossil , such as a leaf or shell , frequently forms the nucleus around which the concretion grows. @# Why are building stones more easily worked when " green " than after their quarry water has dried out ? @# DEPOSITS OF GROUND WATER IN ARID REGIONS . In arid lands where ground water is drawn by capillarity to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the minerals held in solution . White limy incrustations of this nature cover considerable tracts in northern Mexico . Evaporating beneath the surface , ground water may deposit a limy cement in beds of loose sand and gravel . Such firmly cemented layers are not uncommon in western Kansas and Nebraska , where they are known as " mortar beds. " @# THERMAL SPRINGS . While the lower limit of surface drainage is sea level , subterranean water circulates much below that depth , and is brought again to the surface by hydrostatic pressure . In many instances springs have a higher temperature than the average annual temperature of the region , and are then known as thermal springs . In regions of present or recent volcanic activity , such as the Yellowstone National Park , we may believe that the heat of thermal springs is derived from uncooled lavas , perhaps not far below the surface . But when hot springs occur at a distance of hundreds of miles from any volcano , as in the case of the hot springs of Bath , England , it is probable that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth ' s interior . The springs of Bath have a temperature of 120 degrees F. , 70 degrees above the average annual temperature of the place . If we assume that the rate of increase in the earth ' s internal heat is here the average rate , 1 degree F. to every sixty feet of descent , we may conclude that the springs of Bath rise from at least a depth of forty-two hundred feet. @# Water may descend to depths from which it can never be brought back by hydrostatic pressure . It is absorbed by highly heated rocks deep below the surface . From time to time some of this deep- seated water may be returned to open air in the steam of volcanic eruptions. @# SURFACE DEPOSITS OF SPRINGS . Where subterranean water returns to the surface highly charged with minerals in solution , on exposure to the air it is commonly compelled to lay down much of its invisible load in chemical deposits about the spring . These are thrown down from solution either because of cooling , evaporation , the loss of carbon dioxide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been charged under pressure with carbon dioxide from subterranean sources and are able therefore to take up large quantities of lime carbonate from the limestone rocks through which they pass . On reaching the surface the pressure is relieved , the gas escapes , and the lime carbonate is thrown down in deposits called TRAVERTINE . The gas is sometimes withdrawn and the deposit produced in large part by the action of algae and other humble forms of plant life. @# At the Mammoth Hot Springs in the valley of the Gardiner River , Yellowstone National Park , beautiful terraces and basins of travertine are now building , chiefly by means of algae which cover the bottoms , rims , and sides of the basins and deposit lime carbonate upon them in successive sheets . The rock , snow-white where dry , is coated with red and orange gelatinous mats where the algae thrive in the over-flowing waters. @# Similar terraces of travertine are found to a height of fourteen hundred feet up the valley side . We may infer that the springs which formed these ancient deposits discharged near what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the valley has been deepened by the river the ground water of the region has found lower and lower points of issue. @# In many parts of the country calcareous springs occur which coat with lime carbonate mosses , twigs , and other objects over which their waters flow . Such are popularly known as petrifying springs , although they merely incrust the objects and do not convert them into stone. @# Silica is soluble in alkaline waters , especially when these are hot . Hot springs rising through alkaline siliceous rocks , such as lavas , often deposit silica in a white spongy formation known as SILICEOUS SINTER , both by evaporation and by the action of algae which secrete silica from the waters . It is in this way that the cones and mounds of the geysers in the Yellowstone National Park and in Iceland have been formed. @# Where water oozes from the earth one may sometimes see a rusty deposit on the ground , and perhaps an iridescent scum upon the water . The scum is often mistaken for oil , but at a touch it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is a film of hydrated iron oxide , or LIMONITE , and the spring is an iron , or chalybeate , spring . Compounds of iron have been taken into solution by ground water from soil and rocks , and are now changed to the insoluble oxide on exposure to the oxygen of the air. @# In wet ground iron compounds leached by ground water from the soil often collect in reddish deposits a few feet below the surface , where their downward progress is arrested by some impervious clay . At the bottom of bogs and shallow lakes iron ores sometimes accumulate to a depth of several feet. @# Decaying organic matter plays a large part in these changes . In its presence the insoluble iron oxides which give color to most red and yellow rocks are decomposed , leaving the rocks of a gray or bluish color , and the soluble iron compounds which result are readily leached out ,  --  effects seen where red or yellow clays have been bleached about some decaying tree root. @# The iron thus dissolved is laid down as limonite when oxidized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contact with the air and in the presence of carbon dioxide supplied by decaying vegetation , as in a peat bog , it may be deposited as iron carbonate , or SIDERITE. @# TOTAL AMOUNT OF UNDERGROUND WATERS . In order to realize the vast work in solution and cementation which underground waters are now doing and have done in all geological ages , we must gain some conception of their amount . At a certain depth , estimated at about six miles , the weight of the crust becomes greater than the rocks can bear , and all cavities and pores in them must be completely closed by the enormous pressure which they sustain . Below a depth of even three or four miles it is believed that ground water can not circulate . Estimating the average pore spaces of the different rocks of the earth ' s crust above this depth , and the average per cents of their pore spaces occupied by water , it has been recently computed that the total amount of ground water is equal to a sheet of water one hundred feet deep , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CHAPTER III @# RIVERS AND VALLEYS @# THE RUN-OFF . We have traced the history of that portion of the rainfall which soaks into the ground ; let us now return to that part which washes along the surface and is known as the RUN-OFF . Fed by rains and melting snows , the run-off gathers into courses , perhaps but faintly marked at first , which join more definite and deeply cut channels , as twigs their stems . In a humid climate the larger ravines through which the run-off flows soon descend below the ground-water surface . Here springs discharge along the sides of the little valleys and permanent streams begin . The water supplied by the run-off here joins that part of the rainfall which had soaked into the soil , and both now proceed together by way of the stream to the sea. @# RIVER FLOODS . Streams vary greatly in volume during the year . At stages of flood they fill their immediate banks , or overrun them and inundate any low lands adjacent to the channel ; at stages of low water they diminish to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At times of flood , rivers are fed chiefly by the run-off ; at times of low water , largely or even wholly by springs. @# How , then , will the water of streams differ at these times in turbidity and in the relative amount of solids carried in solution ? @# In parts of England streams have been known to continue flowing after eighteen months of local drought , so great is the volume of water which in humid climates is stored in the rocks above the drainage level , and so slowly is it given off in springs. @# In Illinois and the states adjacent , rivers remain low in winter and a " spring freshet " follows the melting of the winter ' s snows . A " June rise " is produced by the heavy rains of early summer . Low water follows in July and August , and streams are again swollen to a moderate degree under the rains of autumn. @# THE DISCHARGE OF STREAMS . The per cent of rainfall discharged by rivers varies with the amount of rainfall , the slope of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other factors . With an annual rainfall of fifty inches in an open country , about fifty per cent is discharged ; while with a rainfall of twenty inches only fifteen per cent is discharged , part of the remainder being evaporated and part passing underground beyond the drainage area . Thus the Ohio discharges thirty per cent of the rainfall of its basin , while the Missouri carries away but fifteen per cent . A number of the streams of the semi-arid lands of the West do not discharge more than five per cent of the rainfall. @# Other things being equal , which will afford the larger proportion of run-off , a region underlain with granite rock or with coarse sandstone ? grass land or forest ? steep slopes or level land ? a well-drained region or one abounding in marshes and ponds ? frozen or unfrozen ground ? Will there be a larger proportion of run-off after long rains or after a season of drought ? after long and gentle rains , or after the same amount of precipitation in a violent rain ? during the months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the autumn months ? @# DESERT STREAMS . In arid regions the ground-water surface lies so low that for the most part stream ways do not intersect it . Streams therefore are not fed by springs , but instead lose volume as their waters soak into the thirsty rocks over which they flow . They contribute to the ground water of the region instead of being increased by it . Being supplied chiefly by the run-off , they wither at times of drought to a mere trickle of water , to a chain of pools , or go wholly dry , while at long intervals rains fill their dusty beds with sudden raging torrents . Desert rivers therefore periodically shorten and lengthen their courses , withering back at times of drought for scores of miles , or even for a hundred miles from the point reached by their waters during seasons of rain. @# THE GEOLOGICAL WORK OF STREAMS . The work of streams is of three kinds ,  --  transportation , erosion , and deposition . Streams TRANSPORT the waste of the land ; they wear , or ERODE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they DEPOSIT portions of their load from time to time along their courses , finally laying it down in the sea . Most of the work of streams is done at times of flood. @# TRANSPORTATION @# THE INVISIBLE LOAD OF STREAMS . Of the waste which a river transports we may consider first the invisible load which it carries in solution , supplied chiefly by springs but also in part by the run-off and from the solution of the rocks of its bed . More than half the dissolved solids in the water of the average river consists of the carbonates of lime and magnesia ; other substances are gypsum , sodium sulphate ( Glauber ' s salts ) , magnesium sulphate ( Epsom salts ) , sodium chloride ( common salt ) , and even silica , the least soluble of the common rock-making minerals . The amount of this invisible load is surprisingly large . The Mississippi , for example , transports each year 113 , 000 , 000 tons of dissolved rock to the Gulf. @# THE VISIBLE LOAD OF STREAMS . This consists of the silt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gravel and larger stones which it pushes along its bed . Especially in times of flood one may note the muddy water , its silt being kept from settling by the rolling , eddying currents ; and often by placing his ear close to the bottom of a boat one may hear the clatter of pebbles as they are hurried along . In mountain torrents the rumble of bowlders as they clash together may be heard some distance away . The amount of the load which a stream can transport depends on its velocity . A current of two thirds of a mile per hour can move fine sand , while one of four miles per hour sweeps along pebbles as large as hen ' s eggs . The transporting power of a stream varies as the sixth power of its velocity . If its velocity is multiplied by two , its transporting power is multiplied by the sixth power of two : it can now move stones sixty-four times as large as it could before. @# Stones weigh from two to three times as much as water , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they displace . What proportion , then , of their weight in air do stones lose when submerged ? @# MEASUREMENT OF STREAM LOADS . To obtain the total amount of waste transported by a river is an important but difficult matter . The amount of water discharged must first be found by multiplying the number of square feet in the average cross section of the stream by its velocity per second , giving the discharge per second in cubic feet . The amount of silt to a cubic foot of water is found by filtering samples of the water taken from different parts of the stream and at different times in the year , and drying and weighing the residues . The average amount of silt to the cubic foot of water , multiplied by the number of cubic feet of water discharged per year , gives the total load carried in suspension during that time . Adding to this the estimated amount of sand and gravel rolled along the bed , which in many swift rivers greatly exceeds the lighter material held in suspension , and adding also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exceedingly important result of the total load of waste discharged by the river . Dividing the volume of this load by the area of the river basin gives another result of the greatest geological interest ,  --  the rate at which the region is being lowered by the combined action of weathering and erosion , or the rate of denudation. @# THE RATE OF DENUDATION OF RIVER BASINS . This rate varies widely . The Mississippi basin may be taken as a representative land surface because of the varieties of surface , altitude and slope , climate , and underlying rocks which are included in its great extent . Careful measurements show that the Mississippi basin is now being lowered at a rate of one four-thousandth of a foot a year , or one foot in four thousand years . Taking this as the average rate of denudation for the land surfaces of the globe , estimates have been made of the length of time required at this rate to wash and wear the continents to the level of the sea . As the average elevation of the lands of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occur in nine or ten million years , if the present rate of denudation should remain unchanged . But even if no movements of the earth ' s crust should lift or depress the continents , the rate of wear and the removal of waste from their surfaces will not remain the same . It must constantly decrease as the lands are worn nearer to sea level and their slopes become more gentle . The length of time required to wear them away is therefore far in excess of that just stated. @# The drainage area of the Potomac is 11 , 000 square miles . The silt brought down in suspension in a year would cover a square mile to the depth of four feet . At what rate is the Potomac basin being lowered from this cause alone ? @# It is estimated that the Upper Ganges is lowering its basin at the rate of one foot in 823 years , and the Po one foot in 720 years . Why so much faster than the Potomac and the Mississippi ? @# HOW STREAMS GET THEIR LOADS . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the larger part being supplied by the weathering of valley slopes . We have noticed how the mantle of waste creeps and washes to the stream ways . Watching the run-off during a rain , as it hurries muddy with waste along the gutter or washes down the hillside , we may see the beginning of the route by which the larger part of their load is delivered to rivers . Streams also secure some of their load by wearing it from their beds and banks ,  --  a process called erosion. @# EROSION @# Streams erode their beds chiefly by means of their bottom load ,  --  the stones of various sizes and the sand and even the fine mud which they sweep along . With these tools they smooth , grind , and rasp the rock of their beds , using them in much the fashion of sandpaper or a file. @# WEATHERING OF RIVER BEDS . The erosion of stream beds is greatly helped by the work of the weather . Especially at low water more or less of the bed is exposed to the action of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rocks are pried loose and broken up and made ready to be swept away by the stream at time of flood. @# POTHOLES . In rapids streams also drill out their rocky beds . Where some slight depression gives rise to an eddy , the pebbles which gather in it are whirled round and round , and , acting like the bit of an auger , bore out a cylindrical pit called a pothole . Potholes sometimes reach a depth of a score of feet . Where they are numerous they aid materially in deepening the channel , as the walls between them are worn away and they coalesce. @# WATERFALLS . One of the most effective means of erosion which the river possesses is the waterfall . The plunging water dislodges stones from the face of the ledge over which it pours , and often undermines it by excavating a deep pit at its base . Slice after slice is thus thrown down from the front of the cliff , and the cataract cuts its way upstream leaving a gorge behind it. @# NIAGARA FALLS . The Niagara River flows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has cut but a few feet below the level of the region . Some thirteen miles from the outlet it plunges over a ledge one hundred and seventy feet high into the head of a narrow gorge which extends for seven miles to the escarpment of the upland in which the gorge is cut . The strata which compose the upland dip gently upstream and consist at top of a massive limestone , at the Falls about eighty feet thick , and below of soft and easily weathered shale . Beneath the Falls the underlying shale is cut and washed away by the descending water and retreats also because of weathering , while the overhanging limestone breaks down in huge blocks from time to time. @# Niagara is divided by Goat Island into the Horseshoe Falls and the American Falls . The former is supplied by the main current of the river , and from the semicircular sweep of its rim a sheet of water in places at least fifteen or twenty feet deep plunges into a pool a little less than two hundred feet in depth . Here the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fallen blocks of limestone and use them in the excavation of the shale of the bed . At the American Falls the lesser branch of the river , which flows along the American side of Goat Island , pours over the side of the gorge and breaks upon a high talus of limestone blocks which its smaller volume of water is unable to grind to pieces and remove. @# A series of surveys have determined that from 1842 to 1890 the Horseshoe Falls retreated at the rate of 2. 18 feet per year , while the American Falls retreated at the rate of 0. 64 feet in the same period . We can not doubt that the same agency which is now lengthening the gorge at this rapid rate has cut it back its entire length of seven miles. @# While Niagara Falls have been cutting back a gorge seven miles long and from two hundred to three hundred feet deep , the river above the Falls has eroded its bed scarcely below the level of the upland on which it flows . Like all streams which are the outlets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear of sediment , as from a settling basin , and carries no tools with which to abrade its bed . We may infer from this instance how slight is the erosive power of clear water on hard rock. @# Assuming that the rate of recession of the combined volumes of the American and Horseshoe Falls was three feet a year below Goat Island , and ASSUMING THAT THIS RATE HAS BEEN UNIFORM IN THE PAST , how long is it since the Niagara River fell over the edge of the escarpment where now is the mouth of the present gorge ? @# The profile of the bed of the Niagara along the gorge ( Fig. 39 ) shows alternating deeps and shallows which can not be accounted for , except in a single instance , by the relative hardness of the rocks of the river bed . The deeps do not exceed that at the foot of the Horseshoe Falls at the present time . When the gorge was being cut along the shallows , how did the Falls compare in excavating power , in force , and volume with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recession at those times compare with the present rate ? Is the assumption made above that the rate of recession has been uniform correct ? @# The first stretch of shallows below the Falls causes a tumultuous rapid impossible to sound . Its depth has been estimated at thirty- five feet . From what data could such an estimate be made ? @# Suggest a reason why the Horseshoe Falls are convex upstream. @# At the present rate of recession which will reach the head of Goat Island the sooner , the American or the Horseshoe Falls ? What will be the fate of the Falls left behind when the other has passed beyond the head of the island ? @# The rate at which a stream erodes its bed depends in part upon the nature of the rocks over which it flows . Will a stream deepen its channel more rapidly on massive or on thin-bedded and close- jointed rocks ? on horizontal strata or on strata steeply inclined ? @# DEPOSITION @# While the river carries its invisible load of dissolved rock on without stop to the sea , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ en route . Now and again it is laid aside , to be picked up later and carried some distance farther on its way . One of the most striking features of the river therefore is the waste accumulated along its course , in bars and islands in the channel , beneath its bed , and in flood plains along its banks . All this alluvium , to use a general term for river deposits , with which the valley is cumbered is really en route to the sea ; it is only temporarily laid aside to resume its journey later on . Constantly the river is destroying and rebuilding its alluvial deposits , here cutting and there depositing along its banks , here eroding and there building a bar , here excavating its bed and there filling it up , and at all times carrying the material picked up at one point some distance on downstream before depositing it at another. @# These deposits are laid down by slackening currents where the velocity of the stream is checked , as on the inner side of curves , and where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lee of islands , bridge piers and projecting points of land . How slight is the check required to cause a current to drop a large part of its load may be inferred from the law of the relation of the transporting power to the velocity . If the velocity is decreased one half , the current can move fragments but one sixty-fourth the size of those which it could move before , and must drop all those of larger size. @# Will a river deposit more at low water or at flood ? when rising or when falling ? @# STRATIFICATION . River deposits are stratified , as may be seen in any fresh cut in banks or bars . The waste of which they are built has been sorted and deposited in layers , one above another ; some of finer and some of coarser material . The sorting action of running water depends on the fact that its transporting power varies with the velocity . A current whose diminishing velocity compels it to drop coarse gravel , for example , is still able to move all the finer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gravel , carries it on downstream ; while at a later time slower currents may deposit on the gravel bed layers of sand , and , still later , slack water may leave on these a layer of mud . In case of materials lighter than water the transporting power does not depend on the velocity , and logs of wood , for instance , are floated on to the sea on the slowest as well as on the most rapid currents. @# CROSS BEDDING . A section of a bar exposed at low water may show that it is formed of layers of sand , or coarser stuff , inclined downstream as steeply often as the angle of repose of the material . From a boat anchored over the lower end of a submerged sand bar we may observe the way in which this structure , called cross bedding , is produced . Sand is continually pushed over the edge of the bar at b ( Fig. 42 ) and comes to rest in successive layers on the sloping surface . At the same time the bar may be worn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly advance down stream . While the deposit is thus cross bedded , it constitutes as a whole a stratum whose upper and lower surfaces are about horizontal . In sections of river banks one may often see a vertical succession of cross-bedded strata , each built in the way described. @# WATER WEAR . The coarser material of river deposits , such as cobblestones , gravel , and the larger grains of sand , are WATER WORN , or rounded , except when near their source . Rolling along the bottom they have been worn round by impact and friction as they rubbed against one another and the rocky bed of the stream. @# Experiments have shown that angular fragments of granite lose nearly half their weight and become well rounded after traveling fifteen miles in rotating cylinders partly filled with water . Marbles are cheaply made in Germany out of small limestone cubes set revolving in a current of water between a rotating bed of stone and a block of oak , the process requiring but about fifteen minutes . It has been found that in the upper reaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is sufficient to round pebbles of granite. @# LAND FORMS DUE TO RIVER EROSION @# RIVER VALLEYS . In their courses to the sea , rivers follow valleys of various forms , some shallow and some deep , some narrow and some wide . Since rivers are known to erode their beds and banks , it is a fair presumption that , aided by the weather , they have excavated the valleys in which they flow. @# Moreover , a bird ' s-eye view or a map of a region shows the significant fact that the valleys of a system unite with one another in a branch work , as twigs meet their stems and the branches of a tree its trunk . Each valley , from that of the smallest rivulet to that of the master stream , is proportionate to the size of the stream which occupies it . With a few explainable exceptions the valleys of tributaries join that of the trunk stream at a level ; there is no sudden descent or break in the bed at the point of juncture . These are the natural consequences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon by streams , and no other process has ever been suggested which is competent to produce them . We must conclude that valley systems have been formed by the river systems which drain them , aided by the work of the weather ; they are not gaping fissures in the earth ' s crust , as early observers imagined , but are the furrows which running water has drawn upon the land. @# As valleys are made by the slow wear of streams and the action of the weather , they pass in their development through successive stages , each of which has its own characteristic features . We may therefore classify rivers and valleys according to the stage which they have reached in their life history from infancy to old age. @# YOUNG RIVER VALLEYS @# INFANCY . The Red River of the North . A region in northwestern Minnesota and the adjacent portions of North Dakota and Manitoba was so recently covered by the waters of an extinct lake , known as Lake Agassiz , that the surface remains much as it was left when the lake was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lake-laid silts , is still a plain , to the eye as level as the sea . Across it the Red River of the North and its branches run in narrow , ditch-like channels , steep-sided and shallow , not exceeding sixty feet in depth , their gradients differing little from the general slopes of the region . The trunk streams have but few tributaries ; the river system , like a sapling with few limbs , is still undeveloped . Along the banks of the trunk streams short gullies are slowly lengthening headwards , like growing twigs which are sometime to become large branches. @# The flat interstream areas are as yet but little scored by drainage lines , and in wet weather water lingers in ponds in any initial depressions on the plain. @# CONTOURS . In order to read the topographic maps of the text-book and the laboratory the student should know that contours are lines drawn on maps to represent relief , all points on any given contour being of equal height above sea level . The CONTOUR INTERVAL is the uniform vertical distance between two adjacent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of faint relief a contour interval of ten or twenty feet is commonly selected ; while in mountainous regions a contour interval of two hundred and fifty , five hundred , or even one thousand feet may be necessary in order that the contours may not be too crowded for easy reading. @# Whether a river begins its life on a lake plain , as in the example just cited , or upon a coastal plain lifted from beneath the sea or on a spread of glacial drift left by the retreat of continental ice sheets , such as covers much of Canada and the northeastern parts of the United States , its infantile stage presents the same characteristic features ,  --  a narrow and shallow valley , with undeveloped tributaries and undrained interstream areas . Ground water stands high , and , exuding in the undrained initial depressions , forms marshes and lakes. @# LAKES . Lakes are perhaps the most obvious of these fleeting features of infancy . They are short-lived , for their destruction is soon accomplished by several means . As a river system advances toward maturity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground-water surface and invade the undrained depressions of the region . Lakes having outlets are drained away as their basin rims are cut down by the outflowing streams ,  --  a slow process where the rim is of hard rock , but a rapid one where it is of soft material such as glacial drift. @# Lakes are effaced also by the filling of their basins . Inflowing streams and the wash of rains bring in waste . Waves abrade the shore and strew the debris worn from it over the lake bed . Shallow lakes are often filled with organic matter from decaying vegetation. @# Does the outflowing stream , from a lake carry sediment ? How does this fact affect its erosive power on hard rock ? on loose material ? @# Lake Geneva is a well-known example of a lake in process of obliteration . The inflowing Rhone has already displaced the waters of the lake for a length of twenty miles with the waste brought down from the high Alps . For this distance there extends up the Rhone Valley an alluvial plain , which has grown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since Roman times , as proved by the distance inland at which a Roman port now stands. @# How rapidly a lake may be silted up under exceptionally favorable conditions is illustrated by the fact that over the bottom of the artificial lake , of thirty-five square miles , formed behind the great dam across the Colorado River at Austin , Texas , sediments thirty-nine feet deep gathered in seven years. @# Lake Mendota , one of the many beautiful lakes of southern Wisconsin , is rapidly cutting back the soft glacial drift of its shores by means of the abrasion of its waves . While the shallow basin is thus broadened , it is also being filled with the waste ; and the time is brought nearer when it will be so shoaled that vegetation can complete the work of its effacement. @# Along the margin of a shallow lake mosses , water lilies , grasses , and other water-loving plants grow luxuriantly . As their decaying remains accumulate on the bottom , the ring of marsh broadens inwards , the lake narrows gradually to a small pond set in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All stages in this process of extinction may be seen among the countless lakelets which occupy sags in the recent sheets of glacial drift in the northern states ; and more numerous than the lakes which still remain are those already thus filled with carbonaceous matter derived from the carbon dioxide of the atmosphere . Such fossil lakes are marked by swamps or level meadows underlain with muck. @# THE ADVANCE TO MATURITY . The infantile stage is brief . As a river advances toward maturity the initial depressions , the lake basins of its area , are gradually effaced . By the furrowing action of the rain wash and the head ward lengthening , of tributaries a branchwork of drainage channels grows until it covers the entire area , and not an acre is left on which the fallen raindrop does not find already cut for it an uninterrupted downward path which leads it on by way of gully , brook , and river to the sea . The initial surface of the land , by whatever agency it was modeled , is now wholly destroyed ; the region @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OF A STREAM . This at first corresponds with the initial surface of the region on which the stream begins to flow , although its way may lead through basins and down steep descents . The successive profiles to which it reduces its bed are illustrated in Figure 51 . As the gradient , or rate of descent of its bed , is lowered , the velocity of the river is decreased until its lessening energy is wholly consumed in carrying its load and it can no longer erode its bed . The river is now AT GRADE , and its capacity is just equal to its load . If now its load is increased the stream deposits , and thus builds up , or AGGRADES , its bed . On the other hand , if its load is diminished it has energy to spare , and resuming its work of erosion , DEGRADES its bed . In either case the stream continues aggrading or degrading until a new gradient is found where the velocity is just sufficient to move the load , and here again it reaches grade. @# V-VALLEYS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cutting their beds to grade , and thus erode narrow , steep-sided gorges only wide enough at the base to accommodate the stream . The steepness of the valley slopes depends on the relative rates at which the bed is cut down by the stream and the sides are worn back by the weather . In resistant rock a swift , well-laden stream may saw out a gorge whose sides are nearly or even quite vertical , but as a rule young valleys whose streams have not yet reached grade are V-shaped ; their sides flare at the top because here the rocks have longest been opened up to the action of the weather . Some of the deepest canyons may be found where a rising land mass , either mountain range or plateau , has long maintained by its continued uplift the rivers of the region above grade. @# In the northern hemisphere the north sides of river valleys are sometimes of more gentle slope than the south sides . Can you suggest a reason ? @# THE GRAND CANYON OF THE COLORADO RIVER IN ARIZONA . The Colorado @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colossal canyon two hundred and eighteen miles long and more than a mile in greatest depth . The rocks in which the canyon is cut are for the most part flat-lying , massive beds of limestones and sandstones , with some shales , beneath which in places harder crystalline rocks are disclosed . Where the canyon is deepest its walls have been profoundly dissected . Lateral ravines have widened into immense amphitheaters , leaving between them long ridges of mountain height , buttressed and rebuttressed with flanking spurs and carved into majestic architectural forms . From the extremity of one of these promontories it is two miles or more across the gulf to the point of the one opposite , and the heads of the amphitheaters are thirteen miles apart. @# The lower portion of the canyon is much narrower ( Fig. 54 ) and its walls of dark crystalline rock sink steeply to the edge of the river , a swift , powerful stream a few hundred feet wide , turbid with reddish silt , by means of which it continually rasps its rocky bed as it hurries on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grand Canyon its gradient is seven and one half feet to the mile , but , as in all ungraded rivers , the descent is far from uniform . Graded reaches in soft rock alternate with steeper declivities in hard rock , forming rapids such as , for example , a stretch of ten miles where the fall averages twenty-one feet to the mile . Because of these dangerous rapids the few exploring parties who have traversed the Colorado canyon have done so at the hazard of their lives. @# The canyon has been shaped by several agencies . Its depth is due to the river which has sawed its way far toward the base of a lofty rising plateau . Acting alone this would have produced a slitlike gorge little wider than the breadth of the stream . The impressive width of the canyon and the magnificent architectural masses which fill it are owing to two causes . : Running water has gulched the walls and weathering has everywhere attacked and driven them back . The horizontal harder beds stand out in long lines of vertical cliffs , often hundreds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conceal the outcrop of the weaker strata . As the upper cliffs have been sapped and driven back by the weather , broad platforms are left at their bases and the sides of the canyon descend to the river by gigantic steps . Far up and down the canyon the eye traces these horizontal layers , like the flutings of an elaborate molding , distinguishing each by its contour as well as by its color and thickness. @# The Grand Canyon of the Colorado is often and rightly cited as an example of the stupendous erosion which may be accomplished by a river . And yet the Colorado is a young stream and its work is no more than well begun . It has not yet wholly reached grade , and the great task of the river and its tributaries  --  the task of leveling the lofty plateau to a low plain and of transporting it grain by grain to the sea  --  still lies almost entirely in the future. @# WATERFALLS AND RAPIDS . Before the bed of a stream is reduced to grade it may be broken by abrupt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breaks in a river ' s bed may belong to the initial surface over which it began its course ; still more commonly are they developed in the rock mass through which it is cutting its valley . Thus , wherever a stream leaves harder rocks to flow over softer ones the latter are quickly worn below the level of the former , and a sharp change in slope , with a waterfall or rapid , results. @# At time of flood young tributaries with steeper courses than that of the trunk stream may bring down stones and finer waste , which the gentler current can not move along , and throw them as a dam across its way . The rapids thus formed are also ephemeral , for as the gradient of the tributaries is lowered the main stream becomes able to handle the smaller and finer load which they discharge. @# A rare class of falls is produced where the minor tributaries of a young river are not able to keep pace with their master stream in the erosion of their beds because of their smaller volume , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gorge . But as the river approaches grade and slackens its down cutting , the tributaries sooner or later overtake it , and effacing their falls , unite with it on a level. @# Waterfalls and rapids of all kinds are evanescent features of a river ' s youth . Like lakes they are soon destroyed , and if any long time had already elapsed since their formation they would have been obliterated already. @# LOCAL BASELEVELS . That balanced condition called grade , where a river neither degrades its bed by erosion nor aggrades it by deposition , is first attained along reaches of soft rocks , ungraded outcrops of hard rocks remaining as barriers which give rise to rapids or falls . Until these barriers are worn away they constitute local baselevels , below which level the stream , up valley from them , can not cut . They are eroded to grade one after another , beginning with the least strong , or the one nearest the mouth of the stream . In a similar way the surface of a lake in a river ' s course constitutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the basin is filled or drained. @# MATURE AND OLD RIVERS @# Maturity is the stage of a river ' s complete development and most effective work . The river system now has well under way its great task of wearing down the land mass which it drains and carrying it particle by particle to the sea . The relief of the land is now at its greatest ; for the main channels have been sunk to grade , while the divides remain but little worn below their initial altitudes . Ground water now stands low . The run-off washes directly to the streams , with the least delay and loss by evaporation in ponds and marches ; the discharge of the river is therefore at its height . The entire region is dissected by stream ways . The area of valley slopes is now largest and sheds to the streams a heavier load of waste than ever before . At maturity the river system is doing its greatest amount of work both in erosion and in the carriage of water and of waste to the sea. @# LATERAL EROSION @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed , and it does not again begin to do so until some change in load or volume enables it to find grade at a lower level . On the other hand , a stream erodes its banks at all stages in its history , and with graded rivers this process , called lateral erosion , or PLANATION , is specially important . The current of a stream follows the outer side of all curves or bends in the channel , and on this side it excavates its bed the deepest and continually wears and saps its banks . On the inner side deposition takes place in the more shallow and slower-moving water . The inner bank of bends is thus built out while the outer bank is worn away . By swinging its curves against the valley sides a graded river continually cuts a wider and wider floor . The V-valley of youth is thus changed by planation to a flat-floored valley with flaring sides which gradually become subdued by the weather to gentle slopes . While widening their valleys streams maintain a constant width of channel , so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupied by a river of equal width. @# THE GRADIENT . The gradients of graded rivers differ widely . A large river with a light load reaches grade on a faint slope , while a smaller stream heavily burdened with waste requires a steep slope to give it velocity sufficient to move the load. @# The Platte , a graded river of Nebraska with its headwaters in the Rocky Mountains , is enfeebled by the semi-arid climate of the Great Plains and surcharged with the waste brought down both by its branches in the mountains and by those whose tracks lie over the soft rocks of the plains . It is compelled to maintain a gradient of eight feet to the mile in western Nebraska . The Ohio reaches grade with a slope of less than four inches to the mile from Cincinnati to its mouth , and the powerful Mississippi washes along its load with a fall of but three inches per mile from Cairo to the Gulf. @# Other things being equal , which of graded streams will have the steeper gradient , a trunk stream or its tributaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? @# Other factors remaining the same , what changes would occur if the Platte should increase in volume ? What changes would occur if the load should be increased in amount or in coarseness ? @# THE OLD AGE OF RIVERS . As rivers pass their prime , as denudation lowers the relief of the region , less waste and finer is washed over the gentler slopes of the lowering hills . With smaller loads to carry , the rivers now deepen their valleys and find grade with fainter declivities nearer the level of the sea . This limit of the level of the sea beneath which they can not erode is known as baselevel . Footnote : The term " baselevel " is also used to designate the close approximation to sea level to which streams are able to subdue the land . As streams grow old they approach more and more closely to baselevel , although they are never able to attain it . Some slight slope is needed that water may flow and waste be transported over the land . Meanwhile the relief of the land has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now wander with sluggish currents over the broad valley floors which they have planed away ; while under the erosion of their innumerable branches and the wear of the weather the divides everywhere are lowered and subdued to more and more gentle slopes . Mountains and high plateaus are thus reduced to rolling hills , and at last to plains , surmounted only by such hills as may still be unreduced to the common level , because of the harder rocks of which they are composed or because of their distance from the main erosion channels . Such regions of faint relief , worn down to near base level by subaerial agencies , are known as PENEPLAINS ( almost plains ) . Any residual masses which rise above them are called MONADNOCKS , from the name of a conical peak of New Hampshire which overlooks the now uplifted peneplain of southern New England. @# In its old age a region becomes mantled with thick sheets of fine and weathered waste , slowly moving over the faint slopes toward the water ways and unbroken by ledges of bare rock . In other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and as waterfalls have been effaced in the river beds , so now any ledges in the wide streams of waste are worn away and covered beneath smooth slopes of fine soil . Ground water stands high and may exude in areas of swamp . In youth the land mass was roughhewn and cut deep by stream erosion . In old age the faint reliefs of the land dissolve away , chiefly under the action of the weather , beneath their cloak of waste. @# THE CYCLE OF EROSION . The successive stages through which a land mass passes while it is being leveled to the sea constitute together a cycle of erosion . Each stage of the cycle from infancy to old age leaves , as we have seen , its characteristic records in the forms sculptured on the land , such as the shapes of valleys and the contours of hills and plains . The geologist is thus able to determine by the land forms of any region the stage in the erosion cycle to which it now belongs , and knowing what are the earlier stages of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the region. @# INTERRUPTED CYCLES . So long a time is needed to reduce a land mass to baselevel that the process is seldom if ever completed during a single uninterrupted cycle of erosion . Of all the various interruptions which may occur the most important are gradual movements of the earth ' s crust , by which a region is either depressed or elevated relative to sea level. @# The DEPRESSION of a region hastens its old age by decreasing the gradient of streams , by destroying their power to excavate their beds and carry their loads to a degree corresponding to the amount of the depression , and by lessening the amount of work they have to do . The slackened river currents deposit their waste in Hood plains which increase in height as the subsidence continues . The lower courses of the rivers are invaded by the sea and become estuaries , while the lower tributaries are cut off from the trunk stream. @# ELEVATION , on the other hand , increases the activity of all agencies of weathering , erosion , and transportation , restores the region @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ erosion . Streams are given a steeper gradient , greater velocity , and increased energy to carry their loads and wear their beds . They cut through the alluvium of their flood plains , leaving it on either bank as successive terraces , and intrench themselves in the underlying rock . In their older and wider valleys they cut narrow , steep-walled inner gorges , in which they flow swiftly over rocky floors , broken here and there by falls and rapids where a harder layer of rock has been discovered . Winding streams on plains may thus incise their meanders in solid rock as the plains are gradually uplifted . Streams which are thus restored to their youth are said to be REVIVED. @# As streams cut deeper and the valley slopes are steepened , the mantle of waste of the region undergoing elevation is set in more rapid movement . It is now removed particle by particle faster than it forms . As the waste mantle thins , weathering attacks the rocks of the region more energetically until an equilibrium is reached again ; the rocks waste rapidly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When a rise of the land brings one cycle to an end and begins another , the characteristic land forms of each cycle are found together and the topography of the region is composite until the second cycle is so far advanced that the land forms of the first cycle are entirely destroyed . The contrast between the land surfaces of the later and the earlier cycles is most striking when the earlier had advanced to age and the later is still in youth . Thus many peneplains which have been elevated and dissected have been recognized by the remnants of their ancient erosion surfaces , and the length of time which has elapsed since their uplift has been measured by the stage to which the new cycle has advanced. @# THE PIEDMONT BELT . As an example of an ancient peneplain uplifted and dissected we may cite the Piedmont Belt , a broad upland lying between the Appalachian Mountains and the Atlantic coastal plain . The surface of the Piedmont is gently rolling . The divides , which are often smooth areas of considerable width , rise to a common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an even sky line except where in places some lone hill or ridge may lift itself above the general level ( Fig. 62 ) . The surface is an ancient one , for the mantle of residual waste lies deep upon it , soils are reddened by long oxidation , and the rocks are rotted to a depth of scores of feet. @# At present , however , the waste mantle is not forming so rapidly as it is being removed . The streams of the upland are actively engaged in its destruction . They flow swiftly in narrow , rock- walled valleys over rocky beds . This contrast between the young streams and the aged surface which they are now so vigorously dissecting can only be explained by the theory that the region once stood lower than at present and has recently been upraised . If now we imagine the valleys refilled with the waste which the streams have swept away , and the upland lowered , we restore the Piedmont region to the condition in which it stood before its uplift and dissection ,  --  a gently rolling plain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @# The surface of the ancient Piedmont plain , as it may be restored from the remnants of it found on the divides , is not in accordance with the structures of the country rocks . Where these are exposed to view they are seen to be far from horizontal . On the walls of river gorges they dip steeply and in various directions and the streams flow over their upturned edges . As shown in Figure 67 , the rocks of the Piedmont have been folded and broken and tilted. @# It is not reasonable to believe that when the rocks of the Piedmont were thus folded and otherwise deformed the surface of the region was a plain . The upturned layers have not always stopped abruptly at the even surface of the Piedmont plain which now cuts across them . They are the bases of great folds and tilted blocks which must once have risen high in air . The complex and disorderly structures of the Piedmont rocks are those seen in great mountain ranges , and there is every reason to believe that these rocks after their deformation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across these upturned rocks as independently of their structure as the even surface of the sawed stump of some great tree is independent of the direction of its fibers . Hence the Piedmont plain as it was before its uplift was not a coastal plain formed of strata spread in horizontal sheets beneath the sea and then uplifted ; nor was it a structural plain , due to the resistance to erosion of some hard , flat-lying layer of rock . Even surfaces developed on rocks of discordant structure , such as the Piedmont shows , are produced by long denudation , and we may consider the Piedmont as a peneplain formed by the wearing down of mountain ranges , and recently uplifted. @# THE LAURENTIAN PENEPLAIN . This is the name given to a denuded surface on very ancient rocks which extends from the Arctic Ocean to the St. Lawrence River and Lake Superior , with small areas also in northern Wisconsin and New York . Throughout this U-shaped area , which incloses Hudson Bay within its arms , the country rocks have the complicated and contorted structures which characterize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by no means mountainous . The sky line when viewed from the divides is unbroken by mountain peaks or rugged hills . The surface of the arm west of Hudson Bay is gently undulating and that of the eastern arm has been roughened to low-rolling hills and dissected in places by such deep river gorges as those of the Ottawa and Saguenay . This immense area may be regarded as an ancient peneplain truncating the bases of long-vanished mountains and dissected after elevation. @# In the examples cited the uplift has been a broad one and to comparatively little height . Where peneplains have been uplifted to great height and have since been well dissected , and where they have been upfolded and broken and uptilted , their recognition becomes more difficult . Yet recent observers have found evidences of ancient lowland surfaces of erosion on the summits of the Allegheny ridges , the Cascade Mountains ( Fig. 69 ) , and the western slope of the Sierra Nevadas. @# THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION . We have here an example of an area the latter part of whose geological history may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generalized section of Figure 70 , which passes from west to east across a portion of the region in eastern Tennessee , shows on the west a part of the broad Cumberland plateau . On the east is a roughened upland platform , from which rise in the distance the peaks of the Great Smoky Mountains . The plateau , consisting of strata but little changed from their original flat-lying attitude , and the platform , developed on rocks of disordered structure made crystalline by heat and pressure , both stand at the common level of the line AB . They are separated by the Appalachian valley , forty miles wide , cut in strata which have been folded and broken into long narrow blocks . The valley is traversed lengthwise by long , low ridges , the outcropping edges of the harder strata , which rise to about the same level ,  --  that of the line cd . Between these ridges stretch valley lowlands at the level ef excavated in the weaker rocks , while somewhat below them lie the channels of the present streams now busily engaged in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planed by graded or ungraded streams ?

Which surface is the older ? @# How many cycles of erosion are represented here ? Give the erosion history of the region by cycles , beginning with the oldest , the work done in each and the work left undone , what brought each cycle to a close , and how long relatively it continued. @# @# @# CHAPTER IV @# RIVER DEPOSITS @# The characteristic features of river deposits and the forms which they assume may be treated under three heads : ( 1 ) valley deposits , ( 2 ) basin deposits , and ( 3 ) deltas. @# VALLEY DEPOSITS @# FLOOD PLAINS are the surfaces of the alluvial deposits which streams build along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then sweeps along the channel , while a shallow sheet of water moves slowly over the flood plain , spreading upon it a thin layer of sediment . It has been estimated that each inundation of the Nile leaves a layer of fertilizing silt three hundredths of an inch thick over the flood plain of Egypt. @# Flood plains may consist of a thin spread of alluvium over the flat rock floor of a valley which is being widened by the lateral erosion of a graded stream ( Fig. 60 ) . Flood-plain deposits of great thickness may be built by aggrading rivers even in valleys whose rock floors have never been thus widened. @# A cross section of a flood plain shows that it is highest next the river , sloping gradually thence to the valley sides . These wide natural embankments are due to the fact that the river deposit is heavier near the bank , where the velocity of the silt-laden channel current is first checked by contact with the slower-moving overflow. @# Thus banked off from the stream , the outer portions of a flood plain are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as peat , may be interbedded with river silts. @# A map of a wide flood plain , such as that of the Mississippi or the Missouri ( Fig. 77 ) , shows that the courses of the tributaries on entering it are deflected downstream . Why ? @# The aggrading streams by which flood plains are constructed gradually build their immediate banks and beds to higher and higher levels , and therefore find it easy at times of great floods to break their natural embankments and take new courses over the plain . In this way they aggrade each portion of it in turn by means of their shifting channels , @# BRAIDED CHANNELS . A river actively engaged in aggrading its valley with coarse waste builds a flood plain of comparatively steep gradient and often flows down it in a fairly direct course and through a network of braided channels . From time to time a channel becomes choked with waste , and the water no longer finding room in it breaks out and cuts and builds itself a new way which reunites down valley with the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ channels inclosing low islands of sand and gravel. @# TERRACES . While aggrading streams thus tend to shift their channels , degrading streams , on the contrary , become more and more deeply intrenched in their valleys . It often occurs that a stream , after having built a flood plain , ceases to aggrade its bed because of a lessened load or for other reasons , such as an uplift of the region , and begins instead to degrade it . It leaves the original flood plain out of reach of even the highest floods . When again it reaches grade at a lower level it produces a new flood plain by lateral erosion in the older deposits , remnants of which stand as terraces on one or both sides of the valley . In this way a valley may be lined with a succession of terraces at different levels , each level representing an abandoned flood plain. @# MEANDERS . Valleys aggraded with fine waste form well-nigh level plains over which streams wind from side to side of a direct course in symmetric bends known as meanders , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The giant Mississippi has developed meanders with a radius of one and one half miles , but a little creek may display on its meadow as perfect curves only a rod or so in radius . On the flood plain of either river or creek we may find examples of the successive stages in the development of the meander , from its beginning in the slight initial bend sufficient to deflect the current against the outer side . Eroding here and depositing on the inner side of the bend , it gradually reaches first the open bend whose width and length are not far from equal , and later that of the horseshoe meander whose diameter transverse to the course of the stream is much greater than that parallel with it . Little by little the neck of land projecting into the bend is narrowed , until at last it is cut through and a " cut-off " is established . The old channel is now silted up at both ends and becomes a crescentic lagoon , or oxbow lake , which fills gradually to an arc-shaped shallow depression. @# FLOOD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stream planes a flat floor for its continually widening valley . Ever cutting on the outer bank of its curves , it deposits on the inner bank scroll-like flood-plain patches . For a while the valley bluffs do not give its growing meanders room to develop to their normal size , but as planation goes on , the bluffs are driven back to the full width of the meander belt and still later to a width which gives room for broad stretches of flood plain on either side. @# Usually a river first attains grade near its mouth , and here first sinks its bed to near baselevel . Extending its graded course upstream by cutting away barrier headwaters are still busily eroding their beds . Its ungraded branches may thus bring down to its lower course more waste than it is competent to carry on to the sea , and here it aggrades its bed and builds a flood plain in order to gain a steeper gradient and velocity enough to transport its load. @# As maturity is past and the relief of the land is lessened , a smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It now has energy to spare and again degrades its valley , excavating its former flood plains and leaving them in terraces on either side , and at last in its old age sweeping them away. @# ALLUVIAL CONES AND FANS . In hilly and mountainous countries one often sees on a valley side a conical or fan-shaped deposit of waste at the mouth of a lateral stream . The cause is obvious : the young branch has not been able as yet to wear its bed to accordant level with the already deepened valley of the master stream . It therefore builds its bed to grade at the point of juncture by depositing here its load of waste ,  --  a load too heavy to be carried along the more gentle profile of the trunk valley. @# Where rivers descend from a mountainous region upon the plain they may build alluvial fans of exceedingly gentle slope . Thus the rivers of the western side of the Sierra Nevada Mountains have spread fans with a radius of as much as forty miles and a slope too slight to be detected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mountains and descend upon the broad central valley of California. @# As a river flows over its fan it commonly divides into a branchwork of shifting channels called DISTRIBUTARIES , since they lead off the water from the main stream . In this way each part of the fan is aggraded and its symmetric form is preserved. @# PIEDMONT PLAINS . Mountain streams may build their confluent fans into widespread piedmont ( foot of the mountain ) alluvial plains . These are especially characteristic of arid lands , where the streams wither as they flow out upon the thirsty lowlands and are therefore compelled to lay down a large portion of their load . In humid climates mountain-born streams are usually competent to carry their loads of waste on to the sea , and have energy to spare to cut the lower mountain slopes into foothills . In arid regions foothills are commonly absent and the ranges rise , as from pedestals , above broad , sloping plains of stream-laid waste. @# THE HIGH PLAINS . The rivers which flow eastward from the Rocky Mountains have united their fans in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ base of the mountains for hundreds of miles and in places is five hundred feet thick ( Fig. 80 ) . That the deposit was made in ancient times on land and not in the sea is proved by the remains which it contains of land animals and plants of species now extinct . That it was laid by rivers and not by fresh-water lakes is shown by its structure . Wide stretches of flat-lying , clays and sands are interrupted by long , narrow belts of gravel which mark the channels of the ancient streams . Gravels , and sands are often cross bedded , and their well worn pebbles may be identified with the rocks of the mountains . After building this sheet of waste the streams ceased to aggrade and began the work of destruction . Large uneroded remnants , their surfaces flat as a floor , remain as the High Plains of western Kansas and Nebraska. @# RIVER DEPOSITS IN SUBSIDING TROUGHS . To a geologist the most important river deposits are those which gather in areas of gradual subsidence ; they are often of vast extent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ages have not infrequently been preserved , with all their records of the times in which they were built , by being carried below the level of the sea , to be brought to light by a later uplift . On the other hand , river deposits which remain above baselevels of erosion are swept away comparatively soon. @# THE GREAT VALLEY OF CALIFORNIA is a monotonously level plain of great fertility , four hundred miles in length and fifty miles in average width , built of waste swept down by streams from the mountain ranges which inclose it ,  --  the Sierra Nevada on the east and the Coast Range on the west . On the waste slopes at the foot of the bordering hills coarse gravels and even bowlders are left , while over the interior the slow-flowing streams at times of flood spread wide sheets of silt . Organic deposits are now forming by the decay of vegetation in swampy tule ( reed ) lands and in shallow lakes which occupy depressions left by the aggrading streams. @# Deep borings show that this great trough is filled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level with recent unconsolidated sands and silts containing logs of wood and fresh- water shells . These are land deposits , and the absence of any marine deposits among them proves that the region has not been invaded by the sea since the accumulation began . It has therefore been slowly subsiding and its streams , although continually carried below grade , have yet been able to aggrade the surface as rapidly as the region sank , and have maintained it , as at present , slightly above sea level. @# THE INDO-GANGETIC PLAIN , spread by the Brahmaputra , the Ganges , and the Indus river systems , stretches for sixteen hundred miles along the southern base of the Himalaya Mountains and occupies an area of three hundred thousand square miles ( Fig. 342 ) . It consists of the flood plains of the master streams and the confluent fans of the tributaries which issue from the mountains on the north . Large areas are subject to overflow each season of flood , and still larger tracts mark abandoned flood plains below which the rivers have now cut their beds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clay , penetrated by streaks of sand , and also of gravel near the mountains . Beds of impure peat occur in it , and it contains fresh-water shells and the bones of land animals of species now living in northern India . At Lucknow an artesian well was sunk to one thousand feet below sea level without reaching the bottom of these river-laid sands and silts , proving a slow subsidence with which the aggrading rivers have kept pace. @# WARPED VALLEYS . It is not necessary that an area should sink below sea level in order to be filled with stream-swept waste . High valleys among growing mountain ranges may suffer warping , or may be blockaded by rising mountain folds athwart them . Where the deformation is rapid enough , the river may be ponded and the valley filled with lake-laid sediments . Even when the river is able to maintain its right of way it may yet have its declivity so lessened that it is compelled to aggrade its course continually , filling the valley with river deposits which may grow to an enormous thickness. @# Behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valleys , the largest of which are Kashmir and Nepal , the former being an alluvial plain about as large as the state of Delaware . The rivers which drain these plains have already cut down their outlet gorges sufficiently to begin the task of the removal of the broad accumulations which they have brought in from the surrounding mountains . Their present flood plains lie as much as some hundreds of feet below wide alluvial terraces which mark their former levels . Indeed , the horizontal beds of the Hundes Valley have been trenched to the depth of nearly three thousand feet by the Sutlej River . These deposits are recent or subrecent , for there have been found at various levels the remains of land plants and land and fresh-water shells , and in some the bones of such animals as the hyena and the goat , of species or of genera now living . Such soft deposits can not be expected to endure through any considerable length of future time the rapid erosion to which their great height above the level of the sea will subject them. @# @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly the characteristic features of extensive river deposits . These deposits consist of broad , flat-lying sheets of clay and fine sand left by the overflow at time of flood , and traversed here and there by long , narrow strips of coarse , cross-bedded sands and gravels thrown down by the swifter currents of the shifting channels . Occasional beds of muck mark the sites of shallow lakelets or fresh-water swamps . The various strata also contain some remains of the countless myriads of animals and plants which live upon the surface of the plain as it is in process of building . River shells such as the mussel , land shells such as those of snails , the bones of fishes and of such land animals as suffer drowning at times of flood or are mired in swampy places , logs of wood , and the stems and leaves of plants are examples of the variety of the remains of land and fresh-water organisms which are entombed in river deposits and sealed away as a record of the life of the time , and as proof that the deposits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BASIN DEPOSITS @# DEPOSITS IN DRY BASINS . On desert areas without outlet to the sea , as on the Great Basin of the United States and the deserts of central Asia , stream-swept waste accumulates indefinitely . The rivers of the surrounding mountains , fed by the rains and melting snows of these comparatively moist elevations , dry and soak away as they come down upon the arid plains . They are compelled to lay aside their entire load of waste eroded from the mountain valleys , in fans which grow to enormous size , reaching in some instances thousands of feet in thickness. @# The monotonous levels of Turkestan include vast alluvial tracts now in process of building by the floods of the frequently shifting channels of the Oxus and other rivers of the region . For about seven hundred miles from its mouth in Aral Lake the Oxus receives no tributaries , since even the larger branches of its system are lost in a network of distributaries and choked with desert sands before they reach their master stream . These aggrading rivers , which have channels but no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case of the Oxus sometimes equal the average volume of the Mississippi  --  far and wide over the plain , washing the bases of the desert dunes. @# PLAYAS . In arid interior basins the central depressions may be occupied by playas ,  --  plains of fine mud washed forward from the margins . In the wet season the playa is covered with a thin sheet of muddy water , a playa lake , supplied usually by some stream at flood . In the dry season the lake evaporates , the river which fed it retreats , and there is left to view a hard , smooth , level floor of sun-baked and sun-cracked yellow clay utterly devoid of vegetation. @# In the Black Rock desert of Nevada a playa lake spreads over an area fifty miles long and twenty miles wide . In summer it disappears ; the Quinn River , which feeds it , shrinks back one hundred miles toward its source , leaving an absolutely barren floor of clay , level as the sea. @# LAKE DEPOSITS . Regarding lakes as parts of river systems , we may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basins . Soundings in lakes of considerable size and depth show that their bottoms are being covered with tine clays . Sand and gravel are found along ; their margins , being brought in by streams and worn by waves from the shore , but there are no tidal or other strong currents to sweep coarse waste out from shore to any considerable distance . Where fine clays are now found on the land in even , horizontal layers containing the remains of fresh-water animals and plants , uncut by channels tilled with cross-bedded gravels and sands and bordered by beach deposits of coarse waste , we may safely infer the existence of ancient lakes. @# MARL . Marl is a soft , whitish deposit of carbonate of lime , mingled often with more or less of clay , accumulated in small lakes whose feeding springs are charged with carbonate of lime and into which little waste is washed from the land . Such lakelets are not infrequent on the surface of the younger drift sheets of Michigan and northern Indiana , where their beds of marl  --  sometimes as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Portland cement . The deposit results from the decay of certain aquatic plants which secrete lime carbonate from the water , from the decomposition of the calcareous shells of tiny mollusks which live in countless numbers on the lake floor , and in some cases apparently from chemical precipitation. @# PEAT . We have seen how lakelets are extinguished by the decaying remains of the vegetation which they support . A section of such a fossil lake shows that below the growing mosses and other plants of the surface of the bog lies a spongy mass composed of dead vegetable tissue , which passes downward gradually into PEAT ,  --  a dense , dark brown carbonaceous deposit in which , to the unaided eye , little or no trace of vegetable structure remains . When dried , peat forms a fuel of some value and is used either cut into slabs and dried or pressed into bricks by machinery. @# When vegetation decays in open air the carbon of its tissues , taken from the atmosphere by the leaves , is oxidized and returned to it in its original form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water , as in a bog , where the oxygen of the air is excluded , the carbonaceous matter of plants accumulates in deposits of peat. @# Peat bogs are numerous in regions lately abandoned by glacier ice , where river systems are so immature that the initial depressions left in the sheet of drift spread over the country have not yet been drained . One tenth of the surface of Ireland is said to be covered with peat , and small bogs abound in the drift-covered area of New England and the states lying as far west as the Missouri River . In Massachusetts alone it has been reckoned that there are fifteen billion cubic feet of peat , the largest bog occupying several thousand acres. @# Much larger swamps occur on the young coastal plain of the Atlantic from New Jersey to Florida . The Dismal Swamp , for example , in Virginia and North Carolina is forty miles across . It is covered with a dense growth of water-loving trees such as the cypress and black gum . The center of the swamp is occupied by Lake Drummond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banks of pure-peat , and still narrowing from the encroachment of vegetation along its borders. @# SALT LAKES . In arid climates a lake rarely receives sufficient inflow to enable it to rise to the basin rim and find an outlet . Before this height is reached its surface becomes large enough to discharge by evaporation into the dry air the amount of water that is supplied by streams . As such a lake has no outlet , the minerals in solution brought into it by its streams can not escape from the basin . The lake water becomes more and more heavily charged with such substances as common salt and the sulphates and carbonates of lime , of soda , and of potash , and these are thrown down from solution one after another as the point of saturation for each mineral is reached . Carbonate of lime , the least soluble and often the most abundant mineral brought in , is the first to be precipitated . As concentration goes on , gypsum , which is insoluble in a strong brine , is deposited , and afterwards common salt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seasons and with climatic changes , gypsum and salt are laid in alternate beds and are interleaved with sedimentary clays spread from the waste brought in by streams at times of flood . Few forms of life can live in bodies of salt water so concentrated that chemical deposits take place , and hence the beds of salt , gypsum , and silt of such lakes are quite barren of the remains of life . Similar deposits are precipitated by the concentration of sea water in lagoons and arms of the sea cut off from the ocean. @# LAKES BONNEVILLE AND LAHONTAN . These names are given to extinct lakes which once occupied large areas in the Great Basin , the former in Utah , the latter in northwestern Nevada . Their records remain in old horizontal beach lines which they drew along their mountainous shores at the different levels at which they stood , and in the deposits of their beds . At its highest stage Lake Bonneville , then one thousand feet deep , overflowed to the north and was a fresh-water lake . As it shrank below the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Great Salt Lake , its withered residue , is now depositing salt along its shores . In its strong brine lime carbonate is insoluble , and that brought in by streams is thrown down at once in the form of travertine. @# Lake Lahontan never had an outlet . The first chemical deposits to be made along its shores were deposits of travertine , in places eighty feet thick . Its floor is spread with fine clays , which must have been laid in deep , still water , and which are charged with the salts absorbed by them as the briny water of the lake dried away . These sedimentary clays are in two divisions , the upper and lower , each being about one hundred feet thick . They are separated by heavy deposits of well-rounded , cross-bedded gravels and sands , similar to those spread at the present time by the intermittent streams of arid regions . A similar record is shown in the old floors of Lake Bonneville . What conclusions do you draw from these facts as to the history of these ancient lakes ? @# @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea level particles of waste are allowed to linger only for a time . From alluvial fans and flood plains they are constantly being taken up and swept farther on downstream . Although these land forms may long persist , the particles which compose them are ever changing . We may therefore think of the alluvial deposits of a valley as a stream of waste fed by the waste mantle as it creeps and washes down the valley sides , and slowly moving onwards to the sea. @# In basins waste finds a longer rest , but sooner or later lakes and dry basins are drained or filled , and their deposits , if above sea level , resume their journey to their final goal . It is only when carried below the level of the sea that they are indefinitely preserved. @# On reaching this terminus , rivers deliver their load to the ocean . In some cases the ocean is able to take it up by means of strong tidal and other currents , and to dispose of it in ways which we shall study later . But often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so weak , that much of the waste which the river brings in settles at its mouth , there building up a deposit called the DELTA , from the Greek letter of that name , whose shape it sometimes resembles. @# Deltas and alluvial fans have many common characteristics . Both owe their origin to a sudden check in the velocity of the river , compelling a deposit of the load ; both are triangular in outline , the apex pointing upstream ; and both are traversed by distributaries which build up all parts in turn. @# In a delta we may distinguish deposits of two distinct kinds ,  --  the submarine and the subaerial . In part a delta is built of waste brought down by the river and redistributed and spread by waves and tides over the sea bottom adjacent to the river ' s mouth . The origin of these deposits is recorded in the remains of marine animals and plants which they contain. @# As the submarine delta grows near to the level of the sea the distributaries of the river cover it with subaerial deposits altogether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed the subaerial delta is the prolongation . Here extended deposits of peat may accumulate in swamps , and the remains of land and fresh- water animals and plants swept down by the stream are imbedded in the silts laid at times of flood. @# Borings made in the deltas of great rivers such as the Mississippi , the Ganges , and the Nile , show that the subaerial portion often reaches a surprising thickness . Layers of peat , old soils , and forest grounds with the stumps of trees are discovered hundreds of feet below sea level . In the Nile delta some eight layers of coarse gravel were found interbedded with river silts , and in the Ganges delta at Calcutta a boring nearly five hundred feet in depth stopped in such a layer. @# The Mississippi has built a delta of twelve thousand three hundred square miles , and is pushing the natural embankments of its chief distributaries into the Gulf at a maximum rate of a mile in sixteen years . Muddy shoals surround its front , shallow lakes , e. g. lakes Pontchartrain and Borgne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shore line , and elongate lakes and swamps are inclosed between the natural embankments of the distributaries. @# The delta of the Indus River , India , lies so low along shore that a broad tract of country is overflowed by the highest tides . The submarine portion of the delta has been built to near sea level over so wide a belt offshore that in many places large vessels can not come even within sight of land because of the shallow water. @# A former arm of the sea , the Rann of Cutch , adjoining the delta on the east has been silted up and is now an immense barren flat of sandy mud two hundred miles in length and one hundred miles in greatest breadth . Each summer it is flooded with salt water when the sea is brought in by strong southwesterly monsoon winds , and the climate during the remainder of the year is hot and dry . By the evaporation of sea water the soil is thus left so salty that no vegetation can grow upon it , and in places beds of salt several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beds of great thickness have been formed in the past and are now found buried among the deposits of ancient deltas. @# SUBSIDENCE OF GREAT DELTAS . As a rule great deltas are slowly sinking . In some instances upbuilding by river deposits has gone on as rapidly as the region has subsided . The entire thickness of the Ganges delta , for example , so far as it has been sounded , consists of deposits laid in open air . In other cases interbedded limestones and other sedimentary rocks containing marine fossils prove that at times subsidence has gained on the upbuilding and the delta has been covered with the sea. @# It is by gradual depression that delta deposits attain enormous thickness , and , being lowered beneath the level of the sea , are safely preserved from erosion until a movement of the earth ' s crust in the opposite direction lifts them to form part of the land . We shall read later in the hard rocks of our continent the records of such ancient deltas , and we shall not be surprised to find them as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great rivers. @# LAKE DELTAS . Deltas are also formed where streams lose their velocity on entering the still waters of lakes . The shore lines of extinct lakes , such as Lake Agassiz and Lakes Bonneville and Lahontan , may be traced by the heavy deposits at the mouths of their tributary streams. @# We have seen that the work of streams is to drain the lands of the water poured upon them by the rainfall , to wear them down , and to carry their waste away to the sea , there to be rebuilt by other agents into sedimentary rocks . The ancient strata of which the continents are largely made are composed chiefly of material thus worn from still more ancient lands  --  lands with their hills and valleys like those of to-day  --  and carried by their rivers to the ocean . In all geological times , as at the present , the work of streams has been to destroy the lands , and in so doing to furnish to the ocean the materials from which the lands of future ages were to be made . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in by streams is rebuilt upon the ocean floor , we must proceed to study the work of two agents , glacier ice and the wind , which cooperate with rivers in the denudation of the land. @# @# @# CHAPTER V @# THE WORK OF GLACIERS @# THE DRIFT . The surface of northeastern North America , as far south as the Ohio and Missouri rivers , is generally covered by the drift ,  --  a formation which is quite unlike any which we have so far studied . A section of it , such as that illustrated in Figure 87 , shows that for the most part it is unstratified , consisting of clay , sand , pebbles , and even large bowlders , all mingled pell- mell together . The agent which laid the drift is one which can carry a load of material of all sizes , from the largest bowlder to the finest clay , and deposit it without sorting. @# The stones of the drift are of many kinds . The region from which it was gathered may well have been large in order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bowlders have been left far from their original homes , as may be seen in southern Iowa , where the drift contains nuggets of copper brought from the region about Lake Superior . The agent which laid the drift is one able to gather its load over a large area and carry it a long way. @# The pebbles of the drift are unlike those rounded by running water or by waves . They are marked with scratches . Some are angular , many have had their edges blunted , while others have been ground flat and smooth on one or more sides , like gems which have been faceted by being held firmly against the lapidary ' s wheel . In many places the upper surface of the country rock beneath the drift has been swept clean of residual clays and other waste . All rock rotten has been planed away , and the ledges of sound rock to which the surface has been cut down have been rubbed smooth and scratched with long , straight , parallel lines . The agent which laid the drift can hold sand and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rock beneath , thus planing it down and scoring it , while faceting the pebbles also. @# Neither water nor wind can do these things . Indeed , nothing like the drift is being formed by any process now at work anywhere in the eastern United States . To find the agent which has laid this extensive formation we must go to a region of different climatic conditions. @# THE INLAND ICE OF GREENLAND . Greenland is about fifteen hundred miles long and nearly seven hundred miles in greatest width . With the exception of a narrow fringe of mountainous coast land , it is completely buried beneath a sheet of ice , in shape like a vast white shield , whose convex surface rises to a height of nine thousand feet above the sea . The few explorers who have crossed the ice cap found it a trackless desert destitute of all life save such lowly forms as the microscopic plant which produces the so- called " red snow . " On the smooth plain of the interior no rock waste relieves the snow ' s dazzling whiteness ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is broken only by howling storm winds and the rustle of the surface snow which they drive before them . Sounding with long poles , explorers find that below the powdery snow of the latest snowfall lie successive layers of earlier snows , which grow more and more compact downward , and at last have altered to impenetrable ice . The ice cap formed by the accumulated snows of uncounted centuries may well be more than a mile in depth . Ice thus formed by the compacting of snow is distinguished when in motion as GLACIER ICE. @# The inland ice of Greenland moves . It flows with imperceptible slowness under its own weight , like , a mass of some viscous or plastic substance , such as pitch or molasses candy , in all directions outward toward the sea . Near the edge it has so thinned that mountain peaks are laid bare , these islands in the sea of ice being known as NUNATAKS . Down the valleys of the coastal belt it drains in separate streams of ice , or GLACIERS . The largest of these reach the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called TIDE GLACIERS . Their fronts stand so deep in sea water that there is visible seldom more than three hundred feet of the wall of ice , which in many glaciers must be two thousand and more feet high . From the sea walls of tide glaciers great fragments break off and float away as icebergs . Thus snows which fell in the interior of this northern land , perhaps many thousands of years ago , are carried in the form of icebergs to melt at last in the North Atlantic. @# Greenland , then , is being modeled over the vast extent of its interior not by streams of running water , as are regions in warm and humid climates , nor by currents of air , as are deserts to a large extent , but by a sheet of flowing ice . What the ice sheet is doing in the interior we may infer from a study of the separate glaciers into which it breaks at its edge. @# THE SMALLER GREENLAND GLACIERS . Many of the smaller glaciers of Greenland do not reach the sea , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these ice tongues are often as abrupt as if sliced away with a knife ( Fig. 92 ) , and their structure is thus readily seen . They are stratified , their layers representing in part the successive snowfalls of the interior of the country . The upper layers are commonly white and free from stones ; but the lower layers , to the height of a hundred feet or more , are dark with debris which is being slowly carried on . So thickly studded with stones is the base of the ice that it is sometimes difficult to distinguish it from the rock waste which has been slowly dragged beneath the glacier or left about its edges . The waste beneath and about the glacier is unsorted . The stones are of many kinds , and numbers of them have been ground to flat faces . Where the front of the ice has retreated the rock surface is seen to be planed and scored in places by the stones frozen fast in the sole of the glacier. @# We have now found in glacier ice an agent able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheet of Greenland is now doing what we have seen was done in the recent past in our own land . It is carrying for long distances rocks of many kinds gathered , we may infer , over a large extent of country . It is laying down its load without assortment in unstratified deposits . It grinds down and scores the rock over which it moves , and in the process many of the pebbles of its load are themselves also ground smooth and scratched . Since this work can be done by no other agent , we must conclude that the northeastern part of our own continent was covered in the recent past by glacier ice , as Greenland is to-day. @# VALLEY GLACIERS @# The work of glacier ice can be most conveniently studied in the separate ice streams which creep down mountain valleys in many regions such as Alaska , the western mountains of the United States and Canada , the Himalayas , and the Alps . As the glaciers of the Alps have been studied longer and more thoroughly than any others , we shall describe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all parts of the world. @# CONDITIONS OF GLACIER FORMATION . The condition of the great accumulation of snow to which glaciers are due  --  that more or less of each winter ' s snow should be left over unmelted and unevaporated to the next  --  is fully met in the Alps . There is abundant moisture brought by the winds from neighboring seas . The currents of moist air driven up the mountain slopes are cooled by their own expansion as they rise , and the moisture which they contain is condensed at a temperature at or below 32 degrees F. , and therefore is precipitated in the form of snow . The summers are cool and their heat does not suffice to completely melt the heavy snow of the preceding winter . On the Alps the SNOW LINE  --  the lower limit of permanent snow  --  is drawn at about eight thousand five hundred feet above sea level . Above the snow line on the slopes and crests , where these are not too steep , the snow lies the year round and gathers in valley heads to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small fraction of the thickness to which snow would be piled on the Alps were it not constantly being drained away . Below the snow fields which mantle the heights the mountain valleys are occupied by glaciers which extend as much as a vertical mile below the snow line . The presence in the midst of forests and meadows and cultivated fields of these tongues of ice , ever melting and yet from year to year losing none of their bulk , proves that their loss is made good in the only possible way . They are fed by snow fields above , whose surplus of snow they drain away in the form of ice . The presence of glaciers below the snow line is a clear proof that , rigid and motionless as they appear , glaciers really are in constant motion down valley. @# THE NEVE FIELD . The head of an Alpine valley occupied by a glacier is commonly a broad amphitheater deeply filled with snow . Great peaks tower above it , and snowy slopes rise on either side on the flanks of mountain spurs . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and avalanches pour in their torrents of snow and waste . The snow of the amphitheater is like that of drifts in late winter after many successive thaws and freezings . It is made of hard grains and pellets and is called NEVE . Beneath the surface of the neve field and at its outlet the granular neve has been compacted to a mass of porous crystalline ice . Snow has been changed to neve , and neve to glacial ice , both by pressure , which drives the air from the interspaces of the snowflakes , and also by successive meltings and freezings , much as a snowball is packed in the warm hand and becomes frozen to a ball of ice. @# THE BERGSCHRUND . The neve is in slow motion . It breaks itself loose from the thinner snows about it , too shallow to share its motion , and from the rock rim which surrounds it , forming a deep fissure called the bergschrund , sometimes a score and more feet wide. @# SIZE OF GLACIERS . The ice streams of the Alps vary in size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the neve fields which they drain . The largest of Alpine glaciers , the Aletsch , is nearly ten miles long and has an average width of about a mile . The thickness of some of the glaciers of the Alps is as much as a thousand feet . Giant glaciers more than twice the length of the longest in the Alps occur on the south slope of the Himalaya Mountains , which receive frequent precipitations of snow from moist winds from the Indian Ocean . The best known of the many immense glaciers of Alaska , the Muir , has an area of about eight hundred square miles ( Fig. 95 ) . @# GLACIER MOTION . The motion of the glaciers of the Alps seldom exceeds one or two feet a day . Large glaciers , because of the enormous pressure of their weight and because of less marginal resistance , move faster than small ones . The Muir advances at the rate of seven feet a day , and some of the larger tide glaciers of Greenland are reported to move at the exceptional rate of fifty feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by day than by night , and in summer than in winter . Other laws of glacier motion may be discovered by a study of Figures 96 and 97 . It is important to remember that glaciers do not slide bodily over their beds , but urged by gravity move slowly down valley in somewhat the same way as would a stream of thick mud . Although small pieces of ice are brittle , the large mass of granular ice which composes a glacier acts as a viscous substance. @# CREVASSES . Slight changes of slope in the glacier bed , and the different rates of motion in different parts , produce tensions under which the ice cracks and opens in great fissures called crevasses . At an abrupt descent in the bed the ice is shattered into great fragments , which unite again below the icefall . Crevasses are opened on lines at right angles to the direction of the tension . TRANSVERSE CREVASSES are due to a convexity in the bed which stretches the ice lengthwise ( Fig. 99 ) . MARGINAL CREVASSES are directed upstream and inwards ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some narrow valley and spreads upon some more open space . What is the direction of the tension which causes each and to what is it due ? @# LATERAL AND MEDIAL MORAINES . The surface of a glacier is striped lengthwise by long dark bands of rock debris . Those in the center are called the medial moraines . The one on either margin is a lateral moraine , and is clearly formed of waste which has fallen on the edge of the ice from the valley slopes . A medial moraine can not be formed in this way , since no rock fragments can fall so far out from the sides . But following it up the glacial stream , one finds that a medial moraine takes its beginning at the junction of the glacier and some tributary and is formed by the union of their two adjacent lateral moraines . Each branch thus adds a medial moraine , and by counting the number of medial moraines of a trunk stream one may learn of how many branches it is composed. @# Surface moraines appear in the lower course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exceptional height of one hundred feet . The bulk of such a ridge is ice . It has been protected from the sun by the veneer of moraine stuff ; while the glacier surface on either side has melted down at least the distance of the height of the ridge . In summer the lowering of the glacial surface by melting goes on rapidly . In Swiss glaciers it has been estimated that the average lowering of the surface by melting and evaporation amounts to ten feet a year . As a moraine ridge grows higher and more steep by the lowering of the surface of the surrounding ice , the stones of its cover tend to slip down its sides . Thus moraines broaden , until near the terminus of a glacier they may coalesce in a wide field of stony waste. @# ENGLACIAL DRIFT . This name is applied to whatever debris is carried within the glacier . It consists of rock waste fallen on the neve and there buried by accumulations of snow , and of that engulfed in the glacier where crevasses have opened beneath a surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by melting , more or less englacial drift is brought again to open air , and near the terminus it may help to bury the ice from view beneath a sheet of debris. @# THE GROUND MORAINE . The drift dragged along at the glacier ' s base and lodged beneath it is known as the ground moraine . Part of the material of it has fallen down deep crevasses and part has been torn and worn from the glacier ' s bed and banks . While the stones of the surface moraines remain as angular as when they lodged on the ice , many of those of the ground moraine have been blunted on the edges and faceted and scratched by being ground against one another and the rocky bed. @# In glaciers such as those of Greenland , whose basal layers are well loaded with drift and whose surface layers are nearly clean , different layers have different rates of motion , according to the amount of drift with which they are clogged . One layer glides over another , and the stones inset in each are ground and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are more worn than the ends , and the scratches upon them run with the longer axis of the stone . Why ? @# THE TERMINAL MORAINE . As a glacier is in constant motion , it brings to its end all of its load except such parts of the ground moraine as may find permanent lodgment beneath the ice . Where the glacier front remains for some time at one place , there is formed an accumulation of drift known as the terminal moraine . In valley glaciers it is shaped by the ice front to a crescent whose convex side is downstream . Some of the pebbles of the terminal moraine are angular , and some are faceted and scored , the latter having come by the hard road of the ground moraine . The material of the dump is for the most part unsorted , though the water of the melting ice may find opportunity to leave patches of stratified sands and gravels in the midst of the unstratified mass of drift , and the finer material is in places washed away. @# GLACIER DRAINAGE . The terminal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issues from beneath the ice by a tunnel whose portal has been enlarged to a beautiful archway by melting in the sun and the warm air ( Fig. 107 ) . The stream is gray with silt and loaded with sand and gravel washed from the ground moraine . " Glacier milk " the Swiss call this muddy water , the gray color of whose silt proves it rock flour freshly ground by the ice from the unoxidized sound rock of its bed , the mud of streams being yellowish when it is washed from the oxidized mantle of waste . Since glacial streams are well loaded with waste due to vigorous ice erosion , the valley in front of the glacier is commonly aggraded to a broad , flat floor . These outwash deposits are known as VALLEY DRIFT. @# The sand brought out by streams from beneath a glacier differs from river sand in that it consists of freshly broken angular grains . Why ? @# The stream derives its water chiefly from the surface melting of the glacier . As the ice is touched by the rays of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and rills trickle and unite in brooklets which melt and cut shallow channels in the blue ice . The course of these streams is short . Soon they plunge into deep wells cut by their whirling waters where some crevasse has begun to open across their path . These wells lead into chambers and tunnels by which sooner or later their waters find way to the rock floor of the valley and there unite in a subglacial stream. @# THE LOWER LIMIT OF GLACIERS . The glaciers of a region do not by any means end at a uniform height above sea level . Each terminates where its supply is balanced by melting . Those therefore which are fed by the largest and deepest neves and those also which are best protected from the sun by a northward exposure or by the depth of their inclosing valleys flow to lower levels than those whose supply is less and whose exposure to the sun is greater. @# A series of cold , moist years , with an abundant snowfall , causes glaciers to thicken and advance ; a series of warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The variation in glaciers is now carefully observed in many parts of the world . The Muir glacier has retreated two miles in twenty years . The glaciers of the Swiss Alps are now for the most part melting back , although a well-known glacier of the eastern Alps , the Vernagt , advanced five hundred feet in the year 1900 , and was then plowing up its terminal moraine. @# How soon would you expect a glacier to advance after its neve fields have been swollen with unusually heavy snows , as compared with the time needed for the flood of a large river to reach its mouth after heavy rains upon its headwaters ? @# On the surface of glaciers in summer time one may often see large stones supported by pillars of ice several feet in height ( Fig. 108 ) . These " glacier tables " commonly slope more or less strongly to the south , and thus may be used to indicate roughly the points of the compass . Can you explain their formation and the direction of their slope ? On the other hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dust , lying on the ice , tends to sink a few inches into it . Why ? @# In what respects is a valley glacier like a mountain stream which flows out upon desert plains ? @# Two confluent glaciers do not mingle their currents as do two confluent rivers . What characteristics of surface moraines prove this fact ? @# What effect would you expect the laws of glacier motion to have on the slant of the sides of transverse crevasses ? @# A trunk glacier has four medial moraines . Of how many tributaries is it composed ? Illustrate by diagram. @# State all the evidences which you have found that glaciers move. @# If a glacier melts back with occasional pauses up a valley , what records are left of its retreat ? @# PIEDMONT GLACIERS @# THE MALASPINA GLACIER . Piedmont ( foot of the mountain ) glaciers are , as the name implies , ice fields formed at the foot of mountains by the confluence of valley glaciers . The Malaspina glacier of Alaska , the typical glacier of this kind , is seventy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Mount Saint Elias range to the shore of the Pacific Ocean . The valley glaciers which unite and spread to form this lake of ice lie above the snow line and their moraines are concealed beneath neve . The central area of the Malaspina is also free from debris ; but on the outer edge large quantities of englacial drift are exposed by surface melting and form a belt of morainic waste a few feet thick and several miles wide , covered in part with a luxuriant forest , beneath which the ice is in places one thousand feet in depth . The glacier here is practically stagnant , and lakes a few hundred yards across , which could not exist were the ice in motion and broken with crevasses , gather on their beds sorted waste from the moraine . The streams which drain the glacier have cut their courses in englacial and subglacial tunnels ; none flow for any distance on the surface . The largest , the Yahtse River , issues from a high archway in the ice ,  --  a muddy torrent one hundred feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stones which it deposits in a broad outwash plain ( Fig. 110 ) . Where the ice has retreated from the sea there is left a hummocky drift sheet with hollows filled with lakelets . These deposits help to explain similar hummocky regions of drift and similar plains of coarse , water-laid material often found in the drift-covered area of the northeastern United States. @# THE GEOLOGICAL WORK OF GLACIER ICE @# The sluggish glacier must do its work in a different way from the agile river . The mountain stream is swift and small , and its channel occupies but a small portion of the valley . The glacier is slow and big ; its rate of motion may be less than a millionth of that of running water over the same declivity , and its bulk is proportionately large and fills the valley to great depth . Moreover , glacier ice is a solid body plastic under slowly applied stresses , while the water of rivers is a nimble fluid. @# TRANSPORTATION . Valley glaciers differ from rivers as carriers in that they float the major part of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily as a grain of sand ; while streams push and roll much of their load along their beds , and their power of transporting waste depends solely upon their velocity . The amount of the surface load of glaciers is limited only by the amount of waste received from the mountain slopes above them . The moving floor of ice stretched high across a valley sweeps along as lateral moraines much of the waste which a mountain stream would let accumulate in talus and alluvial cones. @# While a valley glacier carries much of its load on top , an ice sheet , such as that of Greenland , is free from surface debris , except where moraines trail away from some nunatak . If at its edge it breaks into separate glaciers which drain down mountain valleys , these tongues of ice will carry the selvages of waste common to valley glaciers . Both ice sheets and valley glaciers drag on large quantities of rock waste in their ground moraines. @# Stones transported by glaciers are sometimes called erratics . Such are the bowlders of the drift of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insecure position on the melting of the ice. @# DEPOSIT . Little need be added here to what has already been said of ground and terminal moraines . All strictly glacial deposits are unstratified . The load laid down at the end of a glacier in the terminal moraine is loose in texture , while the drift lodged beneath the glacier as ground moraine is often an extremely dense , stony clay , having been compacted under the pressure of the overriding ice. @# EROSION . A glacier erodes its bed and banks in two ways ,  --  by abrasion and by plucking. @# The rock bed over which a glacier has moved is seen in places to have been abraded , or ground away , to smooth surfaces which are marked by long , straight , parallel scorings aligned with the line of movement of the ice and varying in size from hair lines and coarse scratches to exceptional furrows several feet deep . Clearly this work has been accomplished by means of the sharp sand , the pebbles , and the larger stones with which the base of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firm grasp as running water can not . Hard and fine-grained rocks , such as granite and quartzite , are often not only ground down to a smooth surface but are also highly polished by means of fine rock flour worn from the glacier bed. @# In other places the bed of the glacier is rough and torn . The rocks have been disrupted and their fragments have been carried away ,  --  a process known as PLUCKING . Moving under immense pressure the ice shatters the rock , breaks off projections , presses into crevices and wedges the rocks apart , dislodges the blocks into which the rock is divided by joints and bedding planes , and freezing fast to the fragments drags them on . In this work the freezing and thawing of subglacial waters in any cracks and crevices of the rock no doubt play an important part . Plucking occurs especially where the bed rock is weak because of close jointing . The product of plucking is bowlders , while the product of abrasion is fine rock flour and sand. @# Is the ground moraine of Figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ROCHES MOUTONNEES AND ROUNDED HILLS . The prominences left between the hollows due to plucking are commonly ground down and rounded on the stoss side ,  --  the side from which the ice advances ,  --  and sometimes on the opposite , the lee side , as well . In this way the bed rock often comes to have a billowy surface known as roches moutonnees ( sheep rocks ) . Hills overridden by an ice sheet often have similarly rounded contours on the stoss side , while on the lee side they may be craggy , either because of plucking or because here they have been less worn from their initial profile. @# THE DIRECTION OF GLACIER MOVEMENT . The direction of the flow of vanished glaciers and ice sheets is recorded both in the differences just mentioned in the profiles of overridden hills and also in the minute details of the glacier trail. @# Flint nodules or other small prominences in the bed rock are found more worn on the stoss than on the lee side , where indeed they may have a low cone of rock protected by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have their edges worn on the lee side and left sharp upon the stoss. @# Surfaces worn and torn in the ways which we have mentioned are said to be glaciated . But it must not be supposed that a glacier everywhere glaciates its bed . Although in places it acts as a rasp or as a pick , in others , and especially where its pressure is least , as near the terminus , it moves over its bed in the manner of a sled . Instances are known where glaciers have advanced over deposits of sand and gravel without disturbing them to any notable degree . Like a river , a glacier does not everywhere erode . In places it leaves its bed undisturbed and in places aggrades it by deposits of the ground moraine. @# CIRQUES . Valley glaciers commonly head as we have seen , in broad amphitheaters deeply filled with snow and ice . On mountains now destitute of glaciers , but whose glaciation shows that they have supported glaciers in the past , there are found similar crescentic hollows with high , precipitous walls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold lakelets whose deep and quiet waters reflect the sheltering ramparts of rugged rock which tower far above them . Such mountain hollows are termed CIRQUES . As a powerful spring wears back a recess in the valley side where it discharges , so the fountain head of a glacier gradually wears back a cirque . In its slow movement the neve field broadly scours its bed to a flat or basined floor . Meanwhile the sides of the valley head are steepened and driven back to precipitous walls . For in winter the crevasse of the bergschrund which surrounds the neve field is filled with snow and the neve is frozen fast to the rocky sides of the valley . In early summer the neve tears itself free , dislodging and removing any loosened blocks , and the open fissure of the bergschrund allows frost and other agencies of weathering to attack the unprotected rock . As cirques are thus formed and enlarged the peaks beneath which they lie are sharpened , and the mountain crests are scalloped and cut back from either side to knife-edged ridges. @# In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empty of neve and glacier ice , and known locally as " basins , " testify to the fact that in recent times the snow line stood beneath the levels of their floors , and thus far below its present altitude. @# GLACIER TROUGHS . The channel worn to accommodate the big and clumsy glacier differs markedly from the river valley cut as with a saw by the narrow and flexible stream and widened by the weather and the wash of rains . The valley glacier may easily be from one thousand to three thousand feet deep and from one to three miles wide . Such a ponderous bulk of slowly moving ice does not readily adapt itself to sharp turns and a narrow bed . By scouring and plucking all resisting edges it develops a fitting channel with a wide , flat floor , and steep , smooth sides , above which are seen the weathered slopes of stream-worn mountain valleys . Since the trunk glacier requires a deeper channel than do its branches , the bed of a branch glacier enters the main trough at some distance above the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two ice streams may be accordant . Glacier troughs can be studied best where large glaciers have recently melted completely away , as is the case in many valleys of the mountains of the western United States and of central and northern Europe ( Fig. 114 ) . The typical glacier trough , as shown in such examples , is U-shaped , with a broad , flat floor , and high , steep walls . Its walls are little broken by projecting spurs and lateral ravines . It is as if a V- valley cut by a river had afterwards been gouged deeper with a gigantic chisel , widening the floor to the width of the chisel blade , cutting back the spurs , and smoothing and steepening the sides . A river valley could only be as wide-floored as this after it had long been worn down to grade. @# The floor of a glacier trough may not be graded ; it is often interrupted by irregular steps perhaps hundreds and even a thousand feet in height , over which the stream that now drains the valley tumbles in waterfalls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may occupy hollows excavated in solid rock , and other lakes may be held behind terminal moraines left as dams across the valley at pauses in the retreat of the glacier. @# FJORDS are glacier troughs now occupied in part or wholly by the sea , either because they were excavated by a tide glacier to their present depth below sea level , or because of a submergence of the land . Their characteristic form is that of a long , deep , narrow bay with steep rock walls and basined floor . Fjords are found only in regions which have suffered glaciation , such as Norway and Alaska. @# HANGING VALLEYS . These are lateral valleys which open on their main valley some distance above its floor . They are conspicuous features of glacier troughs from which the ice has vanished ; for the trunk glacier in widening and deepening its channel cut its bed below the bottoms of the lateral valleys. @# Since the mouths of hanging valleys are suspended on the walls of the glacier trough , their streams are compelled to plunge down its steep , high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful waterfalls of the world leap from hanging valleys ,  --  among them the celebrated Staubbach of the Lauterbrunnen valley of Switzerland , and those of the fjords of Norway and Alaska. @# Hanging valleys are found also in river gorges where the smaller tributaries have not been able to keep pace with a strong master stream in cutting down their beds . In this case , however , they are a mark of extreme youth ; for , as the trunk stream approaches grade and its velocity and power to erode its bed decrease , the side streams soon cut back their falls and wear their beds at their mouths to a common level with that of the main river . The Grand Canyon of the Colorado must be reckoned a young valley . At its base it narrows to scarcely more than the width of the river , and yet its tributaries , except the very smallest , enter it at a common level. @# Why could not a wide-floored valley , such as a glacier trough , with hanging valleys opening upon it , be produced in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OF YOUNG AND OF MATURE GLACIERS . The features of a glacier trough depend much on the length of time the preexisting valley was occupied with ice . During the infancy of a glacier , we may believe , the spurs of the valley which it fills are but little blunted and its bed is but little broken by steps . In youth the glacier develops icefalls , as a river in youth develops waterfalls , and its bed becomes terraced with great stairs . The mature glacier , like the mature river , has effaced its falls and smoothed its bed to grade . It has also worn back the projecting spurs of its valley , making itself a wide channel with smooth sides . The bed of a mature glacier may form a long basin , since it abrades most in its upper and middle course , where its weight and motion are the greatest . Near the terminus , where weight and motion are the least , it erodes least , and may instead deposit a sheet of ground moraine , much as a river builds a flood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approaches maturity . The bed of a mature glacier thus tends to take the form of a long , relatively narrow basin , across whose lower end may be stretched the dam of the terminal moraine . On the disappearance of the ice the basin is rilled with a long , narrow lake , such as Lake Chelan in Washington and many of the lakes in the Highlands of Scotland. @# Piedmont glaciers apparently erode but little . Beneath their lake- like expanse of sluggish or stagnant ice a broad sheet of ground moraine is probably being deposited. @# Cirques and glaciated valleys rapidly lose their characteristic forms after the ice has withdrawn . The weather destroys all smoothed , polished , and scored surfaces which are not protected beneath glacial deposits . The oversteepened sides of the trough are graded by landslips , by talus slopes , and by alluvial cones . Morainic heaps of drift are dissected and carried away . Hanging valleys and the irregular bed of the trough are both worn down to grade by the streams which now occupy them . The length of time since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus be estimated by the degree to which the destruction of the characteristic features of the glacier trough has been carried. @# In Figure 104 what characteristics of a glacier trough do you notice ? What inference do you draw as to the former thickness of the glacier ? @# Name all the evidences you would expect to find to prove the fact that in the recent geological past the valleys of the Alps contained far larger glaciers than at present , and that on the north of the Alps the ice streams united in a piedmont glacier which extended across the plains of Switzerland to the sides of the Jura Mountains. @# THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF GLACIERS AND OF RIVERS . Powerful as glaciers are , and marked as are the land forms which they produce , it is easy to exaggerate their geological importance as compared with rivers . Under present climatic conditions they are confined to lofty mountains or polar lands . Polar ice sheets are permanent only so long as the lands remain on which they rest . Mountain glaciers can stay only the brief time during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountains , such as the Selkirks and the Alps , are lowered by frost and glacier ice , the snowfall will decrease , the line of permanent snow will rise , and as the mountain hollows in which snow may gather are worn beneath the snow line , the glaciers must disappear . Under present climatic conditions the work of glaciers is therefore both local and of short duration. @# Even the glacial epoch , during which vast ice sheets deposited drift over northeastern North America , must have been brief as well as recent , for many lofty mountains , such as the Rockies and the Alps , still bear the marks of great glaciers which then filled their valleys . Had the glacial epoch been long , as the earth counts time , these mountains would have been worn low by ice ; had the epoch been remote , the marks of glaciation would already have been largely destroyed by other agencies. @# On the other hand , rivers are well-nigh universally at work over the land surfaces of the globe , and ever since the dry land appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in delivering to the seas the waste which there is built into the stratified rocks. @# ICEBERGS . Tide glaciers , such as those of Greenland and Alaska , are able to excavate their beds to a considerable distance below sea level . From their fronts the buoyancy of sea water raises and breaks away great masses of ice which float out to sea as icebergs . Only about one seventh of a mass of glacier ice floats above the surface , and a berg three hundred feet high may be estimated to have been detached from a glacier not less than two thousand feet thick where it met the sea. @# Icebergs transport on their long journeys whatever drift they may have carried when part of the glacier , and scatter it , as they melt , over the ocean floor . In this way pebbles torn by the inland ice from the rocks of the interior of Greenland and glaciated during their carriage in the ground moraine are dropped at last among the oozes of the bottom of the North Atlantic. @# @# @# CHAPTER VI @# THE WORK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ geological work of the currents of the atmosphere , and to learn how they erode , and transport and deposit waste as they sweep over the land . Illustrations of the wind ' s work are at hand in dry weather on any windy day. @# Clouds of dust are raised from the street and driven along by the gale . Here the roadway is swept bare ; and there , in sheltered places , the dust settles in little windrows . The erosive power of waste-laden currents of air is suggested as the sharp grains of flying sand sting one ' s face or clatter against the window . In the country one sometimes sees the dust whirled in clouds from dry , plowed fields in spring and left in the lee of fences in small drifts resembling in form those of snow in winter. @# THE ESSENTIAL CONDITIONS for the wind ' s conspicuous work are illustrated in these simple examples ; they are aridity and the absence of vegetation . In humid climates these conditions are only rarely and locally met ; for the most part a thick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a cover of leaves and stems and a mattress of interlacing roots . But in arid regions either vegetation is wholly lacking , or scant growths are found huddled in detached clumps , leaving interspaces of unprotected ground ( Fig. 119 ) . Here , too , the mantle of waste , which is formed chiefly under the action of temperature changes , remains dry and loose for long periods . Little or no moisture is present to cause its particles to cohere , and they are therefore readily lifted and drifted by the wind. @# TRANSPORTATION BY THE WIND @# In the desert the finer waste is continually swept to and fro by the ever-shifting wind . Even in quiet weather the air heated by contact with the hot sands rises in whirls , and the dust is lifted in stately columns , sometimes as much as one thousand feet in height , which march slowly across the plain . In storms the sand is driven along the ground in a continuous sheet , while the air is tilled with dust . Explorers tell of sand storms in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air grows murky and suffocating . Even at midday it may become dark as night , and nothing can be heard except the roar of the blast and the whir of myriads of grains of sand as they fly past the ear. @# Sand storms are by no means uncommon in the arid regions of the western United States . In a recent year , six were reported from Yuma , Arizona . Trains on transcontinental railways are occasionally blockaded by drifting sand , and the dust sifts into closed passenger coaches , covering the seats and floors . After such a storm thirteen car loads of sand were removed from the platform of a station on a western railway. @# DUST FALLS . Dust launched by upward-whirling winds on the swift currents of the upper air is often blown for hundreds of miles beyond the arid region from which it was taken . Dust falls from western storms are not unknown even as far east as the Great Lakes . In 1896 a " black snow " fell in Chicago , and in another dust storm in the same decade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Island , Ill. , was estimated at more than one thousand tons to the cubic mile. @# In March , 1901 , a cyclonic storm carried vast quantities of dust from the Sahara northward across the Mediterranean to fall over southern and central Europe . On March 8th dust storms raged in southern Algeria ; two days later the dust fell in Italy ; and on the 11th it had reached central Germany and Denmark . It is estimated that in these few days one million eight hundred thousand tons of waste were carried from northern Africa and deposited on European soil. @# We may see from these examples the importance of the wind as an agent of transportation , and how vast in the aggregate are the loads which it carries . There are striking differences between air and water as carriers of waste . Rivers flow in fixed and narrow channels to definite goals . The channelless streams of the air sweep across broad areas , and , shifting about continually , carry their loads back and forth , now in one direction and now in another. @# WIND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorted by the wind . The coarser rubbish , too heavy to be lifted into the air , is left to strew wide tracts with residual gravels ( Fig. 120 ) . The sand derived from the disintegration of desert rocks gathers in vast fields . About one eighth of the surface of the Sahara is said to be thus covered with drifting sand . In desert mountains , as those of Sinai , it lies like fields of snow in the high valleys below the sharp peaks . On more level tracts it accumulates in seas of sand , sometimes , as in the deserts of Arabia , two hundred and more feet deep. @# DUNES . The sand thus accumulated by the wind is heaped in wavelike hills called dunes . In the desert of northwestern India , where the prevalent wind is of great strength , the sand is laid in longitudinal dunes , i. e. in stripes running parallel with the direction of the wind ; but commonly dunes lie , like ripple marks , transverse to the wind current . On the windward side they show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sand can readily be moved ; while to the lee their slope is frequently as great as the angle of repose ( Fig. 122 ) . Dunes whose sands are not fixed by vegetation travel slowly with the wind ; for their material is ever shifted forward as the grains are driven up the windward slope and , falling over the crest , are deposited in slanting layers in the quiet of the lee. @# Like river deposits , wind-blown sands are stratified , since they are laid by currents of air varying in intensity , and therefore in transporting power , which carry now finer and now coarser materials and lay them down where their velocity is checked ( Fig. 123 ) . Since the wind varies in direction , the strata dip in various directions . They also dip at various angles , according to the inclination of the surface on which they were laid. @# Dunes occur not only in arid regions , but also wherever loose sand lies unprotected by vegetation from the wind . From the beaches of sea and lake shores the wind drives inland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , piling it in dunes which may invade forests and fields and bury villages beneath their slowly advancing waves . On flood plains during summer droughts river deposits are often worked over by the wind ; the sand is heaped in hummocks and much of the fine silt is caught and held by the forests and grassy fields of the bordering hills. @# The sand of shore dunes differs little in composition and the shape of its grains from that of the beach from which it was derived . But in deserts , by the long wear of grain on grain as they are blown hither and thither by the wind , all soft minerals are ground to powder and the sand comes to consist almost wholly of smooth round grams of hard quartz. @# Some marine sandstones , such as the St. Peter sandstone of the upper Mississippi valley , are composed so entirely of polished spherules of quartz that it has been believed by some that their grains were long blown about in ancient deserts before they were deposited in the sea. @# DUST DEPOSITS . As desert sands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what has become of the softer minerals of which the rocks whose disintegration has supplied the sand were in part , and often in large part , composed . The softer minerals have been ground to powder , and little by little the quartz sand also is worn by attrition to fine dust . Yet dust deposits are scant and few in great deserts such as the Sahara . The finer waste is blown beyond its limits and laid in adjacent oceans , where it adds to the muds and oozes of their floors , and on bordering steppes and forest lands , where it is bound fast by vegetation and slowly accumulates in deposits of unstratified loose yellow earth . The fine waste of the Sahara has been identified in dredgings from the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean , taken hundreds of miles from the coast of Africa. @# LOESS . In northern China an area as large as France is deeply covered with a yellow pulverulent earth called loess ( German , loose ) , which many consider a dust deposit blown from the great Mongolian desert lying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the height of eight thousand feet and descends on the plains nearly to sea level . Its texture and lack of stratification give it a vertical cleavage ; hence it stands in steep cliffs on the sides of the deep and narrow trenches which have been cut in it by streams. @# On loess hillsides in China are thousands of villages whose eavelike dwellings have been excavated in this soft , yet firm , dry loam . While dust falls are common at the present time in this region , the loess is now being rapidly denuded by streams , and its yellow silt gives name to the muddy Hwang-ho ( Yellow River ) , and to the Yellow Sea , whose waters it discolors for scores of miles from shore. @# Wind deposits both of dust and of sand may be expected to contain the remains of land shells , bits of wood , and bones of land animals , testifying to the fact that they were accumulated in open air and not in the sea or in bodies of fresh water. @# WIND EROSION @# Sand-laden currents of air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in much the same way as does the jet of steam fed with sharp sand , which is used in the manufacture of ground glass . Indeed , in a single storm at Cape Cod a plate glass of a lighthouse was so ground by flying sand that its transparency was destroyed and its removal made necessary. @# Telegraph poles and wires whetted by wind-blown sands are destroyed within a few years . In rocks of unequal resistance the harder parts are left in relief , while the softer are etched away . Thus in the pass of San Bernardino , Cal. , through which strong winds stream from the west , crystals of garnet are left projecting on delicate rock fingers from the softer rock in which they were imbedded. @# Wind-carved pebbles are characteristically planed , the facets meeting along a summit ridge or at a point like that of a pyramid . We may suppose that these facets were ground by prevalent winds from certain directions , or that from time to time the stone was undermined and rolled over as the sand beneath it was blown away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the driving sand . Such wind-carved pebbles are sometimes found in ancient rocks and may be accepted as evidence that the sands of which the rocks are composed were blown about by the wind. @# DEFLATION . In the denudation of an arid region , wind erosion is comparatively ineffective as compared with deflation ( Latin , de , from ; flare , to blow ) ,  --  a term by which is meant the constant removal of waste by the wind , leaving the rocks bare to the continuous attack of the weather . In moist climates denudation is continually impeded by the mantle of waste and its cover of vegetation , and the land surface can be lowered no faster than the waste is removed by running water . Deep residual soils come to protect all regions of moderate slope , concealing from view the rock structure , and the various forms of the land are due more to the agencies of erosion and transportation than to differences in the resistance of the underlying rocks. @# But in arid regions the mantle is rapidly removed , even from well- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wind and the wash of occasional rains . The geological structure of these regions of naked rock can be read as far as the eye can see , and it is to this structure that the forms of the land are there largely due . In a land mass of horizontal strata , for example , any softer surface rocks wear down to some underlying , resistant stratum , and this for a while forms the surface of a level plateau ( Fig. 129 ) . The edges of the capping layer , together with those of any softer layers beneath it , wear back in steep cliffs , dissected by the valleys of wet-weather streams and often swept bare to the base by the wind . As they are little protected by talus , which commonly is removed about as fast as formed , these escarpments and the walls of the valleys retreat indefinitely , exposing some hard stratum beneath which forms the floor of a widening terrace. @# The high plateaus of northern Arizona and southern Utah , north of the Grand Canyon of the Colorado River , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thick and of very gentle inclination northward . From the broad plat form in which the canyon has been cut rises a series of gigantic stairs , which are often more than one thousand feet high and a score or more of miles in breadth . The retreating escarpments , the cliffs of the mesas and buttes which they have left behind as outliers , and the walls of the ravines are carved into noble architectural forms  --  into cathedrals , pyramids , amphitheaters , towers , arches , and colonnades  --  by the processes of weathering aided by deflation . It is thus by the help of the action of the wind that great plateaus in arid regions are dissected and at last are smoothed away to waterless plains , either composed of naked rock , or strewed with residual gravels , or covered with drifting residual sand. @# The specific gravity of air is 1/823 that of water . How does this fact affect the weight of the material which each can carry at the same velocity ? @# If the rainfall should lessen in your own state to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would take place in the vegetation of the country ? in the soil ? in the streams ? in the erosion of valleys ? in the agencies chiefly at work in denuding the land ? @# In what way can a wind-carved pebble be distinguished from a river-worn pebble ? from a glaciated pebble ? @# @# @# CHAPTER VII @# THE SEA AND ITS SHORES @# We have already seen that the ocean is the goal at which the waste of the land arrives . The mantle of rock waste , creeping down slopes , is washed to the sea by streams , together with the material which the streams have worn from their beds and that dissolved by underground waters . In arid regions the winds sweep waste either into bordering oceans or into more humid regions where rivers take it up and carry it on to the sea . Glaciers deliver the load of their moraines either directly to the sea or leave it for streams to transport to the same goal . All deposits made on the land , such as the flood plains of rivers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheets of glacial drift , mark but pauses in the process which is to bring all the materials of the land now above sea level to rest upon the ocean bed. @# But the sea is also at work along all its shores as an agent of destruction , and we must first take up its work in erosion before we consider how it transports and deposits the waste of the land. @# SEA EROSION @# THE SEA CLIFF AND THE ROCK BENCH . On many coasts the land fronts the ocean in a line of cliffs . To the edge of the cliffs there lead down valleys and ridges , carved by running water , which , if extended , would meet the water surface some way out from shore . Evidently they are now abruptly cut short at the present shore line because the land has been cut back. @# Along the foot of the cliff lies a gently shelving bench of rock , more or less thickly veneered with sand and shingle . At low tide its inner margin is laid bare , but at high tide it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the cliffs . A notch , of which the SEA CLIFF and the ROCK BENCH are the two sides , has been cut along the shore. @# WAVES . The position of the rock bench , with its inner margin slightly above low tide , shows that it has been cut by some agent which acts like a horizontal saw set at about sea level . This agent is clearly the surface agitation of the water ; it is the wind-raised wave. @# As a wave comes up the shelving bench the crest topples forward and the wave " breaks , " striking a blow whose force is measured by the momentum of all its tons of falling water . On the coast of Scotland the force of the blows struck by the waves of the heaviest storms has sometimes exceeded three tons to the square foot . But even a calm sea constantly chafes the shore . It heaves in gentle undulations known as the ground swell , the result of storms perhaps a thousand miles distant , and breaks on the shore in surf. @# The blows of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else they would have little effect on cliffs of solid rock . Storm waves arm themselves with the sand and gravel , the cobbles , and even the large bowlders which lie at the base of the cliff , and beat against it with these hammers of stone. @# Where a precipice descends sheer into deep water , waves swash up and down the face of the rocks but can not break and strike effective blows . They therefore erode but little until the talus fallen from the cliff is gradually built up beneath the sea to the level at which the waves drag bottom upon it and break. @# Compare the ways in which different agents abrade . The wind lightly brushes sand and dust over exposed surfaces of rock . Running water sweeps fragments of various sizes along its channels , holding them with a loose hand . Glacial ice grinds the stones of its ground moraine against the underlying rock with the pressure of its enormous weight . The wave hurls fragments of rock against the sea cliff , bruising and battering it by the blow . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to and fro upon it. @# WEATHERING OF SEA CLIFFS . The sea cliff furnishes the weapons for its own destruction . They are broken from it not only by the wave but also by the weather . Indeed the sea cliff weathers more rapidly , as a rule , than do rock ledges inland . It is abundantly wet with spray . Along its base the ground water of the neighboring land finds its natural outlet in springs which under mine it . Moreover , it is unprotected by any shield of talus . Fragments of rock as they fall from its face are battered to pieces by the waves and swept out to sea . The cliff is thus left exposed to the attack of the weather , and its retreat would be comparatively rapid for this reason alone. @# Sea cliffs seldom overhang , but commonly , as in Figure 134 , slope seaward , showing that the upper portion has retreated at a more rapid rate than has the base . Which do you infer is on the whole the more destructive agent , weathering or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut in well jointed rocks whose joints dip toward the land . Draw a diagram of a sea cliff where the joints dip toward the sea. @# SEA CAVES . The wave does not merely batter the face of the cliff . Like a skillful quarryman it inserts wedges in all natural fissures , such as joints , and uses explosive forces . As a wave flaps against a crevice it compresses the air within with the sudden stroke ; as it falls back the air as suddenly expands . On lighthouses heavily barred doors have been burst outward by the explosive force of the air within , as it was released from pressure when a partial vacuum was formed by the refluence of the wave . Where a crevice is filled with water the entire force of the blow of the wave is transmitted by hydraulic pressure to the sides of the fissure . Thus storm waves little by little pry and suck the rock loose , and in this way , and by the blows which they strike with the stones of the beach , they quarry out about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a recess known as a SEA CAVE , provided that the rock above is coherent enough to form a roof . Otherwise an open chasm results. @# BLOWHOLES AND SEA ARCHES . As a sea cave is drilled back into the rock , it may encounter a joint or crevice opened to the surface by percolating water . The shock of the waves soon enlarges this to a blowhole , which one may find on the breezy upland , perhaps a hundred yards and more back from the cliff ' s edge . In quiet weather the blowhole is a deep well ; in storm it plays a fountain as the waves drive through the long tunnel below and spout their spray high in air in successive jets . As the roof of the cave thus breaks down in the rear , there may remain in front for a while a sea arch , similar to the natural bridges of land caverns. @# STACKS AND WAVE-CUT ISLANDS . As the sea drives its tunnels and open drifts into the cliff , it breaks through behind the intervening portions and leaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from inland escarpments by the weather ; and as the sea cliff retreats , these remnant masses may be left behind as rocky islets . Thus the rock bench is often set with stacks , islets in all stages of destruction , and sunken reefs , all wrecks of the land testifying to its retreat before the incessant attack of the waves. @# COVES . Where zones of soft or closely jointed rock outcrop along a shore , or where minor water courses conic down to the sea and aid in erosion , the shore is worn back in curved reentrants called coves ; while the more resistant rocks on either hand are left projecting as headlands ( Fig. 139 ) . After coves are cut back a short distance by the waves , the headlands come to protect them , as with breakwaters , and prevent their indefinite retreat . The shore takes a curve of equilibrium , along which the hard rock of the exposed headland and the weak rock of the protected cove wear back at an equal rate. @# RATE OF RECESSION . The rate at which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or incoherent rocks exposed to violent storms the retreat is so rapid as to be easily measured . The coast of Yorkshire , England , whose cliffs are cut in glacial drift , loses seven feet a year on the average , and since the Norman conquest a strip a mile wide , with farmsteads and villages and historic seaports , has been devoured by the sea . The sandy south shore of Martha ' s Vineyard wears back three feet a year . But hard rocks retreat so slowly that their recession has seldom been measured by the records of history. @# SHORE DRIFT @# BOWLDER AND PEBBLE BEACHES . About as fast as formed the waste of the sea cliff is swept both along the shore and out to sea . The road of waste along shore is the BEACH . We may also define the beach as the exposed edge of the sheet of sediment formed by the carriage of land waste out to sea . At the foot of sea cliffs , where the waves are pounding hardest , one commonly finds the rock bench strewn on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waves and by the weather and some-what worn on their corners and edges . From this BOWLDER BEACH the smaller fragments of waste from the cliff and the fragments into which the bowlders are at last broken drift on to more sheltered places and there accumulate in a PEBBLE BEACH , made of pebbles well rounded by the wear which they have suffered . Such beaches form a mill whose raw material is constantly supplied by the cliff . The breakers of storms set it in motion to a depth of several feet , grinding the pebbles together with a clatter to be heard above the roar of the surf . In such a rock crusher the life of a pebble is short . Where ships have stranded on our Atlantic coast with cargoes of hard-burned brick or of coal , a year of time and a drift of five miles along the shore have proved enough to wear brick and coal to powder . At no great distance from their source , therefore , pebble beaches give place to beaches of sand , which occupy the more sheltered reaches of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of various minerals into which pebbles are broken by the waves are ground together under the beating surf and rounded , and those of the softer minerals are crushed to powder . The process , however , is a slow one , and if we study these sand grains under a lens we may be surprised to see that , though their corners and edges have been blunted , they are yet far from the spherical form of the pebbles from which they were derived . The grains are small , and in water they have lost about half their weiglit in air ; the blows which they strike one another are therefore weak . Besides , each grain of sand of the wet beach is protected by a cushion of water from the blows of its neighbors. @# The shape and size of these grains and the relative proportion of grains of the softer minerals which still remain give a rough measure of the distance in space and time which they have traveled from their source . The sand of many beaches , derived from the rocks of adjacent cliffs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is dark with grains of a number of minerals softer than quartz . The white sand of other beaches , as those of the east coast of Florida , is almost wholly composed of quartz grains ; for in its long travel down the Atlantic coast the weaker minerals have been worn to powder and the hardest alone survive. @# How does the absence of cleavage in quartz affect the durability of quartz sand ? @# HOW SHORE DRIFT MIGRATES . It is under the action of waves and currents that shore drift migrates slowly along a coast . Where waves strike a coast obliquely they drive the waste before them little by little along the shore . Thus on a north-south coast , where the predominant storms are from the northeast , there will be a migration of shore drift southwards. @# All shores are swept also by currents produced by winds and tides . These are usually far too gentle to transport of themselves the coarse materials of which beaches are made . But while the wave stirs the grains of sand and gravel , and for a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a step forward on their way . The current can not lift and the wave can not carry , but together the two transport the waste along the shore . The road of shore drift is therefore the zone of the breaking waves. @# THE BAY-HEAD BEACH . As the waste derived from the wear of waves and that brought in by streams is trailed along a coast it assumes , under varying conditions , a number of distinct forms . When swept into the head of a sheltered bay it constitutes the bay-head beach . By the highest storm waves the beach is often built higher than the ground immediately behind it , and forms a dam inclosing a shallow pond or marsh. @# THE BAY BAR . As the stream of shore drift reaches the mouth of a bay of some size it often occurs that , instead of turning in , it sets directly across toward the opposite headland . The waste is carried out from shore into the deeper waters of the bay mouth ; where it is no longer supported by the breaking waves , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the surface as a stubby spur , pointing across the bay , and as it reaches the zone of wave action current and wave can now combine to carry shore drift along it , depositing their load continually at the point of the spur . An embankment is thus constructed in much the same manner as a railway fill , which , while it is building , serves as a roadway along which the dirt from an adjacent cut is carted to be dumped at the end . When the embankment is completed it bridges the bay with a highway along which shore drift now moves without interruption , and becomes a bay bar. @# INCOMPLETE BAY BARS . Under certain conditions the sea can not carry out its intention to bridge a bay . Rivers discharging in bays demand open way to the ocean . Strong tidal currents also are able to keep open channels scoured by their ebb and flow . In such cases the most that land waste can do is to build spits and shoals , narrowing and shoaling the channel as much as possible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ setting at right angles to the stream of shore drift and are then classified as HOOKS ( Fig. 142 ) . @# SAND REEFS . On low coasts where shallow water extends some distance out , the highway of shore drift lies along a low , narrow ridge , termed the sand reef , separated from the land by a narrow stretch of shallow water called the LAGOON . At intervals the reef is held open by INLETS ,  --  gaps through which the tide flows and ebbs , and by which the water of streams finds way to the sea. @# No finer example of this kind of shore line is to be found in the world than the coast of Texas . From near the mouth of the Rio Grande a continuous sand reef draws its even curve for a hundred miles to Corpus Christi Pass , and the reefs are but seldom interrupted by inlets as far north as Galveston Harbor . On this coast the tides are variable and exceptionally weak , being less than one foot in height , while the amount of waste swept along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and much of it is a mud flat too shoal for even small boats . On the coast of New Jersey strong tides are able to keep open inlets at intervals of from two to twenty miles in spite of a heavy alongshore drift. @# Sand reefs are formed where the water is so shallow near shore that storm waves can not run in it and therefore break some distance out from land . Where storm waves first drag bottom they erode and deepen the sea floor , and sweep in sediment as far as the line where they break . Here , where they lose their force , they drop their load and beat up the ridge which is known as the sand reef when it reaches the surface. @# SHORES OF ELEVATION AND DEPRESSION @# Our studies have already brought to our notice two distinct forms of strand lines ,  --  one the high , rocky coast cut back to cliffs by the attack of the waves , and the other the low , sandy coast where the waves break usually upon the sand reef . To understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the meeting place of sea and land is determined primarily by movements of the earth ' s crust . Where a coast land emerges the  --  shore line moves seaward ; where it is being submerged the shore line advances on the land. @# SHORES OF ELEVATION . The retreat of the sea , either because of a local uplift of the land or for any other reason , such as the lowering of any portion of ocean bottom , lays bare the inner margin of the sea floor . Where the sea floor has long received the waste of the land it has been built up to a smooth , subaqueous plain , gently shelving from the land . Since the new shore line is drawn across this even surface it is simple and regular , and is bordered on the one side by shallow water gradually deepening seaward , and on the other by low land composed of material which has not yet thoroughly consolidated to firm rock . A sand reef is soon beaten up by the waves , and for some time conditions will favor its growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and of that ground to powder by the surf and carried out to sea , is more than made up by the stream of alongshore drift , and especially by the drag of sediments to the reef by the waves as they deepen the sea floor on its seaward side. @# Meanwhile the lagoon gradually fills with waste from the reef and from the land . It is invaded by various grasses and reeds which have learned to grow in salt and brackish water ; the marsh , laid bare only at low tide , is built above high tide by wind drift and vegetable deposits , and becomes a meadow , soldering the sand reef to the mainland. @# While the lagoon has been filling , the waves have been so deepening the sea floor off the sand reef that at last they are able to attack it vigorously . They now wear it back , and , driving the shore line across the lagoon or meadow , cut a line of low cliffs on the mainland . Such a shore is that of Gascony in southwestern France , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by dunes and unprotected by reefs from the attack of the waves of the Bay of Biscay. @# We may say , then , that on shores of elevation the presence of sand reefs and lagoons indicates the stage of youth , while the absence of these features and the vigorous and unimpeded attack by the sea upon the mainland indicate the stage of maturity . Where much waste is brought in by rivers the maturity of such a coast may be long delayed . The waste from the land keeps the sea shallow offshore and constantly renews the sand reef . The energy of the waves is consumed in handling shore drift , and no energy is left for an effective attack upon the land . Indeed , with an excessive amount of waste brought down by streams the land may be built out and encroach temporarily upon the sea ; and not until long denudation has lowered the land , and thus decreased the amount of waste from it , may the waves be able to cut through the sand reef and thus the coast reach maturity. @# SHORES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shore line moves landward . The horizontal plane of the sea now intersects an old land surface roughened by subaerial denudation . The shore line is irregular and indented in proportion to the relief of the land and the amount of the submergence which the land has suffered . It follows up partially submerged valleys , forming bays , and bends round the divides , leaving them to project as promontories and peninsulas . The outlines of shores of depression are as varied as are the forms of the land partially submerged . We give a few typical illustrations. @# The characteristics of the coast of Maine are due chiefly to the fact that a mountainous region of hard rocks , once worn to a peneplain , and after a subsequent elevation deeply dissected by north-south valleys , has subsided , the depression amounting on its southern margin to as much as six hundred feet below sea level . Drowned valleys penetrate the land in long , narrow bays , and rugged divides project in long , narrow land arms prolonged seaward by islands representing the high portions of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be two thousand miles from the New Brunswick boundary as far west as Portland ,  --  a straight-line distance of but two hundred miles . Since the time of its greatest depression the land is known to have risen some three hundred feet ; for the bays have been shortened , and the waste with which their floors were strewn is now in part laid bare as clay plains about the bay heads and in narrow selvages about the peninsulas and islands. @# The coast of Dalmatia , on the Adriatic Sea , is characterized by long land arms and chains of long and narrow islands , all parallel to the trend of the coast . A region of parallel mountain ranges has been depressed , and the longitudinal valleys which lie between them are occupied by arms of the sea. @# Chesapeake Bay is a branching bay due to the depression of an ancient coastal plain which , after having emerged from the sea , was channeled with broad , shallow valleys . The sea has invaded the valley of the trunk stream and those of its tributaries , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward its axis ( Fig. 146 ) . @# Hudson Bay , and the North , the Baltic , and the Yellow seas are examples where the sinking of the land has brought the sea in over low plains of large extent , thus deeply indenting the continental out-line . The rise of a few hundred feet would restore these submerged plains to the land. @# THE CYCLE OF SHORES OF DEPRESSION . In its infantile stage the outline of a shore of depression depends almost wholly on the previous relief of the land , and but little on erosion by the sea . Sea cliffs and narrow benches appear where headlands and outlying islands have been nipped by the waves . As yet , little shore waste has been formed . The coast of Maine is an example of this stage. @# In early youth all promontories have been strongly cliffed , and under a vigorous attack of the sea the shore of open bays may be cut back also . Sea stacks and rocky islets , caves and coves , make the shore minutely ragged . The irregularity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while increased by differential wave wear on harder and softer rocks . The rock bench is still narrow . Shore waste , though being produced in large amounts , is for the most part swept into deeper water and buried out of sight . Examples of this stage are the east coast of Scotland and the California coast near San Francisco. @# Later youth is characterized by a large accumulation of shore waste . The rock bench has been cut back so that it now furnishes a good roadway for shore drift . The stream of alongshore drift grows larger and larger , filling the heads of the smaller bays with beaches , building spits and hooks , and tying islands with sand bars to the mainland . It bridges the larger bays with bay bars , while their length is being reduced as their inclosing promontories are cut back by the waves . Thus there comes to be a straight , continuous , and easy road , no longer interrupted by headlands and bays , for the transportation of waste alongshore . The Baltic coast of Germany is in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with delta deposits the bays into which they empty . By these steps a coast gradually advances to MATURITY , the stage when the irregularities due to depression have been effaced , when outlying islands formed by subsidence have been planed away , and when the shore line has been driven back behind the former bay heads . The sea now attacks the land most effectively along a continuous and fairly straight line of cliffs . Although the first effect of wave wear was to increase the irregularities of the shore , it sooner or later rectifies it , making it simple and smooth . Northwestern France may be cited as an upland plain , dissected and depressed , whose coast has reached maturity. @# In the OLD AGE of coasts the rock bench is cut back so far that the waves can no longer exert their full effect upon the shore . Their energy is dissipated in moving shore drift hither and thither and in abrading the bench when they drag bottom upon it . Little by little the bench is deepened by tidal currents and the drag of waves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea cliffs melt down under the weather , and the bench becomes a broad shoal where waves and tides gradually work over the waste from the land to greater fineness and sweep it out to sea. @# PLAINS OF MARINE ABRASION . While subaerial denudation reduces the land to baselevel , the sea is sawing its edges to WAVE BASE , i. e. the lowest limit of the wave ' s effective wear . The widened rock bench forms when uplifted a plain of marine abrasion , which like the peneplain bevels across strata regardless of their various inclinations and various degrees of hardness. @# How may a plain of marine abrasion be expected to differ from a peneplain in its mantle of waste ? @# Compared with subaerial denudation , marine abrasion is a comparatively feeble agent . At the rate of five feet per century  --  a higher rate than obtains on the youthful rocky , coast of Britain  --  it would require more than ten million years to pare a strip one hundred miles wide from the margin of a continent , a time sufficient , at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away , for subaerial denudation to lower the lands of the globe to the level of the sea. @# Slow submergence favors the cutting of a wide rock bench . The water continually deepens upon the bench ; storm waves can therefore always ride in to the base of the cliffs and attack them with full force ; shore waste can not impede the onset of the waves , for it is continually washed out in deeper water below wave base. @# BASAL CONGOLMERATES . As the sea marches across the land during a slow submergence , the platform is covered with sheets of sea-laid sediments . Lowest of these is a conglomerate ,  --  the bowlder and pebble beach , widened indefinitely by the retreat of the cliffs at whose base it was formed , and preserved by the finer deposits laid upon it in the constantly deepening water as the land subsides . Such basal conglomerates are not uncommon among the ancient rocks of the land , and we may know them by their rounded pebbles and larger stones , composed of the same kind of rock as that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @# @# @# CHAPTER VIII @# OFFSHORE AND DEEP-SEA DEPOSITS @# The alongshore deposits which we have now studied are the exposed edge of a vast subaqueous sheet of waste which borders the continents and extends often for as much as two or three hundred miles from land . Soundings show that offshore deposits are laid in belts parallel to the coast , the coarsest materials lying nearest to the land and the finest farthest out . The pebbles and gravel and the clean , coarse sand of beaches give place to broad stretches of sand , which grows finer and finer until it is succeeded by sheets of mud . Clearly there is an offshore movement of waste by which it is sorted , the coarser being sooner dropped and the finer being carried farther out. @# OFFSHORE DEPOSITS @# The debris torn by waves from rocky shores is far less in amount than the waste of the land brought down to the sea by rivers , being only one thirty-third as great , according to a conservative estimate . Both mingle alongshore in all the forms of beach and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly carried out to sea . On the shelving ocean floor waste is agitated by various movements of the unquiet water ,  --  by the undertow ( an outward- running bottom current near the shore ) , by the ebb and flow of tides , by ocean currents where they approach the land , and by waves and ground swells , whose effects are sometimes felt to a depth of six hundred feet . By all these means the waste is slowly washed to and fro , and as it is thus ground finer and finer and its soluble parts are more and more dissolved , it drifts farther and farther out from land . It is by no steady and rapid movement that waste is swept from the shore to its final resting place . Day after day and century after century the grains of sand and particles of mud are shifted to and fro , winnowed and spread in layers , which are destroyed and rebuilt again and again before they are buried safe from further disturbance. @# These processes which are hidden from the eye are among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do ; for it is they which have given shape to by far the largest part of the stratified rocks of which the land is made. @# THE CONTINENTAL DELTA . This fitting term has been recently suggested for the sheet of waste slowly accumulating along the borders of the continents . Within a narrow belt , which rarely exceeds two or three hundred miles , except near the mouths of muddy rivers such as the Amazon and Congo , nearly all the waste of the continent , whether worn from its surface by the weather , by streams , by glaciers , or by the wind , or from its edge by the chafing of the waves , comes at last to its final resting place . The agencies which spread the material of the continental delta grow more and more feeble as they pass into deeper and more quiet water away from shore . Coarse materials are therefore soon dropped along narrow belts near land . Gravels and coarse sands lie in thick , wedge-shaped masses which thin out seaward rapidly and give place to sheets of finer sand. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the waste of the continents is a wide belt of mud ; for fine clays settle so slowly , even in sea water ,  --  whose saltness causes them to sink much faster than they would in fresh water ,  --  that they are wafted far before they reach a bottom where they may remain undisturbed . Muds are also found near shore , carpeting the floors of estuaries , and among stretches of sandy deposits in hollows where the more quiet water has permitted the finer silt to rest. @# Sea muds are commonly bluish and consolidate to bluish shales ; the red coloring matter brought from land waste  --  iron oxide  --  is altered to other iron compounds by decomposing organic matter in the presence of sea water . Yellow and red muds occur where the amount of iron oxide in the silt brought down to the sea by rivers is too great to be reduced , or decomposed , by the organic matter present. @# Green muds and green sand owe their color to certain chemical changes which take place where waste from the land accumulates on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GLAUCONITE  --  a silicate of iron and alumina  --  is then formed . Such deposits , known as GREEN SAND , are now in process of making in several patches off the Atlantic coast , and are found on the coastal plain of New Jersey among the offshore deposits of earlier geological ages. @# ORGANIC DEPOSITS . Living creatures swarm along the shore and on the shallows out from land as nowhere else in the ocean . Seaweed often mantles the rock of the sea cliff between the levels of high and low tide , protecting it to some degree from the blows of waves . On the rock bench each little pool left by the ebbing tide is an aquarium abounding in the lowly forms of marine life . Below low-tide level occur beds of molluscous shells , such as the oyster , with countless numbers of other humble organisms . Their harder parts  --  the shells of mollusks , the white framework of corals , the carapaces of crabs and other crustaceans , the shells of sea urchins , the bones and teeth of fishes  --  are gradually buried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , far more often , broken into fragments by the waves. @# By means of these organic remains each layer of beach deposits and those of the continental delta may contain a record of the life of the time when it was laid . Such a record has been made ever since living creatures with hard parts appeared upon the globe . We shall find it sealed away in the stratified rocks of the continents ,  --  parts of ancient sea deposits now raised to form the dry land . Thus we have in the traces of living creatures found in the rocks , i. e. in fossils , a history of the progress of life upon the planet. @# MOLLUSCOUS SHELL DEPOSITS . The forms of marine life of importance in rock making thrive best in clear water , where little sediment is being laid , and where at the same time the depth is not so great as to deprive them of needed light , heat , and of sufficient oxygen absorbed by sea water from the air . In such clear and comparatively shallow water there often grow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whose shells and skeletons of carbonate of lime gradually accumulate in beds of limestone. @# A shell limestone made of broken fragments cemented together is sometimes called COQUINA , a local term applied to such beds recently uplifted from the sea along the coast of Florida ( Fig. 149 ) . @# OOLITIC limestone ( oon , an egg ; lithos , a stone ) is so named from the likeness of the tiny spherules which compose it to the roe of fish . Corals and shells have been pounded by the waves to calcareous sand , and each grain has been covered with successive concentric coatings of lime carbonate deposited about it from solution. @# The impalpable powder to which calcareous sand is ground by the waves settles at some distance from shore in deeper and quieter water as a limy silt , and hardens into a dense , fine-grained limestone in which perhaps no trace of fossil is found to suggest the fact that it is of organic origin. @# From Florida Keys there extends south to the trough of Florida Straits a limestone bank covered by from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The rocky bottom consists of limestone now slowly building from the accumulation of the remains of mollusks , small corals , sea urchins , worms with calcareous tubes , and lime-secreting seaweed , which live upon its surface. @# Where sponges and other silica-secreting organisms abound on limestone banks , silica forms part of the accumulated deposit , either in its original condition , as , for example , the spicules of sponges , or gathered into concretions and layers of flint. @# Where considerable mud is being deposited along with carbonate of lime there is in process of making a clayey limestone or a limy shale ; where considerable sand , a sandy limestone or a limy sandstone. @# CONSOLIDATION OF OFFSHORE DEPOSITS . We can not doubt that all these loose sediments of the sea floor are being slowly consolidated to solid rock . They are soaked with water which carries in solution lime carbonate and other cementing substances . These cements are deposited between the fragments of shells and corals , the grains of sand and the particles of mud , binding them together into firm rock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portions tend also to consolidate under the weight of the overlying beds . Except in the case of limestones , recent sea deposits uplifted to form land are seldom so well cemented as are the older strata , which have long been acted upon by underground waters deep below the surface within the zone of cementation , and have been exposed to view by great erosion. @# RIPPLE MARKS , SUN CRACKS , ETC . The pulse of waves and tidal currents agitates the loose material of offshore deposits , throwing it into fine parallel ridges called ripple marks . One may see this beautiful ribbing imprinted on beach sands uncovered by the outgoing tide , and it is also produced where the water is of considerable depth . While the tide is out the surface of shore deposits may be marked by the footprints of birds and other animals , or by the raindrops of a passing shower. @# The mud of flats , thus exposed to the sun and dried , cracks in a characteristic way . Such markings may be covered over with a thin layer of sediment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lasting record of the manner and place in which the strata were laid . In Figure 150 we have an illustration of a very ancient ripple-marked sand consolidated to hard stone , uplifted and set on edge by movements of the earth ' s crust , and exposed to open air after long erosion. @# STRATIFICATION . For the most part the sheet of sea-laid waste is hidden from our sight . Where its edge is exposed along the shore we may see the surface markings which have just been noticed . Soundings also , and the observations made in shallow waters by divers , tell something of its surface ; but to learn more of its structures we must study those ancient sediments which have been lifted from the sea and dissected by subaerial agencies . From them we ascertain that sea deposits are stratified . They lie in distinct layers which often differ from one another in thickness , in size of particles , and perhaps in color . They are parted by bedding planes , each of which represents either a change in material or a pause during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to settle and become somewhat consolidated before the material of the next was laid upon it . Stratification is thus due to intermittently acting forces , such as the agitation of the water during storms , the flow and ebb of the tide , and the shifting channels of tidal currents . Off the mouths of rivers , stratification is also caused by the coarser and more abundant material brought down at time of floods being laid on the finer silt which is discharged during ordinary stages. @# How stratified deposits are built up is well illustrated in the flats which border estuaries , such as the Bay of Fundy . Each advance of the tide spreads a film of mud , which dries and hardens in the air during low water before another film is laid upon it by the next incoming tidal flood . In this way the flats have been covered by a clay which splits into leaves as thin as sheets of paper. @# It is in fine material , such as clays and shales and limestones , that the thinnest and most uniform layers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the other hand , coarse materials are commonly laid in thick beds , which soon thin out seaward and give place to deposits of finer stuff . In a general way strata are laid in well-nigh horizontal sheets , for the surface on which they are laid is generally of very gentle inclination . Each stratum , however , is lenticular , or lenslike , in form , having an area where it is thickest , and thinning out thence to its edges , where it is overlapped by strata similar in shape. @# CROSS BEDDING . There is an apparent exception to this rule where strata whose upper and lower surfaces may be about horizontal are made up of layers inclined at angles which may be as high as the angle of repose . In this case each stratum grew by the addition along its edge of successive layers of sediment , precisely as does a sand bar in a river , the sand being pushed continuously over the edge and coming to rest on a sloping surface . Shoals built by strong and shifting tidal currents often show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different directions. @# THICKNESS OF SEA DEPOSITS . Remembering the vast amount of material denuded from the land and deposited offshore , we should expect that with the lapse of time sea deposits would have grown to an enormous thickness . It is a suggestive fact that , as a rule , the profile of the ocean bed is that of a soup plate ,  --  a basin surrounded by a flaring rim . On the CONTINENTAL SHELF , as the rim is called , the water is seldom more than six hundred feet in depth at the outer edge , and shallows gradually towards shore . Along the eastern coast of the United States the continental shelf is from fifty to one hundred and more miles in width ; on the Pacific coast it is much narrower . So far as it is due to upbuilding , a wide continental shelf , such as that of the Atlantic coast , implies a massive continental delta thousands of feet in thickness . The coastal plain of the Atlantic states may be regarded as the emerged inner margin of this shelf , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depth of as much as three thousand feet without finding the bottom of ancient offshore deposits . Continental shelves may also be due in part to a submergence of the outer margin of a continental plateau and to marine abrasion. @# DEPOSITION OF SEDIMENTS AND SUBSIDENCE . The stratified rocks of the land show in many places ancient sediments which reach a thickness which is measured in miles , and which are yet the product of well-nigh continuous deposition . Such strata may prove by their fossils and by their composition and structure that they were all laid offshore in shallow water . We must infer that , during the vast length of time recorded by the enormous pile , the floor of the sea along the coast was slowly sinking , and that the trough was constantly being filled , foot by foot , as fast as it was depressed . Such gradual , quiet movements of the earth ' s crust not only modify the outline of coasts , as we have seen , but are of far greater geological importance in that they permit the making of immense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long time is recorded also in the succession of the various kinds of rock that come to be deposited in the same area . As the sea transgresses the land , i. e. encroaches upon it , any given part of the sea bottom is brought farther and farther from the shore . The basal conglomerate formed by bowlder and pebble beaches comes to be covered with sheets of sand , and these with layers of mud as the sea becomes deeper and the shore more remote ; while deposits of limestone are made when at last no waste is brought to the place from the now distant land , and the water is left clear for the growth of mollusks and other lime-secreting organisms. @# RATE OF DEPOSITION . As deposition in the sea corresponds to denudation on the land , we are able to make a general estimate of the rate at which the former process is going on . Leaving out of account the soluble matter removed , the Mississippi is lowering its basin at the rate of one foot in five thousand years , and we may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s land surface of fifty-seven million square miles is now being denuded by the removal of its mechanical waste . But sediments from the land are spread within a zone but two or three hundred miles in width along the margin of the continents , a line one hundred thousand miles long . As the area of deposition  --  about twenty-five million square miles  --  is about one half the area of denudation , the average rate of deposition must be twice the average rate of denudation , i. e. about one foot in twenty-five hundred years . If some deposits are made much more rapidly than this , others are made much more slowly . If they were laid no faster than the present average rate , the strata of ancient sea deposits exposed in a quarry fifty feet deep represent a lapse of at least one hundred and twenty-five thousand years , and those of a formation five hundred feet thick required for their accumulation one million two hundred and fifty thousand years. @# THE SEDIMENTARY RECORD AND THE DENUDATION CYCLE . We have seen that the successive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by which a land mass of lofty mountains is worn to low plains , are marked each by its own peculiar land forms , and that the forms of the earlier stages are more or less completely effaced as the cycle draws toward an end . Far more lasting records of each stage are left in the sedimentary deposits of the continental delta. @# Thus , in the youth of such a land mass as we have mentioned , torrential streams flowing down the steep mountain sides deliver to the adjacent sea their heavy loads of coarse waste , and thick offshore deposits of sand and gravel ( Fig. 156 ) record the high elevation of the bordering land . As the land is worn to lower levels , the amount and coarseness of the waste brought to the sea diminishes , until the sluggish streams carry only a fine silt which settles on the ocean floor near to land in wide sheets of mud which harden into shale . At last , in the old age of the region ( Fig. 157 ) , its low plains contribute little to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in the clear waters near the land lime-secreting organisms flourish and their remains accumulate in beds of limestone . When long-weathered lands mantled with deep , well-oxidized waste are uplifted by a gradual movement of the earth ' s crust , and the mantle is rapidly stripped off by the revived streams , the uprise is recorded in wide deposits of red and yellow clays and sands upon the adjacent ocean floor. @# Where the waste brought in is more than the waves can easily distribute , as off the mouths of turbid rivers which drain highlands near the sea , deposits are little winnowed , and are laid in rapidly alternating , shaly sandstones and sandy shales. @# Where the highlands are of igneous rock , such as granite , and mechanical disintegration is going on more rapidly than chemical decay , these conditions are recorded in the nature of the deposits laid offshore . The waste swept in by streams contains much feldspar and other minerals softer and more soluble than quartz , and where the waves have little opportunity to wear and winnow it , it comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feldspar and other soft minerals are abundant . Such feldspathic sandstones are known as ARKOSE. @# On the other hand , where the waste supplied to the sea comes chiefly from wide , sandy , coastal plains , there are deposited off- shore clean sandstones of well-worn grains of quartz alone . In such coastal plains the waste of the land is stored for ages . Again and again they are abandoned and invaded by the sea as from time to time the land slowly emerges and is again submerged . Their deposits are long exposed to the weather , and sorted over by the streams , and winnowed and worked over again and again by the waves . In the course of long ages such deposits thus become thoroughly sorted , and the grains of all minerals softer than quartz are ground to mud. @# DEEP-SEA OOZES AND CLAYS @# GLOBIGERINA OOZE . Beyond the reach of waste from the land the bottom of the deep sea is carpeted for the most part with either chalky ooze or a fine red clay . The surface waters of the warm seas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Foraminifera , which secrete shells of carbonate of lime . At death these tiny white shells fall through the sea water like snowflakes in the air , and , slowly dissolving , seem to melt quite away before they can reach depths greater than about three miles . Near shore they reach bottom , but are masked by the rapid deposit of waste derived from the land . At intermediate depths they mantle the ocean floor with a white , soft lime deposit known as Globigerina ooze , from a genus of the Foraminifera which contributes largely to its formation. @# RED CLAY . Below depths of from fifteen to eighteen thousand feet the ocean bottom is sheeted with red or chocolate colored clay . It is the insoluble residue of seashells , of the debris of submarine volcanic eruptions , of volcanic dust wafted by the winds , and of pieces of pumice drifted by ocean currents far from the volcanoes from which they were hurled . The red clay builds up with such inconceivable slowness that the teeth of sharks and the hard ear bones of whales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed , where they have lain unburied for thousands of years ; and an appreciable part of the clay is also formed by the dust of meteorites consumed in the atmosphere ,  --  a dust which falls everywhere on sea and land , but which elsewhere is wholly masked by other deposits. @# The dark , cold abysses of the ocean are far less affected by change than any other portion of the surface of the lithosphere . These vast , silent plains of ooze lie far below the reach of storms . They know no succession of summer and winter , or of night and day . A mantle of deep and quiet water protects them from the agents of erosion which continually attack , furrow , and destroy the surface of the land . While the land is the area of erosion , the sea is the area of deposition . The sheets of sediment which are slowly spread there tend to efface any inequalities , and to form a smooth and featureless subaqueous plain. @# With few exceptions , the stratified rocks of the land are proved by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea ; but in the same way they are proved to be offshore , shallow-water deposits , akin to those now making on continental shelves . Deep- sea deposits are absent from the rocks of the land , and we may therefore infer that the deep sea has never held sway where the continents now are ,  --  that the continents have ever been , as now , the elevated portions of the lithosphere , and that the deep seas of the present have ever been its most depressed portions. @# THE REEF-BUILDING CORALS @# In warm seas the most conspicuous of rock-making organisms are the corals known as the reef builders . Floating in a boat over a coral reef , as , for example , off the south coast of Florida or among the Bahamas , one looks down through clear water on thickets of branching coral shrubs perhaps as much as eight feet high , and hemispherical masses three or four feet thick , all abloom with countless minute flowerlike coral polyps , gorgeous in their colors of yellow , orange , green , and red . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sac whose mouth is surrounded with petal-like tentacles , or feelers . From the sea water the polyps secrete calcium carbonate and build it up into the stony framework which supports their colonies . Boring mollusks , worms , and sponges perforate and honeycomb this framework even while its surface is covered with myriads of living polyps . It is thus easily broken by the waves , and white fragments of coral trees strew the ground beneath . Brilliantly colored fishes live in these coral groves , and countless mollusks , sea urchins , and other forms of marine life make here their home . With the debris from all these sources the reef is constantly built up until it rises to low-tide level . Higher than this the corals can not grow , since they are killed by a few hours ' exposure to the air. @# When the reef has risen to wave base , the waves abrade it on the windward side and pile to leeward coral blocks torn from their foundation , filling the interstices with finer fragments . Thus they heap up along the reef low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building is a comparatively rapid progress . It has been estimated that off Florida a reef could be built up to the surface from a depth of fifty feet in about fifteen hundred years. @# CORAL LIMESTONES . Limestones of various kinds are due to the reef builders . The reef rock is made of corals in place and broken fragments of all sizes , cemented together with calcium carbonate from solution by infiltrating waters . On the island beaches coral sand is forming oolitic limestone , and the white coral mud with which the sea is milky for miles about the reef in times of storm settles and concretes into a compact limestone of finest grain . Corals have been among the most important limestone builders of the sea ever since they made their appearance in the early geological ages. @# The areas on which coral limestone is now forming are large . The Great Barrier Reef of Australia , which lies off the north-eastern coast , is twelve hundred and fifty miles long , and has a width of from ten to ninety miles . Most of the islands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are themselves of coral formation. @# CONDITIONS OF CORAL GROWTH . Reef-building corals can not live except in clear salt water less , as a rule , than one hundred and fifty feet in depth , with a winter temperature not lower than 68 degrees F. An important condition also is an abundant food supply , and this is best secured in the path of the warm oceanic currents. @# Coral reefs may be grouped in three classes ,  --  fringing reefs , barrier reefs , and atolls. @# FRINGING REEFS . These take their name from the fact that they are attached as narrow fringes to the shore . An example is the reef which forms a selvage about a mile wide along the northeastern coast of Cuba . The outer margin , indicated by the line of white surf , where the corals are in vigorous growth , rises from about forty feet of water . Between this and the shore lies a stretch of shoal across which one can wade at low water , composed of coral sand with here and there a clump of growing coral. @# @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship channel of quiet water , often several miles in width and sometimes as much as three hundred feet in depth , are known as barrier reefs . The seaward face rises abruptly from water too deep for coral growth . Low islands are cast up by the waves upon the reef , and inlets give place for the ebb and flow of the tides . Along the west coast of the island of New Caledonia a barrier reef extends for four hundred miles , and for a length of many leagues seldom approaches within eight miles of the shore. @# ATOLLS . These are ring-shaped or irregular coral islands , or island-studded reefs , inclosing a central lagoon . The narrow zone of land , like the rim of a great bowl sunken to the water ' s edge , rises hardly more than twenty feet at most above the sea , and is covered with a forest of trees such as the cocoanut , whose seeds can be drifted to it uninjured from long distances . The white beach of coral sand leads down to the growing reef , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sea face of the reef falls off abruptly , often to depths of thousands of feet , while the lagoon varies in depth from a few feet to one hundred and fifty or two hundred , and exceptionally measures as much as three hundred and fifty feet. @# THEORIES OF CORAL REEFS . Fringing reefs require no explanation , since the depth of water about them is not greater than that at which coral can grow ; but barrier reefs and atolls , which may rise from depths too great for coral growth demand a theory of their origin. @# Darwin ' s theory holds that barrier reefs and atolls are formed from fringing reefs by SUBSIDENCE . The rate of sinking can not be greater than that of the upbuilding of the reef , since otherwise the corals would be carried below their depth and drowned . The process is illustrated in Figure 161 , where v represents a volcanic island in mid ocean undergoing slow depression , and ss the sea level before the sinking began , when the island was surrounded by a fringing reef . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equal pace . It rears its seaward face more steep than the island slope , and thus the intervening space between the sinking , narrowing land and the outer margin of the reef constantly widens . In this intervening space the corals are more or less smothered with silt from the outer reef and from the land , and are also deprived in large measure of the needful supply of food and oxygen by the vigorous growth of the corals on the outer rim . The outer rim thus becomes a barrier reef and the inner belt of retarded growth is deepened by subsidence to a ship channel , s ' s ' representing sea level at this time . The final stage , where the island has been carried completely beneath the sea and overgrown by the contracting reef , whose outer ring now forms an atoll , is represented by s " s " . @# In very many instances , however , atolls and barrier reefs may be explained without subsidence . Thus a barrier reef may be formed by the seaward growth of a fringing reef upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ f is a fringing reef whose outer wall rises from about one hundred and fifty feet , the lower limit of the reef-building species . At the foot of this submarine cliff a talus of fallen blocks t accumulates , and as it reaches the zone of coral growth becomes the foundation on which the reef is steadily extended seaward . As the reef widens , the polyps of the circumference flourish , while those of the inner belt are retarded in their growth and at last perish . The coral rock of the inner belt is now dissolved by sea water and scoured out by tidal currents until it gives place to a gradually deepening ship channel , while the outer margin is left as a barrier reef. @# In much the same way atolls may be built on any shoal which lies within the zone of coral growth . Such shoals may be produced when volcanic islands are leveled by waves and ocean currents , and when submarine plateaus , ridges , and peaks are built up by various organic agencies , such as molluscous and foraminiferal shell deposits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the tropic seas by ocean currents , colonize such submarine foundations wherever the conditions are favorable for their growth . As the reef approaches the surface the corals of the inner area are smothered by silt and starved , and their Submarine Volcanic Peak hard parts are dissolved and scoured away ; while those of the circumference , with abundant food supply , nourish and build the ring of the atoll . Atolls may be produced also by the backward drift of sand from either end of a crescentic coral reef or island , the spits uniting in the quiet water of the lee to inclose a lagoon . In the Maldive Archipelago all gradations between crescent-shaped islets and complete atoll rings have been observed. @# In a number of instances where coral reefs have been raised by movements of the earth ' s crust , the reef formation is found to be a thin veneer built upon a foundation of other deposits . Thus Christmas Island , in the Indian Ocean , is a volcanic pile rising eleven hundred feet above sea level and fifteen thousand five hundred feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a plateau surrounded by a rim of hills of reef formation , which represent the ring of islets of an ancient atoll . Beneath the reef are thick beds of limestone , composed largely of the remains of foraminifers , which cover the lavas and fragraental materials of the old submarine volcano. @# Among the ancient sediments which now form the stratified rocks of the land there occur many thin reef deposits , but none are known of the immense thickness which modern reefs are supposed to reach according to the theory of subsidence. @# Barrier and fringing reefs are commonly interrupted off the mouths of rivers . Why ? @# SUMMARY . We have seen that the ocean bed is the goal to which the waste of the rocks of the land at last arrives . Their soluble parts , dissolved by underground waters and carried to the sea by rivers , are largely built up by living creatures into vast sheets of limestone . The less soluble portions  --  the waste brought in by streams and the waste of the shore  --  form the muds and sands of continental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the coherent rocks of the land are thus reconstructed on the ocean floor . But the destination is not a final one . The stratified rocks of the land are for the most part ancient deposits of the sea , which have been lifted above sea level ; and we may believe that the sediments now being laid offshore are the " dust of continents to be , " and will some time emerge to form additions to the land . We are now to study the movements of the earth ' s crust which restore the sediments of the sea to the light of day , and to whose beneficence we owe the habitable lands of the present. @# @# @# PART II @# INTERNAL GEOLOGICAL AGENCIES @# CHAPTER IX @# MOVEMENTS OF THE EARTH ' S CRUST @# The geological agencies which we have so far studied  --  weathering , streams , underground waters , glaciers , winds , and the ocean  --  all work upon the earth from without , and all are set in motion by an energy external to the earth , namely , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have a common tendency to reduce the inequalities of the earth ' s surface by leveling the lands and strewing their waste beneath the sea. @# But despite the unceasing efforts of these external agencies , they have not destroyed the continents , which still rear their broad plains and great plateaus and mountain ranges above the sea . Either , then , the earth is very young and the agents of denudation have not yet had time to do their work , or they have been opposed successfully by other forces. @# We enter now upon a department of our science which treats of forces which work upon the earth from within , and increase the inequalities of its surface . It is they which uplift and recreate the lands which the agents of denudation are continually destroying ; it is they which deepen the ocean bed and thus withdraw its waters from the shores . At times also these forces have aided in the destruction of the lands by gradually lowering them and bringing in the sea . Under the action of forces resident within the earth the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has been folded and broken ; while vast quantities of molten rock have been pressed up into it from beneath and outpoured upon its surface . We shall take up these phenomena in the following chapters , which treat of upheavals and depressions of the crust , foldings and fractures of the crust , earthquakes , volcanoes , the interior conditions of the earth , mineral veins , and metamorphism. @# OSCILLATIONS OF THE CRUST @# Of the various movements of the crust due to internal agencies we will consider first those called oscillations , which lift or depress large areas so slowly that a long time is needed to produce perceptible changes of level , and which leave the strata in nearly their original horizontal attitude . These movements are most conspicuous along coasts , where they can be referred to the datum plane of sea level ; we will therefore take our first illustrations from rising and sinking shores. @# NEW JERSEY . Along the coasts of New Jersey one may find awash at high tide ancient shell heaps , the remains of tribal feasts of aborigines . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing , are now overflowed by the sea , and fragments of their turf and wood are brought to shore by waves . Assuming that the sea level remains constant , it is clear that the New Jersey coast is now gradually sinking . The rate of submergence has been estimated at about two feet per century. @# On the other hand , the wide coastal plain of New Jersey is made of stratified sands and clays , which , as their marine fossils show , were outspread beneath the sea . Their present position above sea level proves that the land now subsiding emerged in the recent past. @# The coast of New Jersey is an example of the slow and tranquil oscillations of the earth ' s unstable crust now in progress along many shores . Some are emerging from the sea , some are sinking beneath it ; and no part of the land seems to have been exempt from these changes in the past. @# EVIDENCES OF CHANGES OF LEVEL . Taking the surface of the sea as a level of reference , we may accept as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above sea level and could have been formed only at or beneath it , and as proofs of relative subsidence whatever is now found beneath the sea and could only have been formed above it. @# Thus old strand lines with sea cliffs , wave-cut rock benches , and beaches of wave-worn pebbles or sand , are striking proofs of recent emergence to the amount of their present height above tide . No less conclusive is the presence of sea-laid rocks which we may find in the neighboring quarry or outcrop , although it may have been long ages since they were lifted from the sea to form part of the dry land. @# Among common proofs of subsidence are roads and buildings and other works of man , and vegetal growths and deposits , such as forest grounds and peat beds , now submerged beneath the sea . In the deltas of many large rivers , such as the Po , the Nile , the Ganges , and the Mississippi , buried soils prove subsidences of hundreds of feet ; and in several cases , as in the Mississippi delta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Other proofs of the same movement are drowned land forms which are modeled only in open air . Since rivers can not cut their valleys farther below the baselevel of the sea than the depths of their channels , DROWNED VALLEYS are among the plainest proofs of depression . To this class belong Narragansett , Delaware , Chesapeake , Mobile , and San Francisco bays , and many other similar drowned valleys along the coasts of the United States . Less conspicuous are the SUBMARINE CHANNELS which , as soundings show , extend from the mouths of a number of rivers some distance out to sea . Such is the submerged channel which reaches from New York Bay southeast to the edge of the continental shelf , and which is supposed to have been cut by the Hudson River when this part of the shelf was a coastal plain. @# WARPING . In a region undergoing changes of level the rate of movement commonly varies in different parts . Portions of an area may be rising or sinking , while adjacent portions are stationary or moving in the opposite direction . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while Nova Scotia and New Brunswick are now rising from the level of the sea , Prince Edward Island and Cape Breton Island are sinking , and the sea now flows over the site of the famous old town of Louisburg destroyed in 1758. @# Since the close of the glacial epoch the coasts of Newfoundland and Labrador have risen hundreds of feet , but the rate of emergence has not been uniform . The old strand line , which stands at five hundred and seventy-five feet above tide at St. John ' s , Newfoundland , declines to two hundred and fifty feet near the northern point of Labrador. @# THE GREAT LAKES is now under-going perceptible warping . Rivers enter the lakes from the south and west with sluggish currents and deep channels resembling the estuaries of drowned rivers ; while those that enter from opposite directions are swift and shallow . At the western end of Lake Erie are found submerged caves containing stalactites , and old meadows and forest grounds are now under water . It is thus seen that the water of the lakes is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shores it is being withdrawn . The region of the Great Lakes is therefore warping ; it is rising in the northeast as compared with the southwest. @# From old bench marks and records of lake levels it has been estimated that the rate of warping amounts to five inches a century for every one hundred miles . It is calculated that the water of Lake Michigan is rising at Chicago at the rate of nine or ten inches per century . The divide at this point between the tributaries of the Mississippi and Lake Michigan is but eight feet above the mean stage of the lake . If the canting of the region continues at its present rate , in a thousand years the waters of the lake will here overflow the divide . In three thousand five hundred years all the lakes except Ontario will discharge by this outlet , via the Illinois and Mississippi rivers , into the Gulf of Mexico . The present outlet by the Niagara River will be left dry , and the divide between the St. Lawrence and the Mississippi systems will have shifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OF OSCILLATIONS . We have already mentioned several of the most important effects of movements of elevation and depression , such as their effects on rivers , the mantle of waste , and the forms of coasts . Movements of elevation  --  including uplifts by folding and fracture of the crust to be noticed later  --  are the necessary conditions for erosion by whatever agent . They determine the various agencies which are to be chiefly concerned m the wear of any land ,  --  whether streams or glaciers , weathering or the wind ,  --  and the degree of their efficiency . The lands must be uplifted before they can be eroded , and since they must be eroded before their waste can be deposited , movements of elevation are a prerequisite condition for sedimentation also . Subsidence is a necessary condition for deposits of great thickness , such as those of the Great Valley of California and the Indo-Gangetic plain ( p. 101 ) , the Mississippi delta ( p. 109 ) , and the still more important formations of the continental delta in gradually sinking troughs ( p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the character and thickness of each formation of the stratified rocks depend primarily on these crustal movements. @# Along the Baltic coast of Sweden , bench marks show that the sea is withdrawing from the land at a rate which at the north amounts to between three and four feet per century ; Towards the south the rate decreases . South of Stockholm , until recent years , the sea has gained upon the land , and here in several seaboard towns streets by the shore are still submerged . The rate of oscillation increases also from the coast inland . On the other hand , along the German coast of the Baltic the only historic fluctuations of sea level are those which may be accounted for by variations due to changes in rainfall . In 1730 Celsius explained the changes of level of the Swedish coast as due to a lowering of the Baltic instead of to an elevation of the land . Are the facts just stated consistent with his theory ? @# At the little town of Tadousac  --  where the Saguenay River empties into the St. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some almost as fresh as recent railway fills , the highest standing two hundred and thirty feet above the river . Here the Saguenay is eight hundred and forty feet in depth , and the tide ebbs and flows far up its stream . Was its channel cut to this depth by the river when the land was at its present height ? What oscillations are here recorded , and to what amount ? @# A few miles north of Naples , Italy , the ruins of an ancient Roman temple lie by the edge of the sea , on a narrow plain which is overlooked in the rear by an old sea cliff ( Fig. 166 ) . Three marble pillars are still standing . For eleven feet above their bases these columns are uninjured , for to this height they were protected by an accumulation of volcanic ashes ; but from eleven to nineteen feet they are closely pitted with the holes of boring marine mollusks . From these facts trace the history of the oscillations of the region. @# FOLDINGS OF THE CRUST @# The oscillations which we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original horizontal attitude . Figure 167 represents a region in which movements of a very different nature have taken place . Here , on either side of the valley V , we find outcrops of layers tilted at high angles . Sections along the ridge r show that it is composed of layers which slant inward from either side . In places the outcropping strata stand nearly on edge , and on the right of the valley they are quite overturned ; a shale SH has come to overlie a limestone LM although the shale is the older rock , whose original position was beneath the limestone. @# It is not reasonable to suppose that these rocks were deposited in the attitude in which we find them now ; we must believe that , like other stratified rocks , they were outspread in nearly level sheets upon the ocean floor . Since that time they must have been deformed . Layers of solid rock several miles in thickness have been crumpled and folded like soft wax in the hand , and a vast denudation has worn away the upper portions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dotted lines. @# DIP AND STRIKE . In districts where the strata have been disturbed it is desirable to record their attitude . This is most easily done by taking the angle at which the strata are inclined and the compass direction in which they slant . It is also convenient to record the direction in which the outcrop of the strata trends across the country. @# The inclination of a bed of rocks to the horizon is its DIP . The amount of the dip is the angle made with a horizontal plane . The dip of a horizontal layer is zero , and that of a vertical layer is 90 degrees . The direction of the dip is taken with the compass . Thus a geologist ' s notebook in describing the attitude of outcropping strata contains many such entries as these : dip 32 degrees north , or dip 8 degrees south 20 degrees west ,  --  meaning in the latter case that the amount of the dip is 8 degrees and the direction of the dip bears 20 degrees west of south. @# The line of intersection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The strike always runs at right angles to the dip. @# Dip and strike may be illustrated by a book set aslant on a shelf . The dip is the acute angle made with the shelf by the side of the book , while the strike is represented by a line running along the book ' s upper edge . If the dip is north or south , the strike runs east and west. @# FOLDED STRUCTURES . An upfold , in which the strata dip away from a line drawn along the crest and called the axis of the fold , is known as an ANTICLINE . A downfold , where the strata dip from either side toward the axis of the trough , is called a SYNCLINE . There is sometimes seen a downward bend in horizontal or gently inclined strata , by which they descend to a lower level . Such a single flexure is a MONOCLINE. @# DEGREES OF FOLDING . Folds vary in degree from broad , low swells , which can hardly be detected , to the most highly contorted and complicated structures . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side the axis of the fold are equal . In UNSYMMETRICAL folds one limb is steeper than the other , as in the anticline in Figure 167 . In OVERTURNED folds one limb is inclined beyond the perpendicular . FAN FOLDS have been so pinched that the original anticlines are left broader at the top than at the bottom. @# In folds where the compression has been great the layers are often found thickened at the crest and thinned along the limbs . Where strong rocks such as heavy limestones are folded together with weak rocks such as shales , the strong rocks are often bent into great simple folds , while the weak rocks are minutely crumpled. @# SYSTEMS OF FOLDS . As a rule , folds occur in systems . Over the Appalachian mountain belt , for example , extending from northeastern Pennsylvania to northern Alabama and Georgia , the earth ' s crust has been thrown into a series of parallel folds whose axes run from northeast to southwest ( Fig. 175 ) . In Pennsylvania one may count a score or more of these earth waves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and some extending as much as two hundred miles before they die away . On the eastern part of this belt the folds are steeper and more numerous than on the western side. @# CAUSE AND CONDITIONS OF FOLDING . The sections which we have studied suggest that rocks are folded by lateral pressure . While a single , simple fold might be produced by a heave , a series of folds , including overturns , fan folds , and folds thickened on their crests at the expense of their limbs , could only be made in one way ,  --  by pressure from the side . Experiment has reproduced all forms of folds by subjecting to lateral thrust layers of plastic material such as wax. @# Vast as the force must have been which could fold the solid rocks of the crust as one may crumple the leaves of a magazine in the fingers , it is only under certain conditions that it could have produced the results which we see . Rocks are brittle , and it is only when under a HEAVY LOAD and by GREAT PRESSURE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bent instead of being crushed to pieces . Under these conditions , experiments prove that not only metals such as steel , but also brittle rocks such as marble , can be deformed and molded and made to flow like plastic clay. @# ZONE OF FLOW , ZONE OF FLOW AND FRACTURE , AND ZONE OF FRACTURE . We may believe that at depths which must be reckoned in tens of thousands of feet the load of overlying rocks is so great that rocks of all kinds yield by folding to lateral pressure , and flow instead of breaking . Indeed , at such profound depths and under such inconceivable weight no cavity can form , and any fractures would be healed at once by the welding of grain to grain . At less depths there exists a zone where soft rocks fold and flow under stress , and hard rocks are fractured ; while at and near the surface hard and soft rocks alike yield by fracture to strong pressure. @# STRUCTURES DEVELOPED IN COMPRESSED ROCKS @# Deformed rocks show the effects of the stresses to which they have yielded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been thrown but in their smallest parts as well . A hand specimen of slate , or even a particle under the microscope , may show plications similar in form and origin to the foldings which have produced ranges of mountains . A tiny flake of mica in the rocks of the Alps may be puckered by the same resistless forces which have folded miles of solid rock to form that lofty range. @# SLATY CLEAVAGE . Rocks which have yielded to pressure often split easily in a certain direction across the bedding planes . This cleavage is known as slaty cleavage , since it is most perfectly developed in fine-grained , homogeneous rocks , such as slates , which cleave to the thin , smooth-surfaced plates with which we are familiar in the slates used in roofing and for ciphering and blackboards . In coarse-grained rocks , pressure develops more distant partings which separate the rocks into blocks. @# Slaty cleavage can not be due to lamination , since it commonly crosses bedding planes at an angle , while these planes have been often well-nigh or quite obliterated . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleavage is due to the grain of the rock . Its particles are flattened and lie with their broad faces in parallel planes , along which the rock naturally splits more easily than in any other direction . The irregular grains of the mud which has been altered to slate have been squeezed flat by a pressure exerted at right angles to the plane of cleavage . Cleavage is found only in folded rocks , and , as we may see in Figure 176 , the strike of the cleavage runs parallel to the strike of the strata and the axis of the folds . The dip of the cleavage is generally steep , hence the pressure was nearly horizontal . The pressure which has acted at right angles to the cleavage , and to which it is due , is the same lateral pressure which has thrown the strata into folds. @# We find additional proof that slates have undergone compression at right angles to their cleavage in the fact that any inclusions in them , such as nodules and fossils , have been squeezed out of shape and have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That pressure is competent to cause cleavage is shown by experiment . Homogeneous material of fine grain , such as beeswax , when subjected to heavy pressure cleaves at right angles to the direction of the compressing force. @# RATE OF FOLDING . All the facts known with regard to rock deformation agree that it is a secular process , taking place so slowly that , like the deepening of valleys by erosion , it escapes the notice of the inhabitants of the region . It is only under stresses slowly applied that rocks bend without breaking . The folds of some of the highest mountains have risen so gradually that strong , well-intrenched rivers which had the right of way across the region were able to hold to their courses , and as a circular saw cuts its way through the log which is steadily driven against it , so these rivers sawed their gorges through the fold as fast as it rose beneath them . Streams which thus maintain the course which they had antecedent to a deformation of the region are known as ANTECEDENT streams . Examples of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose valleys trench the outer ranges of the Himalayas and whose earlier river deposits have been upturned by the rising ridges . On the other hand , mountain crests are usually divides , parting the head waters of different drainage systems . In these cases the original streams of the region have been broken or destroyed by the uplift of the mountain mass across their paths. @# On the whole , which have worked more rapidly , processes of deformation or of denudation ? @# LAND FORMS DUE TO FOLDING @# As folding goes on so slowly , it is never left to form surface features unmodified by the action of other agencies . An anticlinal fold is attacked by erosion as soon as it begins to rise above the original level , and the higher it is uplifted , and the stronger are its slopes , the faster is it worn away . Even while rising , a young upfold is often thus unroofed , and instead of appearing as a long , Smooth , boat-shaped ridge , it commonly has had opened along the rocks of the axis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the infacing escarpments of the hard layers of the sides of the fold . Under long-continued erosion , anticlines may be degraded to valleys , while the synclines of the same system may be left in relief as ridges. @# FOLDED MOUNTAINS . The vastness of the forces which wrinkle the crust is best realized in the presence of some lofty mountain range . All mountains , indeed , are not the result of folding . Some , as we shall see , are due to upwarps or to fractures of the crust ; some are piles of volcanic material ; some are swellings caused by the intrusion of molten matter beneath the surface ; some are the relicts left after the long denudation of high plateaus. @# But most of the mountain ranges of the earth , and some of the greatest , such as the Alps and the Himalayas , were originally mountains of folding . The earth ' s crust has wrinkled into a fold ; or into a series of folds , forming a series of parallel ridges and intervening valleys ; or a number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crust , in which the layers have been so crumpled and twisted , overturned and crushed , that it is exceedingly difficult to make out the original structure. @# The close and intricate folds seen in great mountain ranges were formed , as we have seen , deep below the surface , within the zone of folding . Hence they may never have found expression in any individual surface features . As the result of these deformations deep under ground the surface was broadly lifted to mountain height , and the crumpled and twisted mountain structures are now to be seen only because erosion has swept away the heavy cover of surface rocks under whose load they were developed. @# When the structure of mountains has been deciphered it is possible to estimate roughly the amount of horizontal compression which the region has suffered . If the strata of the folds of the Alps were smoothed out , they would occupy a belt seventy-four miles wider than that to which they have been compressed , or twice their present width . A section across the Appalachian folds in Pennyslvania shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the belt has been shortened thirty-five miles in every hundred. @# Considering the thickness of their strata , the compression which mountains have undergone accounts fully for their height , with enough to spare for all that has been lost by denudation. @# The Appalachian folds involve strata thirty thousand feet in thickness . Assuming that the folded strata rested on an unyielding foundation , and that what was lost in width was gained in height , what elevation would the range have reached had not denudation worn it as it rose ? @# THE LIFE HISTORY OF MOUNTAINS . While the disturbance and uplift of mountain masses are due to deformation , their sculpture into ridges and peaks , valleys and deep ravines , and all the forms which meet the eye in mountain scenery , excepting in the very youngest ranges , is due solely to erosion . We may therefore classify mountains according to the degree to which they have been dissected . The Juras are an example of the stage of early youth , in which the anticlines still persist as ridges and the synclines coincide with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slight height of their uplift as to the recency of its date. @# The Alps were upheaved at various times , the last uplift being later than the uplift of the Juras , but to so much greater height that erosion has already advanced them well on towards maturity . The mountain mass has been cut to the core , revealing strange contortions of strata which could never have found expression at the surface . Sharp peaks , knife-edged crests , deep valleys with ungraded slopes subject to frequent landslides , are all features of Alpine scenery typical of a mountain range at this stage in its life history . They represent the survival of the hardest rocks and the strongest structures , and the destruction of the weaker in their long struggle for existence against the agents of erosion . Although miles of rock have been removed from such ranges as the Alps , we need not suppose that they ever stood much , if any , higher than at present . All this vast denudation may easily have been accomplished while their slow upheaval was going on ; in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet ceased. @# Under long denudation mountains are subdued to the forms characteristic of old age . The lofty peaks and jagged crests of their earlier life are smoothed down to low domes and rounded crests . The southern Appalachians and portions of the Hartz Mountains in Germany are examples of mountains which have reached this stage. @# There are numerous regions of upland and plains in which the rocks are found to have the same structure that we have seen in folded mountains ; they are tilted , crumpled , and overturned , and have clearly suffered intense compression . We may infer that their folds were once lifted to the height of mountains and have since been wasted to low-lying lands . Such a section as that of Figure 67 illustrates how ancient mountains may be leveled to their roots , and represents the final stage to which even the Alps and the Himalayas must sometime arrive . Mountains , perhaps of Alpine height , once stood about Lake Superior ; a lofty range once extended from New England and New Jersey southwestward to Georgia along the Piedmont belt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more clearly how short is the life of mountains as the earth counts time , and how great ranges have been lifted , worn away , and again upheaved into a new cycle of erosion. @# THE SEDIMENTARY HISTORY OF FOLDED MOUNTAINS . We may mention here some of the conditions which have commonly been antecedent to great foldings of the crust. @# 1 . Mountain ranges are made of belts of enormously and exceptionally thick sediments . The strata of the Appalachians are thirty thousand feet thick , while the same formations thin out to five thousand feet in the Mississippi valley . The folds of the Wasatch Mountains involve strata thirty thousand feet thick , which thin to two thousand feet in the region of the Plains. @# 2 . The sedimentary strata of which mountains are made are for the most part the shallow-water deposits of continental deltas . Mountain ranges have been upfolded along the margins of continents. @# 3 . Shallow-water deposits of the immense thickness found in mountain ranges can be laid only in a gradually sinking area . A profound subsidence , often to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the upfolding of a mountain range. @# Thus the history of mountains of folding is as follows : For long ages the sea bottom off the coast of a continent slowly subsides , and the great trough , as fast as it forms , is filled with sediments , which at last come to be many thousands of feet thick . The downward movement finally ceases . A slow but resistless pressure sets in , and gradually , and with a long series of many intermittent movements , the vast mass of accumulated sediments is crumpled and uplifted into a mountain range. @# FRACTURES AND DISLOCATIONS OF THE CRUST @# Considering the immense stresses to which the rocks of the crust are subjected , it is not surprising to find that they often yield by fracture , like brittle bodies , instead of by folding and flowing , like plastic solids . Whether rocks bend or break depends on the character and condition of the rocks , the load of overlying rocks which they bear , and the amount of the force and the slowness with which it is applied. @# @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least , we find rocks universally broken into blocks of greater or less size by partings known as joints . Under this name are included many division planes caused by cooling and drying ; but it is now generally believed that the larger and more regular joints , especially those which run parallel to the dip and strike of the strata , are fractures due to up-and-down movements and foldings and twistings of the rocks. @# Joints are used to great advantage in quarrying , and we have seen how they are utilized by the weather in breaking up rock masses , by rivers in widening their valleys , by the sea in driving back its cliffs , by glaciers in plucking their beds , and how they are enlarged in soluble rocks to form natural passageways for underground waters . The ends of the parted strata match along both sides of joint planes ; in. joints there has been little or no displacement of the broken rocks. @# FAULTS . In Figure 184 the rocks have been both broken and dislocated along the plane ff ' . One side must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Such a dislocation is called a fault . The amount of the displacement , as measured by the vertical distance between the ends of a parted layer , is the throw . The angle which the fault plane makes with the vertical is the HADE . In Figure 184 the right side has gone down relatively to the left ; the right is the side of the downthrow , while the left is the side of the upthrow . Where the fault plane is not vertical the surfaces on the two sides may be distinguished as the HANGING WALL and the FOOT WALL . Faults differ in throw from a fraction of an inch to many thousands of feet. @# SLICKENSIDES . If we examine the walls of a fault , we may find further evidence of movement in the fact that the surfaces are polished and grooved by the enormous friction which they have suffered as they have ground one upon the other . These appearances , called sliekensides , have sometimes been mistaken for the results of glacial action. @# NORMAL FAULTS . Faults are of two kinds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which Figure 184 is an example , hade to the downthrow ; the hanging wall has gone down . The total length of the strata has been increased by the displacement . It seems that the strata have been stretched and broken , and that the blocks have readjusted themselves under the action of gravity as they settled. @# THRUST FAULTS . Thrust faults hade to the upthrow ; the hanging wall has gone up . Clearly such faults , where the strata occupy less space than before , are due to lateral thrust . Folds and thrust faults are closely associated . Under lateral pressure strata may fold to a certain point and then tear apart and fault along the surface of least resistance . Under immense pressure strata also break by shear without folding . Thus , in Figure 185 , the rigid earth block under lateral thrust has found it easier to break along the fault plane than to fold . Where such faults are nearly horizontal they are distinguished as THRUST PLANES. @# In all thrust faults one mass has been pushed over another , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beds ; and when the fault planes are nearly horizontal , and especially when the rocks have been broken into many slices which have slidden far one upon another , the true succession of strata is extremely hard to decipher. @# In the Selkirk Mountains of Canada the basement rocks of the region have been driven east for seven miles on a thrust plane , over rocks which originally lay thousands of feet above them. @# Along the western Appalachians , from Virginia to Georgia , the mountain folds are broken by more than fifteen parallel thrust planes , running from northeast to southwest , along which the older strata have been pushed westward over the younger . The longest continuous fault has been traced three hundred and seventy-five miles , and the greatest horizontal displacement has been estimated at not less than eleven miles. @# CRUSH BRECCIA . Rocks often do not fault with a clean and simple fracture , but along a zone , sometimes several yards in width , in which they are broken to fragments . It may occur also that strata which as a whole yield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such as thin-layered limestones , which are crushed to pieces by the strain . In either case the fragments when recemented by percolating waters form a rock known as a CRUSH BRECCIA ( pronounced BRETCHA ) . @# Breccia is a term applied to any rock formed of cemented ANGULAR fragments . This rock may be made by the consolidation of volcanic cinders , of angular waste at the foot of cliffs , or of fragments of coral torn by the waves from coral reefs , as well as of strata crushed by crustal movements. @# SURFACE FEATURES DUE TO DISLOCATIONS @# FAULT SCARPS . A fault of recent date may be marked at surface by a scarp , because the face of the upthrown block has not yet been worn to the level of the downthrow side. @# After the upthrown block has been worn down to this level , differential erosion produces fault scarps wherever weak rocks and resistant rocks are brought in contact along the fault plane ; and the harder rocks , whether on the upthrow or the downthrow side , emerge in a line of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abrupt scarps appear , its general course is sometimes marked by the line of division between highland and lowland or hill and plain . Great faults have sometimes brought ancient crystalline rocks in contact with weaker and younger sedimentary rocks , and long after erosion has destroyed all fault scarps the harder crystallines rise in an upland of rugged or mountainous country which meets the lowland along the line of faulting. @# The vast majority of faults give rise to no surface features . The faulted region may be old enough to have been baseleveled , or the rocks on both sides of the line of dislocation may be alike in their resistance to erosion and therefore have been worn down to a common slope . The fault may be entirely concealed by the mantle of waste , and in such cases it can be inferred from abrupt changes in the character or the strike and dip of the strata where they may outcrop near it. @# The plateau trenched by the Grand Canyon of the Colorado River exhibits a series of magnificent fault scarps whose general course is from north @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blocks into which the country has been broken . The highest part of the plateau is a crust block ninety miles long and thirty-five miles in maximum width , which has been hoisted to nine thousand three hundred feet above , sea level . On the east it descends four thousand feet by a monoclinal fold , which passes into a fault towards the north . On the west it breaks down by a succession of terraces faced by fault scarps . The throw of these faults varies from seven hundred feet to more than a mile . The escarpments , however , are due in a large degree to the erosion of weaker rock on the downthrow side. @# The Highlands of Scotland meet the Lowlands on the south with a bold front of rugged hills along a line of dislocation which runs across the country from sea to sea . On the one side are hills of ancient crystalline rocks whose crumpled structures prove that they are but the roots of once lofty mountains ; on the other lies a lowland of sandstone and other stratified rocks formed from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sandstone occur in places on the north of the great fault , and are here seen to rest on the worn and fairly even surface of the crystallines . We may infer that these ancient mountains were reduced along their margins to low plains , which were slowly lowered beneath the sea to receive a cover of sedimentary rocks . Still later came an uplift and dislocation . On the one side erosion has since stripped off the sandstones for the most part , but the hard crystalline rocks yet stand in bold relief . On the other side the weak sedimentary rocks have been worn down to lowlands. @# RIFT VALLEYS . In a broken region undergoing uplift or the unequal settling which may follow , a slice inclosed between two fissures may sink below the level of the crust blocks on either side , thus forming a linear depression known as a rift valley , or valley of fracture. @# One of the most striking examples of this rare type of valley is the long trough which runs straight from the Lebanon Mountains of Syria on the north to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portion is occupied by the Jordan valley and the Dead Sea . The plateau which it gashes has been lifted more than three thousand feet above sea level , and the bottom of the trough reaches a depth of two thousand six hundred feet below that level in parts of the Dead Sea . South of the Dead Sea the floor of the trough rises somewhat above sea level , and in the Gulf of Akabah again sinks below it . This uneven floor could be accounted for either by the profound warping of a valley of erosion or by the unequal depression of the floor of a rift valley . But that the trough is a true valley of fracture is proved by the fact that on either side it is bounded by fault scarps and monoclinal folds . The keystone of the arch has subsided . Many geologists believe that the Jordan- Akabah trough , the long narrow basin of the Red Sea , and the chain of down-faulted valleys which in Africa extends from the strait of Bab-el-Mandeb as far south as Lake Nyassa  --  valleys which contain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dislocation. @# Should you expect the lateral valleys of a rift valley at the time of its formation to enter it as hanging valleys or at a common level ? @# BLOCK MOUNTAINS . Dislocations take place on so grand a scale that by the upheaval of blocks of the earth ' s crust or the down- faulting of the blocks about one which is relatively stationary , mountains known as block mountains are produced . A tilted crust block may present a steep slope on the side upheaved and a more gentle descent on the side depressed @# THE BASIN RANGES . The plateaus of the United States bounded by the Rocky Mouirtains on the east , and on the west by the ranges which front the Pacific , have been profoundly fractured and faulted . The system of great fissures by which they are broken extends north and south , and the long , narrow , tilted crust blocks intercepted between the fissures give rise to the numerous north-south ranges of the region . Some of the tilted blocks , as those of southern Oregon , are as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie on the waste that has been washed into the depressions between them . We may therefore conclude that their displacement is somewhat recent . Others , as those of Nevada , are so old that they have been deeply dissected ; their original form has been destroyed by erosion , and the intermontane depressions are occupied by wide plains of waste. @# DISLOCATIONS AND RIVER VALLEYS . Before geologists had proved that rivers can by their own unaided efforts cut deep canyons , it was common to consider any narrow gorge as a gaping fissure of the crust . This crude view has long since been set aside . A map of the plateaus of northern Arizona shows how independent of the immense faults of the region is the course of the Colorado River . In the Alps the tunnels on the Saint Gotthard railway pass six times beneath the gorge of the Reuss , but at no point do the rocks show the slightest trace of a fault. @# RATE OF DISLOCATION . So far as human experience goes , the earth movements which we have just studied , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ranges , and faults whose throw is to be measured in thousands of feet , are slow and gradual . They are not accomplished by a single paroxysmal effort , but by slow creep and a series of slight slips continued for vast lengths of time. @# In the Aspen mining district in Colorado faulting is now going on at a comparatively rapid rate . Although no sudden slips take place , the creep of the rock along certain planes of faulting gradually bends out of shape the square-set timbers in horizontal drifts and has closed some vertical shafts by shifting the upper portion across the lower . Along one of the faults of this region it is estimated that there has been a movement of at least four hundred feet since the Glacial epoch . More conspicuous are the instances of active faulting by means of sudden slips . In 1891 there occurred along an old fault plane in Japan a slip which produced an earth rent traced for fifty miles ( Fig. 192 ) . The country on one side was depressed in places twenty feet below that on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet horizontally in the direction of the fault line. @# In 1872 a slip occurred for forty miles on the great line of dislocation which runs along the eastern base of the Sierra Nevada Mountains . In the Owens valley , California , the throw amounted to twenty-five feet in places , with a horizontal movement along the fault line of as much as eighteen feet . Both this slip and that in Japan just mentioned caused severe earthquakes. @# For the sake of clearness we have described oscillations , foldings , and fractures of the crust as separate processes , each giving rise to its own peculiar surface features , but in nature earth movements are by no means so simple ,  --  they are often implicated with one another : folds pass into faults ; in a deformed region certain rocks have bent , while others under the same strain , but under different conditions of plasticity and load , have broken ; folded mountains have been worn to their roots , and the peneplains to which they have been denuded have been upwarped to mountain height and afterwards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ridges , the southern Carpathians , and other ranges ,  --  or , as in the case of the Sierra Nevada Mountains , have been broken and uplifted as mountains of fracture. @# Draw the following diagrams , being careful to show the direction in which the faulted blocks have moved , by the position of the two parts of some well-defined layer of limestone , sandstone , or shale , which occurs on each side of the fault plane , as in Figure 184. @# 1 . A normal fault with a hade of 15 degrees , the original fault scarp remaining. @# 2 . A normal fault with a hade of 50 degrees , the original fault scarp worn away , showing cliffs caused by harder strata on the downthrow side. @# 3 . A thrust fault with a hade of 30 degrees , showing cliffs due to harder strata outcropping on the downthrow. @# 4 . A thrust fault with a hade of 80 degrees , with surface baseleveled. @# 5 . In a region of normal faults a coal mine is being worked along the seam of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is found broken by a fault f which hades toward A. To find the seam again , should you advise tunneling up or down from B ? @# 6 . In a vertical shaft of a coal mine the same bed of coal is pierced twice at different levels because of a fault . Draw a diagram to show whether the fault is normal or a thrust. @# 7 . Copy the diagram in Figure 194 , showing how the two ridges may be accounted for by a single resistant stratum dislocated by a fault . Is the fault a STRIKE FAULT , i. e. one running parallel with the strike of the strata , or a DIP FAULT , one running parallel with the direction of the dip ? @# 8 . Draw a diagram of the block in Figure 195 as it would appear if dislocated along the plane efg by a normal fault whose throw equals one fourth the height of the block . Is the fault a strike or a dip fault ? Draw a second diagram showing the same block after denudation has worn it down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outcrop of the coal seam is now deceptively repeated . This exercise may be done in blocks of wood instead of drawings. @# 9 . Draw diagrams showing by dotted lines the conditions both of A and of B , Figure 196 , after deformation had given the strata their present attitude. @# 10 . What is the attitude of the strata of this earth block , Figure 197 ? What has taken place along the plane bef ? When did the dislocation occur compared with the folding of the strata ? With the erosion of the valleys on the right-hand side of the mountain ? With the deposition of the sediments ? Do you find any remnants of the original surface baf produced by the dislocation ? From the left-hand side of the mountain infer what was the relief of the region before the dislocation . Give the complete history recorded in the diagram from the deposition of the strata to the present. @# 11 . Which is the older fault , in Figure 198 , or When did the lava flow occur ? How long a time elapsed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the work done in the interval ? How long a time since the formation of the later fault ? @# 12 . Measure by the scale the thickness lie of the coal-bearing strata outcropping from a to b in Figure 199 . On any convenient scale draw a similar section of strata with a dip of 30 degrees outcropping along a horizontal line normal to the strike one thousand feet in length , and measure the thickness of the strata by the scale employed . The thickness may also be calculated by trigonometry. @# UNCONFORMITY @# Strata deposited one upon , another in an unbroken succession are said to be conformable . But the continuous deposition of strata is often interrupted by movements of the earth ' s crust , Old sea floors are lifted to form land and are again depressed beneath the sea to receive a cover of sediments only after an interval during which they were carved by subaerial erosion . An erosion surface which thus parts older from younger strata is known as an UNCONFORMITY , and the strata above it are said to be UNCONFORMABLE with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . An unconformity thus records movements of the crust and a consequent break in the deposition of the strata . It denotes a period of land erosion of greater or less length , which may sometimes be roughly measured by the stage in the erosion cycle which the land surface had attained before its burial . Unconformable strata may be parallel , as in Figure 200 , where the record includes the deposition of strata , their emergence , the erosion of the land surface , a submergence and the deposit of the strata , and lastly , emergence and the erosion of the present surface. @# Often the earth movements to which the uplift or depression was due involved tilting or folding of the earlier strata , so that the strata are now nonparallel as well as unconformable . In Figure 201 , for example , the record includes deposition , uplift , and tilting of a ; erosion , depression , the deposit of b ; and finally the uplift which has brought the rocks to open air and permitted the dissection by which the unconformity is revealed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area was sea , and thick sea muds were laid upon it . These were later altered to hard slates by pressure and upfolded into mountains . During the later Silurian and the Devonian the area was land and suffered vast denudation . In the Carboniferous period it was lowered beneath the sea and received a cover of limestone. @# THE AGE OF MOUNTAINS . It is largely by means of unconformities that we read the history of mountain making and other deformations and movements of the crust . In Figure 203 , for example , the deformation which upfolded the range of mountains took place after the deposit of the series of strata a of which the mountains are composed , and before the deposit of the stratified rocks , which rest unconformably on a and have not shared their uplift. @# Most great mountain ranges , like the Sierra Nevada and the Alps , mark lines of weakness along which the earth ' s crust has yielded again and again during the long ages of geological time . The strata deposited at various times about their flanks have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and have been repeatedly crushed , inverted , faulted , intruded with igneous rocks , and denuded . The structure of great mountain ranges thus becomes exceedingly complex and difficult to read . A comparatively simple case of repeated uplift is shown in Figure 204 . In the section of a portion of the Alps shown in Figure 179 a far more complicated history may be deciphered. @# UNCONFORMITIES IN THE COLORADO CANYON , ARIZONA . How geological history may be read in unconformities is further illustrated in Figures 207 and 208 . The dark crystalline rocks a at the bottom of the canyon are among the most ancient known , and are overlain unconformably by a mass of tilted coarse marine sandstones b , whose total thickness is not seen in the diagram and measures twelve thousand feet perpendicularly to the dip . Both a and b rise to a common level nn and upon them rest the horizontal sea-laid strata c , in which the upper portion of the canyon has been cut. @# Note that the crystalline rocks a have been crumpled and crushed . Comparing their structure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to their relief after their deformation ? To which surface were they first worn down , mm ' or nm ? Describe and account for the surface mm ' . How does it differ from the surface of the crystalline rocks seen in the Torridonian Mountains , and why ? This surface mm ' is one of the oldest land surfaces of which any vestige remains. @# It is a bit of fossil geography buried from view since the earliest geological ages and recently brought to light by the erosion of the canyon. @# How did the surface mm ' come to receive its cover of sandstones b ? From the thickness and coarseness of these sediments draw inferences as to the land mass from which they were derived . Was it rising or subsiding ? high or low ? Were its streams slow or swift ? Was the amount of erosion small or great ? @# Note the strong dip of these sandstones b . Was the surface mm ' tilted as now when the sandstones were deposited upon it ? When was it tilted ? Draw a diagram @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and their height relative to sea level. @# The surface nn ' is remarkably even , although diversified by some low hills which rise into the bedded rocks of c , and it may be traced for long distances up and down the canyon . Were the layers of b and the surface mm ' always thus cut short by nn ' as now ? What has made the surface nn ' so even ? How does it come to cross the hard crystalline rocks a and the weaker sandstones b at the same impartial level ? How did the sediments of c come to be laid upon it ? Give now the entire history recorded in the section , and in addition that involved in the production of the platform P , shown in Figure 130 , and that of the cutting of the canyon . How does the time involved in the cutting of the canyon compare with that required for the production of the surfaces mm ' , nn ' , and P ? @# @# @# CHAPTER X @# EARTHQUAKES @# Any sudden movement of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when a fissure is formed or extended , or slip from time to time along a growing fault , produces a jar called an earthquake , which spreads in all directions from the place of disturbance. @# THE CHARLESTON EARTHQUAKE . On the evening of August 31 , 1886 , the city of Charleston , S.C. , was shaken by one of the greatest earthquakes which has occurred in the United States . A slight tremor which rattled the windows was followed a few seconds later by a roar , as of subterranean thunder , as the main shock passed beneath the city . Houses swayed to and fro , and their heaving floors overturned furniture and threw persons off their feet as , dizzy and nauseated , they rushed to the doors for safety . In sixty seconds a number of houses were completely wrecked , fourteen thousand chimneys were toppled over , and in all the city scarcely a building was left without serious injury . In the vicinity of Charleston railways were twisted and trains derailed . Fissures opened in the loose superficial deposits , and in places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The point of origin , or FOCUS , of the earthquake was inferred from subsequent investigations to be a rent in the rocks about twelve miles beneath the surface . From the center of greatest disturbance , which lay above the focus , a few miles northwest of the city , the surface shock traveled outward in every direction , with decreasing effects , at the rate of nearly two hundred miles per minute . It was felt from Boston to Cuba , and from eastern Iowa to the Bermudas , over a circular area whose diameter was a thousand miles. @# An earthquake is transmitted from the focus through the elastic rocks of the crust , as a wave , or series of waves , of compression and rarefaction , much as a sound wave is transmitted through the elastic medium of the air . Each earth particle vibrates with exceeding swiftness , but over a very short path . The swing of a particle in firm rock seldom exceeds one tenth of an inch in ordinary earthquakes , and when it reaches one half an inch and an inch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of earthquake waves , like that of all elastic waves , varies with the temperature and elasticity of the medium . In the deep , hot , elastic rocks they speed faster than in the cold and broken rocks near the surface . The deeper the point of origin and the more violent the initial shock , the faster and farther do the vibrations run. @# Great earthquakes , caused by some sudden displacement or some violent rending of the rocks , shake the entire planet . Their waves run through the body of the earth at the rate of about three hundred and fifty miles a minute , and more slowly round its circumference , registering their arrival at opposite sides of the globe on the exceedingly delicate instruments of modern earthquake observatories. @# GEOLOGICAL EFFECTS . Even great earthquakes seldom produce geological effects of much importance . Landslides may be shaken down from the sides of mountains and hills , and cracks may be opened in the surface deposits of plains ; but the transient shiver , which may overturn cities and destroy thousands of human lives , runs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before. @# EARTHQUAKES ATTENDING GREAT DISPLACEMENTS . Great earthquakes frequently attend the displacement of large masses of the rocks of the crust . In 1822 the coast of Chile was suddenly raised three or four feet , and the rise was five or six feet a mile inland . In 1835 the same region was again upheaved from two to ten feet . In each instance a destructive earthquake was felt for one thousand miles along the coast. @# THE GREAT CALIFORNIA EARTHQUAKE OF 1906 . A sudden dislocation occurred in 1906 along an ancient fault plane which extends for 300 miles through western California . The vertical displacement did not exceed four feet , while the horizontal shifting reached a maximum of twenty feet . Fences , rows of trees , and roads which crossed the fault were broken and offset . The latitude and longitude of all points over thousands of square miles were changed . On each side of the fault the earth blocks moved in opposite directions , the block on the east moving southward and that on the west moving northward and to twice the distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with increasing distance from it. @# This sudden slip set up an earthquake lasting sixty-five seconds , followed by minor shocks recurring for many days . In places the jar shook down the waste on steep hillsides , snapped off or uprooted trees , and rocked houses from their foundations or threw down their walls or chimneys . The water mains of San Francisco were broken , and the city was thus left defenseless against a conflagration which destroyed $500 , 000 , 000 worth of property . The destructive effects varied with the nature of the ground . Buildings on firm rock suffered least , while those on deep alluvium were severely shaken by the undulations , like water waves , into which the loose material was thrown . Well-braced steel structures , even of the largest size , were earthquake proof , and buildings of other materials , when honestly built and intelligently designed to withstand earthquake shocks , usually suffered little injury . The length of the intervals between severe earthquakes in western California shows that a great dislocation so relieves the stresses of the adjacent earth blocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accumulate and cause another dislocation. @# Perhaps the most violent earthquake which ever visited the United States attended the depression , in 1812 , of a region seventy-five miles long and thirty miles wide , near New Madrid , Mo . Much of the area was converted into swamps and some into shallow lakes , while a region twenty miles in diameter was bulged up athwart the channel of the Mississippi . Slight quakes are still felt in this region from time to time , showing that the strains to which the dislocation was due have not yet been fully relieved. @# EARTHQUAKES ORIGINATING BENEATH THE SEA . Many earthquakes originate beneath the sea , and in a number of examples they seem to have been accompanied , as soundings indicate , by local subsidences of the ocean bottom . There have been instances where the displacement has been sufficient to set the entire Pacific Ocean pulsating for many hours . In mid ocean the wave thus produced has a height of only a few feet , while it may be two hundred miles in width . On shores near the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in height roll in , and on coasts thousands of miles distant the expiring undulations may be still able to record themselves on tidal gauges. @# DISTRIBUTION OF EARTHQUAKES . Every half hour some considerable area of the earth ' s surface is sensibly shaken by an earthquake , but earthquakes are by no means uniformly distributed over the globe . As we might infer from what we know as to their causes , earthquakes are most frequent in regions now undergoing deformation . Such are young rising mountain ranges , fault lines where readjustments recur from time to time , and the slopes of suboceanic depressions whose steepness suggests that subsidence may there be in progress. @# Earthquakes , often of extreme severity , frequently visit the lofty and young ranges of the Andes , while they are little known in the subdued old mountains of Brazil . The Highlands of Scotland are crossed by a deep and singularly straight depression called the Great Glen , which has been excavated along a very ancient line of dislocation . The earthquakes which occur from time to time in this region , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to slight slips along this fault plane. @# In Japan , earthquakes are very frequent . More than a thousand are recorded every year , and twenty-nine world-shaking earthquakes occurred in the three years ending with 1901 . They originate , for the most part , well down on the eastern flank of the earth fold whose summit is the mountainous crest of the islands , and which plunges steeply beneath the sea to the abyss of the Tuscarora Deep. @# MINOR CAUSES OF EARTHQUAKES . Since any concussion within the crust sets up an earth jar , there are several minor causes of earthquakes , such as volcanic explosions and even the collapse of the roofs of caves . The earthquakes which attend the eruption of volcanoes are local , even in the case of the most violent volcanic paroxysms known . When the top of a volcano has been blown to fragments , the accompanying earth shock has sometimes not been felt more than twenty-five miles away. @# DEPTH OF FOCUS . The focus of the Charleston earthquake , estimated at about twelve miles below the surface , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably no earthquakes known have started at a greater depth than fifteen or twenty miles . This distance is so slight compared with the earth ' s radius that we may say that earthquakes are but skin-deep. @# Should you expect the velocity of an earthquake to be greater in a peneplain or in a river delta ? @# After an earthquake , piles on which buildings rested were found driven into the ground , and chimneys crushed at base . From what direction did the shock come ? @# Chimneys standing on the south walls of houses toppled over on the roof . Should you infer that the shock in this case came from the north or south ? @# How should you expect a shock from the east to affect pictures hanging on the east and the west walls of a room ? how the pictures hanging on the north and the south walls ? @# In parts of the country , as in southwestern Wisconsin , slender erosion pillars , or " monuments , " are common . What inference could you draw as to the occurrence in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @# @# @# CHAPTER XI @# VOLCANOES @# Connected with movements of the earth ' s crust which take place so slowly that they can be inferred only from their effects is one of the most rapid and impressive of all geological processes ,  --  the extrusion of molten rock from beneath the surface of the earth , giving rise to all the various phenomena of volcanoes. @# In a volcano , molten rock from a region deep below , which we may call its reservoir , ascends through a pipe or fissure to the surface . The materials erupted may be spread over vast areas , or , as is commonly the case , may accumulate about the opening , forming a conical pile known as the volcanic cone . It is to this cone that popular usage refers the word VOLCANO ; but the cone is simply a conspicuous part of the volcanic mechanism whose still more important parts , the reservoir and the pipe , are hidden from view. @# Volcanic eruptions are of two types ,  --  EFFUSIVE eruptions , in which molten rock wells up from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comprehensive term applied to all kinds of rock emitted from volcanoes in a molten state ) , and EXPLOSIVE eruptions , in which the rock is blown out in fragments great and small by the expansive force of steam. @# ERUPTIONS OF THE EFFUSIVE TYPE @# THE HAWAIIAN VOLCANOES . The Hawaiian Islands are all volcanic in origin , and have a linear arrangement characteristic of many volcanic groups in all parts of the world . They are strung along a northwest-southeast line , their volcanoes standing in two parallel rows as if reared along two adjacent lines of fracture or folding . In the northwestern islands the volcanoes have long been extinct and are worn low by erosion . In the southeastern island . Hawaii , three volcanoes are still active and in process of building . Of these Mauna Loa , the monarch of volcanoes , with a girth of two hundred miles and a height of nearly fourteen thousand feet above sea level , is a lava dome the slope of whose sides does not average more than five degrees . On the summit is an elliptical basin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Concentric cracks surround the rim , and from time to time the basin is enlarged as great slices are detached from the vertical walls and engulfed. @# Such a volcanic basin , formed by the insinking of the top of the cone , is called a CALDERA. @# On the flanks of Mauna Loa , four thousand feet above sea level , lies the caldera of Kilauea , an independent volcano whose dome has been joined to the larger mountain by the gradual growth of the two . In each caldera the floor , which to the eye is a plain of black lava , is the congealed surface of a column of molten rock . At times of an eruption lakes of boiling lava appear which may be compared to air holes in a frozen river . Great waves surge up , lifting tons of the fiery liquid a score of feet in air , to fall back with a mighty plunge and roar , and occasionally the lava rises several hundred feet in fountains of dazzling brightness . The lava lakes may flood the floor of the basin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and overflow the rim . Instead , the heavy column of lava breaks way through the sides of the mountain and discharges in streams which flow down the mountain slopes for a distance sometimes of as much as thirty-five miles . With the drawing off of the lava the column in the duct of the volcano lowers , and the floor of the caldera wholly or in part subsides . A black and steaming abyss marks the place of the lava lakes . After a time the lava rises in the duct , the floor is floated higher , and the boiling lakes reappear. @# The eruptions of the Hawaiian volcanoes are thus of the effusive type . The column of lava rises , breaks through the side of the mountain , and discharges in lava streams . There are no explosions , and usually no earthquakes , or very slight ones , accompany the eruptions . The lava in the calderas boils because of escaping steam , but the vapor emitted is comparatively little , and seldom hangs above the summits in heavy clouds . We see here in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all volcanic action , molten rock has been driven upward to the surface from some deep-lying source. @# LAVA FLOWS . As lava issues from the side of a volcano or overflows from the summit , it flows away in a glowing stream resembling molten iron drawn white-hot from an iron furnace . The surface of the stream soon cools and blackens , and the hard crust of nonconducting rock may grow thick and firm enough to form a tunnel , within which the fluid lava may flow far before it loses its heat to any marked degree . Such tunnels may at last be left as caves by the draining away of the lava , and are sometimes several miles in length. @# PAHOEHOE AND AA . When the crust of highly fluid lava remains unbroken after its first freezing , it presents a smooth , hummocky , and ropy surface known by the Hawaiian term PAHOEHOE . On the other hand , the crust of a viscid flow may be broken and splintered as it is dragged along by the slowly moving mass beneath . The stream then appears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with here and there from some chink a dull red glow or a wisp of steam . It sets to a surface called AA , of broken , sharp-edged blocks , which is often both difficult and dangerous to traverse. @# FISSURE ERUPTIONS . Some of the largest and most important outflows of lava have not been connected with volcanic cones , but have been discharged from fissures , flooding the country far and wide with molten rock . Sheet after sheet of molten rock has been successively outpoured , and there have been built up , layer upon layer , plateaus of lava thousands of feet in thickness and many thousands of square miles in area. @# ICELAND . This island plateau has been rent from time to time by fissures from which floods of lava have outpoured . In some instances the lava discharges along the whole length of the fissure , but more often only at certain points upon it . The Laki fissure , twenty miles long , was in eruption in 1783 for seven months . The inundation of fluid rock which poured from it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forty-seven miles and covering two hundred and twenty square miles to an average depth of a hundred feet . At the present time the fissure is traced by a line of several hundred insignificant mounds of fragmental materials which mark where the lava issued. @# The distance to which the fissure eruptions of Iceland flow on slopes extremely gentle is noteworthy . One such stream is ninety miles in length , and another seventy miles long has a slope of little more than one half a degree. @# Where lava is emitted at one point and flows to a less distance there is gradually built up a dome of the shape of an inverted saucer with an immense base but comparatively low . Many LAVA DOMES have been discovered in Iceland , although from their exceedingly gentle slopes , often but two or three degrees , they long escaped the notice of explorers. @# The entire plateau of Iceland , a region as large as Ohio , is composed of volcanic products ,  --  for the most part of successive sheets of lava whose total thickness falls little short of two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in open air and not beneath the sea ; for peat bogs and old forest grounds are interbedded with them , and the fossil plants of these vegetable deposits prove that the plateau has long been building and is very ancient . On the steep sea cliffs of the island , where its structure is exhibited , the sheets of lava are seen to be cut with many DIKES ,  --  fissures which have been filled by molten rock ,  --  and there is little doubt that it was through these fissures that the lava outwelled in successive flows which spread far and wide over the country and gradually reared the enormous pile of the plateau. @# ERUPTIONS OF THE EXPLOSIVE TYPE @# In the majority of volcanoes the lava which rises in the pipe is at least in part blown into fragments with violent explosions and shot into the air together with vast quantities of water vapor and various gases . The finer particles into  --  which the lava is exploded are called VOLCANIC DUST or VOLCANIC ASHES , and are often carried long distances by the wind before they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vent and there accumulate in a steep , conical , volcanic mountain . As successive explosions keep open the throat of the pipe , there remains on the summit a cup-shaped depression called the CRATER. @# STROMBOLI . To study the nature of these explosions we may visit Stromboli , a low volcano built chiefly of fragmental materials , which rises from the sea off the north coast of Sicily and is in constant though moderate action. @# Over the summit hangs a cloud of vapor which strikingly resembles the column of smoke puffed from the smokestack of a locomotive , in that it consists of globular masses , each the product of a distinct explosion . At night the cloud of vapor is lighted with a red glow at intervals of a few minutes , like the glow on the trail of smoke behind the locomotive when from time to time the fire bos is opened . Because of this intermittent light flashing thousands of feet above the sea , Stromboli has been given the name of the Lighthouse of the Mediterranean. @# Looking down into the crater of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The agitation gradually increases . A great bubble forms . It bursts with an explosion which causes the walls of the crater to quiver with a miniature earthquake , and an outrush of steam carries the fragments of the bubble aloft for a thousand feet to fall into the crater or on the mountain side about it . With the explosion the cooled and darkened crust of the lava is removed , and the light of the incandescent liquid beneath is reflected from the cloud of vapor which overhangs the cone. @# At Stromboli we learn the lesson that the explosive force in volcanoes is that of steam . The lava in the pipe is permeated with it much as is a thick boiling porridge . The steam in boiling porridge is unable to escape freely and gathers into bubbles which in breaking spurt out drops of the pasty substance ; in the same way the explosion of great bubbles of steam in the viscid lava shoots clots and fragments of it into the air. @# KRAKATOA . The most violent eruption of history , that of Krakatoa , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , occurred in the last week of August , 1883 . Continuous explosions shot a column of steam and ashes. seventeen miles in air . A black cloud , beneath which was midnight darkness and from which fell a rain of ashes and stones , overspread the surrounding region to a distance of one hundred and fifty miles . Launched on the currents of the upper air , the dust was swiftly carried westward to long distances . Three days after the eruption it fell on the deck of a ship sixteen hundred miles away , and in thirteen days the finest impalpable powder from the volcano had floated round the globe . For many months the dust hung over Europe and America as a faint lofty haze illuminated at sunrise and sunset with brilliant crimson . In countries nearer the eruption , as in India and Africa , the haze for some time was so thick that it colored sun and moon with blue , green , and copper-red tints and encircled them with coronas. @# At a distance of even a thousand miles the detonations of the eruption sounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In one direction they were audible for a distance as great as that from San Francisco to Cleveland . The entire atmosphere was thrown into undulations under which all barometers rose and fell as the air waves thrice encircled the earth . The shock of the explosions raised sea waves which swept round the adjacent shores at a height of more than fifty feet , and which were perceptible halfway around the globe. @# At the close of the eruption it was found that half the mountain had been blown away , and that where the central part of the island had been the sea was a thousand feet deep. @# MARTINIQUE AND ST . VINCENT . In 1902 two dormant volcanoes of the West Indies , Mt . Pelee in Martinique and Soufriere in St. Vincent , broke into eruption simultaneously . No lava was emitted , but there were blown into the air great quantities of ashes , which mantled the adjacent parts of the islands with a pall as of gray snow . In early stages of the eruption lakes which occupied old craters were discharged and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mud. @# On several occasions there was shot from the crater of each volcano a thick and heavy cloud of incandescent ashes and steam , which rushed down the mountain side like an avalanche , red with glowing stones and scintillating with lightning flashes . Forests and buildings in its path were leveled as by a tornado , wood was charred and set on fire by the incandescent fragments , all vegetation was destroyed , and to breathe the steam and hot , suffocating dust of the cloud was death to every living creature . On the morning of the 8th of May , 1902 , the first of these peculiar avalanches from Mt . Pelee fell on the city of St. Pierre and instantly destroyed the lives of its thirty thousand inhabitants. @# The eruptions of many volcanoes partake of both the effusive and the explosive types : the molten rock in the pipe is in part blown into the air with explosions of steam , and in part is discharged in streams of lava over the lip of the crater and from fissures in the sides of the cone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is illustrated in Figure 219. @# SUBMARINE ERUPTIONS . The many volcanic islands of the ocean and the coral islands resting on submerged volcanic peaks prove that eruptions have often taken place upon the ocean floor and have there built up enormous piles of volcanic fragments and lava . The Hawaiian volcanoes rise from a depth of eighteen thousand feet of water and lift their heads to about thirty thousand feet above the ocean bed . Christmas Island ( see p. 194 ) , built wholly beneath the ocean , is a coral-capped volcanic peak , whose total height , as measured from the bottom of the sea , is more than fifteen thousand feet . Deep-sea soundings have revealed the presence of numerous peaks which fail to reach sea level and which no doubt are submarine volcanoes . A number of volcanoes on the land were submarine in their early stages , as , for example , the vast pile of Etna , the celebrated Sicilian volcano , which rests on stratified volcanic fragments containing marine shells now uplifted from the sea. @# Submarine outflows of lava and deposits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intervals between eruptions . Such volcanic deposits are said to be CONTEMPORANEOUS , because they are formed during the same period as the strata among which they are imbedded . Contemporaneous lava sheets may be expected to bake the surface of the stratum on which they rest , while the sediments deposited upon them are unaltered by their heat . They are among the most permanent records of volcanic action , far outlasting the greatest volcanic mountains built in open air. @# From upraised submarine volcanoes , such as Christmas Island , it is learned that lava flows which are poured out upon the bottom of the sea do not differ materially either in composition or texture from those of the land. @# VOLCANIC PRODUCTS @# Vast amounts of steam are , as we have seen , emitted from volcanoes , and comparatively small quantities of other vapors , such as various acid and sulphurous gases . The rocks erupted from volcanoes differ widely in chemical composition and in texture. @# ACIDIC AND BASIC LAVAS . Two classes of volcanic rocks may be distinguished ,  --  those containing a large proportion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called ACIDIC , and those containing less silica and a larger proportion of the bases ( lime , magnesia , soda , etc. ) and therefore called BASIC . The acidic lavas , of which RHYOLITE and THRACHYTE are examples , are comparatively light in color and weight , and are difficult to melt . The basic lavas , of which BASALT is a type , are dark and heavy and melt at a lower temperature. @# SCORIA AND PUMICE . The texture of volcanic rocks depends in part on the degree to which they were distended by the steam which permeated them when in a molten state . They harden into compact rock where the steam can not expand . Where the steam is released from pressure , as on the surface of a lava stream , it forms bubbles ( steam blebs ) of various sizes , which give the hardened rock a cellular structure ( Fig. 220 ) , In this way are formed the rough slags and clinkers called SCORIA , which are found on the surface of flows and which are also thrown out as clots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the seething lava in the throat of the volcano there gathers a rock foam , which , when hurled into the air , is cooled and falls as PUMICE ,  --  a spongy gray rock so light that it floats on water. @# AMYGDULES . The steam blebs of lava flows are often drawn out from a spherical to an elliptical form resembling that of an almond , and after the rock has cooled these cavities are gradually filled with minerals deposited from solution by underground water . From their shape such casts are called amygdules ( Greek , amygdalon , an almond ) . Amygdules are commonly composed of silica . Lavas contain both silica and the alkalies , potash and soda , and after dissolving the alkalies , percolating water is able to take silica also into solution . Most AGATES are banded amygdules in which the silica has been laid in varicolored , concentric layers. @# GLASSY AND STONY LAVAS . Volcanic rocks differ in texture according also to the rate at which they have solidified . When rapidly cooled , as on the surface of a lava @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the minerals of which it is composed have not had time to separate themselves from the fused mixture and form crystals . Under slow cooling , as in the interior of the flow , it becomes a stony mass composed of crystals set in a glassy paste . In thin slices of volcanic glass one may see under the microscope the beginnings of crystal growth in filaments and needles and feathery forms , which are the rudiments of the crystals of various minerals. @# Spherulites , which also mark the first changes of glassy lavas toward a stony condition , are little balls within the rock , varying from microscopic size to several inches in diameter , and made up of radiating fibers. @# Perlitic structure , common among glassy lavas , consists of microscopic curving and interlacing cracks , due to contraction. @# FLOW LINES are exhibited by volcanic rocks both to the naked eye and under the microscope . Steam blebs , together with crystals and their embryonic forms , are left arranged in lines and streaks by the currents of the flowing lava as it stiffened into rock. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through it large conspicuous crystals are said to be PORPHYRITIC , and it is especially among volcanic rocks that this structure occurs . The ground mass of porphyries either may be glassy or may consist in part of a felt of minute crystals ; in either case it represents the consolidation of the rock after its outpouring upon the surface . On the other hand , the large crystals of porphyry have slowly formed deep below the ground at an earlier date. @# COLUMNAR STRUCTURE . Just as wet starch contracts on drying to prismatic forms , so lava often contracts on cooling to a mass of close-set , prismatic , and commonly six-sided columns , which stand at right angles to the cooling surface . The upper portion of a flow , on rapid cooling from the surface exposed to the air , may contract to a confused mass of small and irregular prisms ; while the remainder forms large and beautifully regular columns , which have grown upward by slow cooling from beneath. @# FRAGMENTAL MATERIALS @# Rocks weighing many tons are often thrown from a volcano at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solidofied floor of the crater ; and during the progress of an eruption large blocks may be torn from the throat of the volcano by the outrush of steam . But the most important fragmental materials are those derived from the lava itself . As lava rises in the pipe , the steam which permeates it is released from pressure and explodes , hurling the lava into the air in fragments of all sizes ,  --  large pieces of scoria , LAPILLI ( fragments the size of a pea or walnut ) , volcanic " sand " and volcanic " ashes . " The latter resemble in appearance the ashes of wood or coal , but they are not in any sense , like them , a residue after combustion. @# Volcanic ashes are produced in several ways : lava rising in the volcanic duct is exploded into fine dust by the steam which permeates it ; glassy lava , hurled into the air and cooled suddenly , is brought into a state of high strain and tension , and , like Prince Rupert ' s drops , flies to pieces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falling projectiles also produces some dust , a fair sample of which may be made by grating together two pieces of pumice. @# Beds of volcanic ash occur widely among recent deposits in the western United States . In Nebraska ash beds are found in twenty counties , and are often as white as powdered pumice . The beds grow thicker and coarser toward the southwestern part of the state , where their thickness sometimes reaches fifty feet . In what direction would you look for the now extinct volcano whose explosive eruptions are thus recorded ? @# TUFF . This is a convenient term designating any rock composed of volcanic fragments . Coarse tuffs of angular fragments are called VOLCANIC BRECIA , and when the fragments have been rounded and sorted by water the rock is termed a VOLCANIC CONGLOMERATE . Even when deposited in the open air , as on the slopes of a volcano , tuffs may be rudely bedded and their fragments more or less rounded , and unless marine shells or the remains of land plants and animals are found as fossils in them , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in water or in air . In either case they soon become consolidated . Chemical deposits from percolating waters fill the interstices , and the bed of loose fragments is cemented to hard rock. @# The materials of which tuffs are composed are easily recognized as volcanic in their origin . The fragments are more or less cellular , according to the degree to which they were distended with steam when in a molten state , and even in the finest dust one may see the glass or the crystals of lava from which it was derived . Tuffs often contain VOCLANIC BOMBS ,  --  balls of lava which took shape while whirling in the air , and solidified before falling to the ground. @# ANCIENT VOLCANIC ROCKS . It is in these materials and structures which we have described that volcanoes leave some of their most enduring records . Even the volcanic rocks of the earliest geological ages , uplifted after long burial beneath the sea and exposed to view by deep erosion , are recognized and their history read despite the many changes which they may have undergone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ composition from the sediments among which it is imbedded . The direction of its flow lines may be noted . The cellular and slaggy surface where the pasty lava was distended by escaping steam is recognized by the amygdules which now fill the ancient steam blebs . In a pile of successive sheets of lava each flow may be distinguished and its thickness measured ; for the surface of each sheet is glassy and scoriaceous , while beneath its upper portions the lava of each flow is more dense and stony . The length of time which elapsed before a sheet was buried beneath the materials of succeeding eruptions may be told by the amount of weathering which it had undergone , the depth of ancient soil  --  now baked to solid rock  --  upon it , and the erosion which it had suffered in the interval. @# If the flow occurred from some submarine volcano , we may recognize the fact by the sea-laid sediments which cover it , filling the cracks and crevices of its upper surface and containing pieces of lava washed from it in their basal layers. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stony condition , under the unceasing action of underground waters ; but their flow lines and perlitic and spherulitic structures remain to tell of their original state. @# Ancient tuffs are known by the fragmental character of their volcanic material , even though they have been altered to firm rock . Some remains of land animals and plants may be found imbedded to tell that the beds were laid in open air ; while the remains of marine organisms would prove as surely that the tuffs were deposited in the sea. @# In these ways ancient volcanoes have been recognized near Boston , in southeastern Pennsylvania , about Lake Superior , and in other regions of the United States. @# THE LIFE HISTORY OF A VOLCANO @# The invasion of a region by volcanic forces is attended by movements of the crust heralded by earthquakes . A fissure or a pipe is opened and the building of the cone or the spreading of wide lava sheets is begun. @# VOLCANIC CONES . The shape of a volcanic cone depends chiefly on the materials erupted . Cones made of fragments may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the case of coarse scoria is sometimes as high as thirty or forty degrees . About the base of the mountain the finer materials erupted are spread in more gentle slopes , and are also washed forward by rains and streams . The normal profile is thus a symmetric cone with a flaring base. @# Cones built of lava vary in form according to the liquidity of the lava . Domes of gentle slope , as those of Hawaii , for example , are formed of basalt , which flows to long distances before it congeals . When superheated and emitted from many vents , this easily melted lava builds great plateaus , such as that of Iceland . On the other hand , lavas less fusible , or poured out at a lower temperature , stiffen when they have flowed but a short distance , and accumulate in a steep cone . Trachyte has been extruded in a state so viscid that it has formed steepsided domes like that of Sarcoui. @# Most volcanoes are built , like Vesuvius , both of lava flows and of tuffs , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outward-dipping , alternating layers of lava , scoria , and ashes. @# From time to time the cone is rent by the violence of explosions and by the weight of the column of lava in the pipe . The fissures are filled with lava and some discharge on the sides of the mountain , building parasitic cones , while all form dikes , which strengthen the pile with ribs of hard rock and make it more difficult to rend. @# Great catastrophes are recorded in the shape of some volcanoes which consist of a circular rim perhaps miles in diameter , inclosing a vast crater or a caldera within which small cones may rise . We may infer that at some time the top of the mountain has been blown off , or has collapsed and been engulfed because some reservoir beneath had been emptied by long-continued eruptions. @# The cone-building stage may be said to continue until eruptions of lava and fragmental materials cease altogether . Sooner or later the volcanic forces shift or die away , and no further eruptions add to the pile or replace its losses by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emitted , and , as sulphur vapors are conspicuous among them , such vents are called SOLFATARAS . Mount Hood , in Oregon , is an example of a volcano sunk to this stage . From a steaming rift on its side there rise sulphurous fumes which , half a mile down the wind , will tarnish a silver coin. @# GEYSERS AND HOT SPRINGS . The hot springs of volcanic regions are among the last vestiges of volcanic heat . Periodically eruptive boiling springs are termed geysers . In each of the geyser regions of the earth  --  the Yellowstone National Park , Iceland , and New Zealand  --  the ground water of the locality is supposed to be heated by ancient lavas that , because of the poor conductivity of the rock , still remain hot beneath the surface. @# OLD FAITHFUL , one of the many geysers of the Yellowstone National Park , plays a fountain of boiling water a hundred feet in air ; while clouds of vapor from the escaping steam ascend to several times that height . The eruptions take place at intervals of from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a quiet pool , occupying a craterlike depression in a conical mound some twelve feet high . The conduit of the spring is too irregular to be sounded . The mound is composed of porous silica deposited by the waters of the geyser. @# Geysers erupt at intervals instead of continuously boiling , because their long , narrow , and often tortuous conduits do not permit a free circulation of the water . After an eruption the tube is refilled and the water again gradually becomes heated . Deep in the tube where it is in contact with hot lavas the water sooner or later reaches the boiling point , and bursting into steam shoots the water above it high in air. @# CARBONATED SPRINGS . After all the other signs of life have gone , the ancient volcano may emit carbon dioxide as its dying breath . The springs of the region may long be charged with carbon dioxide , or carbonated , and where they rise through limestone may be expected to deposit large quantities of travertine . We should remember , however , that many carbonated springs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @# THE DESTRUCTION OF THE CONE . As soon as the volcanic cone ceases to grow by eruptions the agents of erosion begin to wear it down , and the length of time that has elapsed since the period of active growth may be roughly measured by the degree to which the cone has been dissected . We infer that Mount Shasta , whose conical shape is still preserved despite the gullies one thousand feet deep which trench its sides , is younger than Mount Hood , which erosive agencies have carved to a pyramidal form . The pile of materials accumulated about a volcanic vent , no matter how vast in bulk , is at last swept entirely away . The cone of the volcano , active or extinct , is not old as the earth counts time ; volcanoes are short- lived geological phenomena. @# CRANDALL VOLCANO . This name is given to a dissected ancient volcano in the Yellowstone National Park , which once , it is estimated , reared its head thousands of feet above the surrounding country and greatly exceeded in bulk either Mount Shasta or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remains ; all has been swept away by erosion except some four thousand feet of the base of the pile . This basal wreck now appears as a rugged region about thirty miles in diameter , trenched by deep valleys and cut into sharp peaks and precipitous ridges . In the center of the area is found the nucleus ( N , Fig. 237 ) ,  --  a mass of coarsely crystalline rock that congealed deep in the old volcanic pipe . From it there radiate in all directions , like the spokes of a wheel , long dikes whose rock grows rapidly finer of grain as it leaves the vicinity of the once heated core . The remainder of the base of the ancient mountain is made of rudely bedded tuffs and volcanic breccia , with occasional flows of lava , some of the fragments of the breccia measuring as much as twenty feet in diameter . On the sides of canyons the breccia is carved by rain erosion to fantastic pinnacles . At different levels in the midst of these beds of tuff and lava are many old forest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now turned to stone , still in many cases stand upright where once they grew on the slopes of the mountain as it was building ( Fig. 238 ) . The great size and age of some of these trees indicate , the lapse of time between the eruption whose lavas or tuffs weathered to the soil on which they grew and the subsequent eruption which buried them beneath showers of stones and ashes. @# Near the edge of the area lies Death Gulch , in which carbon dioxide is given off in such quantities that in quiet weather it accumulates in a heavy layer along the ground and suffocates the animals which may enter it. @# @# @# CHAPTER XII @# UNDERGROUND STRUCTURES OF IGNEOUS ORIGIN @# It is because long-continued erosion lays bare the innermost anatomy of an extinct volcano , and even sweeps away the entire pile with much of the underlying strata , thus leaving the very roots of the volcano open to view , that we are able to study underground volcanic structures . With these we include , for convenience , intrusions of molten rock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which may not have succeeded in breaking way to the surface and establishing a volcano . All these structures are built of rock forced when in a fluid or pasty state into some cavity which it has found or made , and we may classify them therefore , according to the shape of the molds in which the molten rock has congealed , as ( 1 ) dikes , ( 2 ) volcanic necks , ( 3 ) intrusive sheets , and ( 4 ) intrusive masses. @# DIKES . The sheet of once molten rock with which a fissure has been filled is known as a dike . Dikes are formed when volcanic cones are rent by explosions or by the weight of the lava column in the duct , and on the dissection of the pile they appear as radiating vertical ribs cutting across the layers of lava and tuff of which the cone is built . In regions undergoing deformation rocks lying deep below the ground are often broken and the fissures are filled with molten rock from beneath , which finds no outlet to the surface . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rocks , which have been brought to light by long erosion. @# In exceptional cases dikes may reach the length of fifty or one hundred miles . They vary in width from a fraction of a foot to even as much as three hundred feet. @# Dikes are commonly more fine of grain on the sides than in the center , and may have a glassy and crackled surface where they meet the inclosing rock . Can you account for this on any principle which you have learned ? @# VOLCANIC NECKS . The pipe of a volcano rises from far below the base of the cone ,  --  from the deep reservoir from which its eruptions are supplied . When the volcano has become extinct this great tube remains filled with hardened lava . It forms a cylindrical core of solid rock , except for some distance below the ancient crater , where it may contain a mass of fragments which had fallen back into the chimney after being hurled into the air. @# As the mountain is worn down , this central column known as the VOLCANIC NECK is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even when every other trace of the volcano has been swept away , erosion will not have passed below this great stalk on which the volcano was borne as a fiery flower whose site it remains to mark . In volcanic regions of deep denudation volcanic necks rise solitary and abrupt from the surrounding country as dome-shaped hills . They are marked features in the landscape in parts of Scotland and in the St. Lawrence valley about Montreal ( Fig. 241 ) . @# INTRUSIVE SHEETS . Sheets of igneous rocks are sometimes found interleaved with sedimentary strata , especially in regions where the rocks have been deformed and have suffered from volcanic action . In some instances such a sheet is seen to be CONTEMPORANEOUS ( p. 248 ) . In other instances the sheet must be INTRUSIVE . The overlying stratum , as well as that beneath , has been affected by the heat of the once molten rock . We infer that the igneous rock when in a molten state was forced between the strata , much as a card may be pushed between the leaves of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the layers , lifting those above to make room for itself . The source of the intrusive sheet may often be traced to some dike ( known therefore as the FEEDING DIKE ) , or to some mass of igneous rock. @# Intrusive sheets may extend a score and more of miles , and , like the longest surface flows , the most extensive sheets consist of the more fusible and fluid lavas ,  --  those of the basic class of which basalt is an example . Intrusive sheets are usually harder than the strata in which they lie and are therefore often left in relief after long denudation of the region ( Fig. 315 ) . @# On the west bank of the Hudson there extends from New York Bay north for thirty miles a bold cliff several hundred feet high ,  --  the PALISADES OF THE HUDSON . It is the outcropping edge of a sheet of ancient igneous rock , which rests on stratified sandstones and is overlain by strata of the same series . Sandstones and lava sheet together dip gently to the west arid the latter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is an interesting question whether the Palisades sheet is CONTEMPORANEOUS or INTRUSIVE . Was it outpoured on the sandstones beneath it when they formed the floor of the sea , and covered forthwith by the sediments of the strata above , or was it intruded among these beds at a later date ? @# The latter is the case : for the overlying stratum is intensely baked along the zone of contact . At the west edge of the sheet is found the dike in which the lava rose to force its way far and wide between the strata. @# ELECTRIC PEAK , one of the prominent mountains of the Yellowstone National Park , is carved out of a mass of strata into which many sheets of molten rock have been intruded . The western summit consists of such a sheet several hundred feet thick . Studying the section of Figure 244 , what inference do you draw as to the source of these intrusive sheets ? @# INTRUSIVE MASSES @# BOSSES . This name is generally applied to huge irregular masses of coarsely crystalline igneous rock lying in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and may reach scores of miles in extent . Seldom are there any evidences found that bosses ever had connection with the surface . On the other hand , it is often proved that they have been driven , or have melted their way , upward into the formations in which they lie ; for they give off dikes and intrusive sheets , and have profoundly altered the rocks about them by their heat. @# The texture of the rock of bosses proves that consolidation proceeded slowly and at great depths , and it is only because of vast denudation that they are now exposed to view . Bosses are commonly harder than the rocks about them , and stand up , therefore , as rounded hills and mountainous ridges long after the surrounding country has worn to a low plain. @# The base of bosses is indefinite or undetermined , and in this respect they differ from laccoliths . Some bosses have broken and faulted the overlying beds ; some have forced the rocks aside and melted them away. @# The SPANISH PEAKS of southeastern Colorado were formed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breaking the overlying strata . On one side of the mountains the throw of the fault is nearly a mile , and fragments of deep-lying beds were dragged upward by the rising masses . The adjacent rocks were altered by heat to a distance of several thousand feet . No evidence appears that the molten rock ever reached the surface , and if volcanic eruptions ever took place either in lava flows or fragmental materials , all traces of them have been effaced . The rock of the intrusive masses is coarsely crystalline , and no doubt solidified slowly under the pressure of vast thicknesses of overlying rock , now mostly removed by erosion. @# A magnificent system of dikes radiates from the Peaks to a distance of fifteen miles , some now being left by long erosion as walls a hundred feet in height ( Fig. 239 ) . Intrusive sheets fed by the dikes penetrate the surrounding strata , and their edges are cut by canyons as much as twenty-five miles from the mountain . In these strata are valuable beds of lignite , an imperfect coal , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @# LACCOLITHS . The laccolith ( Greek laccos , cistern ; lithos , stone ) is a variety of intrusive masses in which molten rock has spread between the strata , and , lifting the strata above it to a dome- shaped form , has collected beneath them in a lens-shaped body with a flat base. @# The HENRY MOUNTAINS , a small group of detached peaks in southern Utah , rise from a plateau of horizontal rocks . Some of the peaks are carved wholly in separate domelike uplifts of the strata of the plateau . In others , as Mount Hillers , the largest of the group , there is exposed on the summit a core of igneous rock from which the sedimentary rocks of the flanks dip steeply outward in all directions . In still others erosion has stripped off the covering strata and has laid bare the core to its base ; and its shape is here seen to be that of a plano-convex lens or a baker ' s bun , its flat base resting on the undisturbed bedded rocks beneath . The structure of Mount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ igneous rock is four miles in diameter and more than a mile in depth. @# REGIONAL INTRUSIONS . These vast bodies of igneous rock , which may reach hundreds of miles in diameter , differ little from bosses except in their immense bulk . Like bosses , regional intrusions give off dikes and sheets and greatly change the rocks about them by their heat . They are now exposed to view only because of the profound denudation which has removed the upheaved dome of rocks beneath which they slowly cooled . Such intrusions are accompanied  --  whether as cause or as effect is still hardly known  --  by deformations , and their masses of igneous rock are thus found as the core of many great mountain ranges . The granitic masses of which the Bitter Root Mountains and the Sierra Nevadas have been largely carved are each more than three hundred miles in length . Immense regional intrusions , the cores of once lofty mountain ranges , are found upon the Laurentian peneplain. @# PHYSIOGRAPHIC EFFECTS OF INTRUSIVE MASSES . We have already seen examples of the topographic effects of intrusive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the great mountain ranges mentioned in the paragraph on regional intrusions , although in the latter instances these effects are entangled with the effects of other processes . Masses of igneous rock can not be intruded within the crust without an accompanying deformation on a scale corresponding to the bulk of the intruded mass . The overlying strata are arched into hills or mountains , or , if the molten material is of great extent , the strata may conceivably be floated upward to the height of a plateau . We may suppose that the transference of molten matter from one region to another may be among the causes of slow subsidences and elevations . Intrusions give rise to fissures , dikes , and intrusive sheets , and these dislocations can not fail to produce earthquakes . Where intrusive masses open communication with the surface , volcanoes are established or fissure eruptions occur such as those of Iceland. @# THE INTRUSIVE ROCKS @# The igneous rocks are divided into two general classes ,  --  the VOLCANIC or ERUPTIVE rocks , which have been outpoured in open air or on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which have been intruded within the rocks of the crust and have solidified below the surface . The two classes are alike in chemical composition and may be divided into acidic and basic groups . In texture the intrusive rocks differ from the volcanic rocks because of the different conditions under which they have solidified . They cooled far more slowly beneath the cover of the rocks into which they were pressed than is permitted to lava flows in open air . Their constituent minerals had ample opportunity to sort themselves and crystallize from the fluid mixture , and none of that mixture was left to congeal as a glassy paste. @# They consolidated also under pressure . They are never scoriaceous , for the steam with which they were charged was not allowed to expand and distend them with steam blebs . In the rocks of the larger intrusive masses one may see with a powerful microscope exceedingly minute cavities , to be counted by many millions to the cubic inch , in which the gaseous water which the mass contained was held imprisoned under the immense pressure of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the intrusives which cooled most slowly , i. e. in the deepest-seated and largest masses ; while in those which cooled more rapidly , as in dikes and sheets , we find gradations approaching the texture of surface flows. @# VARIETIES OF THE INTRUSIVE ROCKS . We will now describe a few of the varieties of rocks of deep-seated intrusions . All are even grained , consisting of a mass of crystalline grains formed during one continuous stage of solidification , and no porphyritic crystals appear as in lavas. @# GRANITE , as we have learned already , is composed of three minerals ,  --  quartz , feldspar , and mica . According to the color of the feldspar the rock may be red , or pink , or gray . Hornblende  --  a black or dark green mineral , an iron-magnesian silicate , about as hard as feldspar  --  is sometimes found as a fourth constituent , and the rock is then known as HORNBLENDIC GRANITE . Granite is an acidic rock corresponding to rhyolite in chemical composition . We may believe that the same molten mass which supplies this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground in the volcanic reservoir. @# SYENITE , composed of feldspar and mica , has consolidated from a less siliceous mixture than has granite. @# DIORITE , still less siliceous , is composed of hornblende and feldspar ,  --  the latter mineral being of different variety from the feldspar of granite and syenite. @# GABBRO , a typical basic rock , corresponds to basalt in chemical composition . It is a dark , heavy , coarsely crystalline aggregate of feldspar and AUGITE ( a dark mineral allied to hornblende ) . It often contains MAGNETITE ( the magnetic black oxide of iron ) and OLIVINE ( a greenish magnesian silicate ) . @# In the northern states all these types , and many others also of the vast number of varieties of intrusive rocks , can be found among the rocks of the drift brought from the areas of igneous rock in Canada and the states of our northern border. @# SUMMARY . The records of geology prove that since the earliest of their annals tremendous forces have been active in the earth . In all the past , under pressures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rocks of the crust . It has squeezed into fissures forming dikes ; it has burrowed among the strata as intrusive sheets ; it has melted the rocks away or lifted the overlying strata , filling the chambers which it has made with intrusive masses . During all geological ages molten rock has found way to the surface , and volcanoes have darkened the sky with clouds of ashes and poured streams of glowing lava down their sides . The older strata ,  --  the strata which have been most deeply buried ,  --  and especially those which have suffered most from folding and from fracture , show the largest amount of igneous intrusions . The molten rock which has been driven from the earth ' s interior to within the crust or to the surface during geologic time must be reckoned in millions of cubic miles. @# THE INTERIOR CONDITION OF THE EARTH AND CAUSES OF VULCANISM AND DEFORMATION @# The problems of volcanoes and of deformation are so closely connected with that of the earth ' s interior that we may consider them together . Few of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known facts and the probable conclusions which may be drawn as inferences from them. @# THE INTERIOR OF THE EARTH IS HOT . Volcanoes prove that in many parts of the earth there exist within reach of the surface regions of such intense heat that the rock is in a molten condition . Deep wells and mines show everywhere an increase in temperature below the surface shell affected by the heat of summer and the cold of winter ,  --  a shell in temperate latitudes sixty or seventy feet thick . Thus in a boring more than a mile deep at Schladebach , Germany , the earth grows warmer at the rate of 1 degrees F. for every sixty-seven feet as we descend . Taking the average rate of increase at one degree for every sixty feet of descent , and assuming that this rate , observed at the moderate distances open to observation , continues to at least thirty-five miles , the temperature at that depth must be more than three thousand degrees ,  --  a temperature at which all ordinary rocks would melt at the earth ' s surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we go downward , and it may not be appreciable below a few hundred miles . But there is no reason to doubt that THE INTERIOR OF THE EARTH IS INTENSELY HOT . Below a depth of one or two score miles we may imagine the rocks everywhere glowing with heat. @# Although the heat of the interior is great enough to melt all rocks at atmospheric pressure , it does not follow that the interior is fluid . Pressure raises the fusing point of rocks , and the weight of the crust may keep the interior in what may be called a solid state , although so hot as to be a liquid or a gas were the pressure to be removed. @# THE INTERIOR OF THE EARTH IS RIGID AND HEAVY . The earth behaves as a globe more rigid than glass under the attractions of the sun and moon . It is not deformed by these stresses as is the ocean in the tides , proving that it is not a fluid ball covered with a yielding crust a few miles thick . Earthquakes pass through the earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hence the rocks of the interior are highly elastic , being brought by pressure to a compact , continuous condition unbroken by the cracks and vesicles of surface rocks . THE INTERIOR OF THE EARTH IS RIGID @# The common rocks of the crust are about two and a half times heavier than water , while the earth as a whole weighs five and six-tenths times as much as a globe of water of the same size . THE INTERIOR IS THEREFORE MUCH MORE HEAVY THAN THE CRUST . This may be caused in part by compression of the interior under the enormous weight of the crust , and in part also by an assortment of material , the heavier substances , such as the heavy metals , having gravitated towards the center. @# Between the crust , which is solid because it is cool , and the interior , which is hot enough to melt were it not for the pressure which keeps it dense and rigid , there may be an intermediate zone in which heat and pressure are so evenly balanced that here rock liquefies whenever and wherever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crust . It is perhaps from such a subcrustal layer that the lava of volcanoes is supplied. @# THE CAUSES OF VOLCANIC ACTION . It is now generally believed that the HEAT of volcanoes is that of the earth ' s interior . Other causes , such as friction and crushing in the making of mountains and the chemical reactions between oxidizing agents of the crust and the unoxidized interior , have been suggested , but to most geologists they seem inadequate. @# There is much difference of opinion as to the FORCE which causes molten rock to rise to the surface in the ducts of volcanoes . Steam is so evidently concerned in explosive eruptions that many believe that lava is driven upward by the expansive force of the steam with which it is charged , much as a viscid liquid rises and boils over in a test tube or kettle. @# But in quiet eruptions , and still more in the irruption of intrusive sheets and masses , there is little if any evidence that steam is the driving force . It is therefore believed by many geologists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ STRESSES which squeezes molten rock from below into fissures and ducts in the crust . It is held by some that where considerable water is supplied to the rising column of lava , as from the ground water of the surrounding region , and where the lava is viscid so that steam does not readily escape , the eruption is of the explosive type ; when these conditions do not obtain , the lava outwells quietly , as in the Hawaiian volcanoes . It is held by others not only that volcanoes are due to the outflow of the earth ' s deep-seated heat , but also that the steam and other emitted gases are for the most part native to the earth ' s interior and never have had place in the circulation of atmospheric and ground waters. @# VOLCANIC ACTION AND DEFORMATION . Volcanoes do not occur on wide plains or among ancient mountains . On the other hand , where movements of the earth ' s crust are in progress in the uplift of high plateaus , and still more in mountain making , molten rock may reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forming great intrusive masses . Thus extensive lava flows accompanied the upheaval of the block mountains of western North America and the uplift of the Colorado plateau . A line of recent volcanoes may be traced along the system of rift valleys which extends from the Jordan and Dead Sea through eastern Africa to Lake Nyassa . The volcanoes of the Andes show how conspicuous volcanic action may be in young rising ranges . Folded mountains often show a core of igneous rock , which by long erosion has come to form the axis and the highest peaks of the range , as if the molten rock had been squeezed up under the rising upfolds . As we decipher the records of the rocks in historical geology we shall see more fully how , in all the past , volcanic action has characterized the periods of great crustal movements , and how it has been absent when and where the earth ' s crust has remained comparatively at rest. @# THE CAUSES OF DEFORMATION . As the earth ' s interior , or nucleus , is highly heated it must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crust and into space ; and since the nucleus is cooling it must also be contracting . The nucleus has contracted also because of the extrusion of molten matter , the loss of constituent gases given off in volcanic eruptions , and ( still more important ) the compression and consolidation of its material under gravity . As the nucleus contracts , it tends to draw away from the cooled and solid crust , and the latter settles , adapting itself to the shrinking nucleus much as the skin of a withering apple wrinkles down upon the shrunken fruit . The unsupported weight of the spherical crust develops enormous tangential pressures , similar to the stresses of an arch or dome , and when these lateral thrusts accumulate beyond the power of resistance the solid rock is warped and folded and broken. @# Since the planet attained its present mass it has thus been lessening in volume . Notwithstanding local and relative upheavals the earth ' s surface on the whole has drawn nearer and nearer to the center . The portions of the lithosphere which have been carried down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those portions which have been carried down the least have emerged as continents. @# Although it serves our convenience to refer the movements of the crust to the sea level as datum plane , it is understood that this level is by no means fixed . Changes in the ocean basins increase or reduce their capacity and thus lower or raise the level of the sea . But since these basins are connected , the effect of any change upon the water level is so distributed that it is far less noticeable than a corresponding change would be upon the land. @# @# @# CHAPTER XIII @# METAMORPHISM AND MINERAL VEINS @# Under the action of internal agencies rocks of all kinds may be rendered harder , more firmly cemented , and more crystalline . These processes are known as METAMORPHISM , and the rocks affected , whether originally sedimentary or igneous , are called METAMORPHIC ROCKS . We may contrast with metamorphism the action of external agencies in weathering , which render rocks less coherent by dissolving their soluble parts and breaking down their crystalline grains. @# CONTACT METAMORPHISM . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intrusions are found to be metamorphosed to various degrees by the heat of the cooling mass . The adjacent strata may be changed only in color , hardness , and texture . Thus , next to a dike , bituminous coal may be baked to coke or anthracite , and chalk and limestone to crystalline marble . Sandstone may be converted into quartzite , and shale into ARGILLITE , a compact , massive clay rock . New minerals may also be developed . In sedimentary rocks there may be produced crystals of mica and of GARNET ( a mineral as hard as quartz , commonly occurring in red , twelve-sided crystals ) . Where the changes are most profound , rocks may be wholly made over in structure and mineral composition. @# In contact metamorphism , thin sheets of molten rock produce less effect than thicker ones . The strongest heat effects are naturally caused by bosses and regional intrusions , and the zone of change about them may be several miles in width . In these changes heated waters and vapors from the masses of igneous rocks undoubtedly play a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the rocks about a closed dike in which lava began to cool as soon as it filled the fissure , or the rocks about a dike which opened on the surface and through which the molten rock flowed for some time ? @# Taking into consideration the part played by heated waters , which will produce the most far-reaching metamorphism , dikes which cut across the bedding planes or intrusive sheets which are thrust between the strata ? @# REGIONAL METAMORPHISM . Metamorphic rocks occur wide-spread in many regions , often hundreds of square miles in area , where such extensive changes can not be accounted for by igneous intrusions . Such are the dissected cores of lofty mountains , as the Alps , and the worn-down bases of ancient ranges , as in New England , large areas in the Piedmont Belt , and the Laurentian peneplain. @# In these regions the rocks have yielded to immense pressure . They have been folded , crumpled , and mashed , and even their minute grains , as one may see with a microscope , have often been puckered , broken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mechanical movements and strains which the rocks have suffered in every part that we may attribute their metamorphism , and the degree to which they have been changed is in direct proportion to the degree to which they have been deformed and mashed. @# Other factors , however , have played important parts . Rock crushing develops heat , and allows a freer circulation of heated waters and vapors . Thus chemical reactions are greatly quickened ; minerals are dissolved and redeposited in new positions , or their chemical constituents may recombine in new minerals , entirely changing the nature of the rock , as when , for example , feldspar recrystallizes as quartz and mica. @# Early stages of metamorphism are seen in SLATE . Pressure has hardened the marine muds , the arkose , or the volcanic ash from which slates are derived , and has caused them to cleave by the rearrangement of their particles. @# Under somewhat greater pressure , slate becomes PHYLLITE , a clay slate whose cleavage surfaces are lustrous with flat-lying mica flakes . The same pressure which has caused the rock to cleave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleavage planes to crystallize there as mica. @# FOLIATION . Under still stronger pressure the whole structure of the rock is altered . The minerals of which it is composed , and the new minerals which develop by heat and pressure , arrange themselves along planes of cleavage or of shear in rudely parallel leaves , or FOLIA . Of this structure , called FOLIATION , we may distinguish two types ,  --  a coarser feldspathic type , and a fine type in which other minerals than feldspar predominate. @# GNEISS is the general name under which are comprised coarsely foliated rocks banded with irregular layers of feldspar and other minerals . The gneisses appear to be due in many cases to the crushing and shearing of deep-seated igneous rocks , such as granite and gabbro. @# THE CRYSTALLINE SCHISTS , representing the finer types of foliation , consist of thin , parallel , crystalline leaves , which are often remarkably crumpled . These folia can be distinguished from the laminae of sedimentary rocks by their lenticular form and lack of continuity , and especially by the fact that they consist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rounded by wear. @# MICA SCHIST , the most common of schists , and in fact of all metamorphic rocks , is composed of mica and quartz in alternating wavy folia . All gradations between it and phyllite may be traced , and in many cases we may prove it due to the metamorphism of slates and shales . It is widespread in New England and along the eastern side of the Appalachians . TALC SCHIST consists of quartz and TALC , a light-colored magnesian mineral of greasy feel , and so soft that it can be scratched with the thumb nail. @# HORNBLENDE SCHIST , resulting in many cases from the foliation of basic igneous rocks , is made of folia of hornblende alternating with bands of quartz and feldspar . Hornblende schist is common over large areas in the Lake Superior region. @# QUARTZ SCHIST is produced from quartzite by the development of fine folia of mica along planes of shear . All gradations may be found between it and unfoliated quartzite on the one hand and mica schist on the other. @# Under the resistless pressure of crustal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all kinds , granites , diorites , and gabbros may be metamorphosed into schists by crushing and shearing . Limestones , however , are metamorphosed by pressure into marble , the grains of carbonate of lime recrystallizing freely to interlocking crystals of calcite. @# These few examples must suffice of the great class of metamorphic rocks . As we have seen , they owe their origin to the alteration of both of the other classes of rocks  --  the sedimentary and the igneous  --  by heat and pressure , assisted usually by the presence of water . The fact of change is seen in their hardness arid cementation , their more or less complete recrystallization , and their foliation ; but the change is often so complete that no trace of their original structure and mineral composition remains to tell whether the rocks from which they were derived were sedimentary or igneous , or to what variety of either of these classes they belonged. @# In many cases , however , the early history of a metamorphic rock can be deciphered . Fossils not wholly obliterated may prove it originally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ derivation from a conglomerate . Dikes of igneous rocks may be followed into a region where they have been foliated by pressure . The most thoroughly metamorphosed rocks may sometimes be traced out into unaltered sedimentary or igneous rocks , or among them may be found patches of little change where their history maybe read. @# Metamorphism is most common among rocks of the earlier geological ages , and most rare among rocks of recent formation . No doubt it is now in progress where deep-buried sediments are invaded by heat either from intrusive igneous masses or from the earth ' s interior , or are suffering slow deformation under the thrust of mountain-making forces. @# Suggest how rocks now in process of metamorphism may sometimes be exposed to view . Why do metamorphic rocks appear on the surface to-day ? @# MINERAL VEINS @# In regions of folded and broken rocks fissures are frequently found to be filled with sheets of crystalline minerals deposited from solution by underground water , and fissures thus filled are known as mineral veins . Much of the importance of mineral veins is due to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ native metals and metallic ores disseminated in fine particles , in strings , and sometimes in large masses in the midst of the valueless nonmetallic minerals which make up what is known as the VEIN STONE. @# The most common vein stones are QUARTZ and CALCITE . FLUORITE ( calcium fluoride ) , a mineral harder than calcite and crystallizing in cubes of various colors , and BARITE ( barium sulphate ) , a heavy white mineral , are abundant in many veins. @# The gold-bearing quartz veins of California traverse the metamorphic slates of the Sierra Nevada Mountains . Below the zone of solution ( p. 45 ) these veins consist of a vein stone of quartz mingled with pyrite ( p. 13 ) , the latter containing threads and grains of native gold . But to the depth of about fifty feet from the surface the pyrite of the vein has been dissolved , leaving a rusty , cellular quartz with grains of the insoluble gold scattered through it. @# The PLACER DEPOSITS of California and other regions are gold- bearing deposits of gravel and sand in river beds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near or upon the solid rock , and its grains , like those of the sand , are always rounded . How the gold came in the placers we may leave the pupil to suggest. @# Copper is found in a number of ores , and also in the native metal . Below the zone of surface changes the ore of a copper vein is often a double sulphide of iron and copper called CHALCOPYRITE , a mineral softer than pyrite  --  it can easily be scratched with a knife  --  and deeper yellow in color . For several score of feet below the ground the vein may consist of rusty quartz from which the metallic ores have been dissolved ; but at the base of the zone of solution we may find exceedingly rich deposits of copper ores ,  --  copper sulphides , red and black copper oxides , and green and blue copper carbonates , which have clearly been brought down in solution from the leached upper portion of the vein. @# ORIGIN OF MINERAL VEINS . Both vein stones and ores have been deposited slowly from solution in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sides of a jar of saturated brine . In our study of underground water we learned that it is everywhere circulating through the permeable rocks of the crust , descending to profound depths under the action of gravity and again driven to the surface by hydrostatic pressure . Now fissures , wherever they occur , form the trunk channels of the underground circulation . Water descends from the surface along these rifts ; it moves laterally from either side to the fissure plane , just as ground water seeps through the surrounding rocks from every direction to a well ; and it ascends through these natural water ways as in an artesian well , whenever they intersect an aquifer in which water is under hydrostatic pressure. @# The waters which deposit vein stones and ores are commonly hot , and in many cases they have derived their heat from intrusions of igneous rock still uncooled within the crust . The solvent power of the water is thus greatly increased , and it takes up into solution various substances from the igneous and sedimentary rocks which it traverses . For various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ores and vein stones . On rising through the fissure the water cools and loses pressure , and its capacity to hold minerals in solution is therefore lessened . Besides , as different currents meet in the fissure , some ascending , some descending , and some coming in from the sides , the chemical reaction of these various weak solutions upon one another and upon the walls of the vein precipitates the minerals of vein stuffs and ores. @# As an illustration of the method of vein deposits we may cite the case of a wooden box pipe used in the Comstock mines , Nevada , to carry the hot water of the mine from one level to another , which in ten years was lined with calcium carbonate more than half an inch thick. @# The Steamboat Springs , Nevada , furnish examples of mineral veins in process of formation . The steaming water rises through fissures in volcanic rocks and is now depositing in the rifts a vein stone of quartz , with metallic ores of iron , mercury , lead , and other metals. @# RECONCENTRATION . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often stored with exceptionally large and valuable ore deposits . This local enrichment of the vein is due to the reconcentration of its metalliferous ores . As the surface of the land is slowly lowered by weathering and running water , the zone of solution is lowered at an equal rate and encroaches constantly on the zone of cementation . The minerals of veins are therefore constantly being dissolved along their upper portions and carried down the fissures by ground water to lower levels , where they are redeposited. @# Many of the richest ore deposits are thus due to successive concentrations : the ores were leached originally from the rocks to a large extent by laterally seeping waters ; they were concentrated in the ore deposits of the vein chiefly by ascending currents ; they have been reconcentrated by descending waters in the way just mentioned. @# THE ORIGINAL SOURCE OF THE METALS . It is to the igneous rocks that we may look for the original source of the metals of veins . Lavas contain minute percentages of various metallic compounds , and no doubt this was the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crust . By the erosion of the igneous rocks the metals have been distributed among sedimentary strata , and even the sea has taken into solution an appreciable amount of gold and other metals , but in this widely diffused condition they are wholly useless to man . The concentration which has made them available is due to the interaction of many agencies . Earth movements fracturing deeply the rocks of the crust , the intrusion of heated masses , the circulation of underground waters , have all cooperated in the concentration of the metals of mineral veins. @# While fissure veins are the most important of mineral veins , the latter term is applied also to any water way which has been filled by similar deposits from solution . Thus in soluble rocks , such as limestones , joints enlarged by percolating water are sometimes filled with metalliferous deposits , as , for example , the lead and zinc deposits of the upper Mississippi valley . Even a porous aquifer may be made the seat of mineral deposits , as in the case of some copper-bearing and silver-bearing sandstones of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @# CHAPTER XIV @# THE GEOLOGICAL RECORD @# WHAT A FORMATION RECORDS . We have already learned that each individual body of stratified rock , or formation , constitutes a record of the time when it was laid . The structure and the character of the sediments of each formation tell whether the area was land or sea at the time when they were spread ; and if the former , whether the land was river plain , or lake bed , or was covered with wind-blown sands , or by the deposits of an ice sheet . If the sediments are marine , we may know also whether they were laid in shoal water near the shore or in deeper water out at sea , and whether during a period of emergence , or during a period of subsidence when the sea transgressed the land . By the same means each formation records the stage in the cycle of erosion of the land mass from which its sediments were derived . An unconformity between two marine formations records the fact that between the periods when they were deposited in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The attitude and structure of the strata tell also of the foldings and fractures , the deformation and the metamorphism , which they have suffered ; and the igneous rocks associated with them as lava flows and igneous intrusions add other details to the story . Each formation is thus a separate local chapter in the geological history of the earth , and its strata are its leaves . It contains an authentic record of the physical conditions  --  the geography  --  of the time and place when and where its sediments were laid. @# PAST CYCLES OF EROSION . These chapters in the history of the planet are very numerous , although much of the record has been destroyed in various ways . A succession of different formations is usually seen in any considerable section of the crust , such as a deep canyon or where the edges of upturned strata are exposed to view on the flanks of mountain ranges ; and in any extensive area , such as a state of the Union or a province of Canada , the number of formations outcropping on the surface is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is made up for. the most part of old continental deltas . Some , recently emerged as the strata of young coastal plains , are the records of recent cycles of erosion ; while others were deposited in the early history of the earth , and in many instances have been crumpled into mountains , which afterwards were leveled to their bases and lowered beneath the sea to receive a cover of later sediments before they were again uplifted to form land. @# The cycle of erosion now in progress and recorded in the layers of stratified rock being spread beneath the sea in continental deltas has therefore been preceded by many similar cycles . Again and again movements of the crust have brought to an end one cycle  --  sometimes when only well under way , and sometimes when drawing toward its close  --  and have begun another . Again and again they have added to the land areas which before were sea , with all their deposition records of earlier cycles , or have lowered areas of land beneath the sea to receive new sediments. @# THE AGE OF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exposed upon the eroded surface of the continents is very great . In the Appalachian region the strata are seven or eight miles thick , and still greater thicknesses have been measured in several other mountain ranges . The aggregate thickness of all the formations of the stratified rocks of the earth ' s crust , giving to each formation its maximum thickness wherever found , amounts to not less than forty miles . Knowing how slowly sediments accumulate upon the sea floor , we must believe that the successive cycles which the earth has seen stretch back into a past almost inconceivably remote , and measure tens of millions and perhaps even hundreds of millions of years. @# HOW THE FORMATIONS ARE CORRELATED AND THE GEOLOGICAL RECORD MADE UP . Arranged in the order of their succession , the formations of the earth ' s crust would constitute a connected record in which the geological history of the planet may be read , and therefore known as the GEOLOGICAL RECORD . But to arrange the formations in their natural order is not an easy task . A complete set of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no single region . Their leaves and chapters are scattered over the land surface of the globe . In one area certain chapters may be found , though perhaps with many missing leaves , and with intervening chapters wanting , and these absent parts perhaps can be supplied only after long search through many other regions. @# Adjacent strata in any region are arranged according to the LAW OF SUPERPOSITION , i. e. any stratum is younger than that on which it was deposited , just as in a pile of paper , any sheet was laid later than that on which it rests . Where rocks have been disturbed , their original attitude must be determined before the law can be applied . Nor can the law of superposition be used in identifying and comparing the strata of different regions where the formations can not be traced continuously from one region to the other. @# The formations of different regions are arranged in their true order by the LAW OF INCLUDED ORGANISMS ; i. e. formations , however widely separated , which contain a similar assemblage of fossils are equivalent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The correlation of formations by means of fossils may be explained by the formations now being deposited about the north Atlantic . Lithologically they are extremely various . On the continental shelf of North America limestones of different kinds are forming off Florida , and sandstones and shales from Georgia northward . Separated from them by the deep Atlantic oozes are other sedimentary deposits now accumulating along the west coast of Europe . If now all these offshore formations were raised to open air , how could they be correlated ? Surely not by lithological likeness , for in this respect they would be quite diverse . All would be similar , however , in the fossils which they contain . Some fossil species would be identical in all these formations and others would be closely allied . Making all due allowance for differences in species due to local differences in climate and other physical causes , it would still be plain that plants and animals so similar lived at the same period of time , and that the formations in which their remains were imbedded were contemporaneous in a broad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other marine mammals would prove that the strata were laid after the appearance of mammals upon earth , and imbedded relics of man would give a still closer approximation to their age . In the same way we correlate the earlier geological formations. @# For example , in 1902 there were collected the first fossils ever found on the antarctic continent . Among the dozen specimens obtained were some fossil ammonites ( a family of chambered shells ) of genera which are found on other continents in certain formations classified as the Cretaceous system , and which occur neither above these formations nor below them . On the basis of these few fossils we may be confident that the strata in which they were found in the antarctic region were laid in the same period of geologic time as were the Cretaceous rocks of the United States and Canada. @# THE RECORD AS A TIME SCALE . By means of the law of included organisms and the law of superposition the formations of different countries and continents are correlated and arranged in their natural order . When the geological record is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scale for geological history . Geological time is separated into divisions corresponding to the times during which the successive formations were laid . The largest assemblages of formations are known as groups , while the corresponding divisions of time are known as eras . Groups are subdivided into systems , and systems into series . Series are divided into stages and substages ,  --  subdivisions which do not concern us in this brief treatise . The corresponding divisions of time are given in the following table. @# STRATA TIME Group Era System Period Series Epoch @# The geologist is now prepared to read the physical history  --  the geographical development  --  of any country or of any continent by means of its formations , when he has given each formation its true place in the geological record as a time scale. @# The following chart exhibits the main divisions of the record , the name given to each being given also to the corresponding time division . Thus we speak of the CAMBRIAN SYSTEM , meaning a certain succession of formations which are classified together because of broad resemblances in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time during which these rocks were deposited. @# Group and Era System and Period Series and Epoch @# Quaternary  --   --  - Recent Cenozoic  --   --   --  Pleistocene Tertiary  --   --   --  - Pliocene Miocene Eocene Cretaceous Mesozoic  --   --   --  Jurassic Triassic @# Permian Carboniferous  --  Pennsylvanian Mississippian Paleozoic  --   --  - Devonian Silurian Ordovician Cambrian @# Algonkian Archean @# FOSSILS AND WHAT THEY TEACH @# The geological formations contain a record still more important than that of the geographical development of the continents ; the fossils imbedded in the rocks of each formation tell of the kinds of animals and plants which inhabited the earth at that time , and from these fossils we are therefore able to construct the history of life upon the earth. @# FOSSILS . These remains of organisms are found in the strata in all degrees of perfection , from trails and tracks and fragmentary impressions , to perfectly preserved shells , wood , bones , and complete skeletons . As a rule , it is only the hard parts of animals and plants which have left any traces in the rocks . Sometimes the original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been replaced by some less soluble material . Petrifaction , as this process of slow replacement is called , is often carried on in the most exquisite detail . When wood , for example , is undergoing petrifaction , the woody tissue may be replaced , particle by particle , by silica in solution through the action of underground waters , even the microscopic structures of the wood being perfectly reproduced . In shells originally made of ARAGONITE , a crystalline form of carbonate of lime , that mineral is usually replaced by CALCITE , a more stable form of the same substance . The most common petrifying materials are calcite , silica , and pyrite. @# Often the organic substance has neither been preserved nor replaced , but the FORM has been retained by means of molds and casts . Permanent impressions , or molds , may be made in sediments not only by the hard parts of organisms , but also by such soft and perishable parts as the leaves of plants , and , in the rarest instances , by the skin of animals and the feathers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been retained. @# The different kinds of molds and casts may be illustrated by means of a clam shell and some moist clay , the latter representing the sediments in which the remains of animals and plants are entombed . Imbedding the shell in the clay and allowing the clay to harden , we have a MOLD OF THE EXTERIOR of the shell , as is seen on cutting the clay matrix in two and removing the shell from it .
