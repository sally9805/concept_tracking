With incomplete returns , the general result of Tuesday 's elections yet appears unquestioned . The Republicans hold the House , though by a greatly reduced and narrow majority . The Democrats fought in some States with unexpected spirit and success ; they lost heavily in others through unexampled folly of leadership . Col. Gaston in Massachusetts cut deeply into the Republican majority , and made a run which recalls the days of the lamented William E. Russell . In Ohio a veritable cyclone ha 's blown over the circus tent of the grotesque Tom Johnson . Bryan 's ostentatious endorsement of him was the one thing needed to complete his ruin . And , finally , the sarcophagus of free silver was freshly weighted with lead in Colorado , that State having apparently gone Republican and retired Teller , Bryanite Congressmen , and all their works . We consider the net result , which is of the nature of a check and warning to the Republicans , wholesome . It shows that the Spanish war is over . No more sweeping victories are to be won by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unthinking cries about our " unparalleled prosperity " longer suffice . If a " calamity howler " is a nuisance , a " prosperity yawper " is an affliction . His day is passing . The party has had notice that , in order to retain the confidence of the country , it must address itself to the questions of social injustice and class favoritism which are pressing for solution . In this State , those who believed that Coles had more than a fighting chance Of election , even as Hill 's dummy , have been justified . Governor Odell is re-Sleeted by a much reduced and feeble plurality Mayor Low , on his part , will find food for reflection in the enormous Tammany vote , which indicates a widespread dissatisfaction with his nine-months ' Administration . Truly gratifying is the defeat of Judge Werner for the Court of Appeals , and of Attorney-General Davies , President Roosevelt 's unworthy candidate for the Supreme Court in the Fifth Judicial District . The significance of the vote should not fail to penetrate the skin of Judge Werner , and make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wreak the narrow and contemptible revenge of one boss upon another . As for Platt , no happening of recent years has been such a direct slap in his face . Among the many examples of nonpartisan - voting - which , the elections afforded , none was more inspiriting than the defeat of Major Carl Lentz , the Republican candidate for Sheriff of Essex County , New Jersey . All of his colleagues on the Republican County ticket won by majorities in the thousands , so that the discrimination against him was as marked as that against Judge Werner in this city . This rebuke was the more signal because every effort had been made to bolster up Major Lentz 's candidacy . Everybody knew , from his standing apology during the campaign , that he presented as arguments for his election , besides his services in building up the county machine , chiefly his personal poverty and his wounds during the civil war , while he glozed over the most notable feature of his public record , namely , the court judgment pronounced upon him for the appropriation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State , the Attorney-General , the United States Senator , and other prominent Republicans accepted the unfit candidate , personally interested themselves in his canvass , and sympathized with him in his defeat . The voters , however , by their exemplary repudiation of the sophism that by receiving a party nomination a man too bad to be nominated becomes fit to be voted for , have done much to elevate the public tone of the State . President Roosevelt 's ante-election expression of " keen interest " in Republican success was , of course , only the perfunctory official announcement always expected from the titular head of the party . His friends could wish , for his own sake , that he had not made special mention of the contest for the Governorship in Pennsylvania as one of the struggles in which he hoped the Republicans would win . This was to express the hope that a corrupt and debasing tyranny against which . the best citizens of Pennsylvania are fighting , might be fastened upon them for two years more .

Secretary Moody made a speech at Chelsea , Massachusetts , on Thursday evening , on the tariff question . He held the Democrats up to scorn for their opposition to reciprocity ; which he said was a Republican doctrine . In the same speech , he referred to reciprocity with Canada , which , he said , found many advocates in Massachusetts , though none made a definite proposition for reciprocity with the Dominion " which an American who believed in protection could accept . " A treaty of that kind he would ardently support , but he did not say what kind of treaty a believer in protection could accept . Apparently , it would be a treaty which nobody objected to , as , for example , admitting from Canada all articles now on the free list in exchange for a similar concession on the part of Canada . But it would never do to admit barley , or wool , or iron ore , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that country , because some Americans who believe in protection could not stand that . Similarly , Canadians who believe in protection could not accept a treaty which admitted boots and shoes , hardware , cotton and woollen cloth , and many other products of Massachusetts . Mr. Moody 's objection to reciprocity with Canada is the same as Mr. Lodge 's objection to reciprocity with France . The treaty is inadmissible because it offends some particular producer of something . In short , " reciprocity is essentially a Republican doctrine , " as Mr. Moody says , but there is no place for it to begin . In his speech at Dorchester , on Monday week , Senator Hoar made use of an expression which betrays a very imperfect conception of the financial disasters of 1893-6 , which he helped to precipitate . The " hard times which President Cleveland brought on , " in the Senator 's phrase , are those which became acute very soon after his second inauguration as President . That event took place on March 4 , 1893 . When he entered office , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " in the Treasury . By free gold is meant gold over and above the $100,000,000 at that time " reserved for the redemption of United States notes . " He found the Government facing a deficit . The revenue had been cut down some $60,000 , - 000 by the McKinley tariff , and we were spending $50,000,000 per year for silver bullion under the Sherman act  --  both of which were Republican measures , and passed by Republican votes . The panic began in June , 1893 . It was the natural consequence of the Sherman act , and of the silver legislation that preceded it . President Cleveland 's first step was to call an extra session of Congress to repeal the Sherman law . Was it in that way that Mr. Cleveland brought on the hard times ? Is it Senator Hoar 's opinion that the panic of 1893 was brought on by the man who caused the Sherman act to be repealed ? Did Mr. Cleveland cause the Sherman act to be passed in 1890 , or was Mr. Hoar himself , in conjunction with Sen. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaSurO ? The Commercial West of Minneapolis thinks that Secretary Shaw 's speaking tour hai been open to criticism , not because he has been seen repeatedly on the stump , but because the things he has said there have not been directed to the right end . " Instead of urging financial reform through legislation , " it says , " he has pursued policies as Secretary which will probably tend to delay reform , for he has boldly demonstrated that awkward laws can be circumvented , or even almost directly disobeyed ; and when this can be done , why bother to change them ? " The Minneapolis paper refers , no doubt , to the Secretary 's declaration . that the banks need not keep any cash reserve against Government deposits , and to the advice he gave to collectors of customs to expedite the importation of anthracite coal . The latter intimation seems to have fallen upon willing ears , since anthracite is coming in daily from Wales without any analysis to determine its percentage of fixed carbon . This is very much for the public convenience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship till a chemist can ascertain whether the coal is dutiable or not would be simply maddening to a community suffering for want of fuel , yet that is what the law contemplates . Its words are not susceptible of any other interpretation . It is of the same character as many other schedules which require scientific treatment of the article imported , as , for example , the counting of the number of threads in a square inch of cloth and the determination of the nature of threads , whether wool or cotton etc . The shortest way to untie this knot is to repeal the duties on coal altogether . It is reported that President Roosevelt favors this course . Secretary Shaw will probably concur in that policy when he comes to survey the situation calmly as it affects himself . " Mitchell Day " was celebrated in the anthracite fields on Wednesday of last week by general idleness , a monster procession , brass bands , speeches , and the like . One can not but think this jubilation iliztimed , and the manner of it strangely at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it bore . No one has been more lavish of sympathy for the coalless public than Mr. Mitchell , nobody knows better that mining is so far in arrear that every day 's work before severe cold comes is worth a week later in the season . Everybody knows that such a demonstration as last week 's means for many of its participants at least two days of idleness . In view of these facts , Mr. Mitchell might have made a wise and graceful use of his power by postponing the holiday , urging the return to labor of the 20 per cent . of miners still unemployed , and the signalizing of " Mitchell Day " by an extraordinary production of coal . If this were too much magnanimity and - wisdom toexpect of a labor leader flushed with success , it would none the less have been the surest way of commending Mr. Mitchell and his cause to the proprietors of some millions of ill-stocked or empty coal bins , who , as it is , can only pro-test " There is a public mischief in your mirth " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mitchell , " was the inscription on one of the banners borne in the " Mitchell Day " jollification . It was generous in the miners not to put Mitchell 's name first . Mr. Roosevelt plainly endeavored to be entirely impartial , as between miners of the Arbitration Commission . It was inevitable , however , that his intervention should have been felt by the strikers to be a powerful weapon placed in their grasp . They certainly chose an unfortunate time and mode for showing their gratitude . With the country still crying aloud for coal , on the edge of winter , the workers snapped their fingers in the faces of the mine superintendents , threw down their tools , and went off for a day 's merry-making . Thus we have already in evidence the headstrong insubordination and defiance of discipline which have made the Union so difficult a body to deal with . Doubtless the members all feel now a.perfect right to say , as many of them in the past have impudently said to their employers , " We are not working for you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between President Roosevelt 's intervention in the coal strike and the effort of the French Government to bring about arbitration between the owners and the striking miners of Pas de Calais , is obvious and direct . Indeed , Mr. Roosevelt 's example was openly adduced by Socialist orators in the Chamber . Why could not their Government come forward in the benevolent and effective manner of the American President ? It is one proof more how small the world has become . Countries are now only as so many adjoining parishes , and what occurs in one is at once gossiped about and applied in the others . The pressure put upon the French Premier to imitate President Roosevelt is also a very sobering indication of the immense extension of the powers of Government which we are in for if this sort of thing goes on . Presidents and monarchs and party leaders will have to become Great Fathers of all their people , and will be held angrily to account if anything goes wrong anywhere . Government as an earthly providence , instead of a guarantee that all citizens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will be a new conception for Anglo-Saxons , and will involve vast changes for them . Butwe may take courage by reflecting that , as Sir Leslie Stephen says , people are saved by being illogical . They take each case simply by itself , and refuse to carry out a principle to its legitimate consequences . The President may elect to wash his hands of the next big strike , and then we should have a prdcedent on that side . Little that is new is contained in the statement of the case of the anthracite miners , which was published on Tuesday . We presume that their assertions are supported  --  or that the attempt is made to support them  --  by detailed figures . In the absence of complete statistics , it - would be impossible to say whether their claims have a foundation in fact . One point of theirs is , we suppose , not open to doubt . This is , that the cost of the necessaries of life has so increased under our belauded prosperity that workmen at fixed wages are worse off than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In their appeal for recognition of the Mine Workers ' Union as promotive of " discipline " and efficiency , there seems to be a touch of sardonic humor . With 123 local strikes in 1901 , though the Union was under agreement to keep at work and control its men , it is hard to see how this claim could have been put forward solemnly by Mr. Mitchell . He must have had at least a concealed grin . In his argument for collective bargaining between the men and the operators , he once more comes irresistibly up to the inference that the Union ought not to ask for a contract until it is incorporated and made legally responsible . Mr. Mitchell does not draw this inference , I but others will . It is made compulsory by the whole situation . A test is now to be made of the validity under the Federal Constitution of the " grandfather " clause which- has been adopted by most of the States that have attempted to disfranchise the negro . This is the clause , inserted in the Constitutions of Mississippi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which exempts persons whose fathers or grandfathers were voters before the civil war , from franchise disqualifications based on literacy or property holdings . In other words , it is the clause on which registration boards can rely to reject all negro voters in whose reading , writing , or interpretation of legal phrases from the Constitution they can pick a flaw , while permitting white illiterates to register and vote in spite of their ignorance . The " grandfather " clause was not a necessary part of the plans for negro disfranchisement . The negro vote as an important factor in the South has been effectively eliminated by means of educational and property requithements which. , however wise or unwise they may be , are of undoubted legality if applied with equal justice to all . The tests provided for the negro , however , would logically have disfranchised illiterate white voters also . To prevent this , and to defeat the requirements of equal justice in the application of the suffrage qualifications , the grandfather clause was devised . The question which the United States Supreme Court will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not , then . whether- a State may restrict its elective franchise , but rather whether it may apply a restriction to one class of its citizens and not to another . The nineteenth annual report of the United States Civil Service Commission records considerable progress . The rural free-delivery service of the Post-Office , a portion of the field services of the War Department , the permanent Census Office employees , and the clerks appointed for temporary duty during the war with Spain , are now all included in the competitive system . It is true that these employees got in by favor , but it is certainly a distinct gain to have the bars up now , even if the pastures are filled with henchmen . The increase of the Commission 's business is best indicated by the fact that 62,029 persons were examined and 14,983 appointed - to office The Commission lays down excellent rules in regard to the partisan activity of office-holders , maintaining that in the classified service appointees should express their political feelings privately and take no part in campaigns . In the case of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must not coerce their subordinates , or use their offices to control political movements or influence elections . Fourth-class postmasters , however , the Commission believes , should not be treated in the same way as the head of a great Federal office . But the Commission should not forget that the sole Federal official of a small village is often as influential in his smaller sphere as the great office-holder in his , and that the retention by the village postmaster of his party leadership frequently gives rise to abuses . If the Commission really wishes to strike a magnificent blow for the principle of non-interference by officeholders , it can do so by prosecuting Senator Quay for his flagrant violations of the Civil-Service Law . - A statement from the office of the City Comptroller shows that the budget of Greater New York for the ensuing year will be $1,545,534 less than it was last year , and that this reduction is due to the practical extinction of the direct State tax for the ensuing year . If we take into account the increase of local expenses caused by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduction in the budget due to the lessened State tax is $3,965,000 . This in its turn is largely accounted for by the fact that there was a surplus in the State Treasury from former years amounting to $9,789,351 . The Governor referred to this surplus in his last annual message , and recommended that the sum of $4,200,000 from the fund should be used the present year . By so doing , he said , the direct State tax could be reduced to 13-100 of a mill , which the Constitution requires to be levied for the sinking fund and interest on the canal debt There would still be a surplus in the Treasury of upwards of $4,000,000 , which might be considered a fair working balance to avoid the necessity of loans in anticipation of tax receipts . The showing is very satisfactory , as far as it goes , but it must be remembered that a surplus can be used only once , and that the problem of abolishing the direct State tax is not yet solved , although encouraging progress has been made in that direction . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stop to the constant and progressive demoralization of the public mind by vulgar , morbid , and impure plays ; but the reputed scheme of the Church Club and the ' Actors ' Church Alliance to reform by means of boycott , with clergymen acting as moral walking delegates , does not inspire much confidence . All decent people , and all true friends of the stage , will sympathize with these enthusiastic gentlemen and " wish them every success , but there is grave reason to doubt whether much good can be done by laborious personal advertisement of the fact that this or that play is so shocking that modest persons ought to stay away from it . In some cases , no doubt , the warning would be effective ; but , unfortunately , the more energetic the crusade , the more notorious would become the cause of offence , and to make a vicious piece notorious is to play right into the hands of the managers . Is it so certain , moreover , that clergymen , as a rule , are the best judges of tilt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , as a matter of fact , almost proverbial that they are easily beguiled by a little mock religious sentiment , and that they have frequently extended valuable countenance and support to very flagrant theatrical impostures ? Plays like " The Sign of the Cross " and " The Christian , " not to mention a host of others , in which the attempt has been made to give a religious flavor to cheap and meretricious melodrama , have never experienced any difficulty in securing clerical commendation , sometimes in very unexpected quarters . There are , we believe , a considerable number of clergymen of different denominations who even to-day are in favor of public representations of the Passion Play , and are convinced that the result would be widespread spiritual regeneration . It is encouraging to hear from an unbiassed observer of Cuban affairs that the outlook for the island is distinctly promising , despite the present stagnation in the Cuban sugar trade . The Chairman of the Cuban Central Railways made this statement in London on Thursday , and added that , from the point of view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proceeding most satisfactorily . Our own advices from Havana confirm this optimistic view . The sugar growers believe that the coming winter will be better than the last , and the price of sugar has risen slightly . Not so much planting as usual has been done during the present season , but the low . rate of wages now prevailing has enabled the work to be done more cheaply than in the past , which will help the plantation owners a good deal . President Palma shows that the Government has $1,500,000 in the treasury , and more money is being collected at the Custom-house than during the corresponding period in the American occupation . The Government , too , is spending less money than did the extravagant and wasteful administration of Gen Wood . In Havana the sanitary conditions continue favorable . It is all the more to be regretted , therefore , that reports from Santiago and Cienfuegos indicate a retrogression in the matter of sanitation and general cleanliness . The action of the South Kensington Museum in refusing longer to harbor certain loaned exhibits puts the lenders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more can be made of the affair than that . Collectors are naturally glad to save storage and insurance charges while exhibiting their collections to art lovers at no inconvenience to themselves , and museums are glad to get temporary exhibitions of high quality . The collectors are perfectly able to pay for the cost of storing their objects of art ; and the museums , as their permanent exhibits increase , can naturally give less space to loans . Some of the American collectors , however , whose pictures have been long at the South Kensington Museum , must choose between burying works of great interest in storage warehouses , or paying the oppressive Dingley duties , which thus not only deprive us in America of art treasures that should naturally be ours , but also affect the art situation abroad . There is a palpable absurdity in legislation that further enriches through American money the private houses and warehouses of a city which is already as regards art one of the richest cities in the world .
