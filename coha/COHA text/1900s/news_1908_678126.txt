txt According to Dr. ANDREW S. DRAPER , Commissioner of Education for the State of New York , there is something very like a revolution impending in our public education . " When but one-third of the children remain to the end of the elementary course , " he tells us , " in a country where education is such a passion , there is something the matter with the schools . " What the matter is , he thinks , is a lack of " sufficient articulation between the educational and the industrial systems of the country . " Our elementary schools train for no industrial employments . They lead to nothing but the secondary school , which in turn leads to the college , the university , and the professional school , and so very exclusively to professional occupations . One who goes out of the school system at the end of the elementary school is not only unprepared for any vocation which will be open to him , but too commonly he is without that intellectual training which should make him eager for opportunity and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as he can whatever may open to him . He goes without respect for the manual industries , where he might find work if he could do it . Dr. DRAPER thinks that It is time to organize a wholly new form of schools as a part of the public system , involvine two classes , " one to train all-around mechanics for work in factories , where each is a part of an oreanization , and where much machinerer is used  --  these to be known as factory schools ; the other to train mechanics to work independently , mainly with their own tools , and without much machinery  --  these to be known as trade schools . " These schools are not primarily to quicken mentality nor to develop culture ; those things will come , as far as is well , ip the regular order . They are not , to train mechanical or electrical engineers ; the literary and technical schools I are doing that very amply . They are not even to develop foremen ; these will develop themselves , for they will forge ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assiduity , and force . The schools are to contain nothing which naturally leads away from the ? shop . They are to train workmen to do better work that they may earn more bread and butter . This Is a significant statement for an expert in the position of Dr. DRAPER . He is a man of wide and long experience . He knows our schools extremely well , not only the city schools , but those of rural districts and of other States , as well as the colleges and universiti ? - 3s . It will be noted that his criticism is not directed to the high schools chiefly , though it applies to them , but to the elementary schools in which pupils below 13 usually are trained . He finds In the elementary schools as great a percentage of falling out before finishing the course as in the high schools , so It Is the general rule that hardly more than 10 per cent . of the children entering the elementary schools reach the close of the high school course . Considering how schooling increases in cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ privilege for the minority with a vengeance . We have no hesitation In saying that the general remedy proposed by Dr. DRAPER is in the line of the popular needs and the rights of the majority . Our schools ought to have " articulation " with the industrial life of the people for the very simple reason that the great mass of the pupils must enter that industrial life . It is not necessary to ignore this fact in order to give to the higher education its full value . That education is of very great influence for those who can get it and will take it . But it is education for a small , a very small , proportion of the children of the Nation , and it is absurd that the schooling of the vast remainder should be shaped exclusively toward ends which only the few can hope to reach . Breadwinning is not only a necessary occupation , but also one in preparing for which talent and character can and ought to be developed and trained . The best teaching for pupils of any age is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid , and this is as true of teaching with regard to occupation as it is of any other . The current notion that pay and standing should be low in the ratio of the youth of pupils is an error , and the application of it to our system has turned it topsy-turvy . Dr. DRAPER 'S suggestion is calculated to right it .
