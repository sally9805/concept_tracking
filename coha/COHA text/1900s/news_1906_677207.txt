txt On behalf of his father , John A. McCall , whose recovery from his present illness is now pronounced impossible by the attending physicians , John C. McCall , his son , issued a statement to-night conveying a message which the elder Mr. McCall wished to give to the public . It is a declaration that John A. McCall still holds a close and brotherly friendship for Andrew Hamilton ; that the elder McCall appeared before the Insurance Investigating Committee and offered to refund the Hamilton payments " in defiance " of the Directors of the New York Life Insurance Company ; denying the statements that Mr. McCall 's troubles as President of the New York Life or his financial transactions with Judge Hamilton are in any way responsible for his illness ; that at no time has Mr. McCall 's mind been clouded , and that his intellect is as clear to-night as it was ten years ago . Young Mr. McCall , with noticeable emotion , announced that it would be his father 's last word to the public . " Father wished me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " by reason of the fact that many of the newspapers have distorted the facts concerning his condition to such an extent that he deems it wise to issue it . I want to say at the outset that at no time has father 's mind been clouded . He has full possession of all his mental faculties and talks and thinks as clearly as ever . " He realizes his precarious condition , talks about it , and is resigned . He is prepared to die . I talked with him at length this morning and he wants the public to understand a few things which will perhaps interest all and clear up some misunderstanding and confusion . We all appreciate the gravity of his condition , except Mrs. McCall , who does not understand that the end is near . Father said to me this morning : " ' I realize that I 'm a very sick man , and that I 'm facing death . If it Is God 's will that I should go I 'm ready . I have lived a clean life . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it best . 1Co man , woman , or child can say that I ever wronged him or her , as the case may be . I have never harmed any one . ' " Young Mr. aICCall paused a moment before he was able to continue . Then he went on : " Father wishes it to be clearly understood that Ins condition is not due in any way whatsoever to any of the developments of the insurance investigation or to the facts which came out respecting his relations with Andrew Hamilton . Deny that , if you please , in the most emphatic terms . His illness is due to causes to which any other man 's ailments may be attributed . His troubles in insurance have no bearing on the case . " Now respecting the matter of the relations between father and Judge Hamilton . He desires that it shall be known that in his last moments he reposes full and absolute faith in his old and good friend Andrew ' Hamilton . My father has the greatest love for and confidence in him . He told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be so . " That love and confidence was never so great as it is now , and if my father were to make his will to-night he would be glad of an opportunity to make Judge Hamilton one of his executors . Father never dreamed of anything wrong in his relations with Judge Hamilton . He has the fullest confidence , respect , admiration , and loyalty for this , his true friend , and wants to be recorded as saying so to-night . " Speaking for myself I have known Andrew Hamilton since I was a bay at his knee . I know him to be an honest man . It was at my suggestion that I went abroad to see Mr. Hamilton . I offered the idea to my father and he agreed to the plan . When I returned with my report I showed it to father and he was then a very sick man . But the report had a wonderful effect . It cheered him up and he felt better . " Mr. McCall then spoke of his father 's offer to make restitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my father offered to pay back the moneys which had been handed to Judge Hamilton , " he said , " he did so in plain and open defiance of the Directors of the New York Life Insurance Company . They did not want him to do it . They advised him not to do it . But he did n't want such a load upon his shoulders , and therefore offered to make restitution . " Father is not a wealthy man by any means . While he drew a good salary as President of the New York Life , he had many expenses , and he lived up to almost every cent of it . In addition to this , he paid $25,000 a year to the New York Life Insurance Company in insurance premi-1 In speaking of his father 's ailment , Mr. McCall said : " He is suffering from liver complaint . The exact nature of the sickness is not known . It is a complication which the physicians have been unable to solve . They do n't know exactly what it is , and therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If they did there would perhaps be some chance of father 's recovery . But his illness has not impaired his intellect and he is as bright and cheerful as could be expected under the circumstances . Several of us talked with him this morning , and he was resigned to the end , which must come soon . " What he wishes to deny most specifically and most emphatically is that the Andrew Hamilton incident or the insurance matter generally is responsible for his condition . He is satisfied with the . manner in which he has lived , and feels that he has done no one a wrong . I hope that it will be my lot to live as clean a life as father 's . " Mr. McCall 's physicians hold out no hope to-night of his ultimate recovery . They say that his life hangs in the balance , and that while he may live for days or weeks he may pass away at any moment . It was said that Mr McCall had a sinking spell this morning but rallied , and to-night is resting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ St. Michael 's Cathedral of West End , N. J. , called on Mr. McCall to-night and remained with him for an hour . He said that Mr. McCall was at rest and his condition was not immediately dangerous .
