txt Norman Hapgood , editor of Collier 's Weekly , was acquitted yesterday of the charge of criminal libel preferred by Justice Joseph M. Deuel of the Court of Special Sessions . The Jury was out seven minutes . It Is understood that the Jurors Would not have left their seats at all had it not been for the fact that one of their number felt ill and wanted a breath of fresh air . Justice Deuel was not on hand to hear the verdict ; it was said that he was III of nervous prostration  --  too ill to see any one  --  but that he had been informed of the result of the trial . Lest evening , however , Mrs , Deuel denied to a Tuxes reporter at the Justices home that the'JUSdee was ill . CoL William D. Mann , editor of Town Topics , against which Mr. Hapgoocre article in Collier 's was directed as much as it was against Justice Benet , was in court and received the verdict with composure . Edward Lauterbach was in consultation with CoL Mann in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by friends . as soon as the Jury was discharged by Justice Fitzgerald , and congratulated on the outcome of the case . Among the first to shake his hand were his wife and District Attorney Jerome , who had prosecuted him . Mr. Hapgood ( who had written that Town Topics was a publication which printed scandal about people who were not cowardly enough to pay for silence and that it was disgraceful for Justice Deuel to be connected with it ) said that the verdict was no more than he had looked for . Edward M. Shepard , who , with James W. Osborne , had defended Mr. Hapgood , said that as a lawyer he was almost ashamed to have made an argument ment in the case on Thursday , for the reason that no argument was needed to convince the Jury of his client 's inwicence . He bad taken the opportunity , he said , to express his opinion On some matters that he thought ought to come prom , . inently before the public . Robert J. Collier , one of the proprietors of Colliers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by any one associated with him toward getting Justice Deuel off the Special Sessions bench . Mr. Collier ? had comment for only one part of the trial , and that was brought out by District Attorney Jerome yesterday in his summing up . Mr. Jerome had pointed out as an offset to some testimony of= fared by the defense that Collier 's Weekly advertised in Town Topics , Mr. Collier had previously testified that he had been aroused to move against Town Topics on Oct. 20 , 1904 , when an offensive article against Miss Alice Roosevelt appeared in the publication . He said yesterday that on that date he had ordered the advertisement of Collier 's taken from Town Topics , although on the contract Town Topics owed e1,300 worth of space to Collier 's . The District Attorney had no comment to make on the result of the trial beyond saying in a laughing manner , " I am much depressed , " when it was called to his attention that he had lost the first case that he had personally prosecuted in his new term of office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Col. Mann heard the verdict with a greater show of equanimity than any one else connected with the case . " I have no comment to make on - the verdict , he said , before leaving the courtroom . " The Jurors are an intelligent body of men , and as far as . I was able to observe they listened to the evidence , with a great deal of care and attention . I do not . feel called upon , however , to express any particular opinion . I was not on trial . I was merely a witness in the ease , and no one has impeached my testimony . " Last evening Col. Mann Issued a statement In which he said that in view of Mr. Hapgood 's declaration that his article I was written on the basis of information obtained from the District Attorney , he did not see how an intelligent jury'coulti have rendered any other verdict . The acquittal of Mr. Hapgood followed the summing up yesterday morning by District Attorney Jerome , and the charge by Justice Fitzgerald . District Attorney Jerome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had done wrong . He also said in effect that Mr. Hapgood , whom he designated as one of his best friends , had written his opinion of Justice Deuel in the belief that what he said was true , with the best motives and in the interests of the community . Mr. Jerome denounced Town Topics as a blackmailing paper , and declared that with scarcely any exception the newspa= hers of New York City promulgated scandal for which they could be mulcted in damages , given the proper initiative . The . Supreme Court was not exempt from the District Attorney 's arraignment of those who , in his view , were guilty of wrong : . doing . Rumors of an Indictmenf . At the conclusion of the trial yesterday , a throng of lawyers and others who had followed the trial throughout its ceui4e lingered in the corridors of the Criminal Courts Building because a rumor had got around that the Grand Jury , which was then in session , would take some action in charges of blackmail against somebody before it concluded its labors . Nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concluded his charge to the Jury , and that body had gene to the room reserved for the , jury 's I deliberations , Capt . Lynch hastoned over I to that portion of the courtroom where ; score of women have sat at each session of . the trial : " Madame , 7 ? he said , adjuiting ; hiaspeo : tacles , it , is my duty to.:adreon4h , " . the , , ladies " , thai no ; unseemly ' , denzeoxiStr004 . Shall follow the - annouhcement of the verdict . " Capt . Lynch then drew himself up to his full height and glanced severely at - those before him . The woman he had addressed , who happened to be Mrs. Hapgood. the wife of the defendant , surveyed the ' old man through her lorgnette for a moment , and then said : " I do n't just know what you mean about a demonstration . I 'm sure I 've no notion of making one . " " If you do , " said Capt . Lynch sternly , " it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put such persons out . " Mrs. Hapgood smiled upon the friends who -- had accompanied her to court , and then walked out of the room and remained in the corridors until the verdict was anuounced . District Attorney Jerome addressed the d jury as soon as Justice Fitzgerald tuok his seat upon the bench . Jerome Sums Up . " For two weeks now , " said the District Attorney , " we have been wandering through Vanity Fair . In my seventeen years ' experience in the criminal courts I have never seen a case like this . Some things in this case have appeared amusing on their face , but they have their tragic side . " I shall not hesitate to characterize things as I find them . I am not here to whitewash any one . I shall not hesitate to express my utter loathing for some of the witnesses in the case , and I will criticise them with harshness . In the theory of law it is your duty to base your judgment on the evidence . This may not be the best law , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here prosecuting one of the very best friends I have in the world for a crime , which , in my private judgment , he ought to have done , and which I might have done in his place with more heat and vim than he displayed . " Mr. Jerome then read the indictment and continued : " Not for one moment do the people contend that Mr. Hapgood was actuated by corrupt metives , and in the moral form he was justified and actuated by the best of motives . I will concede that this publieatioa was honestly made and in the belief that it was true . The only thing for you to consider is whether it is based on reasonable grounds . " Now , let us see the character of this paper , Town Topics . Mr. Shepard says that Col. Mann pointed out that it was a ' natural evolution of personal journalism ' ; it is . If that is true it ought to be applicable to more than one daily paper in New York whose trend is that way . There is scarcely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York that has n't got vile scandal in it . The papers of New York , almost without exception , are run from the counting room . Does it serve any useful purpose ? It is put there for no-other purpose than that of paying dividends to the stockholders . The advertising , to-a large extent , is to contribute to the corruption fund . These papers have not got to the condition that this vile publication ( Town Topics ) has reached . This is not a pleasant statement to make , but if you see sacrowd of newspaper men talking together and one Of them says , ' Why has a certain paper let up on a certain matter ? ' the reply is likely to be : ' Why , have n't you seen that ad in the paper ? ' You can buy a great daily journal containing these scandalous matters for 1 cent , but Town Topics costs 10 cents . - -1 join with Mr. Shepard , however , on the importance of criticism on the part of the press . But matter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the head of a corporation is described as running in front of a procession yelling ' stop thief ! ' There is nothing written that could justify this sort of thing . The man who wrote ft would not have lasted fortyeight hours west of the Mississippi and south of Mason and Dixon 's line . " Says Deuel Did Wrong . The District Attorney went on to say that , according to the statute , Justice Deuel could not engage in business . " I can see he did , " he continued . " He did wrong . In my opinion he violated a statute , but it has been nowhere shown that he neglected his official duties . I think that every one will concede that he did his duty and did more work than most . But that statute can not make or unmake moralities Mr. Shepard has admitted that a great jurist did violate the statute by being interested In a trust company while he was drawing a salary of $17 , e00 . Justice Deuel is-an old man . The shadows lengthen in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violated the law because he wrote something . One Justice of the Supreme Court rules a ? banking house from the bench , as others have . Says Deuel 's Reputation is Gone . " Justice Deuel is broken in health and twined in reputation , whatever may be the outcome of this case . He has broken the statute and he must suffer for it He will have to bear his burdens . He has done what greater jurists have done in defiance of the better sense of the community . I do n't want you to judge this man harshly ; I want you to judge him fairly . Do n't say that , like a vampire , he sucked the community 's blood because he violated the charter . We will concede that he was part owner and an editor of Town Topics ; a rotten , miserable sheet that ought to be suppressed ; the ' Police Gazette ' of the Four Hundred ; a , publication vulgar to refined tastes . " But he is charged with living like a vulture on the sins and sorrows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prove . This veteran of the war . Col. Mann . was cress-examined on the witness stand , but there is not a bit of evidence to show that Justice Deuel was aware of his borrowings . Col. Mann says that he was an inventor and lost his money . But it is not the first time that an inventor has been squeezed by the capitalists . His necessities were great through a long period of years . " We now come to the case of E. Clarence Jones . There is nothing to show that he was blackmailed . He did not appear as a witness . Then there is Thomas F , Ryan . If any of . you know anything about him , you are aware that no one could make much progress in an attempt to blackmail him . If there is - anything that the newspapers in New York have not said about him in the last few years I do n't know it . He can not be very sensitive to criticism , He has been fighting financial gorillas for years . If he had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you could easily have brought him here . " Take 0 . EL P. Belmont , he , with the warlike front of Mars . ' I 'll consider , ' he says , when Col. Mann asks him for a loan . And the next morning wires that he does n't feel like letting him have it . Take Perry Belmont , the distinguished exstatesman , the rising sun that got stuck on the horizon . If you take Mr. Osborne for it , the screws ' were put on him and be gave up liberally . He has not escaped , I he 's not a shrinking , timid person . He could have been brought here , and after these two yards of laudatory comment he would not have hesitated to come . " Now we come to James R. Keene . You say the money was borrowed over night . He 's a fighter in the world of finance , and has held his own against such men as Mr. Ryan and Mr. Whitney for years . What does it turn out an this case ? The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ample security for the money he borrowed from Mr. Keene , on property right here in New York ; and he could have been brought here . " Mr. Burden takes the stand . Here is where Irving . a blackmailer now under arrest charged with attempted exeortion. comes in . He was also the editor of a blackmailing sheet called The New Yorker . I 'll concede that Irving tried to blackmail Mr. Burden . Scores Wooster and Wayne . " You will remember these miserable creatures , Wooster and Wayne-Wayne , who at last was willing to take blood money . They go on the stand . Men of this type were witnesses for the defense . " Peter Cooper Hewitt was also called to the stand . I could n't understand just what Mr. - Hewitt was called for . Irving went to see him about ' Fads and Fancies ' and Mr. Hewitt turned him down . " Now we come to J. P. Morgan . I do n't know him , but I have seen him , and no man on God 's footstool carries a fiercer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brave man , but if he looked Into that fierce gray eye and attempted blackmail lie would be made to look so ridiculous that he could n't stand it for a moment . " They also have William K. Vanderbilt . He ca n't escape ; he 's a well-known man . Col. Mann believed that he had been crushed to the wall by the railroad people , and if you had wanted Mr. Vanderbilt here to testify about Col. Mann 's borrow-1 ' ing from him you could have got him . ' Why blackmail anybody ' when they are such easy marks ? ' The District Attorney went on to speak of " Fads and Fancies . " and of those who had subscribed for it . He said he ' could imagine that a bricklayer would ' have been proud to find himself side by side with the President of the United States in the book . He referred to many by name who were in it , and added : ' An ex-President of the United States goes in , and is brave enough not to deny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ libel suit , " continued Mr. Jerome . " Well , Mr. District Attorney , " Interrupted Mr. Shepard . " do you intend to pass on without referring to the Baker case ? " " Oh , " replied Mr. Jerome , " I had forgotten about that . There comes thrilling war . Mr. Baker says : ' Let me sacrifice my line of transports for the cause of the Nation ! ? He rushes to Washington and says to the Secretary of War : ' Let me sell my ships to . the Government for an appropriate remuneration . ' Then comes along the old warrior of the civil war . He gets Gen. Alger away from his duties long enough to ask him how the AlgerSullivan Lumber Company is getting along . Then Col. Mann goes to Mr. Baker and tries to borrow money . He did n't try to borrow from men who did n't have it ; he went to those who did have it . " Mr. Shepard , you have not pleased me more in this case than with your description of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of advertising such as the Equitable had in Town Topics , it seems strange to find in the same publication the advertisement of Collier 's Weekly . " There is one - delightful thing irl this case ; it has heartened my faith in my own profession . The defendant is an old friend of mine , and I know that there was nothing but an honest motive in his mind . In his talks with me I did not hesitate to express myself about these people . Our conversation was confidential . So nice was Mr. Hapgood that he respected the Confidence , and Mr. Shepard did not know that I had given Mr. Hapgood my views on the subject until I told him myself . It shows a respect of confidence not rare , but seldom brought out . That " Miserable - Publication . " " It is n't that I care for Justice Deuel or that the people of the State of New York care for him . This case is not brought for the vindication of Justice Deuel ; he has ample protection in the civil courts if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protection of the people . If suits had been brought against this miserable publication long ago it would have been wiped off the face of the earth . " Whether Mr. Hapgood is excused or not , I can say that his motive was absolutely good and kind . " I have done what I could to make clear the issues in this case , and will be content with whatever conclusions you arrive at . It is wholly and purely an intellectual problem . " Justice Fitzgerald , in his instructions tO the jury , said that an action for criminal libel is different in one important respect from all other cases , whether civil or criminal , in that the Judge is without authority to determine the law . The interpreting of the law rests solely With the jury . The Justice went on to define libel , and read the statute as well as the Constitution of the State , under the provislens of which the suit was instituted . He then referred more particularly to the specific allegations in Justice Deuel 's complaint . " The press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fitzgerald , " if the motive is good and the end justifiable . Was the purpose of Mr. Hapgood 's publication justified ? If he has shown those things which he alleged his article is not a libel . If the publication is excused he is entitled to be acquitted . He wrote the article after consulting with Mr. Collier , and after getting information from other sources and reading the papers , including Town Topics , as well as after consulting with the District Attorney . " The case of the People against Norman Hapgood is now in your hands . Decide it fairly and fearlessly in accordance with the law . With the law and the right , indicate by your verdict the wisdom of the stable quality that places its ultimate reliance upon juries to preserve inviolate freedom of speech and at the same time vigorously to guard against those principles being successfully invoked as protection for the common slanderer , the vicious , and the corrupt . " At the conclusion of Justice Fitzgerald 's address to the jury Mr. Shepard asked the court to emphasize certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ o'clock and returned to the courtroom seven minutes later . Frank T. Richards , the Foreman , was called upon by Clerk Penny to report the verdict . " Not Guilty , " Declares the Jury . " Not guilty , " he said , whereupon Justice Fitzgerald discharged . the jurors for the present term of court after thanking them for their patience in hearing the evidence . Mr. Shepard in turn thanked Justice Fitzgerald for his consideration and indulgence In the course of the trial . Col. Mann , who had listened attentively to the District Attorney 's summing up , declined to comment at any length upon the finding . In the evening , however , he invited reporters to his office in the Town Topics Building and gave out a typewritten statement , in which he said : I have little to say of the trial , as I was not a party to it . but simply a witness for the People . There were brought out the names of friends of mine who were kind enough some years ago , after a conspiracy of certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Boudoir Car Company , and left me not only penniless , but heavily in debt . to lend me moneys on more or less , at that time . uncertain security to aid me in again getting on my feet , notably W. K. Vanderbilt , J. Pierpont Morgan , Dr. Seward Webb , Collis P. Huntington , Perry Belmont , W. C. Whitney , and Thomas F. Ryan . " Again , names , notably those of Mrs. Clement C. Moore , Mrs. Andrew Simonds . Harry Lehr , Mr. Muller-Dry , Mrs. Burton Harrison , were given by Charles Stokes Wayne , whom I had discharged and who was a witness for the Colliers , as being contributors to Town Topics . which was absolutely untrue , as none of those parties contributed in any way a single item of news , except some little news personal to herself by Mrs. Simonds . Mann Says Jury Did Well . " No , I ern not surprised at the verdict at all . I fail to see how any intelligent jury , and this one seems to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did in ' view of the evidence of Mr. Hapgood , frankly admitted to be true by the District Attorney , to the effect that he had based his article containing the libel upon what the District Attorney had said . " The District Attorney , in summing up . made a masterly argument and explained that the views which he expressed to Editor Hapgood were those he held at the time , whether rightly or wrongly , and that they were communicated - to Editor Hapgood as any private individual might speak to an old , and personal - trlenk'as he declared Mr. Hapgood to beelend ire- a ' purely - personal interview , and he.argUed that such communication should  --  not have , been taken as ' a .. - ? basis-for an artie , le:orthe grayelnwert pub .
