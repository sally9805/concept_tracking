IN the middle of the lino of pictures Wringing between the delivery desks in the reading-room of the Harvard Law School is a striking group of three-quarter length figures that suggests a Copley , but is in reality the work of Feake , a young Newport Quaker of about a century ago . A stiff , red-coated gentleman stands at is table surrounded by admiring female relatives . He is Isaac Royall , Brigadier-General of the Province of Massachusetts Bay , member of the Council , stanch upholder of King George . His magnificent old mansion in Medford is still standing , and of its owner it is comfortably recorded that " no gentleman of his time gave bettor dinners or drank costlier wines . " But after the battle of Lexington , like a good Tory , he followed the British to Halifax , and thence to England , where he died . By his will , executed in 1778 , it appeared that Ito cherished no animosity against the rebellious subjects of his king ; that on the contrary he had loft a number of charitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not fail to receive his due consideration . His attitude toward it , moreover , was of an oddly modern type . He was evidently a believer in tho pro . fossional schools , or would have been had they existed , At least he did what he could to broaden tho college into a university , for he left two thousand acres of hit had in Granby and Royalston , " to be appropriated towards the endowing a Professor of Laws in said Col-ledge , or a Professor of Phyeiek and Anatomy , which ever the said Overseers and Corporation shall judge to be best for the benefit of said Colledge . " TIde gift was allowed to lie idle until 1811 . Then the Corporation roused itself , selected the first alternative of the gift , and appointed Isaac Parker , Chief Justice of Massachusetts , first Royall Professor of Law . This chair he held till 1827 , but owing to his duties on the bench , was able to lecture only during the summer term of college . In the words of good Dr. Peabody , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay for a course of twelve or more lectures to each emcee- // sive senior college ? hiss . Judge Parker 's course comprised such fonts and features of the common and statute law as a well-educated men ought to know , together with an analysis and exposition of the Constitution of the United States . I I is lectures wore clear , strong , and impressive ; were listened to with groat satisfaction , and were full of materials of practical interest and value . He bore a reputation worthy of his place in the line of Massachusetts chief justices ; and the students , I think , fully appreciated the privilege of having for one of their teachers a man who had no recognized superior at the bar or on the bench , " Now it is to Chief Justice Parker that we should look with especial veneration , as the following extracts , verbatim , from the College Records will show : " At a mooting of the President and Fellows of Harvard College , May 14th. 1817 . Present . 1 The President 2 Mr , Gore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Judge Phillips . . . . " The Royall Professor of Law having represented to this Board , that in his opinion and in that of many friends of the University and of the improvement of our youth , the establishment of a School , for the instruction of Students at Law at Cambridge , under the Patronage of the University , will tend much to the better education of young men destined to that profession , and will increase the reputation and usefulness of this seminary ; and the Corporation concurring in these views , it was voted as follows , " 1 . That some Counsellor , learned in the Law , be elected to be denominated UNIVRRSITY PROVEsSOli Or LAW ; who shall reside in Cambridge , and open and keep a school for the Instruction of Graduates of this or any other University , and of such others , as , according to the rules of admission as Attorneys , may be admitted after five years study in the office of some Counsellor . " 2 . That it shall be the duty of this Officer with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prescribe a course of study , to examine and confer with the Students upon the subjects of their studies , and to read lectures to them appropriate to the course of their studies , and their advancement in the science , and generally to act the part of a Tutor to them in such manner as will beet improve their minds and assist their requisitions . . . " 6 . As an excitement to diligence and good conduct , a degree of Bachelor of Laws shell Ito instituted at the University , to be eonforred on such Students as shall have remained at least eighteen months at the University School , and passed the residue of their noviciate in the office of seine Counsellor of the Supremo Court of the Commonwealth , or who shall have remained three years , or if not graduates of any College , five years , in the School , providing the Professor having charge of the same shall. , continuo to be a practitioner in the Su-promo Judicial Court . " 7 . , The Students shall have the privilege of attending the lectures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end shall have access to the other Lectures of the University usually allowed to be attended by Resident Graduates , without charge , or for smelt reasonable Compensation as the Corporation , with the assent of the Overseers , shall determine . " Voted That the foregoing votes instituting a new department at the University be laid before the Overseers that they may approve the same if they see fit . " Note the timid pride of the last vote , " A new department at the University " had indeed been " instituted , " with a considerable fatty ? before it . At the same meeting the Hon. Asahel Stearns was voted lint University Professor , and a committee duly appointed to apprise him of the honor , Stearns was a Harvard graduate , a former member of Congress , and en- joyed the highest professional reputation . With Chief Justice Shaw he revised the Massachusetts Statutes , and his work on Real Actions was long the standard text on the subject . " Ho was warmly interested in the public charities of his day , exercised a generous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a man of grave and serious aspect and deMeanor , but by no means devoid of humor , and was a favorite in society . His wife was a lovely woman , " says Dr. Peabody , " full of good works ; and there was never a sick student in college whom she did not take under special charge . " Professor Stearns was much more than first University Professor of Law in the new school . He was the entire faculty . His office , in Harvard Square , was the school ; and , as good Dr. Peabody sententiously remarks , " a building , a library , and an organized faculty were essential to mako the School attractive , " Some apologies for the first two were presently provided in a very old , low-studded building on the site of the present College House , where a so-called lecture-room and an equally dubious library were fitted up . But the number of law students rarely rose above eight or ton , and in 1829 had actually run down to one . At this stage Mr. Stearns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the existence of the Law School was about to terminate of more inanition when the author of Dane 's Abridgment took it into his head to follow the example of his English forerunner , Viser , and endow a Professorship of Law with the profits of his book . His aim was to get some one who should teach the principles of jurisprudence systematically and scientifically . To that end he offered the college $1000 for the foundation , stipulating that the first professor should be Joseph Story of the United States Supremo Court . Judge Story had already declined Rio Royal ' Professorship , and was far from willing to accept this now one but as its founder stoutly insisted on withdraw . ing the gift unless the chair Woe filled in accordance with his wishes , Stol. , finally consented . At the same time the Royal Prolessorship was filled by John H. Ashman , and the real history of the Imtv School began . Story 's fame was already world wide , and the public interest in the Su. promo Court and its members was at is pitch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national repo . tation . The library rapidly increased , The number of students in the very first year of the new era tuns no less than thirty , and rose by Maps and bounds to one ' Modred and fifty . In spite of the littoral expenditures for the library there was a handsome surplus of funds . In three years the need of better quarters became imperative , and again Mr. Dane came forward with a largo contribution , and a temporary loan of more . In 1832 Stunner wrote : " Dane Law College ( sit . tutted just north of Rev. Mr. Newell 's &welt),; a beautiful Grecian temple , will : four Ionic pillars in front , ? the most architectural and the best built edifice belonging to the college , ? was dedicated to the law . Quincy delivered a most proper addrosi of an hour , full of his strong sense and strong language . Webster , J. Q. Adams , Dr. Bowditch , Edward Everett , Jeremiah Mason , Judge Story , Ticknor , leaders in the eloquence , statesmanship , mathematics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all present , ? a glorious company . " Mr. Ashman , whose mental powers hod always been far in advance of his physical , died at the early age of thirty . two He is perhaps the most brilliant figure In the whole history of the school . Though so young he bad already " gathered about him all the honors , which are usually the harvest of the ripest life , " At the bar , whore his was admitted at an early age , " he stood in the very first rank of his profession , without any acknowledged superior . " Ho filled the Royal ! Professorship with distinguished ability . His advanced position as an educator , as well as the quality of his work , may be inferred from the fact that in the curriculum of those early days he included a course of lectures on 1 ; clical Jurisprudence of such value that they were published after his death . ' Po quote further front Professor Story , " Although his learning was exceedingly various , as well as deep , he never assumed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a question occurred , which he was not ready to answer , he had no reserves , and no concealments , With the modesty , as well as the tranquil confidence , of a great mind , Ile would candidly say , ' I am nut lawyer enough to an . sees that . ' In truth , his very doubts , like the doubts of Lord Eldon , and the queries of Plowdon , lot you at once into the vast roach of his inquiries and attainments . There is not , and there menet be , a higher tribute to his memory than this , that while his scrutiny was severely close , he was most cordially beloved by all his pupils . He lived with them upon terms of the most familiar intimacy ; and he has sometimes with a delightful modesty and elegance said to me , am but the eldest Boy upon the form , ' Owing to ill health , he could not ho said to have attained either grace of person or ease of action , Hie voice was feeble ; his utterance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though appropriate , was not . . . He felt another disadvantage from the infirmity of a slight deafness , with which he had been long afflicted . His professional success seems truly marvelous , It is as proud an example of genius subduing to its own Purposes every obstacle , opposed to its career , and working out its own lofty destiny , as could well ho presented to the notice of any ingenuous youth , " In May , 1833 , his long consuming illness took a suddenly fatal turn , and he expired peacefully in the night , the only person at his bedside being one of his devoted pupils , young Charles Sumner . The Itoyall Professorship , time sadly vacated , was accepted by Simon Greenleaf , Reporter of the Supreme Court of Maine . Then were the days of the giants . For twelve years those twin kings of American jurisprudence , Story and Greenleaf , held absolute dominion , and moulded a whole generation of lawyers . More than eleven hundred students sat under their instruction . Good textbooks were seriously needed , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ producing them . Greenleaf published his famous Evidence , and a number of other works , but was quite eclipsed by the labors of his energetic colleague . For Mr. Damds scheme of systematic teaching had included the stipulation that the occupant of his professorship shoeld deliver and publish a series of lectures on the following five subjects : Federal Law , Federal Equity , Commercial and Maritime Law , the Law of Nations , and the Law of Nature , Story at once began on this list , but found it ramified so fast that at the time of his death he had become the author of no less than thirteen volumes of treatises , all of international authority . Ho seems to have been a writer by nature , one of those men to whom the sight of a quire of foolscap and the feel of a pen between the fingers are all that is necessary to crystallize thought into a form to be seen of all men . In court he was constantly writing poetry . Here is a simple , found in one of his notebooks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of interest in the ease before him : ? LINES IVRITTEN ON ' WARING AN ARGUMENT IN coma , Sl'Alift MO quotations , which ( Ito ' learned , are deleted material When not writing , the judge was talking . He was one of the most tremendous talkers that long suffering Cambridge has ever heard , It is still remembered how , on his trips into Boston by the daily omnibus ( fare twenty-five cents ) , he entertained friends and strangers alike by his unquenchable stream of pleasantries , anecdotes , and sage observations . His lectures at the school carried away his listeners with the pure enthusiasm ' of the speaker . His extraordinary memory , copious learning , and long practical experience , combined with his ready invention of illustration , and wonderful fluency of expression , often caused him to wander widely from the starting-topic , and sweep with amazing facility over far-distant regions of theory or practice , or even personal reminiscence . Alas that it veracious chronicler must set down that in those bygone times rho young idea in process of being taught Was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earliest disciples of the present . " It was easy , " says a student of that day , " to draw the old judge front the point under consideration to a lengthy account of Chief Justice Marshall /111t1 his fellows . . . and this was apt to be done every day . " Professor Ashmun apparently tried to restrain and oven counteract this tendency of the judge , and there is a tide to the effect that Story once remarked somewhat testily , " Now Ashmun , do n't you contradict what I say . I believe you would try to correct me if I told you that two and two make four . " " Of course I should , ' retorted Ashmun instantly , " they make twenty-two . " Story 's interest in the school was wonderful . It was his pet and pride . He was continually devising new and delightful plans for its improvement . Ile doggedly refused any addition to his original salary of $1000 a year , insisting instead that whatever Inure was offered him should be expended in increasing the Law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which now forms the foundation for the Story Pro . fessurship . It is estimated that his gifts to the school , in this wily alone , amounted to $32,000 . His lectures were pe . riodically interrupted by attendance on the court at Washington , but he always returned at the earliest moment , and with the greatest enthusiasm . After each absence he would enter the library and hold a regular reception , shaking hands with each student , and making affectionate inquiries after his success . His personal interest in every pupil was as extraordinary as it Was unflagging , and created the most intimate and con. tideland relationships . Tho following incident is told by the author of Two Years before the Mast , and well illustrates tho general tone of the school and the kindly nature of the Dane Professor : " Soon after I had left the School and was admitted to the bar , I had occasion to argue a motion for an injunction before him in chambers , ex paste . The case involved some points of general interest in equity practice anti @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trademarks , but the granting of the injunction was matter of little doubt . The judge appointed the library of the Law School as the place for hearing the me-Hon , gave notice to the students , and had them nearly all present . This was partly as an exercise for the school , but in a great degree ? as I know from the direction which he gave the hearing , requiring me to develop the principles and facts , and from his previous introduction of the case to the school ? to afford me an opportunity of appearing to advantage before so good an audience , some of whom had been my follow students . " // C. W. Huston , L. S. 1843 , gives another glimpse of Story in the lecturer:on : " In the winter of ' 42 , Mr. Webster and Lord Ashburton , accompanied by Lord Morpoth , were at Cambridge a length of time settling the Maine boundary question . Those three mon were in tho habit of attending Judge Story 's leetures , ? Recces to the library being what brought them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when Judge Story had told what Lord Mansfield thought about it , and Chief Justice Marshall 's opinion , and when Lord Morpoth had listened with his lips open and his heavy eyelids closed in a negative attitude , for he had inherited gout of many generations , Story would suddenly turn to the old Lord sitting on a bench with the students , and inquire , ? And what is your opinion , my lord ? ' Morpoth would suddenly change his whole countenance , gather up his lips and his eyebrows , his eyes sparkling , and would deliver an exceedingly interesting opinion on the point under consideration . " Two portraits of Story hang in the school , both noticeable for tho moonlike red face and its aspect of extraordinary benevolence . Huston says : " Story was a low , heavy-sot man , ? very fair skin , blue eyes , with but little hair on his head , being very bald save a little tuft on the top of his forehead , which he often combed during lectures with a fine comb carried in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the young men . . . . He kept up constant letter-writing to and with many of the great men of Europe . Professor Greenleaf was taller , black hair in profusion , and keen black eyes . I have heard him say , I believe , he was forty years old before he began studying law in Maine where he was raised . He was not popular with the boys , being sometimes sarcastic . His mind was acute and his reasoning hair-splitting . " Greenleaf , indeed , was in many respects the exact opposite of his col- league . In the words of Professor Parsons : " Judge Story and Professor Greenleaf worked together harmoniously and successfully , and perhaps the more harmoniously because they were so entirely different . With much in common , for both were able , learned , and of the most devoted industry , there were other traits that belonged to one or the other of them exclusively , Greenleaf was singularly calm , finding strength in his very stillness ; always cautious , and therefore always exact . Story was as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flowed like a flood ; but it was because Inc emotions and his thoughts demanded a flood as their exponent Story 's manner was most peculiar ; everybody listened when he spoke , for he carried one away with the irresistible attraction of his own swift motion . And GreenlettLsontewhat slow and measured in his onuncietion , by the charm of his silver voice , the singular felicity of his expressions , and the smooth flow of his untroubled stream of thought , caught and held the attention of every listener as few mon can . " Charles Sumner , who served as assistant instructor for a time before his trip to England , makes the following interesting comparison in a lotto : : from London written to Judge Story in 1838 : " You know Lord Denman intellectually better than I ; but you do not know his person , his voice , his manner , his tone , ? all , ovary inch , the judge . He sits the admired impersonation of the law . He is tall and well-made , with a justice-like countenance : his voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling with which ho castigates everything departing from the strictest lino of right conduct , remind me of Greenleaf more than of any other man I have ever known . " Again , in 1844 : " Greenleaf takes the deepest interest in the unfortunate church controversy , uniting to his great judicial attainments the learning of a divine . " There was indeed a strong Puritanical cast about the author of the Treatise on Evidence . This is observable in his portrait in the reading-room . He used to annotate a portion of the Bible every day ; and he published an attempt to apply the rules of evidence to the writings of the Evangelists , which proved more of a curiosity than a success . In one of his letters he describes himself as cultivating cheerfulness as a religious duty . What few specimens of his wit remain , however , lean toward the ponderous , and would tend to prove that his cultivation was carried on upon a somewhat barren soil . In his sitting-room he would write or study for hours , surrounded by his family and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thousand distractions of a household that was distinctly a " going concern , " yet absolutely 80e0/10 and undisturbed , so great were his powers of concentration . Thus under these two great masters , ocensionally assisted by lesser lights , the school grow and prospered exceedingly , tilbthe increase of students and library demanded an addition to Dane Hall . Accordingly the long transverse portion of the present fabric was built , and opened in 1 845 with brilliant ceremonies , Judge Story , in presiding at this occasion , was unconsciously performing one of his last good offices for the school . His health had been worn away by his triple exertions as teacher , author , and judge . For thirty-three years he had missed but one term of court at Washington , yet when ho realized he must give up some of his work he preferred to keep that at Cambridge , and was just arranging his resignation from the bench when he was stricken with his-last sickness . For over two years Professor Greenleaf , having heel ) promoted to the Dane Professorship , performed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , felt his health giving way , and resigned his chair . The Dane Professorship was then accepted by Theophilus Parsons , of Brookline . Ho was at that time in a largo Boston practice , espe. cially in Admiralty and Marine ' lisle , once , his favorite subjects , daily bet . Mg his house so early and returning so late that he had hardly any home or family life at all ; and he used to tell how his young son one day inquired , " Mother , who is that nice gentleman that sometimes spends Sunday 's here , and seems so fond of me ? " Royal ' Professorship , left vacant by Greenleaf 's promotion , had imam time been held for a year by the son of Chancellor Kent , and was then filled by Joel Parker , Chief Justice of New Hampshire . Under him and Parsons the main work of the school went on for nearly a decade . The University Professorship was revived for a year , with F. H. Allen as incumbent , but he resigned in 1850 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instructors or assistants , among them R. H. Dana , Sr. , George Ticknor Curtis , and the author of Cushing 's Manual , The eminent Wheaton , appointed to lecture on the Law of Nations , died imniediately afterwards , and Edward Everett , appointed 80/110 years later , serer took the chair . Again , as ill the previous era , the two principal figures claim our attention . Each curiously resembled the former occupant of his chair . Parsons was it fascinating lecturer , a most genial and social man , I RIII indebted to Professor Langdoll for the following characteristic reminiscence of him ; " It was the custom in the old days , 011 the first day of each term , for the students to assemble in the library for the purpose of mooting the professors , and listening to an address from one of them . . . . On one occasion , when Professor Parsons delivered the address , he explained to the now students that . . . they had to study English decisions very diligent . ly . Do you ask me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our independence , if we are still governed by England ? No , gentlemen , wo have not achieved our // independence , England governs us still , not by reason of force but by force of reason . ' " Parsons was really more of a littdrateur than a lawyer . Ile openly expressed his dislike of , and inability for , the more technical parts of the law , such as Pleading and Property . He had a certain poetic dreaminess of temperament that , while apparently not interfering with his professional success , did seriously affect his financial affairs , which constantly suffered from his credulity and ever-sanguine expectations . An indefatigable writer of textbooks , he possessed that unusual legal accomplishment , ? n charming literary style . He clothed his propositions in such a pleasing form that , like sugarcoated pills of legal lore , they were swallowed and assimilated with the minimum of effort and the maximum of enjoyment . His weeks were even more popular than Story 's . It is said that his Contracts achieved the largest sale of any law book ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on one of which alone he is reported to have netted a prolit of $40,000 . His lectures , for clearness , scope , and literary excellence , have often been compared to those of Blackstone . He delighted in laying down broad views of the subject , sometimes carrying his generalizing to an extreme . Chief Justice Parker , on the other hand , though deeply respected for his thoroughness , was precise , minute , and involved to the point of obscurity . If a single stop of his logic was lost by the listener , farewell to all hope of following to the conclusion , His law on any given question was sound , absolutely and exasperatingly sound ; but lie could no mere give a comprehensive view of a whole topic than an oyster , busy in perfecting its single pearl , can range over the ocean floor . In private life , Imwever , the Chief Justice was always interesting and often witty . It is worth while to quote his account of his tribulations after having been prevailed upon to leave the New Hampshire court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I had no experience , nor even knowledge of the details of the service to be performed , as the President well understood ; and on taking my seat , at the March term , 1818 , having had no leisure for any preparation whatever , I encountered dillieulties which seemed formidable , and were certainly embar1.1111111.11g . I found that , . . . to my dismay , Shipping and Admiralty was upon my list for that term . My residence in the interior of a state which had had but one port , the business of which was nearly all transacted in Boston , had given /no no occasion to become acquainted with that branch of the law , and I tried in vain to escape by an exchange . Professor Greenleaf 's answer , that he was then in the middle of his topics for the course , showed that he could not comply with 1113 ' request . So , frankly stating the dillieulty , I told the students I would study the textbook with them . . . . In Juno , Professor Greenleaf 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . thus wholly on any hands for the renutinder of the term , with an experience of something more than three months to direct me , " Upon a new division of topics in the course of the vacation , with Professor Parsons , who succeeded Professor Greenleaf , I was desirous of retaining Shipping on my list , in the hope that my studios on that subject , during the last term , might avail me somewhat in another course of lectures ; but the answer that his practice hnd been in Boston , and that branch of the law a specialty , could not but be admitted as a conclusive 1.0118011 why I should give it up ; as I did also the other textbook which had served as the basis for any other C01111313 of lectures ; so that I entered upon my second term with the necessity of entire now preparation so far as lectures were concerned . " In appearance and cluumeter Parker was a typo of the best of the Now Eng- laud country gentlemen of his day . lie was of so dignified and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the street , instinctively felt the pre-same of a great man . His portrait in the Law School , like those of Parsons and 1Vashburn , is vouched for by men who sat under hint as an excellent likeness . Ile 11 ? 118 of high breeding , constant hospitality , strong religions convictions , and sometimes confessed in private to a passionate love for the British poets . Ho was a man of inflexible integrity , and a blunt , outspoken sincerity rivaling that of President Lord , of Dartmouth College fame , to whom it is said he once exclaimed , in the heat of an argument , " Sir , this modem education is all a humbug , " and who instantly replied , with great hoartiness , " Judge Parker , I know it is . " If Parsons was suaviter in mode , Parker was ! seater in re . Polemics were his delight . A good stand-up light was meat and drink to him , and he entered it with a genuine " neck or nothing , " " never say die " relish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an excellent history of the Law School , there are few articles better than a pamphlet he published in reply to sonic criticisms on the school , which appeared in one of the law reviews of the time . His intense conservatism , which brought hint into unpopularity during the Civil War , is seen in the following anecdote by Governor Chamberlain , of South Carolina : " About the beginning of the war , Judge Parker was lecturing on the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus , expressing himself very strongly against it , Ono of the students interrupted hint by stating ( what he thought to be ) a very strong case of treasonable acts against the government , and asked hint if lie would not suspend the writ of habeas corpus in such a case . No , sir , ' said the judge , I would not suspend the writ of habeas corpus , but I would suspend the corpus . ' " In 1865 the University Professorship was again revived by the exertions of Parsons , who carried the appointment of Emory Washburn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Massachusetts , This chair he held till 1876 , although its /IRMO was Chlt0gUd to the Bussey Professorship , in cense ( memo of large additions to its foundation by Benjamin Bussey , of Roxbury , Washburn had been a student at the school in the old " one-man corporation " days of Asahel Stearns , and had built up an enviable practice in the heart of the Commonwealth . His success , single-mindedness , and high integrity had won for him is notable degree of public confidence . He was promoted from the bar to the bench , He was elected successively to both branches of the legislature . Ile was actually nominated for the governorship , the last successful candidate of the old Whig party , during an absence in Europe , and ? incredible Its it sounds to-day ? without his own knowledge . His interests were broad and varied . Ile was foremost in prison reform and in the direction of various benevolent institutions . Ho was an enthusiastic antiquarian , especially in New England town history . He was a copious writer for the press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His public spirit was unflagging and direct , Governor Bullock tolls of seeing him , during wartime , marching as a private in the " Immo guard " at a military funeral . When Bullock expressed his surprise at the humble part taken by a former chief executive , Washburn , at that time considerably over sixty years old , replied quite simply , " Oh yes , I have done this often , sometimes at night . 1 like to help along when I can . " Washburn had an enormous capacity for work , He seemed to have mastered the art of living without sleep . Front , an early morning hour till far into the night he was to be found at the school in his " private " office . Never was there a more delicious misnomer , for he was deluged with an unending stream of eallers , friends , strangers , students , politicians , and clients . Despite them all , however , and tho demands of his teaching and practice , ho managed to produce a number of professional works of the highest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which , in constantly appearing new editions , continue to be the standards of to-day . As a lecturer he was delightful . Mr. Justice Brown , who sat under his instruction , characterizes him RA " a strikingly 11111111801110 man , an intellectual HUM , whose eloquence made oven rho law of contingent remainders interesting , and the statute of uses and trusts to read like a novel . " So great was his popularity that it was not uncommon for undorgraduatds and members of other departments to stroll over to the law lectures " just to hear Washburn awhile . " Ino prodigious power of throwing himself body and soul into the ease before him , be it that of actual elient or academic problem , joined to his bong experience and public prominence , gave assured weight to his words ; while his wonderfully winning personality , his genial spirit and his well-remembered hearty laugh gained him the love and esteem of every listener . Indeed , Professor Washburn will go down in the history of the school , above all his professional excellences , as preeminent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his sketch of the school , epitomizes him as the most beloved instructor in its annals . Every student seemed the especial object of his solicitous interest . Ho not only acted as director , confessor , and inspirer of his pupils during their stay in Cambridge , but 801110110111 found time to correspond with them , often for years , after they had scattered throughout the length and breadth of the land . The spirit of the man speaks in every line of the following extract from his final address to the students . He is talking of the young LL . B. 's icy plunge into the acted work of the profession " In the first phtee , he finds himself , upon entering it , done , Friends may deer him end encourage him at starting by their good wishes , but they can not divide with hint the feeling of responsibility which weighs upon Idni , or the H01180 of mortificution at defeat , if lie fails , On the other hand , he BOOR linos flint the field is an open and a fair one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own want of preparation for the struggle , Birth and fondly can neither help nor hinder hint in the manly contests in which Ito is to engage . What a client looks for in a lawyer is , not the pedigree of his ancestors , but fidelity in himself , an ability and a knowing what to do and how to do it , mud without these he will not trust his OWR son with his ell1180 . In the next place , there is that dreadful waiting for business , through which almost every one has to pass , before lie can feel sure that lie is ever to get foothold in the profession . Every client seems to be forestalled , and every spot of ground to be crowded es he looks around him , and listens in vain for a welcome knock at his office door . It was wittily said by Mr. Ashman , formerly a professor in this school , that a young lawyer 's prospects were like a contingent remainder which requires a particular estate to support it . But let him not lose heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now and then the allurements of a rich man 's daughter are constantly thinning the ranks of the profession , and , before Ito is aware of it , he fluids new aspirants waiting for his place , and enjoying the progress he has made . The changes which are wrought in this way in the body of the profession are wonderfully rapid . It has been estimated that it is ? they are , upon an average , entire every fifteen years . And if , while thus waiting , the young lawyer will fill up his involuntary leisure with well-directed study , he nifty confidently look for the reward which he will be sure to reap in the growing confidence and respect of those around him . " But enough of the instructors of those days . What of the students themselves , the embryonic LL. 13. ' s who filled the corridors of Dane ' Hall and assisted in holding down its benches ? Then as now a largo proportion of every class graduating from the college flocked somewhat blindly to the Law School . But most members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it early attained drew recruits , some entirely raw , some with a little office training , from oven the most remote parts of the country . Aspirants from the middle West elbowed ambitious lads from faraway California , and up to the Civil War the catalogues were full of line old family names from the South . Requirements for admission there were none ; for a degree the sole stipulation wits enrollment as a member of the school for eighteen months . 1-hippy days of lightly won degrees ! In the college itself the M. A. was merely a premium awarded to any one who survived his A. B. for five years . Many graduates refused to take it on account of its utter worthlessness , and B. R. Curtis , of ' 32 , described by it contemporary as " by far the first man of his class , with the highast legal prospects before him , " stirred up a regular revolution on the subject . Short as was the school course in those days , oven shorter periods of residence wore common ; them was a regular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could enroll in the school for half of one term . As nifty be easily imagined , such a brief exposure to the classic Cambridge influences pro-ductal little effect on the more erratic spirits of the school ; and the quaint legend of the manner in which a poor but ingenious candidate from " down East " managed to save all expense for light , while preparing himself for college , by studying in a lighthouse is not more incredible than that of the newly fledged LL. 13. who was discovered setting not for legal conquests in this far West equipped solely with an axe and a demi . john of ink . Once fairly started on the legal path , the student of those days found the life by no means hard . Ills textbooks were lent to Into by the school , the library having a vast stock of duplicates of the standard treatises . These he studied , or not , as he felt inclined . One of the instructors of that golden ago admits in his memoirs that though " a list of books was made up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was enlarged from time to time , it can not be strictly said that this course was prescribed , for nothing was exacted . " Lectures began at eleven and ended et one . Usually the same professor occupied the chair for both hours , changing his subject at noon , Saturday was then dies non . Of the lectures themselves there were but two notable differences from those of to-day , ? it charming tendency , especially in the reign of Story , to wander from the subject in hand into fields of reminiscence and general theory as pleasant and almost as instructive , and the fact that a textbook formed the basis of the work . But this was often lost sight of and overlaid with a colloquial expanding of general imles , putting questions on parallel eases , hypothetical or actual , queries from the students , and expressions of opinion , which must have been surprisingly like a lecture of to-day . Tints Professor Parker gives a lively account of his first experience as lecturer : " I was to deliver a lecture upon certain topic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , . . It was not expedient for me to state the propositions in the words of the text . The students were acquainted with them already . It would be of little advantage to vary the phraseology , If the textbook wne a good one , how was I to deliver a lecture without a ' departure , ' Old Times at the Law School . which lawyers well know is , in pleading , obnoxious to a special demurrer ? I availed myself largely of my privilege , however , and having nutdo 1111 earnest request to the students to ask me any questions on their part , they availed themselves of their privilege . The School was at that time a very strong one , and so wo had for some time a lively interchange of interrogatories . It W110 not difficult to perceive that the students were disposed to try the now Professor , and I enjoyed it , for , having been fifteen years upon the Bench , I felt much more at home in answering questions than I did in delivering Law lectures , properly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to have boon coeval with the very beginnings of legal instruction in this country . It was used ill Reeve 's private Law School , begun in 1795 , at Litchfield , Cons. , and lasting till 1833 . This school attained a very high standard of excellence , and over one thousand pupils attended it . Much the same method was also used in Judge Howe 's short - lived school at Northatnpton , Mass. , begun in 1823 , and of very high character , but collapsing when its ablest lecturer , Ashmun , on whom the instruction devolved almost entirely , accepted the Royall Professorship at Cambridge is 1829 . His lectures are remembered for their clear grasp of the subject and the care with which he frequently put his classes through exact and searching oral examinations , Despite such individual points of OX . Mince , tile general scheme of instruction at the Law School was for many years in amazing confusion , The courses were designed to cover two years ' work ; but , apparently on the principle that the law has neither beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any 0110 year , so that it was entirely look whether on entering the school you found yourself nt the beginning of the course or plunged into the middle of it , A considerable offset to this disjointed state of theory was the attention pabl to ! tractive ill the moot courts . ' ileac , if not invented , were certainly brought into great prominence by Judge Story . 0110 W118 held at least every week , and in the height of the system on Monday , ' Wednesday , and Friday afternoons , One of the professors presided , and all the students were expected to attend and take motes ; though this operation ustudly consisted ill copying down verbatim both the briefs , which , in those days of expensive printing , the counsel slowly read aloud from manuscript . The eases W010 always on agreed farts , often drawn front the actual experience of the presiding justice . Twice It year there were regular trials before a jury drawn from the undergraduates , or sometimes , with a delicate humor , from the divinity students . Those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ festival , and the court-room was crowded to its utmost capacity . Many a great 1101110 ill the history of the bench and the bar won its first recognition ill these mimic combats , In point of fact , noisy applause and uproarious expressions of approval rather spoiled the sought-for dignified effect of a real court , and wore sometimes excessive . The law clubs , too , were an important element ill the work of the school . They were named for great legal writers , ? the Pieta , the Afarshall , etc , The Coke Club was of immemmial antiquity , and usually contained the most brilliant members of the school . The average number of students in a club was from fifteen to twenty . They met ill some of the smaller rooms ill 1 ) 1111e Hall . On any C1/80 there was but one counsel for each side and one judge . The Cases Were usually those which had been announced for approaching moot courts ; so interest anti attendance 011 the latter were always kept at . a high level . Besides these there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a week . Political interest , especially just before the war , ran very high ; and the Southern students , ever craving for social and political leadership , particularly delighted in public speaking and argument . With the outbreak of hostilities this large element in the classes disappeared , never to return , and the attendance f ell , at its minimum in 1862 , to sixty-nine students . After the war it rose again to a maximum slightly above the former , augmented by a very different class , ? older men , dislodged from their expected vocations by the general upheaval , and turning to law as a possible means of improving their condition . Before leaving this side of the subject , something should be said of Dane Hall itself , the legal crucible where so much bright gold has been refined and " uttered . " The stately colonnade of the front was replaced by the present ugly vestibule when the building was moved a few feet in 1871 . The old or forward portion of the building was divided on both floors into small rooms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in position . Three of the rooms on the ground floor were appropriated to the trio of professors , and used much more constantly than their types in Austin Hall . The fourth was the library office . One of the second story front rooms was occupied as an abode by the student to whom the duties of librarian were from time to time entrusted . Another room was set aside for the meetings of the law-club courts , another for a general sitting-room and study , and the remaining one for a reading-room . In the transverse addition at the rear of the original building were the library on the first floor and the lecture-room on the second . I believe the old mahogany desk now in the East Lecture-Room of Austin Hall was that used in the original lecture-room . In the library , half the space was taken up with bookshelves , the rest with tables and settees . In various corners and alcoves wore some half-dozen high desks with stools , which were rent . eel by the janitor at five dollars a Lena to the few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ library in a cell . thmous and systematic way . Outside this handful of enthusiasts there was but little work done in the library . The textbooks were read by each man in his On 11 rooms , and there was not much exami ? nation of the treatises or . reports , lie . sides , Chore was difficulty in finding anything among the shelves . If you wanted a book you hunted for it yourself till you found it or got tired . But the greatest obstacle to work in the library was its use by the moot courts on several afternoons of each week , and even by real courts ; for Judge Story , conceiving it would be an inspiration to members of the bar to be surrounded with the works of their great forerunners , and an equal inspiration to the students to get a glimpse of actual court work , inaugurated the practice of bodily transporting the then pliable forum in " jury-waived ? Cases from Boston to Cambridge , and planting it , totem euriam , in the Law School library , as already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tho library insist have been indeed a decidedly uncomfortable wo ? kroom . The greatest indecorum of our modern reading-room is to work in shirtsleeves , but the simplicity of those days thought nothing of the almost universal " claw " of tobacco , and what is worse , if I may be pardoned a legal phrase , provided no receivers for the ensuing Cleaning anything was apparently the last idea of the janitor . This function ? ary , for a generation or more , was an original genius named Sweet/ nun . Born and bred for a parish priest in Ireland , he had come to this country and fallen upon evil days , being glad to get a job nt street digging . President Quincy , passing one day , was amazed at a red head emerging from a trench and quoting , in excellent Latin , the lines from the %Mica concerning the pleasures of the husbandman . He took the orator into his own service , but finding him perhaps too much of a handful , turned Mtn over to the Law School . Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popularly understood , he limited to opening the doors in the morning and locking them at night . He was deeply aggrieved if asked even to replace library hooks left on the tables , and seizing on the maxim so frequently used in Torts , nod i tied it to suit his own purposes thus : " Sic acre libris ut me non kudos . " Rut lie invented other and higher duties . Ile attended all the lectures , and subsequently gave the spea ! ter the benefit of his criticism , on both delivery and doctrine . He exercised a general supervision over all matters connected with the school , and in his later years became a terror to every one in or near it . But he was at last displaced by the wave of reform that swept over the school about 1870 . The keynote of this groat series of changes may be given in the words of President Eliot : " Formerly it was not the custom for the President of Harvard College to have anything to do with the professional schools . I remember the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elected President . It was ill the autumn of 1869 , a few weeks after the term began . I knocked at a door which many of us remember , the first door on the right after going through the outside door of the Hall , and , entering , received the usual salutation of the over genial Governor Washburn , ' Oh , how are you ? Take a chair , ' ? this without looking at mo at all . When he saw who it was , he held up both his hands with his favorite gesture , and said , ' I declare , I never before saw a President of Harvard College in this building ! " nen and there I took a lesson under one of the kindest and most sympathetic of teachers . " Well might the old professor raise his hands to heaven , for stranger things yet were to happen . It is said that he almost fainted when the first blue-books made their unwelcome appearance , and he realized that regular written examinations , with all the labor they imply , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ term of residence became two years . Changes of this sort paved the way for the next great change . The old staff of instructors , oppressed with new burdens and trammeled by unaccustomed supervision , felt that their places should be taken by younger men , more conversant with modern COIlditions , Within a few years of each other they all quietly and gracefully resigned , and a new and enlarged corps of to:tellers took up their work . Of these Memobents , ' quormo magna pars supersont , of the epoch-making publication of Cases on Contracts , of the phomix-like reincarnation of old Nathan Dane 's idea , the systematic and scientific study of the Law , " of the building of Austin Hall , and of the increase of the term to three years , I do not propose to speak . I have merely endeavored to rescue some old stories from oblivion , and to collect and present , however imperfectly , a few memories of the Old Times at the Law School .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
