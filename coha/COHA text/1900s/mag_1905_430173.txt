 | In the little town separated from Washington by the Potomac river over which in the spring of 1861 waved by equal title the flag of the United States and the flag of the State of Virginia , whose fate in the event of a disturbance of friendly relations between the State and National governments seemed bound for weal or woe with that of the nation 's capital , the question could not have been other than a burning one : " What will Virginia do ? " That it felt the seriousness of the situation is indicated by the summing up of the events of the year in a local paper in which the record stands : " January 4 . Day of humiliation and prayer proclaimed by the President of the United States observed with great devotion in Alexandria . The churches were crowded and prayer meetings were conducted with much solemnity . " At an election held February 4 for the State convention the vote stood 1,216 to 202 for referring the question of secession to the people . But the ordinance once passed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disposition to calculate consequences or question the fates . The proclamation of President Lincoln calling upon the States for troops elicited from the mayor of Alexandria a proclamation enjoining upon the citizens calmness and moderation . These , however , had been flung to the winds . Any one who should have conceived the idea that the conservative old town of ivy , cobblestones , and old fogies not a few , would ask to rest in peace and pursue the even tenor of its way securely nestled under the wing of the capital would soon have found cause to revise his opinion . No where was rebellion more rampant . The ladies were already ' at work at the rooms of the Young Men 's Christian Association making clothing for the militia , volunteers were drilling to be mustered into the service of the State , and the Mount Vernon Guards , parading with the Confederate colors , were received with joyous acclamations . This was Alexandria 's response to President Lincoln 's call for  | page deleted  | we are ready to risk life and all that renders life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and honor we pledge the faith of soldiers and the sacred affection of sons . " To men of this stamp the country will not appeal in vain if the hour shall come that calls for the best blood of those who stand for principles held dear and sacred . With all its fervent good-will to the Confederate cause and the pride and satisfaction felt by the doughty old town when it saw the stars and bars flung to the breeze on the roof of a conspicuously located tavern now known to history as the Marshall House , it may well be doubted whether it dreamed that it was for it to shed the first blood that would flow in its defense . One morning it learned with stupefaction that United States troops had entered the town , that Colonel Ellsworth , commanding the New York Zouaves , in attempting to haul down the flag had been killed and that James W. Jackson , the proprietor of the house , lay there riddled with bullets . Jackson was known to have declared that whoever touched the flag would do so over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would in truth constitute himself an army for its defense , or that the declaration was not simple braggadocio ? To those who carried the stars and stripes , the stars and bars , symbol of disunion and treason . seemed doubtless a poor rag for which to sacrifice a life , nevertheless they were less than soldiers , less than men , if in their hearts they did not honor a deed of heroism . This event it doubtless was that opened the eyes of the nation at large to the as yet unbelievable fact that what confronted it was war , fratricidal , deadly , implacable . The writer remembers to have heard G. W. Custis Lee , who during the war was restricted to the unmilitary role of aide-decamp to the Confederate President , declare at this date that , being himself no believer in secession , were he able to dictate proceedings he would call it revolution and order at once the seizing and fortifying of Arlington Heights . As a revolution in the temper of men 's minds none more remarkable can it have been the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who in their zeal for the Union cause had erected in the town a Bell and Everett flag who later chopped in pieces the flag-staff lest it should be used to float the flag of the Union . By a seemingly remarkable  | inconsistency the men who regarded secession as the most unpardonable of crimes were those of all others who were most ready to applaud resistance to its forcible suppression as a glorious cause for which a patriot might gladly die . War time sees manifold changes in Alexandria . The town has been depleted of more than half its voting population . The mother has given her son , the girl has yielded up her lover , and this is no ordinary separation of which the daily post will assuage the bitterness . Many obstacles , hazards of war , risks of interception , and the crime of treason are between her and even the longed-for letter , and much more the interview with its appalling risk. * General Wilcox having issued his proclamation of protection to loyal citizens and punishment for disloyalty and conspiracy , and search having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shown such effective use might be made ? and who could say but there were other Jacksons ? ? the town settled down to monotony , stagnation , and weary waiting . Stagnation it is , though the streets are soon gay with bright brand-new uniforms , sparkling with glittering brass , though one shop has multiplied itself into three and booths have been erected and shanties run up upon vacant lots for the display of provisions and every kind of merchandise that might tempt the ephemeral population . Gay colors , cheap watches and plated ware are largely in evidence . On the streets every novelty is exhibited that might attract a dime or half-dime . Here are views of a whole city displayed in a marvellous stereopticon box . There is a boy doing a thriving business baking and selling waffles ? the beginning perhaps of a plutocrat . The streets are well nigh impassable , no city can show a more animated and crowded thoroughfare than the erstwhile drowsy little town . Broadway prices are offered for shop space . One might believe an international bazaar had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and uniform making a spectacle as diverse as any city of the country could offer to the curious passer-by . Occasionally the scene is perchance diversified by the trundling in a wheelbarrow of a drunken soldier who has been too obstreperous for  | the guards to manage and for whom the heroic treatment doubtless proves a prompt restorative . A baggage train consisting of as many as a thousand heavy wagons drawn by six horses passes lumbering over the old streets , and a miracle it seems now that the historic cobble stones survived the services which they rendered to the Union . No longer might the citizen choose his hour for the household marketing . It was safer to do it at six in the morning , and the marketman assumed the right to dispose of his provisions to whoever brought the largest handful of cash , and was to be heard calling out , " No change for a purchase under fifty cents ! " Then one fine day the troops would be ordered off leaving only enough to guard the town ? no very difficult task . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would reappear . The playing of a funeral march for a soldier who had begun the journey to his last resting place , a troop of perhaps a hundred " contrabands , " men , women , and children , free as flies to try what the world held for them , the arrival of ambulances and vehicles pressed into the service of bringing in the wounded , or the marching and countermarching of troops , would break the silence . The river for miles was a scene of the greatest animation . All classes of vessels , ocean steamers , schooners , and sailing vessels dotted it with brilliant points . Never had the harbor presented such a show of craft , not even in the good old days when the enterprise and activity of Alexandria were held up to the admiration and emulation of Baltimore ; yet it represented no trade or traffic ; only the fictitious and pernicious activities of war . At night on the surrounding hills the camp fires flamed , flickered and flared in the breeze , bright lights glittered from the hospitals and from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pale moon rose up slowly and calmly she looked down , " and the silent stars gazed wondering upon the glittering panorama which human discord and passion had evoked . But what means this daytime crowd gathered on this otherwise quiet street ? Surely the whole town must be assembled here . For quite a distance the street is impassable . A riot perhaps , a little insurrection which the small force of guards has been unable to control ? Or a hungry mob begging their bread of  | the military authorities ? Neither of these . The same crowd is to be seen every Monday morning in the same place . They are simply awaiting their turn to obtain a pass at the office of the provost marshal . To visit the camps or to visit Washington , to cross the river into Maryland , to go sailing or " ducking " on the Potomac , to pass the town guards after ten o'clock at night , all these require passes and every Monday morning these passes are issued or renewed . A " Union Association " formed of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the proceedings of its weekly reunions make humorous reading . To one who , having lived through the period , reconstructs in imagination its events and emotions ik is not yet perfectly easy to realize that a time could arrive when incidents that seemed so full of gravity and seriousness might be read by all sections of the country ? that the deepest and darkest of conspiracies might even provoke a smile . That the members were in all honesty friends to the Union cause we may not doubt ; that they were not of the stuff of which heroes and martyrs are made seems clearly proved . When the occasion arose to make proof of their loyalty they seem always to have been found wanting . Complaint is made of them that while soldiers are giving their lives on the battle-field , these patriots are confining their efforts to saying : " I am a loyal citizen , give me a pass , " or to soliciting passes for their friends without their being required to sign the obligation not to give aid and comfort to the enemies of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only three offered themselves for enrollment in the home guards which it was proposed to form . A resolution that flags be raised over the houses and places of business of members was after a good deal of discussion passed to read that they be requested to raise them . A resolution to contribute twenty-five cents for the erection of a line of flags across King street , thus obliging secessionists to pass under the flag , met with little favor . One patriot declared that he wanted to see the Union flag everywhere , but he could discover no reason for the members being taxed to cover a particular part of King street with it . He could not approve of such a pent-up Utica for the flag . It even appears that some presumed so far as to indulge a little humor at the expense of the dictators and autocrats which a state of war had foisted upon the town . At  | one of the meetings the provost judge read a note in which some se , ladies requested information as to the precise manner in which Union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had enjoined upon them to toss their heads to one side but had not stated to which side . The judge explained that he had merely wished to indicate that , as it had been the custom of the secession ladies before the recent election of municipal officers held pursuant to the laws of the government at Wheeling to hold their heads high and toss ahem to one side ( which he illustrated in a manner to raise a laugh ) , so now that Union men were in control of the town offices he would like to see Union ladies carrying their heads high and if need be a little to one side to show the pride they felt in themselves as loyal citizens . What , meanwhile , is the Alexandria girl doing , the girl who by rights is a debutante and should have been enjoying her rose-bud season at this epoch when the new woman was not yet born ? Plenty of gay uniforms are here , all that could be desired in the suggestive bravery of costume which the female heart is reputed to hold dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy in gray may be the target for the darts of her bright eyes . The blue shades into the gray , the gray into the blue , but to overwrought imaginations the slight difference of color symbolized all the difference between heaven and hell . A single one of the days such as chanced to the girl in debatable land , bringing the sweetheart in gray , might atone for many a weary week ! No wonder an Alexandria girl sent General Beauregard a set of gold studs containing each a word of which the combination said : " Let us out . " The uniforms themselves may have wearied of the dull monotony of certainty , the certainty that in these streets no blood would flow , of the excitement of raising a flag over the house of a suspected citizen ( the flag thus having been made to serve alike as the shield and consecration of the patriot and the punishment of suspected treason ) , of dancing at Marini 's hall where a children 's dancing school was held , with the postmaster 's daughters , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by wearing red and white cloaks or bonnets . This was a combination of color in high disfavor and was run down as though it possessed a magic power against which the Union cause would contend in vain .  | If such a state of agairs gave birth to conspiracy no one can have a right to be astonished . One of the debates of the Union Association had reference to the necessity for showing passes after ten o'clock at night . It was argued that conspirators could find their opportunity at any hour of the day or night and were not more dangerous after than before ten o'clock . To this some one objected that from the beginning of time crime and treason had sought the cover of the night . It was therefore the part of prudence to lay special restrictions upon the night hours . For the use and benefit of history it must here be stated that the only assemblages of conspirators that were held in Alexandria were held during the day or the early evening by a secret association styling itself " Knights of the Golden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from ten to twenty . It was not they who tossed their heads or flaunted the colors of secession , these pious maidens with downcast eyes . The third story room with gable windows where their meetings were held , where they donned the badge of the order and discussed the operations of the society and the sums of money which had been raised , never drew upon itself the suspicion of being a nest of treason . The oath of initiation which the Knights of the Golden Circle took was as follows : I solemnly avow in the sight of these presents that I am a true and loyal citizen of the Confederate States . I swear that I will give no aid or comfort to any enemy or enemies of the Confederacy , and that to the best of my ability I will aid and support the government of the Confederate States . I swear that I will not marry one who has borne arms for the United States against the Confederate States , nor a Union man nor a Black Republican nor a traitor . So help me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " traitor " was applied to any one who extricated himself from a difficult position by taking the oath of allegiance to the United States . As an indication of the very serious light in which the Knights regarded themselves may be reproduced a prayer which was found quoted as having been : Almighty God , Sovereign Disposer of events , it hath pleased Thee to protect and defend the Confederate States hitherto in their conflict with their enemies and to be unto them a shield .  | page deleted  | album containing the autographs of the prisoners , on the flyleaf of which is pasted a clipping from a contemporary newspaper as follows : Oh ! who has not heard of that isle on Lake Erie So guarded today , so unheeded before , Where the truthful and brave stroll all listless and weary Their hearts far away from its wave-sounding shore . The sun rises red on thy waters , Lake Erie , And gladdens the day with its rich golden hue ; Oh ! who will e'er tell of the thoughts dull and dreary Now curtaining with sadness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' mid the storm of the battle And riders lay breathless their horses all foam , Those hearts that ne'er quailed with the musketry 's rattle Now melt at the thought of dear faces at home . The bugle call wakes with its reveille token From night 's fitful slumbers those heroes so true , From sweet dreams of " Dixie " unconquered , unbroken , To muse and to sigh till the welcome tattoo . The storm blasts of winter sweep over Lake Erie , In silence we bear our lost comrades to rest ; No more will they stroll with the listless and weary , They sleep their last sleep in this isle of the West . As the military were holding their services in old Christ Church one or two families applied for and obtained permission to remove the cushions of their pews . Of course the Knights were there to supervise operations . Moreover , they had business of their own . While the cushions were being taken one of them removed the silver plate which designated General Washington 's pew and carried it away in triumph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it will be stolen , " they argued . But this enterprise so auspiciously begun was destined to end in failure and discomfiture . The plate was safely stored at the Knights ' headquarters and the incident was considered closed . But one morning an officer called at the residence of the senior warden of the church and demanded the return of the plate . The gentleman protested his entire ignorance upon the subject . The officer replied that the plate had disappeared simultaneously with the removal of the cushions , that it was known to be the work of certain persons and could therefore he traced . Investigation being made , the ab- stracted article was discovered and ruefully restored . As a proof that the Knights had not miscalculated it did not long remain in its place . The plate was not , however , in the nature of a relic . General Washington did not thus designate his own pew and the present plate answers the purpose . As there were no overt acts of hostility on the part of the citizens against the authorities , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the very air was hostile , that an order was issued for the expulsion of a considerable number of them . The Alexandria Gazette of which a small edition was published at that date stated that it was not able to ascertain the exact number of citizens to whom the order was sent , but there were several hundred . One morning an officer alighted from his horse and approaching three little Knights who were walking together near their homes requested the addresses of certain persons . Of course the Knights did not know , notwithstanding that the father of one of them was among the number . The officer replied " Perhaps you will know more in a few days . " The order which the officer was engaged in distributing ran as follows : HEADQUARTERS PROVOST MARSHAL GENERAL , DEFENSES SOUTH OF THE POTOMAC . ALEXANDRIA , VA. , June 29 , 1863 . In pursuance of an order of the War Department , you are hereby notified to appear at this office forthwith and make satisfactory proof of your loyalty to the Government of the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forty-eight hours after receiving this notice , you will be sent outside of our lines . Persons so removed will be sent by boat to City Point . Heads of families will be allowed to take their families with them , together with a reasonable amount of personal baggage , not exceeding one hundred pounds , including the trunk or package , to each grown person , and the necessary wearing apparel of the children accompanying them . They will not be allowed to take any supplies , stores or medicines , nor any letters , correspondence or writings of any kind whatever . All such persons to whom this notice is sent will , without further order , deliver their baggage at the dock , foot of Prince street , at 9 o'clock Monday morning , July 6 , 1863 , with a complete inventory of the same . All such baggage will be examined , and if contraband articles are found the entire baggage of the person attempting to take such articles out will be confiscated , and no goods will be allowed to pass unless so delivered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at or before that time send to this office a list of the members of their families who are to accompany them , with the full name and age of each person . The parties , and the members of their families , accompanying them , will report at the foot of Prince street on Tuesday morning , July 7 , at 9 o'clock a. m . No person will be allowed to go on board excepting those so to be sent South . By order H. H. WELLS , Lieut . Col. and Provost Marshal , Prov . Mar . Gen. Defences South of Potomac . A week later there was sent to certain persons who had received the above order the following : HEADQUARTERS PROVOST MARSHAL GENERAL , DEFENCES SOUTH OF POTOMAC . ALEXANDRIA , VA. , July 6 , 1863 . An opportunity is hereby allowed you to appear at this office and by taking the oath of allegiance , or giving other satisfactory security , you will obtain permission to remain in Alexandria . Respectfully , H. W. WELLS , Lieut . Col. and Provost Marshal General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only designed to test the temper of the citizens . That it caused dismay and perplexity is certain , but there was no thought of accepting the alternative . Rumors soon circulated that the order would be rescinded , but an inquiry at the provost marshal 's office elicited the response that it would be carried out . If there was dismay , there was also rejoicing . An old lady dreaded to inform her husband that he was to be ejected from his home in his old age . When he received the news he raised one foot as if about to dance and sang : " I wish I was in Dixie ! " Those who were better off aided their poorer friends in their extremity . On July 9 , 1863 , many citizens were to be seen wending their way to the foot of Prince street where they expected to find a steamer in readiness for their transportation . Friends had congregated and touching scenes of farewell were witnessed . Many hours they waited in the hot sun , the day was wearing on and still there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order had been rescinded , and the fact was soon officially announced . The baggage was restored to its  | owners and they received permission to return to their homes . The whole affair was simply a farce ; a delusion and a snare it had been indeed , and very much like a tragedy , to those whose homes had been broken up and effects sold or scattered . Great as was the distress which Alexandrians underwent during these memorable years , the record is one which could be matched , and perhaps more than matched , by any other town in hostile military occupation . But could life ever be quite the same to the girls whose young lives opened so seriously upon a scene of storm and strife as to those the recollections of whose youth now carry them back to days of sunshiny peace ? One Knight was the daughter of a Union man and the compassion felt for her in the cruelty of her position can never be forgotten . Would not a serious problem have confronted the United States government had the personal influence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ? had the task devolved upon it of governing thousands of Alexandrians from the Potomac to the Gulf of Mexico ? A writer who has published a volume of his war reminiscences speaks of having first realized that the war was at an end when he heard music and laughter proceeding from a house in Richmond where Federal officers were visiting a widow and her daughters who had been expelled from Alexandria . The truth is that no one was expelled from Alexandria during the war . Union officers had always been welcome guests at the house of the ladies in question when their home was in the Federal lines , and the incident had not the value imputed to it . A feature of wartime Alexandria not undeserving of mention , is the indifference to fashions in dress which must have made of the streets a variously edifying spectacle to visitors from the world beyond the limits of stockades and blockades . Any wearing apparel that could be resurrected from the archives of the past was not only admissible , but even preferred to the most modern and approved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a drawn green barege calash which shrouded in more than oriental mystery the owner of the head in the rear . The only social entertainment to be placed to the credit of these years was a series of more or less burlesque tableaux in which no attempt was made at high art . One of them , " The return of the  | refugees from Dixie , " achieved such success in the devising of costumes ? still more incredible than those which were already familiar ? that the spectators , old and young , were convulsed with merriment . As the citizens were not disposed to participate in the military services held in old Christ Church , the Episcopalians withdrew to St. Paul 's , where like the Pilgrim Fathers they hoped to be permitted to worship after their own hearts . This meant refraining from recognizing the President of the United States as their chief magistrate by using the prayer for him contained in their ritual . All went well with this weekly reunion of sympathetic souls until one Sunday morning , when several wearers of the too familiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the midst of the prayers the congregation became aware of a confusion of sounds breaking in upon the familiar words of the liturgy . The wearer of one of the uniforms , a captain of Illinois cavalry , had advanced to the front of the chancel , and finding no attention paid to his injunction to read the omitted prayer , began reading it himself . By this time the congregation had become thoroughly aroused , some were on their feet , some sitting up in their pews staring in blank amazement , while a few continued reverently making the responses as long as the officiating clergyman 's voice was heard , and in the clerical duet the latter prevailed over the intruder . The officers who had accompanied the chaplain were called upon to lend their aid . A vestryman , inspired for the occasion with an unwonted vigor , seized the first who entered the chancel and threw him back over the railing . A squad of soldiers now charged up the aisle with fixed bayonets and the clergyman 's arrest was accomplished . He was led down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " You shall not take my father ! " , amid a volley of prayer books and a pitcher of water hurled from the choir gallery by a Knight , which wrought no damage to friend or foe . The clergyman was conducted through the street in his surplice to the regiment 's headquarters , and the military governor , after telegraphing to Washington for instructions , released him . This event , commonly known as the " battle of St. Paul 's Church , " the only battle of the war which was fought in Alexandria , now appears in a light rather ludicrous than heroic , but every episode of a war  | can not be glorious . A newspaper styling itself the Local News , ? alias the Alexandria Gazette , ? which the following day published an account of the affair , was set on fire in the night and its archives destroyed . This has served to commemorate the incident , for the paper does not fail yearly to announce : " This is the anniversary of the burning of the Gazette office . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place of worship but was converted into a hospital , as sooner or later befell most of the churches . The last scene of the war which was enacted at Alexandria was the return of absentees to homes deserted for four years , which had been quitted with never a thought that the stars and bars would not celebrate a joyous home-coming . But Jackson 's flag , flung to the breeze over the historic tavern where Washington had been wont to give " the prince of caterers " his invariable order for canvas back , madeira and hominy , was the first and last emblem of the Confederate States that was destined to wave over the town . What they saw when they returned was the flag of the Union robed in black and the houses draped in mourning pursuant to a military order . It is no wonder if , prostrate and humiliated as they were , the citizens had obeyed the order in a spirit that made of the act a mockery , and failed yet to comprehend that the tragedy which robbed the nation of its chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that beyond any other portion of the Union it was the South whose right it was to mourn .
