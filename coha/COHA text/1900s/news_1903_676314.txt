txt Senator Grady , the minority leader , to-night committed his party associates in the Senate to a position which , if adhered to , may prolong the session . of the Legislature into the Summer ? months . Because the majority refused to recall the Stevens inheritance-tax measure , passed last Thursday without objection . in order that the minority members might be recorded upon it . Senator Grady gave notice that no bill would be allowed to pass the Senate from now until the end of the session unless there were twenty-six Republican Senators present to vote for it . He proceeded to carry out his threat at to-night 's session . After a vain effort to change the attitude of the minority . Senator Malby , who was acting as the Republican floor leader , was compelled to make a motion for adjournment , the majority being unable to do business because of the absence of three of their number , Senators White . Stewart , and Elsberg . It was one of the stormiest nights in the Senate within the recollection of the oldest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sides were worn out by the vehemence of their oratory . At first the Republican Senators did not realize that Senator Grady was in earnest in. the position which he took , and when they did realize it they had gone too far to compromise without the appearance of completely backing down . - This they were indisposed to do . and so the fight was carried on to the bitter end , so far as to-night 's session was concerned . And Senator Grady vowed in his last impassioned declaration that it would be carried on until the Republicans yielded or brought the session of the Legislature to a close . ? Just before Senator Malby 's motion to adjourn was put Senator Foley announced that the minority members would hold a conference to-morrow at 10 o'clock in the Senate library . When interviewed , he said that the object of the conference was for the minority members to consider and agree upon a plan of action upon which they would be entirely harmonious . The Stevens Inheritance Tax bill , over which the trouble arose , is one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 Per cent , upon all direct inheritances of over 810,000 . It is estimated that the bill will raise ** a year . When it came up in the Senate last Thursday Senator Grady was absent . No objection was offered to it by any member of the minority present . and it . went through without a dissenting vote . This- occasioned surprise . no persons being More amazed than the leaders of the majority . They had expected the minority to wake a hard fight on the measure . Senator Foley , who is the leading minority member on the Committee on Taxation and Retrenchment , which had the bill under consideration . was in his seat when the measure was called up . and , in the absence of Senator Grady. his associates , - so they all said to-night , looked to him to make whatever statement about the bill was necessary . ' When Scnator McCarren and others asked him about the bill . they declare . Senator Foley said it was all right . In explanation of ' this , - Senator Foley said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's tax measure , mistaking it for another bill to which there was no objection . Upon Senator Foley 's assurances few if any of t'he Democratic Senators even thought it necessary to respond when their names were called , and all who did were recorded as having voted in favor of the bill . ' When it became known that the minority members had assisted in passing one of the Governor 's tax measures imposing as additional burden upon real estate there was some criticism made , and the understanding here is that Charles F. Murphy . leader of Tammany Hall . was much wrought up over what had occurred . He is said to have demanded that the Democratic Senators ask for the recall of the bill in order that they might register their protest against it . BEGINNING OF THE FIGHT . Be this as it may , the Senate had not proceeded very far with the calendar tonight when Senator Grady offered a resolution that the bill be recalled in order that an opportunity might be afforded to Democratic Senators to be recorded on the measure as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This angered Senator Grady . In a fiery manner and resounding voice he asked whether the majority intended to deny the minority any and all courtesy . " Iy ail my experience in the Senate . " he said . " I have never seen a more brutal diselay of partisanship than this . It is absolutely indecent . Members of the minority are recorded upon a bill which involves the raising of $1,000,000 in a way which does violence to their convictions , and when they ask the privilege of having their record cotrected it is denied them . Any member of the minority who would submit to such treatment as that has no regard for his self-respect- I demand a roll call on the resolution . " The roll call was taken and resulted 21 to 21 . The vote being a tie , President Raines declared the resolution lost This brought forth another outbreak of oratory from Senator Grady . He denounced the action of the majority in unmeasured terms , and said that so far as he was concerned . the Republicans having thrown courtesy and decency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single measure from now until the close of the session . " Unless you have twenty-six Republican Senators in their seats , " he said . " you can count on nothing going through this Senate that my vote will prevent I shall demand a roll call on every bill . Every single piece of legislation I have here can go by the board . And I ask my colleagues of the minority to act with me in resenting the indecent affront which has been put upon us by the majority . " The first bill reached on the calendar after Senator Grady 's threat was one of his own . He demanded a roll call upon it . and when his name was called asked to be excused from voting . There was no opposition to the bill . The next bill was one introduced by Senator Malby to provide for the division of union free school districts . Although it was introducel by Senator Malby. it was drawn by Senator McClelland. a Democrat . Senator McClellan acknowledged to the Senate that the bill was his measure and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senators McCarren and Foley also voted for it . It did not receive the requiree number of votes and was lost . Senator Wilcox had one of his measures laid over . When the Rogers bill providing for the payment of the balance due newspapers for the publication of concurrent resolutions was reached , Senator Grady I said : " I will say to the members of the minority that they need have no hesitation in voting against the measure . It provides pap for Republican country newspapers . " When Senator MeCarren 's name was reached on the roll call he said : " Mr. President , I agree with the statement of Senator Malby that this bill is a bill to pay newspapers for services already rendered and that it includes payments to Democratic as well as to Republican newspapers . I feel that if I were to vote against it I would have every editor of a Democratic country newspaper in the State down on me . " Senator Grady said " Ah ! " in a disgusted tone . " You can Ah ! ' about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I feel about it , " said Mr. McCarren . The bill was lost-22 to 18 . After Senator Grady had again lectured the minority on their duty , Senator Armstrong of Rochester suggested that if he wanted to scold Ins Democratic colleagues , the Senator from the Fourteenth should " hire a hall " Senator Malby explained that the reason the majority had refused the request of Senator Grady to call back the Stevens bill was that the majority did not have enough votes to pass it again and might not have enough for some time to come . REPUBLICAN LEADER EXPLAINS . " Senator White is so seriously ill that he may not be able to return to the Senate during the session . " he said ; " Senator Stewart is by the bedside of his wife , who is dangerously ill , and Senator Elsberg is kept away by illness in his family . The Senator from the Fourteenth knows these facts . and he knows that if he persist , in his attitude he will block the business of the Senate . If he is willing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senator Grady retorted that the excuse of the Republican leader was no excuse . The Stevens bill , he said , could be advanced to a third reading in the Assembly and brought back to the Senate and held until such time as the Republicans did have enough votes to pass it . Sena tor McClelland of Westchester said he was in entire accord with the position which Senator Grady had taken . He referred to the fact that he owed his seat in the Senate to the inability of Senator Mills , I his predecessor . to explain his vote in favor of a bill introduce by Senator Brackett in the interest of Richard Canfield , the g Saratoga gambler . " I do not want to suffer as Mills suffered . " he said . " and unless the Stevens bill is recalled no amount of explanation on my part will set me right . " The Rogers bill failed , as did also the Malby bill . to authorize the acquisition by the United States of lands in the City of New York as a site for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ useless to protract the session as it was evident that owing to the attitude of the minority it was impossible to transact any business . He accordingly made the motion to adjourn.
