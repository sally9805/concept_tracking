txt Is it personal and party loyalty , or a sort of hypnotism that constrains the President 's official family to stand by him and stand up for him in everything he does ? Mr. ROOSEVELT did not consult all the members of his Cabinet about initiating the proceedings to enforce the Anti-Trust act . But no word of criticism or dissent was heard from anybody after the proceedings were begun . No Voice was lifted in protest against the many violation ? of our treaty with Colombia at the time of the secession of Panama . And not only has the President 's Executive order extending the scope and effect of the pension laws escaped censure , but here comes Pension Commissioner ' WARE , in a letter to The Sun , demanding that nothing more be said about it . It is astonishing how completely the mind of the President dominates the minds of those about him . He has them under a spell . Commissioner WARE insists that the President 's Executive order became good law when Congress appropriated money to pay the additional pensions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not discuss the question whether the order was not in fact an attempt to make law at the ' White House . He does not consider the question whether it was not an act of Executive usurpation and a violation of the Constitution . He says that it has been ratified by Congress and is , therefore , beyond the pale of criticism . In effect he demands that the newspapers quit talking about it . If this were good doctrine there would be no bounds to the Presidential prerogative . It is usual for stockholders of corporations at their annual meetings to pass a formal resolution confirming , ratifying , and approving all acts of the officers and Directors during the year . If Commissioner WARE 'S argument is sound , the Directors of a corporation might with impunity pursue a course of infamous chicanery , and yet all their acts would be washed white and made wise , legal , and good by the stockholders ' vote to ratify , confirm , and approve . Congress found itself confronted by an Executive order which called for the expenditure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appropriation of $1,500,000 . The House of Representatives specifically refused to insert in the bill the language of the President 's order . Had the order been enacted in that way Congress would indeed have given its sanction in a way to relieve the President of responsibility . But even this es-post -- facto ratification would not have freed the order from its original taint of usurped authority . As it is , Congress has hardly even condoned the Executive intrusion into its field . It appropriated the money , because otherwise the President would have been put in the awkward position of issuing orders which could not be carried out . The Republican Congress did not want to have Mr. ROOSEVELT put in that position in this campaign year. , The President 's act was of a nature not to be justified by any subsequent action of Congress . It was at the time a stretch of the Executive power , or rather , the assumption of a power which the President had no statutory or Constitutional authority to exercise . The only good point we can see in Commissioner ** letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is a lingering sensitiveness about the pension order .
