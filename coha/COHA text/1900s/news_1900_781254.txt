txt At midnight , with the first session of the Democratic State Ccnvention but ten hours off , the CrokerMurphy-McLaughlin combine has positively agreed on only two of the candidates of the ticket which will be named by the Croker-Murphy-McLaughlin combine . Senator Hill and his friends are in a hopeless minority . They declare , however . that they will carry the banner of Controller Coler into the convention and wave it in the faces of the enemy until they are voted down . John B. ' Stanchfield of Elmira is the candidate of the Croker-Murphy-McLaughlin combine for Governor . This declaration was made by Mr. Croker 's closest advisers when he dismissed them to-night and retired to his cottage . Even the Tammany men of undoubted loyalty here can scarcely believe that the convention will nominate Stanchfield , and they ask Mr. Croker and Mr. Murphy why he should be nominated . They get no satisfaction . That the name of Mr. Stanchfield was first taken up by the CrokerMurphy-McLaughlin combine for the purpose of taking away Mr. Hill 's fighting ground  --  Mr. Stanchfield being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be no doubt . The combine believed that Mr. Hill would have to submit if Stanchfield was put at the head of the ticket . But Mr. Hill will not submit , and the combine now appears to have determined upon the nomination of Stanchfield simply because they have no other available candidate . They talk of Judge Earl and they talk of Supreme Court Justice Barrett . but only to add that neither of them would accept the nomination ; and so it now stands , Stanchfield for Governor . The other candidate already agreed upon by the combine is Thomas F. Conway of Plattsburg . Clinton County . for Attorney General . He has been promised the place . At the same time George H. Palmer of Schoharie is advancing claims for the Attorney Generalship which ' may put him in over Mr. Conway . Mr. Palmer 's friends are even going so far as to urge him as a compromise candidate for Governor , who would be satisfactory to Senator Hill , but Senator Hill says no . If Senator Hill stands throughout as he stands to-night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until the end . He wants no compromises , will enter no conferences , even if invited to . and seems to be determined  --  to use a Western phrase  --  to die with his boots on . It still looks as though Senator Mackey Of Erie would be the candidate of the Croker-Murphy-McLaughlin combine for LieutenaneGoverrfor . Mr. afackey 's friends are shouting that he will have first place or nothing ; that . he controls 102 votes , and can tie up the convention , but Croker , Murphy ; McLaughlin and-Company seem to be very well satisfied that Senator Mackey will consider himself very lucky to get the second place on the ticket and pay as the price the delivery of as many votes as he can control to them . They are probably right The rest of the slate can not be predicted to-night with any more accuracy than it was in THE TimEs yesterday morning . The Croker-Murphy-McLaughlin combine are reserving decision in the nominations for minor officers on the ticket so that they will have something to barter with if they find to-morrow that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tense . The men who are bent on the complete humiliation of Hill are silently exulting in their strength . Mr. Hill , in the darkest hour of his political career , is determined and defiant He has concluded that there is no use accepting crumbs from the bands of the men who would crush him , but that he can gain more by fighting them to the finish even in the face of certain defeat . That is what he says . In carrying out their programme for the humiliation of Hill the Croker-MurphyMcLaughlin combine played a trump card to-night when they induced Elliot Danforth , supposedly the most loyal of Mr. Bill 's supporters , to nominate Senator McCarrell , Hill 's bitter enemy . for temporary Chairman of the convention . Hill received the news of that action with a sneer , and the statement that it would have no bearing on the fight which he has to make . It is very hard to compute as to the num-ber of delegates which will be controlled by the Croker-Murphy-McLaughlin combine . It seems safe to say , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delegates they will control at least 300 of the 450 delegates . The Croker-Murphy-McLaughlin leaders learned to-night that the Kings County delegate who would present the name of Controller Coler is 01 to Kernpner , a former Tammany Hall Assemblyman . The Kings County politicians spent hours last evening trying to dissuade him from nominating Controller Color . All efforts were unsuccessful . Mr. Kempner is the author of a book on Richard Croker 's lite. in which the Tammany leader is exposed as a corrupt politician . Mr. Kempner said last night : The book on Mr. Croker 's life will be Ice water to the speech to be delivered in the convention naming Controller Coler . " Orders were sent to the Tammany Hall orators to prepare for a " debate " on the convention floor . Senator Grady and others will take the Tammany side . As predicted in THE TIMES yesterday the Albany County delegates , with the exception of Senator Hill , have been driven into the Croker-Murphy-McLaughlin camp by Eugene Wood . whom Mr. Croker recently branded as a " paid lobbyist .
