txt United States Consul James Verner Long , writing from Patras , Greece , says a prominent English syndicate has recently begun a search for cil on the Island of Zante . The present operations are on the site of what have been known for centuries as the " pitch wells , " situated in the southernmost portion of the island , some ten miles from the town of Zante , and reached by an excellent carriage road from that place . These pitch springs , or welts , are usually named among the interesting antiquities of the island , and received descriptive Mention by Herodotus , Pliny , and others . In the larger of the two springs , the pitch is seen bubblinc. up , as it comes from the earth , beneath exceptionally clear water . The ' substance rises in large bubbles , which assume the foar and appearance of rubber balls , until the inclosed air bursts the globules and the pitch passes off . The output of this spring Is estimated at about three barrels a day , and can be utilized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its crude state it is comparatively valueless . The second spring is in an adjacent vineyard , but the pitch does not bubble up as it does in the spring just described . and its presence is only surmised from the extreme aridity and dark color of the soil , which sticks to the feet to some extent when walked on . The demand for this pitch in Zante has in recent years been very small , as vegetable pitch has taken its place and Is much preferred . The English syndiCate began its operations in boring for oil in the immediate vicinity of the bubbling spring . It started with the most approved modern boring machinery and methods , and is being backed by substantial capital . If Immediate success is not realized in its first venture it is said that the syndicate will bore several very deep wells before the termination of its enterprise . The discovery of petroleum in this region is confidently predicted by reputable geologists and others who have studied oil territory in other countries .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
