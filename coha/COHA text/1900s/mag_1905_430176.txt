 | Professor of History in Hendrix College , Arkansas Although the indictments of the Declaration of Independence were leveled at the English executive , it is very doubtful if the experience which led up to that revolt had much to do with the failure of the Continental Congress to provide an executive for the new-born American State . Throughout its existence the Continental Congress either acted as its own executive or entrusted such business to committees directly responsible to itself . The need of a strong executive was not so apparent at first , when all patriotic Americans were willing to spend and be spent in a cause which they felt to be glorious . While still under the influence of this impulse the Articles of Confederation were formed ( 1777 ) and submitted to the States , with no provision for an executive . The inspiration of the common cause was strong enough to carry the war to a successful conclusion , but even before the Articles went into operation ( 1781 ) the weakness of such a system ? where Congress had only recommendatory or powers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear . With the return of peace the impotent confederation fell into greater contempt with every passing day . Men soon realized that the Congress must not only have greater powers , but that it must be backed up by an executive to carry out its decrees . It is not surprising , then , that the first outline of a constitution presented to the convention in 1787 provided for an executive to carry out the national laws . Yet the members were wholly at sea on the number , qualifications , method of election , term and tenure of office , powers ? in fact , on nearly every question concerning this executive . In spite of a strong fear that a single executive would prove tyrannical , this was finally adopted by a vote of seven to three , Virginia being saved from a tie by the vote of Washington . This being settled , the powers to be given and denied to this executive were then taken up . No body of men , in providing for the different departments of government , can foresee  | every contingency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases . The convention of 1787 , being fearful of tyranny , naturally was loath to confer great powers , unless they were carefully hedged about ; yet the debates reveal a desire to reconcile a discreet watchfulness over the executive , with a reasonable independence . That the members realized that some powers , to be exercised efficiently , must be conferred , with few limitations , is shown by the sweeping terms in which the most dangerous of all powers was given , that of the command over the military forces . Naturally , it is from this clause that the prerogative has been most freely developed , yet it has some roots in the peace powers . It may be well enough to say at the outset that by prerogative is meant the use of discretionary powers , or powers not expressly conferred . Sometimes they may be drawn by implication from specific powers ; sometimes they are extralegal , not to say illegal , except in so far as necessity may be said to legalize them . I. PEACE POWERS . 1 . The ordinance power . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means for the execution of governmental powers , " is clearly vested in Congress by the Constitution . The President is sworn to execute the laws , but if Congress fail to provide the means , he is not authorized to do so . But a few exigencies have arisen when the executive has seen fit to pursue a course which certainly looks very much like the exercise of this power , if not that of real legislation . In 1813 President Madison appointed and commissioned ministers to negotiate a treaty of peace with Great Britain when the Senate was not in session . On reassembling the Senate protested against this as the creation and filling of office without its consent . The power to negotiate treaties and send ambassadors was held not to include the power to create the offices necesssary to that end . A similar act by President Monroe called forth another protest ( April 20 , 1822. ) 2 . Appointment to and removal from office . The Constitution clearly vests the power of appointment to office in the President ,  | by and with the advice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not otherwise provided for by law . The nomination rests solely with the President , and may be withdrawn before it is acted on by the Senate . The appointment is the joint act of the Senate and the executive . The granting of the commission is , then , a duty imposed upon the executive by another clause in the Constitution . However , Jefferson withheld a commission after it had been made out and signed , and apr pointed another man to the office , although it was one over which he did not possess the power of removal . The Supreme Court held that the first man was entitled to the office , but that it had no power to enforce his rights , not having the right to issue writs of mandamus . Perhaps an inferior court could . The writer does not know of another similar case . By the Constitution the President is empowered to " fill up vacancies that may happen during the recess of the Senate by granting commissions which shall expire at the end of their next session . " This clause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government through the inability of the executive to make appointments by himself ; but since the commission runs until the close of the next session of the Senate , it really enables him to keep in office men who are obnoxious to that body . In the course of his struggle with the national bank , President Jackson found it necessary to secure a secretary of the treasury who would do his bidding . During a recess of the Senate he dismissed Secretary Duane , who refused to change the place of deposit or to resign , and appointed Roger B. Taney instead , and the withdrawal of the deposits was at once begun . Jackson knew that this was contrary to the wishes of Congress ; consequently he did not send in the nomination of Mr. Taney after the the reassembling of the Senate until near the close of the session . The nomination was rejected and Mr Taney at once resigned.t A law of February 13 , 1795 , allowed appointments ad interim in case of vacancies at any time and for any cause in the departments of State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to these three departments , it has been applied to others several times , as to that of the Navy in 1823 , and to that of the  | Postoffice in 1862 . A noted case of the exercise of this power to thwart the will of the Senate has recently arisen in the repeated nomination and repeated appointment and rejection of Dr. Crum to be collector at the port of Charleston . It reminds one of the practice of colonial governors of proroguing and dissolving assemblies and calling them to meet in unusual places , to worry them into submission to the will of the executive . The Constitution says nothing directly about the power of removal . One of the objections raised to it was that this very great power was vested in the executive alone . No friend of the Constitution appears to have defended this view before the Constitution was adopted , while Hamilton , in the Federalist ( No. 77 ) maintained that removal was inseparable from appointment and could be accomplished only with the consent of the Senate . However , Madison afterwards declared that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ executive alone , and the first Congress , in providing for the creation of certain offices , adopted this view , the vote being 29 to 22 in the House , and decided by the vote of the Vice President in the Senate . The power was exercised with moderation until the advent of Jackson . The wholesale removals inaugurated by him revived the discussion , but no attempt to limit the prerogative was successful . In 1867 the Tenure of Office Act was passed over the President 's veto with this object in view . The act never was tested in the courts , but it can hardly be defended on constitutional grounds . It was modified for President Grant , and there the matter rested until the advent of President Cleveland . The Senate , a majority of which was of the opposite party , then showed that it wished to sit in judgment upon removals , but the President resisted its demands , and the law was finally repealed , thereby restoring the condition created by the view adopted in 1789. 4 . The recognition of new States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public ministers . Since there is no limitation as to what ministers shall be received , it is within his power to recognize a change of government in an old State or the formation of a new State , by the reception of its representative . This has been done several times in our history ,  | but the power to recognize new States does not belong exclusively to the President . Congress may do the same thing in another way , as in the case of Cuba in 1898 . The power to receive ambassadors has been interpreted to include consuls , although they are not diplomatic officers . No consul is allowed to exercise the functions of his office until he has received an exequatur from the President . 5 . Interpretation of the laws . Inasmuch as he is to execute the laws , the President must be their first interpreter . And his interpretation is the law of the land until it is altered by statute or by judicial decision . This is what is known as a coordinate government , but there can be no doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ binding upon all alike ; yet some of our executives have held that their right to interpret the Constitution and laws was equal , if not superior , to that of the judiciary . Such was the contention of Jefferson in regard to his right to withhold a commission already made out , to mention only one case , and of Jackson in the trouble of the Cherokee Indians with the state of Georgia . There can be no doubt that Jackson 's view of the situation was the sensible one , but neither is there any doubt that he was legally bound to execute the decree of the Court . A somewhat remarkable use of this power has recently been made which practically amounts to legislation . April 13 , 1904 , order No. 78 went into effect , construing the service pension act of June 27 , 1890 . This act provides pensions for soldiers who have become incapacitated for manual labor for any cause whatsoever . Order No. 78 decrees that " if the contrary does not appear , . . . when a claimant has passed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to perform manual labor and is entitled to be rated at six dollars a month , " and so on to seventy years , when he is to have twelve dollars . Just what is meant by " if the contrary does not appear " is not quite clear , for the instructions accompanying the order say that " a declaration that a claimant is sixty-two . . . is a sufficient allegation , even if no other disabling cause is set forth . " The effect of the order appears to have been the conversion of the act of 1890 into a  | service pension law , regardless of the physical condition of the claimant . An executive may be fully convinced of the unconstitutionality of a measure , but his prerogative of primary interpretation does not justify him in refusing to execute it . Indeed , his right of construction can not be said to extend beyond the meaning of the act . By the execution of a doubtful law he subjects his subordinates to liability to action for trespass , if the act should be declared void by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty of the legislature to protect them . Should he refuse to execute it , he would in turn be liable to impeachment , should the law be upheld by the courts . The writer knows of no deliberate violation of a statute to test its constitutionality . The conduct of President Johnson in regard to the Tenure of Office Act can be explained in another way . His arguments against some of the reconstruction acts are unanswerable , but when they were passed over his veto he endeavored to execute them . 6 . Legitimation of State governments . Upon the application of the legislature , or of the executive when the legislature is not is session , it is the duty of the President to protect a State from domestic violence . It has happened several tines that troubles have arisen over the disputes of rival parties claiming to be the legitimate government . In such cases the President must decide which one is legitimate and give it his protection . Here , however , his prerogative is not exclusive , for the Congress may reverse his decision by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the government of his adoption . Well known , not to say notorious , examples of such interposition in State affairs may be found in the history of reconstruction , as well as in the Dorr Rebellion in Rhode Island . 7 . The infliction of punishment . The framers of the Constitution certainly never contemplated the exercise of this power in any way except through the regular channels of justice . Even in waging war wholesale punitive measures are now forbidden by the laws of war , yet a postoffice was recently discontinued at Indianola , Mississippi , to punish a whole community where individuals had made it impossible for the President 's appointee to continue in office . The withholding of official news from offending papers was a somewhat similar , though far less serious , exercise of the same power .  | A. General Powers . 1 . The disposition of the army and militia . The right to colnmand the army , which Congress alone can create , is a constitutional power . The President is also commander of the militia when called into the service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say when the call shall be made , * unless Congress shalll preempt the field . The call is always issued to the governors . Twice in our history , in the second war with England and in the Civil War , several governors defied the calf Some writers hold that they thereby subjected themselves to court-martial for disobedience , but what penalty could be inflicted ? Certainly no such tribunal would try to depose a governor , and there is no other way to deprive him of the right to command the militia until , by some means , it is brought into the service of the United States . The right to dispose of the forces naturally grows out of the right to command , and this power is equally valid in times of war and peace , in foreign and domestic territory . This means that the executive can send them anywhere he sees fit . It would he a case of invasion , if the President should order troops into any State to interfere with its legitimate government , or perhaps even to quell an insurrection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been made by the legislature or the governor , unless the insurrection was , at the same time , impeding the execution of federal laws But when there is such hindrance , then the troops are as much at home there as anywhere . It is on this ground that the sending of troops into Illinois and Oregon by President Cleveland in 1894 , over the protests of Governors Altgeld and Pennoyer , is to be justified . Congress once sought to encroach upon the right of the executive to command and dispose of the army by passing an act locating the headquarters of the general at Washington and providing that all orders and instructions should be issued through him or the next in command ; that the general could not be removed , suspended , or assigned to duty elsewhere , except at *Martin vs . Mott , 12 Wheaton , 19. fSchouler , ibid. , II. , 396.  | his own request , without the previous consent of the Senate . It is surprising now that an act so clearly in contravention of the Constitution could have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day . 2 . To make rules for military forces . In Great Britain this is a prerogative of the Crown , so far as it has not been encroached upon by Parliament . Our Constitution provides that Congress shall have power " to make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces . " The natural interpretation would be that this grant was exclusive , but such has not been the practice . When necessity seemed to require it the executive has supplemented the work of legislation . A noted case of such supplementary legislation may be found in the order issued by General Scott , in the course of the Mexican War , forbidding certain acts and providing for military commissions to try offenders . In 1863 elaborate " Instructions for the Government of the Armies of the United States in the Field " were prepared by Professor Francis Lieber and issued by order of the President. * They were reissued in the course of the late war with Spain . The power to command and dispose of the forces does not include the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proclamation by President Lincoln in 1861 , but he never defended the act as legal , pleading only necessity as a justification . The act was subsequently " legalized " by Congress . B. On Hostile Foreign Territory . It is hardly too much to say that the power of our executive in conquered territory may be summed up by saying that he displaces the sovereignty and assumes all the powers belonging to it . In the government of such territory , then , he can do anything not forbidden by international law , until Congress sees fit fit to intervene . It is doubtful , however , if they , through the power to make rules and regulations for the army , can make any rules that would seriouslyinterefere with his freedom . In practice he has always been left untrammeled . It will be necessary to specify only a few things . 1 . The management of foreign relations . By the laws of war foreign relations are entirely changed . Even treaties are suspended in their operation . The President may forbid all inter- course between the occupied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he may open it to the commerce of the world upon such terms as he may see fit . Both in the Mexican and SpanishAmerican wars elaborate commercial regulations were put in force by the executive . This power has been exercised over territory with which we were nominally at peace . On several occasions different parts of Florida were seized and held for awhile , though at first this was done under cover of a secret act of Congress ( January 11 , 1811 ) . Fernandina was seized in 1817 and held until title was acquired by treaty in 1821 . In I817-18 General Jackson captured Pensacola , appointed a military governor , and put our customs laws in force . The place was thus held for nearly a year . " 2 . Reorganization and control of the local government . The President , through his military officials , may change the personnel of the existing government , and even change its character and modify its laws so far as military necessity may dictate . At the outbreak of the Mexican War elaborate instructions were prepared for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the conquered territory . General S. W. Kearny , who conquered New Mexico , appears not to have understood the extent of his powers . He at once declared the inhabitants citizens of the United States , set up a " civil " government , and ordered an election for a delegate to Congress . Commodore Stockton pursued a similar course in California . Their acts were approved by the executive , except such as purported to confer political rights . In some cases the native officials were retained when they would take the oath of allegiance to the United States . Several trials were instituted for treason on account of violations of this oath , but they were not approved of by the President . Such an oath never should have been imposed , for it is hardly allowable to exact anything more than an oath to obey the orders of the military commander . In the management of such governments our executives have not always been careful to observe the limitations imposed by international law . Both in the Mexican and Spanish-American  | wars changes were made in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military necessity . Another act open to criticism was the infliction of punishment upon a whole community for crimes committed by a few individuals . Such acts were at least questionable at the time , and they are now forbidden by the laws of war . Land grants were declared illegal by our own courts , as the conqueror can not dispose of the immovable property of the vanquished . The setting up of an admiralty court , with jurisdiction in prize cases , was declared by the Supreme Court to be an infringement upon the right of Congress to establish courts and confer jurisdiction . The continuance of the military government in Cuba after the conclusion of peace was a unique exercise of the prerogative . The avowed object of the war was to expel Spain from Cuba , but it was also the desire of this country to see a stable government set up there . For the accomplishment of this end the continuance of the military government was deemed necessary for some time . This case is a little peculiar . The United States refused to accept the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powers of sovereignty until the Cuban government was organized under his direction . The sovereignty has now passed out of his hands , but its present location is at least a debatable question . Since our Congress forbade the government of Cuba to do certain things without their consent , the sovereignty would seem to rest with them instead of the people of Cuba . C. On Domestic Territory . 1 . Defensive war . The right to defend the country both against foreigners and rebels is naturally implied from the oath and prescribed duties of the executive . But to wage a foreign war is one thing ; to prosecute a civil war under the forms of constitutional government is something very different . In the former case the exercise of unusual powers is likely to pass unquestioned when directed against aliens ; in the latter it is directed against citizens who have become hostile , or citizens whose loyalty has become doubtful , or finally against loyal citizens whom it maybe necessary to restrain from certain acts for military reasons . In all three of these cases there may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the laws of the land ; in the last two certainly this is true . This difference was strikingly brought out at the very outbreak of the Civil War by Mr. Lincoln 's proclamation of a blockade of the Southern ports , thereby changing the foreign relations of a part of the country . The hair-splitting arguments advanced by some natives and foreigners denying the right of the executive to blockade ports open to the world under the laws of the land hardly deserve any notice here . Of more force was the dissenting opinion of four members of the Supreme Court who held that the relation of citizens to their government could not be changed from that of peace to war , which was done by the blockade , except by the war-making power . The majority , however , held that Congress was not empowered to declare war against any State of the Union , but that the courts were bound to recognize the existence of war as a fact . The President , who was charged with the execution of the laws , must be the judge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was subsequently " legalized " by act of Congress . That body also authorized the executive to forbid trade with the States in insurrection , except under license . The right to do this really belonged to the commander-in-chief , without any special authorization , but in the case of a domestic war it was well enough to have some rules prescribed by the legislative body , as they would be more readily acquiesced in.
