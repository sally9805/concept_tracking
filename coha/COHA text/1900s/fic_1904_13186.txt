The SCENE passes within a low hut , Saxon-built . At back , a small window-space ; centre , a doorway , past which the seabirds fly in a gray light . Against the right wal. , a seat and a shelf with one or two great books , a half-loaf of bread , and a lamp without a light . Near by , a large unlighted lanthorn . On the left wall , a rude wooden cross ; below it , a bench with a slab of stone upon it , covered over , mallet , chisel and other tools . Also to the left , a low door , now shut , leading to an inner cell . Twilight of a bleak day . Enter Brun the fisher-boy , doubtfully . He looks from bench to books , and shakes his head . There appears on the threshold behind him the figure of a woman , Edburga , in a long cloak . Brun , when he turns , waves her back with a gesture of warning entreaty . BRUN No more , but wings and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , for all the night be wild . The wind cries out ;  --  there will be broken wings , And they do vex him , ever . Nay , forbear ! Edburga stands in the doorway Gudewife , forbear ! Ye may not step within . He is not here , although the door stood wide ; See you , the holy Cerdic is not here . EDBURGA Where , then ? p. 3 BRUN God wot ! ' Twill be a mickle hap That holds him fast ; and no light litten yet . The light is wanting .  --  Do not come within ; Bide yonder . EDBURGA Wherefore ? Wit ye who am I ? He shakes his head . She draws aside veil and wimple , discovering a young face and long braids of red-gold hair ; then she steps in arrogantly , to his dumb distress . While he replies in abashed singsong to her questions , she looks about her with something between scorn and curiosity . Deem ye the holy Cerdic hides away ? Or that I come for naught ?  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wulfstan .... EDBURGA And what dost thou here ? BRUN Ye bade me lead you hither from the shore , See you ;  --  therefore I came . Often I come , Likewise to bring the holy Cerdic bread , And tidings from the Abbey .... Ye can hear Our bell , save when the wind will be too high , At vesper-time and curfew .  --  He would fast , Ye wit , till he were like the lanthorn yonder , As ye could see a light through , if let be ! Then I row hither , or across the bar I come here at low water , and bring bread . And if I did not , sure the Angel would . p. 4 EDBURGA Sooth ! BRUN All folk say . Once I lay by to watch , Till nigh I heard it coming . For I dread Some day the Angel seize me by the hair ! Lady , ye wit no woman can be here , In holy Cerdic 's cell . EDBURGA Was this thy dread ?  --  And dare no townsfolk come ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nigher than the door ! But ye have come within . Pray now , go forth ! EDBURGA ( stealthily ) And I , worn weary , I must forth again Into the wet , for that I am a Woman ? BRUN Needs must ye take it ill to be a woman . But see , there is a tree to shelter by , A dark tree yonder , hard upon the dune .  --  Forsooth , all womankind he should mislike ; And beyond that , men say it was a woman Drove Cerdic from the King . EDBURGA Men say ? ... What men ? BRUN Sooth , did ye never hear ? p. 5 EDBURGA What do men say ? BRUN It was for chiding the King 's light-o ' - love ,  --  I wot not who , no more than ye ;  --  EDBURGA Her name Is called Edburga . BRUN Ay , an evil woman ! She was it , brought mislike upon the King , And Cerdic bade him leave her .  --  And the King Would not ; but still she wasteth all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hath no mind to wed . And he was wroth ; and , likewise for her sake , He drove the holy Cerdic from the town .  --  But Cerdic found our island . And they tell , His faring here must bring a blessing down . EDBURGA Ay , hath it fallen yet ? Methought the isle Looked bare enough , and starven ! BRUN Nay , not yet . But likewise there are curses in the court ; And men cry out on lfric.  --  Wit ye well , Their longing is for Cerdic home again . EDBURGA And Cerdic , will he hence ? When the King comes , With shining gifts ! Between her teeth p. 6 BRUN If he put her away , It may be ... See you , Cerdic is so holy , They tell he will not look upon a woman When he must speak with them . But I 'm a man : I talk with him , and look . And so I too Would not have spoke with ye , but that ye came To ask the way  --  EDBURGA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would see and speak with Cerdic . Ye deem he cometh hither soon ? BRUN God wot ! He hath a Book here that he reads upon ; Likewise he knoweth how to grave on stone , With pictures like to frost . But oftentimes All day he standeth on the rocks , adream , So stark the sea-birds have no fear of him , But graze his face in flying . So , belike , It is a Vision that doth keep him now ; For still the light is ever lit , by now . He will be coming .... Ye must bide beyond . EDBURGA Go thou . And I will follow to thy tree , There to sit down ... and pray ... till I behold Thy holy Cerdic coming . Have no fear ! See : I will wrap my mantle round my hair , As holy men would have us do . Such peril ,  --  And dear enchantment , in a woman 's hair ! So : ' t is my will to stand thus in the wind , Now , while the sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have his own ; or Cerdic  --  p. 7 BRUN Woe ! The Fiend !  --  EDBURGA That dwells in Woman : thou hast said . BRUN Woe that I brought ye here to Cerdic 's cell ! EDBURGA ( undoing a scarf from her neck ) Nay , thou wilt never rue it . Take this scarf So , knotted thrice ,  --  unto the farthest rock , Where thou shalt bind it to that only bush ,  --  The thorn thou shewedst me ; and so let hang That the sea-winds may sift and winnow it . This if thou do  --  and look not back again ,  --  And say thy prayer , likewise , for holy Cerdic , There shall no hurt come nigh thee from the Fiend . But I must bide by yonder starven pine , Till Cerdic pass , ... to shrive me . BRUN ( terrified ) Ay , go hence ! There doth he bless the sick . EDBURGA I follow thee . And may the saints forgive it to this  --  saint , There stepped upon his threshold one poor woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thee . p. 8 BRUN Nay , do not ! Sooth , I will as ye have said . EDBURGA Never look back ! BRUN ( terrified ) By holy Guthlac , never !  --  When ye are shriven ... take the self-same way Back to the shore .... Running out God shield the holy Cerdic ! EDBURGA ( alone , stretching out her arms with savage relief ) God crush the holy Cerdic , with His shield ! She looks about her , between curiosity and aversion ; then begins to sing with exuberant defiance of the place . If the moon were mine For a silver cup . Ah , but I would fill it up With red wine , red wine ! Then , O love of mine .... She stops singing as she comes to the bench with the covered stone , and draws near to look , as if it fascinated and repelled her ; then she turns away , silent . From the doorway , she seems to listen ; then calls through her hands in a soft , high voice , like the wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blows shut after her . Deep twilight falls . There is a pause , filled with the crying of wind and of seagulls . Then the low door in the left wall opens , and Cerdic gropes his way in , carrying a taper . He is a young monk with the keen face of a mystic , worn white with fatigue . He seems half tranced. p. 9 CERDIC The darkness here .... Need be , I fell asleep . Sleep , sleep for me , and in the daytime !  --  Ah , The little sleep ! Could I not watch one hour ? Yea , Lord , for all the hours of day and night ; Save that in sleep , the wings stoop near to me I grasp for vainly , waking .... Was it sleep ? Or were they here , the voices and the wings ?  --  Not yours , beloved birds ! Not yours that beat Gray through the wind and wet , in search of me . Lady of Heaven ! Forgive me that I slept , Forgetful of thy birds , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He goes to the shelf , and taking the loaf down , breaks and scatters it from the doorway , afterwards closing the door . Take all ,  --  take all ! For I have slept ; and I am filled indeed , With manna and with light . Yet , O thou Blessd ! If my poor prayer and longing may avail , Like hands of need , dragging thy garment 's hem , Vouchsafe to me , here in my wilderness , One sign to ease the hunger of my heart , That calls and echoes , prays and hears the prayer , Echoed and ebbing , till it surge again ; High tide ,  --  low tide ,  --  but never any word . High tide ,  --  low tide ; never a face to see ! He comes down to the bench . From his taper he lights the lanthorn , and sets it by ; then reverently he lifts the covering-cloth from the stone , to look upon his work . Our Lady of all Comfort . Rose of Heaven ! Could I but make her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Face ,  --  the stone should put forth might Unto blind eyes , and they would look , and see ! Ah , when ?  --  Poor scribbled track , so e pitiful , Of wingless longing ! Here the Face should be ; With this gray blankness where the eyes would shine , More lovely blue than ever twilight sea . And here would be her hair ;  --  a golden wave Of sunset , ebbing redly in the west ... Her hair .... But never can I make her hands , Like to those palest roses that did grow Close to the Abbey wall .... Ah , could I know , Even in a dream ! Since unto lowlier men Than blessd Luke , she hath vouchsafed to see Her very face . Comfort this halting tool ,  --  Quicken this stone ! Let not the earth go dark Of such a likeness for men 's hearts to keep , Beautiful , on the altar of that temple Whose walls be blazoned with the shapes of earth ,  --  Scribbled and scarred with basest names and things , Foul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some voice in my soul , more ware than I , Thrust me awake , crying , lfric  --  the King ! And I awoke , and heard no more .  --  Lifting his face with shut eyes . Let be ! There shall no hurt come near my dream of thee ; But I will count a thousand dawning suns , Patient , so be that on some dawn of day , Thou lean from out of heaven , and I may see Thy face like dawn above thy Star-in-the-East , Mother of all the motherless ,  --  God 's Mother ! And still , though I should count the thousand years , Still shall my heart be ready . The wind shakes the door ; and the gulls go by .  --  Ah , the wings ! Ever thy birds , the while I hark for thee . Never thy word , but only call of birds , And waves and wind , and evermore the wings Of sea-gulls that I hear with quickened heart Of hope : because they knock upon my door , Knocking and mocking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , beside thy flock of stars , Who broodest over this mid-world as though It were an ailing lamb , I wait for thee . I harken , and my heart is at the gate ... My soul doth wait , as a poor vacant chamber , With the door wide like famine , but for thee ; Ay , and the torches waiting for a fire White from the stars ,  --  not breathing , save for thee . O Moon of Pity , if this loneliness , And the sore heart of man that knows but how To seek a home , can ever draw thee down , Lean from thy glory with thy mother-looks ; Lean down to bless ,  --  follow thy pity , down ,  --  Down to this solitude . Let me once look On Thee ! A knocking on the door . Cerdic looks up with fixed eyes . The door swings open , and Edburga stands on the threshold , her veil shadowing her face , the two long golden braids hanging below , upon her breast .  --  She steps in , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a voice without emotion of any kind . p. 10 EDBURGA Knowest thou me ? Cerdic , as in a trance , crosses his arms on his breast . His face grows radiant with beatitude . Without giving sign of her bewilderment , Edburga comes forward slowly , facing him . Then she loosens the veil from her head and the cloak from her shoulders . They fall about her feet ; she stands richly arrayed . Cerdic sinks upon his knees . Behold me . ... Thou art Cerdic . CERDIC ( in a far-off voice ) Lady , thou knowest . EDBURGA Yea , thou hast well said . I know thee what thou art . Thou dost not know What I am.  --  Dost thou dream ? CERDIC It well may be ... I dream . EDBURGA Wake then . For thou shouldst know me , Cerdic . He does not move . She regards him with a closer curiosity . Make me some firelight here . For I am cold . CERDIC Lady , have pity that my heart is shamed And my poor home is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had no thought  --  of this . p. 11 EDBURGA Wake , Cerdic . ' T is no dream . Albeit thine eyes Never looked yet on mine . Guess , who am I ? Thy lips have used my name . Why art thou dumb But now ? He answers in a joyful prayer . CERDIC Thy grace must needs unseal this mouth . Thou knowest.  --  Give me leave to tell of thee , In words like golden harp-strings ; but to tell How all the air is summer with thy coming , And morn doth flush the furrows of the sea ! Yea , how thy voice hath fallen , like white manna , To fill the craving hunger of the soul That longed for God and thee . She recoils with sudden contemptuous laughter . EDBURGA Nay , for us twain ! This , then , is Holy Cerdic , who would look Upon no woman ! ... Thou , who wouldst have us Forswear all earth , for heaven somewhere outside , Tell me , O wise one , of this precious rede : How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cerdic , stricken aghast , reaches towards the fallen mantle and touches it in horror , to make sure . As his vision breaks , he rises and stands back , striving to master his anguish . Dreaming , good sooth ! You touch it , to make sure , Dreamer of far-off women ? But this dream Is a true dream ; as I am very Woman . Nor shalt thou bid me go till I have said . So mild thou wert , before I made me known ! p. 12 CERDIC ( gravely ) Known , maiden ? She regards him keenly ; then goes to the door , shuts it , and turns towards him , with triumph growing in her looks . EDBURGA Nay , then !  --  I will tell thee more . How shouldst thou know me ? I am the first woman , Haply , thine eyes have met ; and so , like Eve , Older and wiser than thou !  --  I come to tell , First , of the few , far things thou dost not know ; Then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then ... what a pitiful King 's Counsellor Thou wert ,  --  too craven to behold a woman ! CERDIC No longer give I counsel , well or ill , Unto the King . Another counsellor He hath preferred before me ; for whose sake I am an exile , and this place my home . EDBURGA Haply it was Edburga ? CERDIC Even she ,  --  The King 's Edburga . If I have been craven , Speak out thy hurt . For I will hear , and learn . He lights the lamp also , from the lanthorn ; then stands with his arms folded , looking at her calmly . She begins with a cold irony that grows passionate . p. 13 EDBURGA Ay , learn .  --  If that Edburga drave thee here , Bethink thee , that Edburga was a woman . Learn that there was some strength around her then , Stronger than thou , to drive thee from his heart  --  lfric the King 's  --  and from the city gate ! The woman 's strength , the one might that is Woman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , What is it that ye flee from and ye fear ? Dreading this ... softness , once it be unchained ! Con thy blank heart . For I will write in it The runes that might unriddle thee the world ; And thou shalt ponder them , one little hour , Looking upon me . Nay , I do not come , Save but in hatred . Thou art safe from all Thy heart can fear , and long for  --  and despise ! I hate thee ; and I tell thee ; and I come To speak thee sooth , and at my going hence To leave full goodly token that I hate . But thou , look back and be the wiser ,  --  thou ! When I did enter , ere we came to speech , What was it bowed thy knees before me here Against thy will ? Thou'rt dumb . Why then , poor clod , What , but this weird which thou couldst never face ? This little **30;504;TOOLONG ! What save one Woman ? And that one , to thee , The basest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CERDIC Ah , my God ! No , no.  --  EDBURGA The King 's  --  The King 's Edburga ! CERDIC ( apart ) Ah , forgive  --  forgive ... EDBURGA Prayest me now forgiveness ? CERDIC ( sternly ) Nay , not thee ! Not thee . EDBURGA Then haply heaven : that thou wert moved By this poor beauty that I wear upon me ? Waste not thy prayer . The peril that I bring Is nothing strange ; ' t is old and grim and free . Have I not said , I come to tell thee of it ? And what I am that reckon with thee ? CERDIC Speak . EDBURGA I am Edburga , and the daughter of Ulf . My mother was a slave . For she was sold , And given in her youth unto Svanfleda , Sister of Ulf ,  --  a just and holy woman ; Who bought and set her free , for Ulf to wed ,  --  And had it written in the gospel-book ,  --  When that his heart clave to her . That , O monk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was grown , When Ulf came to be made an ealdorman . And Bertric would have taken me to wife , Save that I came before the eyes of lfric The King ; and so ...  --  What are you , men and monks , That you may give us unto such an one To bind your lands together ? Or to bring The sum of twenty spears or more , to follow You , at the man-hunt ? Women bring you forth , As Darkness cherishes the doomful light Of the Sun , that being grown , shakes his bright locks And puts all to the sword ! I 'll not be given To Bertric , would that Bertric have me now :  --  I , a free-woman , and gladlier free , That being yet unborn , I was a slave ! I am a creature rooted in the dark , But born to sunlight and the noble air . I will to give ; and I will not be given . I fear not right nor left , nor east , nor west ; Nor thee ! For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep . And I am all I have . And I am lfric 's ,  --  for a kingly gift . A bugle sounds distantly . Neither hears as they face each other fiercely . I reck no more . But thou , thou shadow-thing , Unwitting what or men or shadows be , And hearing of my name and how time sped , And fearing for the council and the peace , Thou wouldst have hurled my one gift of myself Into the dust ; and called all men to see , And curse and stone me hence : and if thou couldst !  --  As there were no degrees ' twixt mire and me . O thou wise Cerdic , hear the end of this . For thy King 's Peace , thou hast so ploughed the state , And turned the people 's heart against their King , That now they clamor for their holy man ! Like rain and snow , two names make dim the air With Cerdic and Edburga ! p. 15 CERDIC I knew not this . EDBURGA Quoth he ! Thou hast it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wilt not come again , to rule ! ... Thou piece of craft , I know thee . Dost thou think Cerdic shall win ? Or , haply , base Edburga ? The King is here , without ... and nigh at hand , Coming with torches . Lifts her hand to listen . ... Ay ! CERDIC ( dazed ) The King is come . ... EDBURGA Yea , so .  --  Tho ' thou be traitor , he 's a King ; And thou hast been a one-time counsellor . He comes to say farewell ... And I am first , To shew thee something of this world , before Thou tak'st thy leave for that far other world Thou knowst so well ;  --  and liker home for thee , Than this warm Earth so full of seas and sun ,  --  Too golden  --  like my hair ! ... The tide is in . It was low water when I walked across ; But I did seal my name upon the shore ! CERDIC lfric is come ... p. 16 EDBURGA I have said .  --  And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lfric is a king , Though he be young . EDBURGA But ,  --  Cerdic or Edburga ! CERDIC Not thus for lfric ! He bore love to me . EDBURGA Ay , long ago . ... For any of the earls He would not so have done . It was for me . Save thyself , Holy Cerdic !  --  She points to the door with ironic invitation . Cerdic turns towards the bench , and grasping his mallet , looks on the carven stone , lifting the cloth from it . She sees with amusement . Let us see How monks may fight ! ... He covers the stone and faces her with sudden indignation , still grasping his mallet . Stout tools they look : and thou hast need of them . If thou wilt cling to such a meagre life , Who scants a moment ? Surely not the King ! Yet dost thou look not now , as when I came , Kneeling adaze before me ! And belike I seemed not thus to thee .  --  What I did seem , I wonder yet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet .  --  The Abbey bell sounds faintly far off . It is followed by confused sounds of approach . p. 17 CERDIC Hear , then ! Thou sayst truth :  --  How much of truth I may have time to tell thee , Thou bitter truth , Edburga ! When I kneeled , Not knowing ,  --  for my heart was worn with dreams , Mine eyes were worn with watching ,  --  I had prayed Only to hear one knock upon the door ; Only to see one Vision , that I strove To carve there on the stone . . . . There came a knock , There stood one . . . at the door .  --  And I looked up , And saw in thee what I had prayed to see ;  --  And knew not what I saw , believing thee  --  God rede to me this day in Paradise The meaning of that mock !  --  believing thee The Vision . . . of all pity and all grace , The Blessd One , the Mother of Our Lord !  --  EDBURGA Out ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with anguish ) The Blessd One !  --  Believing thee . . . the Mother of Our Lord ! . . . Edburga gives a strange cry and falls huddled against the door , with her veil gathered over her face , as Cerdic breaks the stone into fragments .  --  There is a bugle-blast without , and the sound of voices and steel ; then a blow upon the door . Cerdic hurls away the mallet . Could spears bite out this broken heart of a fool , And tear it from me !  --  Bid them in. p. 18 VOICE ( without ) Come forth ! Enter lfric alone . The open door shows the torches outside . Cerdic faces him , sternly motionless . Edburga is crouched by the doorway , her face covered . The King looks from one to other in amazement . AELFRIC THE KING Where was thy signal ? Twice I sounded horn . To Cerdic I bade thee forth . Why cam'st thou not ? Is Cerdic afraid to die ?  --  . . . What makes Edburga here ? Thou wert to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thou cowering in thy veil ? When have I seen This thing ?  --  Speak !  --  EDBURGA ( faintly ) lfric . . . AELFRIC THE KING Up ! Rise up and speak . Come forth , out of thy veil ! EDBURGA I can not . . . AELFRIC THE KING Come .  --  . . . Look up .  --  EDBURGA Let be . . . . Ah , ah ! . . . p. 19 AELFRIC THE KING ( fiercely ) Out . . . from thy veil ! Still she shrinks , covered . He turns on Cerdic , drawing his sword with a cry . Thou diest !  --  Edburga flings herself against him and clasps his knees , reaching up towards his arm . EDBURGA No , lfric , no . But give me time !  --  Not yet . Let be . . . I do not know . . . I do not know . . . I can not tell thee why . . . AELFRIC THE KING Thou wilt not speak ? EDBURGA Yea , soon . . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gasping whisper . . . . Put up thy sword . AELFRIC THE KING Thou plead for him ? Am I become thy fool ? For he it was so called me , on a time !  --  Speak .  --  Hath one hour stricken thy mind from thee ? Art thou Edburga ? And am I the King ? What was the spell ?  --  For whom was ambush set ? Gods !  --  I would make all sure , but I am loath To shame the King I was , before my thanes . He pushes the door shut and stands against it , holding his sword drawn . Answer , Edburga.  --  Was't for me or thee , I took this errand on me ? Thou hast said One of you twain must live , the other die .  --  To death with him . p. 20 EDBURGA It shall dishonor thee . AELFRIC THE KING Bid in the hands to do it . For that cause Thou wouldst have had them hither . Let them be Dishonored ! So :  --  was it not all thy deed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But thou , undo my deed , And cast it from thee .  --  He hath spoken true . . .

Yea , I hate Cerdic . . . and I hate myself . . . I bade thee do it , and I pray thee now , Hear me again , and do it not ! AELFRIC THE KING ( as she clings to him again ) Edburga ! EDBURGA All I have asked of thee ,  --  unto this hour , Put it away from thee and me , . . . away ! AELFRIC THE KING Edburga ! She stands up , with a cry EDBURGA Doubt me not . Thou dost believe ! I loved thee , and I love thee , and . . . I love thee .  --  I loved thee that thou wert the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Be not . . . less . The people love thee yet .  --  Ah , but they shall ! I did not know . . . but now . . . Wistfully Thou wilt believe ? Undo me from thy neck . Cast me away . I love thee , and I know thou didst love me . Cast me away !  --  Cerdic stretches his arms out to them , suddenly illumined with great joy . p. 21 CERDIC O , woman !  --  child . . . . God 's child . They turn to him , perplexed , Edburga sobbing at the feet of lfric . Wilt thou forgive ? EDBURGA ( doubting ) Forgive thee , Cerdic ? . . . Ah ! . . . CERDIC Then hear me ; and forgive when I have done . I took thee for a bitter mockery Of my fair dream . Thou wert to me one sent To bow my pride , who deemed my prayer could win The blessd Vision . . . So I let break the image that I strove To make of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . and my heart was sore abased.  --  Blest be that shame and sharpness !

CERDIC Even to her ; Yea , and to Him who did so love the world :  --  Love , the one Likeness . . . . AELFRIC THE KING ( after a silence ) Cerdic , thou shamest me . He puts up his sword . Edburga hides her face against his knees . p. 22 CERDIC Lift up her head , and set her by thy side . . . . Wed her . Whom thou hast humbled , lift her up . The gift that thou hast taken , hold it high . AELFRIC THE KING Come with us , Cerdic . Be at our right hand . CERDIC Not yet . For I have lived within a dream Too long . . . . Not yet know I enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go , Edburga leaves the King 's arms irresolutely . She draws near the bench and gathers up the fragments of the broken stone to lay them together with a half-fearful touch , not looking at Cerdic . Exeunt Edburga and the King . Cerdic follows them to the threshold , looking out , his hands held after them in farewell . There is a sharp command . The torches go , and the footsteps on the pebbles . A gust of wind blows suddenly ; and Cerdic reenters with a hurt sea-gull . There is the faint sound of the Abbey bell once . Cerdic comes slowly down towards the bench and the stone fragments , his face set , and the sea-gull held close to his breast . Ah , Thou !  --  Have pity on all broken wings .
