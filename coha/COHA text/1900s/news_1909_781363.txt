txt deleted 10 paragraphs An ordinary board box of probably about two cubic feet capacity , " he explained . " Inside the box I put my Instruments , every one of w high was in its waterproof case . Along wit htliecases of instruments 1 placed the datawhich I wanted Whitney to kep for me . " ' " Did you tell ' Whitney not to inform Commander Peary that you had given him your proofs ? " " 1 asked Mr. Whitney to tell Mr. Peary nothing of my discovery of the north pole . I suppose he understood that he was not to mention anything of the data or instruments being in the box I gave him . and I do n't ' believe he did . " " Did you tell Whitney that the proofs of . your discovery of the pole went iv that box ? " " I believe I did , " replied Dr. Cook .. Bears Eskimo Has Data . " Was the box nailed ? " " It was . I nailed it up myself . Whitney Ras informed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instruments and the data I left with'him out of the box and placed them in his trunk on the Roosevelt . It was after that that Mr. Peary ordered him to take them ashore and leave them . So Whitney , I am informed , placed them in another box and Put them in charge of an Eskimceat Etah . I feel that they are safe where they are , and that when I send for them they will be waiting for me . " The ' Eskimo who was left in charge of them is one who can be trusted , because he is one of the tribe that went with me on my trip . I do n't believe they are lost , or that there will be any trouble in getting them . The only difficulty now is that it is the worst time of the year to send for them . You see the long arctic night is beginning there . It would be impracticable to try to get to Etah now . It would I e impossible to get beyond Upernavik . " " Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked . " Well , I would like to get them ; " replied Dr. Cook , " but there Is no danger of Toeing them , as I have said  --  at lees I do n't think so . " ? Needed for the Scientists . " Suppose you were not able to produce them along with the proofs which are to go to the University of Denmark : do you consider that the scientists might throw out your proofs ? " " That is for them alone to say . " " It is customary for the instruments with which observations have been made to be submitted with the results of the observations , is it not ? " . " Yes , I believe it is , " said Dr. Cook . " To be perfectly frank , it is most desirable to have the instrumental corrections . " " Your trip toward the pole might be of no avail , then , if you fail lo get your instruments ? " " Again I must say that that would be for the scientists to determine . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made ty Whitney ; that you will be able to prove to the University of Denmark that you reached the north nult " can only say that they are to get the proofs that I have brought back . and , if I can get them , the instruments . It may be considerably longer than I had hoped belore I can send my proofs , however . as I want to make the effort to obtain the inetrunients . The data I have with me is intact . Dr. Cook was asked if he cared to Corn'sent upon Whitney 's reported statement that tile two Eskimos the explorer had with him were young and inexperienced in polar travel . His Eskimos Were Toaths ; " Did Whitney say that ? " returned Dr. Cook , in evident prise . " Well , if he did say it , which I doubt . the fact remains that the Eskimos were thoroughly qualified to make the trip , which was evidenced by their sticking to it until the pole was reached . They will be here within a year er so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eskimos are 20 years old , and tough enough to go another trip to the pole , if they want to . " Dr. Cook was asked what he thought of Whitileyee reported remark . that he would have a ' . hard time proving the discovery of the pole , as he had only the word of the two Eskimos to rely - upon . " If Whitney said it , " replied Dr. Cook , " I can say that the word of the Eskimos will not be necessary , as tile proofs will speak for themselves . However , I have no rear teat the Eskimos will give any false report . They have been quoted as saying that they went only two marches bey end land . They could n't have said it , and no one can make me believe they did . " A reporter asked Dr. Cook if he wished the scientists to accept his proofs on faith . He smiled , and replied : " Not on faith , but on the proofs . " Dr. Cook was asked again if he would submit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declared that nothing could induce him to alter his resolve to send them to Denmark .
