txt A Call for German Opera . Will you , in your valuable paper , put in a plea for the lovers of German opera before the now rapidly approaching end of the present season at the Metropolitan ? During these past seventeen weeks we have had at the Saturday matinees but four performances of German opera in all , and the coming performance of the " Ring , " falling as it does in Holy Week , will prevent a great many from attending . For the past two weeks , and including this and the coming week , ( according to the announcement , ) we shall have had Italian opera in its most florid style . It is generally conceded that the boxholders and Directors prefer this , ( possibly because it does not seriously interfere with conversation , ) and they are doubtless the powers that be , but inasmuch as the list of subscribers for the Saturday matinees is larger than for any other day in the week , it would seem as if some attention might be given to their wishes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
