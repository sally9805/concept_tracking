txt The death of Ovington C. Benedict , a bent and shriveled man of about seventy years , at the Hudson Street Hospital yesterday afternoon , marked the passing away of one of the most eccentric of New York 's old pioneers . At one time a man of considerable wealth and a member of a prominent jewelry firm of the city , he died in want with no home but a miserable hovel at 12-1 ; 4 Hudson Street . His house is nothing better than a box built in an alley-way between two fourstory buildings . The room is about 16 feet long , not more than 3 feet in width , and only S feet from floor to ceiling . It is almost destitute of furniture , but is piled full of old boxes and papers , rusty clock works , and what appears to be the most useless of rubbish , all the accumulation of years . Entrance to it can only be gained through the rear , although there is a door and window in the front . In the rear is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high , covered by a slanting board that runs down to the ground . The death certificate issued by Coroner 's Physician J , Donlan reads " apoplexy , " but the friends of the old man assert that , in their opinion ; he died literally of starvation . He was removed from his home to the Hudson Street Hospital late in the afternoon . Within twenty-five minutes after being taken there he died , without having been able to make any statement . Later in the day his brother , Fred P. Benedict , whose home is in New Jersey , called at the hospital and told Clerk Estabrook that the body would be removed to-day and buried in the family plot on Staten Island . Ovington C. Benedict was at one time worth a large sum of money . Twenty-five years ago he , with his brother , Read Benedict , formed one of the biggest jewelry concerns in this city . They disagreed about business matters and Ovington Benedict retired from the firm . He entered into partnership with a Swiss ; and the two opened a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business was not prosperous and three years later the firm failed , Benedict losing all he had , amounting , it is said , to nearly 8150,000 . The loss of his wealth and the estrangement with his brother , Read Benedict , preyed on his mind to such an extent that he shunned his former associates , and lived much alone . The brother , Read , in partnership with another brother , Edwin P. Benedict , now compose the jewelry firm known as Benedict Brothel 's , at 171 Broadway . The one intimate friend of Benedict 's was Max Schwartz , a dealer in shoes , at 128 Hudson Street . According to the stony told by Schwartz . Benedict rented the space between the two big buildings about twelve years ago . There he fitted up a little watch and jewelry repair shop . His cunning of hand had left him , he could no longer kio the expert work he did of old , and things went from bad to worse . It was then that he made the friendship with Max Schwartz , who , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was a clerk in the shoe afore he now . owns . Schwartz would igitoss the nian 's - needs , ? and never allowed , him to want for food , though Benedict would'never accept a cent - of ... charity , so . long as he could hold out without doing so . According to Schwartz 's story , as he declared the old man had many times told him the rental of the hovel , which amounted to $12 a year , was paid by the brother , Read Benedict , and sometimes by Read Benedict 's son , Fred Benedict , Jr . Schwartz says that Benedict has told him that he sometimes received a little additional help from his brother Read . Another friend of Benedict 's was J. N. Peterson , a druggist , at 166 Franklin Street , who had known the old man for several years . It was to these two friends that Benedict made his last appeals for assistance before dying . About 2 o'clock yesterday afternoon he came out of his house , and tottering into Schwartz 's place , held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Lois , Louis , come here . I am very weak . I think I am going to die . " Schwartz helped the old man into a chair , and then sent out for some coffee and sandwiches . When they came Benedict could not eat them , ad pushed the food away untouched . Schwartz says that since last Monday he had been lying in his room , on his uncovered cot , and that he had eaten nothing in all that time except a few morsels of food he ( Schwartz ) had furnished him . Schwartz then went with him to Peterson 's drug store . Peterson seeing his condition , called an ambulance , and Benedict was taken to Hudson Street Hospital , where he died within thirty minutes . Peterson and Schwartz both begged the old man to let them telephone his brother Read , but he would not consent . When admission was sought to his ? little shop last night there appeared at the rear door an old woman , of about sixty years , with gray hair and wearing a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shawl . She refused to believe that the old man was dead , and laughed at the idea at first . She later admitted that he had been away nearly all the afternoon . After much persuasion she gave her name as Annie Green , and said she had kept house for Benedict for years .
