txt To-night 's estimate of ? the number of killed in the terrible mine explosion here yesterday is 250 , but the total death list may yet reach 300 . Relief work is still in progress , being conducted by shifts of men . The shift now in the mine has fifty bodies ready to bring out , and the number of corpses yet to be reached is still uncertain . Arriving trains are constantly bringing relatives of the victims from outside points and the coal company has designated a committee to carry the dead to Salt Lake , Ogden , and other cities . On account of gas , No. 4 mine has been abandoned as a means of rescue , and bodies are arriving at the mouth of No. 1 mine by the carload . When the removal of the bodies from the mines began hundreds of men volunteered their services for the purpose . The rescuers came from other mines and towns surrounding , and worked incessantly to bring out the burned and mangled remains of the dead miners . The bodies were taken to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the mine . and were there dressed and laid out , preparatory to the Coroner 's inquest and for identification . To-day : 201 bodies had been recovered from Mine No. 4 . It is now known that nearly 400 men entered the mines , and it is also known that most of them were killed in the powder explosion of yesterday . Nine-tenths of the men killed are Americans and Welshmen . The former come mostly from Utah . with a small number from Tennessee and Colorado . Among the dead are about twenty young boys who acted as couplers and trap boys . in the . Hunter family alone seven are missing . A large number of the dead were Married men . The financial loss to the company can not be estimated yet . but it will be great . In every way it is regarded as the worst disaster ever occurring in this part of the country . The nearesi approach to it was the Southern Pacific Almy ( Wyo. ) explosion five years ago , when over 100 men were killed . DEAD BODIES IN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party , but the magnitude of the disaster soon became apparent . All men on the raise known as " Pike 's Peak " were lying in clusters . John James , a County Commissioner , was found with his son , George , entwined in loving embrace in each other 's arms . All these men apparently had realized that death was coming , for all were found as though in attitudes of defense . Some had their cloaks about them ; others tried to protect themselves by burying their faces in the ground floor of the mine , hoping thus to escape the deadly gas that was fast enveloping them . They must have lived for some time in prayerful expectation of rescue reaching them . Bernard Dougall. a young engineer from Springville , Utah , who had just entered the mine a few minutes before with his assistants , was found with his instrument set , while he and his men lay dead around it . John Kirton was the first man brought to the surface . He was still alive , but presented a terrible sight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was almost unrecogreizable . In his horrible pain , he cried out to his companions , begging them to end his misery by taking his life . GETTING OUT THE DEAD . The scene was ghastly , yet most pathetic . Between the blackened and stalwart men lay about a dozen lads . who had been employed as couplers and trappers . Some lay alongside of their fathers and elder brothers . It was a scene that made strong men turn away in tears . After the foul air cleared away from No. 1 the work of rescue began , and it was soon found that a great many of the miners of No. 1 had been suffocated . The men of the lower levels had been warned of the explosion , and Lad made their escape before the gaseous air had reached them . The work of rescue is still proceeding . and will continue until all the bodies are brought to the surface . There are willing hands at work , and as fast as bodies are reached they are brought down to the boarding houses and other company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coroner 's inquest . These buildings are numerous , and in each are from ten to thirty-five bodies . To those which have been identified are attached tags with name and address . These await the coming of relatives or frtextcs . Many of the rescuers came near losing their lives from the fatal after-damp , but the work was continued in the face of all dangers , and most of the brave fellows remained at their posts until they were almost ready to drop from physical exhaustion and the deadly effects of the poisonous fumes . All efforts are now being concentrated to bring out a large number of bodies known to be in No. 4. where eighty-five men perished . Here the force of the explosion broke down the timbers and the bodies can only he got at through No. 1 . Two hundred coffins have been ordered through local undertakers to be sent at once to the scene of the disaster . A special train bearing the seriously wounded has started from Scofield for Salt Lake . CAUSE CP THE ACCIDENT . The cause of the accident has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ascertained ( it appears to have been one of those explosions that occur at times in even the best-regulated mines and in spite of rhe best endeavors of the most competent Su ' perintendents . State Mine Inspector Thomas is still without the data to fix the blame on any one . An inquest may determine just where it should rest . but little hope is entertained of a definite finding . The mine has been worked for over twenty years . and has the reputation , according to Mr. Thomas . of being one of the best ventilated and protected in the West . He states that he inspected it less than five weeks ago . and believed it entirely safe at that time .. It has never bad bad air , and has always been free from gas . sad , as the coal is all loaded with shovels. there has not been a large accumulation of dust . The theory of Bishop Parmalee is that some of the Finnz recently imported se- cretly took giant " DOWtter clown into themine to assist them in. their work . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stowing , and make as much money as possible , and it is thought this form of explosive was - used in order that great bodies of coal could more easily be dislodged . It is thought that when the giant powder , was ? touched off it ignited some of the dust of which every coal mine has more or less . HOW THE MEN DIED . One of the miners sent over from Castle Gate to aid the rescue work , said , when he came out of the tunnel : " This exploSiOn , i5 the most iliga9trous so far as loss of life is concerned , that has ever occurred in America . There will be 300 dead men when we are through work . - " We have had some hard experiences digging through the mine . Several times members of our party were overcome by the damp , but we got them out in time . We found the bodies of the men in every conceivable shape , but generally they were lying on their stomachs with their arms about their faces . The men died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffer . They just became unconscious and were asphyxiated . Their faces were calm and peaceful , as though they had just fallen asleep . The men in No. 1 might possibly have escaped had they started to run as soon as the explosion in No. 4 , which connected with it , occurred . Evidently they did not appreciate this fact until too late . as they put on their coats and arranged their tools before starting . They started , however , just in time to meet the damp half way . The bodies found near the entrance are badly crushed , as they got the full force of the explosion . They are few in number , however . Mine No. 1 was damaged comparatively little , but No. 4 is badly damaged . " A curious fact connected with the affair is that five men  --  Thomas Sellers . Alexander C. Wilson , John Wilson , Harry Taylor , and John Redoes  --  who were working outside of mine , were severely hurt . ACCOUNTS OF SURVIVORS . Harry Taylor , one of the injured men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he told of it , a few words at a time , between paroxysms of pain . " I was repairing some track out on the dump , " said the injured man , " when I started toward the mouth of the tunnel to get some tools . I got about fifty feet away from the tunnel mouth , when suddenly there was an awful report , and at the same time a black cloud filled with rocks bore down on me . I felt several small rocks strike me ; then I felt a jolt on my . side , and then  --  then I came away , " said the injured man , with a- ghastly attempt at smiling . " Next thing I knew I woke with a man pouring some brandy down my throat , and I saw the boys lying all around me , moaning for help . We were fixed up and put on the train . " W. C. Wilson was one of those fortunate ones on the level of No. 1 who escaped . He tells his story as follows : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distance , followed by a sort of wave that can hardly be described but that is known to all who have been in explosions , and I have been in several . I said to my partner that if gas was known to exist in the mine I should say that an explosion had occurred . I advised that we run to the tunnel , and with me came six men working in that section . ' In the main tunnel we met the driver , and asked him if he had noticed the strange occurrence . He replied that he had almost been knocked off the bar by the rush of air . I was then convinced that it was an explosion , and advised my comrades to hasten with me to the mouth . We met two others further on , and they proceeded with us . We were none too soon , for afterdamp reached us some three or four minutes before we reached " the open air , almost suffocating us. "                @ @ @ @ @
