 | THE ULTRA-VIOLET MICROSCOPE To that rude scientist in dim historic time who first acquired the knowledge of a simple lens , how strangely must have come the wizardry of magnifying-glass . Before his wondering eyes his hand was doubled , blades of grass grew great , an insect seemed a monster . And when one day a brilliant dragon-fly fluttered within the microscopic field , what startled awe must have arisen in the gazer 's soul to find upon its wings slight cords and filaments , veinings and colorings never before conceived . Yesterday our microscopic lore had reached a boundary , set fast as that which held mankind before those first experiments with light released the world until then hidden from the naked eye . The microscope of glass , with sunlit field , had come as near perfection as the hand and brain of man could reasonably achieve . To-day a single leap into the unknown dark gives new and living empires up to light , doubles the power of any microscope ever produced , revolutionizes the study of the infinitely small . A new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ microscope with quartz lenses , using light far beyond all visible light , that of the ultra-violet . Light comes to us in spherical waves which rise and fall like the restless waves of the sea . Still clinging to the old nomenclature , we speak of it as coming in rays as well as in waves . A convex lens , such as a burning glass , holds from its shape the power to take the light rays of the sun and bring them to a focus . So the camera , by use of a similar simple lens , takes the image of a summer landscape , transfers the light waves which proceed from tree or rock , and prints them on a plate covered with sensitive film . In both these cases the object is comparatively distant from the lens . Used thus , the simple lens converges light and concentrates its power . Change the distance between the object and the convex glass , bring it close , and the simple microscope results , which , like a reading glass above a printed page , diverges light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrice its size . Instead of concentration , such usage gives diversion , and the printed word beneath the lens has , to our eye , swollen , widened and lengthened . If we combine these powers , and , having placed one lens to concentrate our light , use another like it to enlarge the image given by the first , we have a compound visual microscope . This microscope possesses in its simple form two lenses only : one placed directly above the object to be magnified and taking from that cause its name , " objective ; " a second , the " eye-piece , " below the eye , which magnifies yet more the object which the first has thrown into its range . The light for such a microscope comes from the white light of the sun , or from its substitutes , the artificial lights of daily life . The rays which reach the instrument from window or from are are caught on a reflector which directs them upward , passing them through a transparent slide on which the specimen rests . This object , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its contrast with the light around . Two factors determine what a microscope can do : the light illuminating the object to be seen , the lenses , mirrors , or prisms which transmit its rays . Given the light most favorable for magnification , ? given , too , the substance which will most perfectly transmit that light , ? and the ideal microscope comes nearest to attainment . The microscope from which have come the vast advances of the  | years past used sunlight , transmitted through , and by means of , glass . The microscope of the future , the ultra-violet , uses waves invisible to mortal eye , and transmits them through fused quartz . To recognize the reasons for the change from old to new , we must understand that the crux of the problem , the reason why one microscope is better than another , lies in the resolving power of the instrument , its ability to separate two points closely together . Simple enough this seems , an act which we unconsciously perform every time we read a letter from a friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carry the matter further and new conditions rise . Take a beetle shining with gold and crimson armor . To the naked eye it shows a broad design . A simple lens gives definition to each varied part . Here are ridges , lines , and traceries . More powerful microscopes take up the work . Tiny crevasses now appear . Small differences in size and shape before unnoted suddenly spring into view . Each microscope , more powerful than the one before , presents new wealth of vision clarified ! And as each latest , greatest telescope gives myriads of new stars to add to our known universe , so each increase in microscopic power gives realms unknown before , and all because of one supremely simple fact , ? two points so close together that man has never seen them as two points before stand now distinct and separate . Bit by bit , step by step , the cunning polishers of glass , the wise men who by mathematics figured out each lens , advanced on microscopic lines . Decade after decade showed microscopes revealing more , till @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used our common light was practically achieved . To pass that limit , new theories of construction must be opened , using the new beliefs in light transmission for which Abbe and others had done so much . Wonderful indeed are those conceptions which were ready for the worker 's hands . The gleaming wonder of the spectrum , @# shown by the filmy rainbow arch or cast by prismatic glass on wall or floor , had sorely puzzled many a philosopher ere Newton , with his mastermind , took up the task of elucidation . He placed a prism so that it barred the path of light rays from the sun . They entered white . They emerged broken into a million wavering bands which ranged upward from red through orange , yellow , green , blue , and indigo , to violet . That showed that white light must be made from all those parts . But Newton went still farther . He took the glimmering strands of color just achieved and passed them through a lens . Issuing from the rounded glass , the light came forth pure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Newton proved that white light broken down gives all the colors of the spectrum , and conversely showed that all the colors of that spectrum joined produce white light . On the swiftness with which the light of any color reaches the eye depends the color sensation which we feel . A crimsoning sunset and the light green of the spring woods differ only , in color , by the rapidity of the waves . Red is the slowest color of the spectrum . Violet is the swiftest . Down far below the lowest wave of red we know that energy of similar kind exists , a light invisible , the infrared . At the other end of the spectrum , far above the shimmering violet , range yet other invisible light waves , the waves of the ultra-violet . These are the shortest and the swiftest waves of all . It is a fact easily susceptible of proof that the swifter or shorter the wave , the greater the resolving power of any microscope ; the closer together the points which it can separate . On that fact rest the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ White light is far slower than much of the ultra-violet light . It was not long , therefore , before scientific research began to turn towards the upper regions of the spectrum , seeking a source of illumination which should produce a new microscope . The experimenters who entered  | @# upon this work were not many in number , but the chief centre of investigation was one known for its microscopes from Tokio to St. Petersburg , and from Buenos Ayres to San Francisco , ? the house of Carl Zeiss of Jena . Dr. A. Kohler of their scientific staff designed the apparatus . Dr. M. von Rohr , another member of their staff , worked out the difficult computation of the objectives . At first the work progressed along the lines of violet light , which contains the shortest visible waves of the spectrum . As the research went on , however , it turned gradually but certainly towards the use of the ultraviolet . No simple problem lay before the workers . Microscopes had always depended upon the sun for light , and the use of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . To obtain a microscope which should successfully substitute ultra-violet for white light , required a whole series of changes and developed new requirements which appeared in succession . It was of the first importance to secure a source of energy which would give a constant unvarying supply of ultraviolet waves . Fortunately there was such a source at hand . If we pass an electric current between two poles made up of either metallic cadmium or magnesium , that is to say , if we form either a cadmium or a magnesium arc lamp , there will be given off a number of light waves , visible and invisible . Among these latter waves are some of the shortest and swiftest , and , as a result , some of the most useful of the ultra-violet . One serious difficulty with white light has always been what is known as chromatic aberration , its constant tendency to break down into its component colored parts . Look at an ordinary pin through a common lens , and see the red , yellow , or blue of the spectrum appear around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light from the pin as a whole , has broken it down into its component parts as it passed through . For that reason , the matter of chromatic aberration has been a fruitful and con- tinual source of trouble in glass lenses . It seemed especially advisable to do away with mixtures of colors in this new microscopic work , and to get rid of illumination made up of waves of different rapidity . That could not be done with white light or composition light , but it could be accomplished by taking a wave of a single length out of the ultra-violet . If that could be achieved , a light of a single tone would be obtained which could not break down when passed through lens or prism , because there was nothing for it to break into . To separate out such a monochromatic ultra-violet light , to get it where it would illuminate the object below the microscope , and to pass it through the microscope itself , some substance other than glass had to be used . Glass , permeable as it is to white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit of glass across the path of such rays and you raise as complete a barrier as if you raised a wall of iron . The search for some substance which would transmit these waves was long and arduous . It was ultimately found . Fused quartz would let the waves pass through . With that discovery , the two major difficulties were practically settled . The ultra-violet source of illumination was certain to give a far greater resolving power than white light had ever given . It would pass through quartz as white light does through glass . By quartz prisms the experimenter separated out a single-toned wave of ultra-violet light , passed it up to a quartz reflector , sent it from there through a slide , and finally through quartz lenses . At the slide where the object to be examined rests , be that object what you will , a colony of typhoid germs , or a group of blood corpuscles , opens a whole new set of difficulties . As ultra-violet waves are invisible to the human eye the appearance of an object illuminated by that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We see nothing but blackness . That lack of visual power might years ago have been a barrier , but now photo-micrography , 216 The Ultra-Via  | the art of photographing with a microscope , is so advanced that it offers an easy solution of that question . Photography can be accomplished without white light . Not only can it be accomplished , but it is far easier when done with ultra-violet waves , since the essential rays of white light which break down the chemical salts , and impress the image on a photographic plate , are the so-called actinic rays . These are found in greater quantity in the waves above the violet than in those below it . Photo-micrography , which uses the ultra-violet , gives beautifully sharp , clearly-defined images . There is , however , another lion in the way before this process can be used . A camera or a microscope must be focused , the lenses must be so placed as to give a clear sharp image on the plate . When the eye can bring a sharp image from a blurred outline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the eye is of but little avail , it becomes a tedious and difficult process . An approximate focus can be obtained from that property of the ultra-violet waves by which they impart a glow , fluorescence , to uranium glass . In focusing by this process , a piece of uranium glass is placed on the slide on which the object is to rest , the light is turned on , and the microscope adjusted as the glow sharpens or grows dull . This is , however , more or less of an expedient . For more careful work , a series of films are exposed in succession . The focus is changed and noted for each exposure , and the one giving the sharpest image is chosen . More than one microscopic tool which has proved a useful servant in the past becomes with ultra-violet light A serious hindrance . The ordinary microscopic slide on which the specimen rests is of glass , sealed with Canada balsam , a substance through which light passes exactly as it does through glass . Such a slide placed beneath an ultra-violet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waves will pass through . Therefore the slides , like everything else through which the ultra-violet waves pass , were necessarily made of quartz . The old liquids which held the specimens were likewise impassable to the rays . To obviate this , a mounting fluid , a substance which would afford a food and home for germ growths , was prepared by using a solution of salt with agar ( a nutrient ) , in distilled water . This mounting fluid gave nutrition , non-distortion , and , most of all , transparency to the rays . When all these changes had been completed , a microscope was obtained of practically the shape and construction of a compound microscope , having eyepiece and objective of fused quartz instead of glass , having quartz prisms for transmission instead of glass mirrors , and slides of quartz instead of glass . The source of illumination had become short , swift , single-toned waves of ultra-violet , instead of long complex waves of white light . ' What will this instrument do ? It will do just double what the old can accomplish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the size of the smallest the most powerful visual microscope in the world can show . Reduce it to that essential necessity already stated , the ability of the microscope to separate two points near together , and the figures show the tremendous advance . With glass lenses and visible light , the ultimate boundary for separating two such points is one twenty-thousandth of a centimeter . With quartz lenses and ultra-violet waves it is half that , one forty-thousandth of a centimeter . At one bound the new microscope has added one hundred per cent to the power of the old . If the new microscope did nothing more than that it would be one of the great advances of the century , but there inheres in it another power which promises great future use to medical and biological science , ? its action on organic tissue and micro-organic life . The science of microscopy , much as it has given to the world of knowledge which has to do with body-building , with disease , and with the infinitesimal inhabitants of our  | world , has been at best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a dead world on the moon , so the microscopist has gazed through his lenses at a bacterial world made up of dead microorganisms , and of organic tissue hardened and distorted from its natural form . With the visual microscope such conditions were inevitable . The light of day would not show tissue properly until it had been so hardened and fixed by the fluids used in preparation that its normal appearance was gravely altered . It would not show cavity or bacterial form until some colored liquid which mapped out the specimen was injected into it . Such liquid perforce killed the specimen , yet it was essential to proper examination . To recognize the necessity for this , suppose for a moment that we desire to study the structure of a jelly fish . As we hold the semi-transparent mass up to the light , the cavities within by no means show their whole structure or extent . If , however , we could inject into them some brilliant crimson fluid which would fill every channel , we can readily imagine that every tube and hollow would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So staining , for microscopic use , mapped out the specimen in the slide and gave clear definition , but as it gave that definition it killed or changed the substance . As the experimenters carried on the new work and at last forced the light of the ultra-violet through every part , they first tried specimens prepared as for the visual microscope , but , to their surprise , they found that every kind of treatment , such as hardening , mounting , staining , made the specimen absolutely opaque to the rays . No result could be obtained . They went from prepared specimens back to fresh and live specimens . Right there developed one of the most interesting features of the whole matter , the fact that ultra-violet light is selectively absorbing . Just what does that mean ? Simply this , that this light is so extremely sensitive to minute changes in the thickness of any substance through which it passes , that the slightest difference in density makes a marked difference on a photographic plate exposed to that light . Every hollow , every cavity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the flesh or tissue about it , and those walls must be thicker than the surrounding mass . With rays far more potent than those of white light the ultra-violet maps out the whole interior of a specimen , and shows the boundaries of every part . In like fashion a red staining fluid might map our jellyfish example , or would map a microscopic specimen . That opens instantly , not only the world of organic tissue , unhardened , unmounted , and unstained , but it also opens a wide untrodden field , the study of the living bacteria . Sunlight would not reveal the history of the living germ . The ultra-violet can trace that history from its beginning to its end . With the new microscope we can imbed a typhoid bacillus in a solution where it can live its allotted time of existence under constant observation . We are able to study germ processes of growth , methods of reproduction , the spread of disease , and the effects of inoculation . The winding way of the blood corpuscles , of those myriad travelers which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as never before . The struggle between the toxins and the anti-toxins opens to our view . Once more , the ultra-violet microscope has not opened up a single road . It has opened up a new world . No advance in science moves with ordered ease . Each new achievement comes from constant struggle , from a persistent overcoming of obstacles . The new microscope has been no exception to this rule . The effect of ultra-violet light upon living matter seemed at first a barrier which might check the onward movement . It was claimed that these rays , having serious physiological effects , would kill protoplasm and render it opaque to the short waves of light . This theory has now been proved incorrect . In recent experi218 Upon Reading an Appreciation of Aldrich  | ments typhoid bacilli were exposed to ultra-violet rays without harm for some forty minutes , an exposure distributed through a period of three hours . The focusing still remains a serious obstacle . Whether it be done by fluorescence , or by the taking of a series of photographs , the two methods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The preparation of specimens has been difficult in the extreme , and the evolution of satisfactory mounting media , a matter of recent development , is still under discussion . Until we have one vital piece of evidence , complete proof of what this microscope can do will be impossible . For that we should possess a complete series of comparison pictures , showing numerous instances of the same subject taken by ultra-violet and by white light under precisely similar conditions . An apparatus which will give us such an ocular demonstration is now under process of construction , and we shall in time have plates which show the exact relative values of old and new . Then pictures will tell the tale . Until that time we shall have to do our best with w , So ends the beginning of the s Only the beginning , for years of pa labor , tens and hundreds of research will not complete the tale .
