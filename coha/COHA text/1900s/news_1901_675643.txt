txt A poolroom concern on the second and third floors of the building 20 Dey Street was raided yesterday afternoon during the height of business . This time there was no timely tip . The police learned of it only after actual raiding had begun by Detective Sergeants , who met District Attorney Philbin half an hour before under the impression that they were to hunt a murderer or to trace an escaped lunatic . Justice Jerome took part in the raid . Among those found in the place were Maurice F. Holahan , President of the - Board of Public Improvements , and a well-know professor . The raid was made on evidence furnished by the Tammany Committee of Five , and Chairman Lewis Nixon , it is said , watched it from a building opposite . Reginal Levien , one of the alleged proprietors of the place , and Percy Levien and Leon Stedeker , said to be doorkeepers , were held to appear for examination before Justice Jerome in the library of the District Attorney 's office on Thursday . morning at .10:30 o'clock . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with blank subpoenas to appear before the Justice in the case of The People against John Doe . John Doe 's case was taken up there and then , on the poker table in the place . The patrons had the alternative of giving their right names or of going to the House of Detention . About ten days ago , according to District Attorney Philbin , detectives employed by the Committee of Five presented to him evidence showing the existence of a poolroom at the address . The difficulty was to make the raid without the tip being given . Yesterday afternoon the District Attorney secured warrants for the arrest of the three men above named from Justice Jerome , in Special Sessions , in order to avoid the publicity of a police court . Then he started down town for the Cortlandc Street Ferry , where six Detective Sergeants were to assemble , together with Assistant District Attorneys Schurman and O'Connor . Mr. Schurman had a few minutes be-. fore telephoned his chief that he could not get away from his down-town office , which was the signal arranged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jerome , accompanied by Clerk Fuller of his court and Detective Sergeant Cuff , also started out . At the ferry the party , with the exception of the District Attorney , took two carriages and drove at once to 20 Dey Street . In the first carriage were Justice Jerome and Clerk Fuller of Special Sessions , and De . tective Sergeants Cuff , Kelly , and Price . In the second were Assistant District Attorneys O'Connor and Schurman and Detective Sergeants McCafferty , Rynder. and Clark . While this party was on its way to Der Street District , Attorney Philbin had gone around to the Church Street Police Station , first stopping at the Dey Street corner to make sure that the carriages were not too far behind him . At the station house he threw his card on the desk and told the Sergeant that he wanted a platoon of policemen at once . The Sergeant promptly rang tip a platoon . The District Attorney , with Capt . Westervelt , who happened to be in , took the head of the column . They arrived just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the meantime the carriage party had drawn up in front of the saloon of G. L. Vath , on the ground floor . Clark and McCafferty were sent up through the adjoining building on the east side of the roof , where they guarded a ladder that ran up from the lower roof of No. 20 . Price and Cuff guarded the roof of the building to the west . The rest of the party went into the saloon . " Gentlemen , what , will you have ? " asked the barkeeper . Outside the platoon from Church Street was heard coming up . " I think we 'll have that door first . " Justice Jerome observed . Rynder placed him , self at the front door of the saloon and Kelly stepped to the back . In a minute the street and room were filled with police . Despite the saloon keeper 's , protest that the stairway at the back led only to an unused loft and his kitchen , the storming party ' went up . In the kitchen they found two women cooking . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confronted them . Justice Jerome ordered those behind it to open in the name of the law . Prom behind the door , according to the storming panty , came a storm of protest and threats of the use of political pull . " If you wo n't open the door , we 'll break it , " Justice Jerome cried . There was a scurry from the rooms behind the door up a stairway invisible to the stormers . Then there was stillness , after which some one on the inside shouted : " Hold on , we 'll unlock it . " The door flew open , and the doorkeeper who had yielded was seized by the police . The storming party rushed by the new stairway they found only in time to hear the door at the top bang and the heavy locks slide back . At the top of the stairway three stout patrolmen pounded upon this new obstruction , shouting for those within to open . There was no response . At this point Capt . Westervelt and the District Attorney came tip . " Get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patrolmen went to the street . where they got a heavy sledge hammer . Then one of them crossed to a truck and pulled out the iron-bound stake in its rear . These were used on the door speedily . Some half dozen good blows had been struck when the door was opened from the inside . WILD RUSH TO ESCAPE . As the raiders forced their way in a wild scramble for trap doors in the roof and other apparent ways of egress took place . Reginald Le Vien , one of the alleged proprietors , got to the ladder leading tip to the roof of the adjoining building only to be taken prisoner by the detectives stationed there . Others remained seated agitatedly at the poker tables dealing out to each other crosses between casino and poker hands , and the cry that a chartered club had been invaded arose . ' When the inmates realized that they were trapped , and after all sorts of . threats of political pull had been used , the place quieted down somewhat . On the second floor were two rooms with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peep holes . The smaller of these rooms was evidently the place where the books were made up . It was fitted with telephones , and had a glass window opening into the larger room in front , which was made up to resemble a club library . in the hall on the third floor was a bar . Opening out of it was a room fitted with poker tables . Two smaller rooms were back of these , one containing a dummy safe . The seventy-five patrons in the place were put in a rear room . Then Justice Jerome opened court upon a poker table . Assistant District Attorney Schurman examined the men for his office : Upon each of the patrons a blank subpoena was served , as follows : In the name of the people of the State of New York. ? To John Jones . the name John Jones being fictitious. but the person served herewith whose name is unknown . is the party Intended .

As each man was brought before the Dey Street Court he v. ? as told that if he insisted upon giving a fictiious name he ' would be committed to the House of Detention . He was give-ti 1,3 understand , ' however , that if lie consented ? to give his proper name and address and give testimony to the court in private big name would be withheld from the public for the present , and he would be allowed to go . Clerk Fuller had with him a number blank commitments . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The District Attorney 's office , it was said , was abl ? ? to secure testimony from reputable men that they had played the races M the room for two years . Some fifty of the men caught in the room were summoned to appear at the examination of the three prisoners . The others were released . ALLEGED PROPRIETOR ARRAIGNED . When the last of the witnesses had been disposed of . Reginald ? Le Vien , the alleged proprietor , was brought before the court . He was represented by his cousin , Douglass Le Vien , as counsel , who also appeared for the other prisoners . It developed that the complainants in the case were John R. Wood and Harry R. Mareuse , detectives in the employ of the Committee of Five : They charged Le Vien with being the proprietor and recognized Percy Le Vien and Leon Stedeker as the men at the door . The alleged proprietor , through his counsel , waived the reading of the depositions of the complaining witnesses , and asked that a du . for examination be set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take the bail bond of James M. Steedman , who offered real estate situated at 220 West Forty-ninth Street . The bond was fixed at $1 , a00 , and Le Vien was released . The other two prisoners were turned over to the police of the Church Street Station , as it was decided to examine them in the station house after the court had dined . Before going . however , a search was made of the rooms . A number of ' ? dope books . ' scorecards. and pads of paper showingwhere the horses run in one , two , or three order were found . When Justice Jerome opened the roll-top desk Counsel Le Vien ana , iously inquired if the telephone inside were to be taken . " You know it does n't belong to us , and it would be too bad to take that . It does n't do anywhere. - he said . In a corner of the room there was a large dummy safe , which Counsel Le Vien said would be found to be empty . When ( ' apt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plash cloth was found . Three large registers were in the place containing what is alleged to be the names of the members of the organization . The place has been called the Parole Turf Club . Payment of $1 it is said entitled one to a pass key and membership . All the testimony given in secret to the poker table court and the evidence found about the room were turned over to Assistant District Attorney O'Connors , who took them in a carriage to the Criminal Court building , where they were placed in Justice Jerome 's private iocaer . It was said that during the time of excitement in the street Chairman Nixon of the Committee of Five stood in the building opposite watching the spectacle . Later in the day he said : " I am well pleased with the results of this day 's work . It is only the beginning , however. - District Attorney Philbin said that he had been planning the raid for about ten days . " Certatin evidence had been furnished by the Committee of Five , which was turned over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birthday Justice Jerome and I were in consultation about it . The great thing was to prevent a tip being given out . I think the , we devised it got over that difficult . But it was a difficult thing to bring out just right . since this shop has had the benefit of some detective work . Capt . Westervelt told me he had eight men around the place for months , but he had n't managed to get the evidence . However , the other gamblers need n't feel slighted , as we 'll devise a few new things for their benefit . This is one of the principal places in the combination west of Broadway . When the place was entered by us there were all sorts of threats of the use of political pull . but we told them that we were playing no favorites . " James M. Steedman , who went on Levien 's bond . was asked his business . " I am a speculator , " he replied " Have you any regular office ? " " No . At present I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ STATION . After the Court had dined the examination of the remaining two prisoners was proceeded with in the Church Street Station . ? - . On the blotter the three prisoners were entered as , follows : Reginald Levien , fifty-one years old . a commission broker , of 77t ) Lexington Avenue : Percy A. Levien , thirty years old . a clerk of 82 Rogers Avenue , Brooklyn . and Leon Stedeker , fortysix years old , a speculator living at the Astor House . The two prisoners vet to be bailed sat behind the Sergeant 's desk awaiting the arrival of Justice Jerome , while their counsel , Douglass Levien , prepared the bail bond . James S. Steedman being ready to qualify as n hc'ndsmaii . Capt .

At the time ' if the raid there were five of our men in tee place , but on the lower floors , and three of the Inspector 's men in addition . They were unable to get into the upper rooms . They had been there since 1 o'clock . and they tell me no one ' went up stairs in that time . They have been there daily for weeks , too . Why , I broke in and raided that place twice about a year and a half ago . the raids being a month apart . We arrested Stedeker , among others . The men were all discharged in court and ha ve civil suits now pending against the si fieers . The planet-mien from the precinct were Creed , laehoe . Horrigan , O'Sullivan , and Quirk . The Inspector 's men were Sutty , Adams , and Crowe . This district is under the command of Inspector Grant , but he is away on sick leave and Inspector Cross is now in charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the raid , and policemen of the precinct helped in taking- the prisoners . " It was about 10:15 when Justice Jerome , accompanied by Mr. Schurman and Mr. O'Connor , reached the police station . They at once went into Capt . Westervelt 's private office . where the hearing was held . Lawyer Levien made a strong plea for his clients ' release , but the Judge said : I think there is evidence enough on which I should hold them . Ca n't you get bail for them to-night and have it out in the morning ? I do n't want a long hearing now . " The lawyer then asked for the liberty of young Levien . " I 'd like to . " said Justice Jerome , " but it 's not exactly right to parole a man in a felony case . It 's a serious thing to have to call out a whole platoon of police to execute a felony warrant in the City of New York .. Some men are so bright they ought to be operated upon . " The prisoners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for examination . When Stedeker was brought out he was identified by Capt . Westervelt as . an oldtime ticket speculator at ' Tenderloin theatres . I 've been arrested forty times at least for . trouble growing out of ticket speculating , " he said , " but I never was held . I was always let go in the morning . " " Then you never happened to get before me , " said Justice Jerome . " I have no doubt you would tax me- . $2.50 for tickets worth 75 cents , " he added . " I would n't care whether they were only worth 25 cents , - said Stedeker . " I 'd tax you $5 for ' em if you 'd give it. - " I believe you will be in court if you give Me your word of honor that you will , ' continned the Justice . I 'll give you my word of honor . " " That 's a compliment to you , " interpolated Mr. Schurman . " Oh , well , we were neither of us born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bend was signed . Asked about his reasons for holding court in the-gambling rooms , Justice Jerome said there was every warrant for it in the common law of the country . " But no other Magistrate ever did It , " " Fortunaely . I 'm not responsible for the legal education of all the other Judges . I issued the warrants at the request of the District Attorney on prima fade evidence , to show that there was good and sufficient reason ' for issuing them . I placed the warrants in the hands of the peace officers , in whom I had confidence  --  and then I went to see that they executed them . ? I am ? perfectly satisfied with what they did . " As he left the station Justice Jerome addressed - Caps Westervelt in soft accents : " Good night , Captain , " he said : " I hope you 'll have peace and quiet in the precinct now . " ? V HAT MR . HOLAHAN SAYS . idaurite F. Holahan , when seen last night , admitted that he had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raided , but said that he had not gone there to gamble . " I was looking for a relative , " he said , " who I had reason to suppose was in the place . I do not care to give the name of the relative , because I do not want any notoriety in the DaDera in regard to disappearance . He has been missing for the past four months , and I have been hutsfor him all over the city . I had reason to suppose that he frequented this place on Dey Street , and I have been there several times is search of . him , butelhave " never found him so far . . rwould like to say here that the place is a regularly licensed club , and that there is no reason why I should be ashamed of having been in it . " I have been in it severaletimes looking for my - relative , but I have never seen so much as . a racing card in the place . There were several games of cards going on last night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gambling paraphernalia . I had reason to suppose that the man would - be in the place yesterday .  - -  To show --  how anxious I have been to find him I will say that I have stood for hours at the door of ' the place in the hope that I might find him as he came out . " Yesterday I went there again in search of him . I went into the place and stood looking around at the people there , but I did not take part in any of the games . Anybody can see that I would not go there to gamble . If I wanted . to bet on a horse I could have called up a poolroom on the telephone . I am not ashamed in any way of having been there , as I was there for a good urpose , although I would have Preferredp that my name should have been kept out of the papers in connection with the ra , id . I had been in the place about fifteen minutes , and was just buttoning up my coat to leave , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rushed in . " Mr. Holahan added that he did not think that Mr. Philbin had acted fairly to him in regard to the raid . " When he came in. " he said , " I went right up to him and told him who I was . Nobody there knew rne , and it would have been just as easy for me to say that my name was John Smith . I thought that when I told him my name he would not let it get into the papers in any way . Philbin is a reformer , though , and I might have known that he would not act right . I am very sorry that my name has appeared in connection with the place at all , but I was there to look for my relative , and I have nothing to conceal in the affair at all . "
