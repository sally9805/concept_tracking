txt Kansas has long claimed the distinction of raising more cranks to the acre than any State in the Union . That it is entitled to whatever satisfaction may be derived from the amplitude of its crank crop may be conceded without discussion . An extremely fine specimen of this variety of ' native product Would seem to be the Principal of Washburn College at Topeka , who 1 has peremptorily put a stop to the singing of hymns in the chapel exercises of that institution until a popular Gospel hymnal hitherto in use can be replaced by one edited according to %very much higher and stricter standards . In explaining his action the worthy pedagogue says it Is taken because the songs are immoral  --  not the words , which may be as silly as could be desired , but the music . Of the tunes to which these unobjectionable words are to be sung , the Professor finds  --  though hs-w he knows might be made the subject of profitable inquiry  --  that not less than twenty-five are immoral . Six of them are waltz movements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are two-steps . The remainder are marches which , if not distinctly immoral , are at least objectionable . When hymnals can be found in which none of the tunes are open to the suspicion of being waltzes , polkas , two-steps , or marches , devotional singing may be resumed . Until then the morals of the Washburn undergraduate . will be safeguarded by shielding him from the corrupting tendency of the immoral music referred to . Whether there is such a quality in music as immorality , per se , is a question concerning which the Principal of Washburn College would seem to have a monopoly of positive convictions . Perhaps OPPENDACH came as near to musical indelicacy as any composer ever did . His melodies certainly lent themselves very kindly to the purposes of an improper libretto . STRAUSS , without the aid of anything but suggestive titles , gave us a good deal of music of the kind popularly known as " sensuous . " SULLIVAN was able to express a sense of humor in harmony and to excite a smile in the appreciative listener wholly independent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's bubbling merriment . It remains for Prof. PENNY of Topeka to discover that waltzes , polkas , two-steps , and even marches are immoral , and to realize the danger to youth from having such compositions associated with devotional hymns . The average man might suppose that to associate a tune with such a thought as is usually crystallized in the Gospel hymn was good evidence of its regeneration , and that thereafter it might be regarded as a brand snatched from the burning or a stray lamb recovered and safely corralled in the fold . But the average man is likely to be mistaken on many subjects , and may be on this . Certainly an authoritative essay by Prof. PENNY on the quality of immorality in music would be a contribution to the gayety of nations if not to the wisdom of the ages . The good Methodist who defended such tunes as Prof. PENNY condemns , on the ground that the devil should not have a monopoly of all the good music , has long been considered a very wise and practical person ; but obviously his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
