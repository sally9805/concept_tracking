txt // What are the characteristics of rock , the Jurassic period ? The Jurassic contains , besides many characteristic radiates , ' sponges and mollusks , ( brachiopods , lamellibranchs , cephalopods , etc. ) remains of gigantic reptiles , including the flying-reptiles or pterodactyls , ' the ichthyosaurus , ' tortoises , etc. ; also some mammals . Fishes flourished . What are the characteristics of rocks of the Cretaceous period ? The Cretaceous plants were marked by the first great development of the angiosperms ( including all plants with a bark , except the conifers and cyeads ) . This class embraces the oak , willow , maple , etc . The smaller marine animals have contributed shells in great variety and profusion to the Cretaceous sediments . Rhizopods with tiny shells ( foraminifers ' ) . were abundant , and constitute most of the chalk beds . Sponges and corals were of great importance . The oyster family flourished , and many others Sharks and other fishes were common ; reptiles were numerous , among them true sea-serpents , as much as seventy-five feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which possessed pointed teeth . What are the characteristics of rocks of the Tertiary period ? The Tertiary is called the Age of Mammals , for during this period mammals flourished . Yet most of the Tertiary mammal species are now extinct . The Tertiary beds often contain plant remains , belonging // to species of oak , maple , dog-wood , magnolia , fig , palm , etc . The mollusks comprise many species of oyster , clam , and other larnellibranchs , but few brachiopods . Crabs , insects , fishes , etc. were plentiful . Crocodiles , snakes , and turtles abounded . There were many large mammals , including now extinct species of elephant , tapir , rhinoceros , horse , tiger , lion , wolf , peccary , etc . The remains of all of these are found in the western United States . In the sea there were whales , dolphins , seals and walruses . Example : A quarry near Carson , Nevada , now used as a State prison yard , is cut in grayish sandstones , whose bedding is such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ancient stream . When the sandstone was removed down to two shale layers , these were found litera ly covered with the tracks of many species of birds and mammals , including the mammoth , the deer , the wolf , many birds , a horse , and tracks resembling those of a man , but which may have been made by some animal . The footprints and some associated bones indicate a probable very late Tertiary age . These remarkable tracks were exposed and trampled over by horses and men for eight or ten years , without attracting any especial attention. * What are the characteristics of rocks of the Quaternary period ? The Quaternary in called the Age of Man , for in this period the human race began to flourish . During this age came the Glacial Period or Ice Age , when a vast glacier or glaciers covered the northern part of North America , with their southern margin running irregularly across the northern and central part of the present United States . These // glaciers spared most of Alaska and some other areas , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left , on melting , vast deposits of boulders and gravels . Thus in the eastern United States the southern and central portions , which are unglaciated , are strikingly different from the rocky , bouldery , often barren glaciated areas of the north . In the Western States the glacier did not extend far south of the present Canadian boundary . In the early part of the Quaternary flourished many great mammals , of species now generally extinct . These comprised gigantic mastodons , elephants ( mammoths ) , lions , hyenas , bears , wolves , beavers , etc . Man probably lived in the later Tertiary period , but evidence of his existence is first complete in the Quaternary . IIe was contemporary with the hairy Inauunoth and other extinct species , which he has survived . How can one tell to what period a given rock belongs ? The only reliable way to identify a stratified rock , as belonging to one of these periods , is by study of the fossil remains which it contains . These will tell in what stage or the world 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who has made a careful study of extinct animal forms , it is generally possible , on seeing a group of fossils , to refer them to one of the great periods given . But to the casual observer , the differences are not so striking as to be retained without study and careful comparison . There are , to be sure , certain broad signs , which he may use as guides , to a limited extent . Rocks containing large numbers of trilobites , with few other fossils , // are probably Cambrian , or Silurian , most probably the former . Rocks with graptolites are probably Silurian . Rocks containing plant remains , if these are largely reedlike and otherwise unlike any of our common trees , are probably Carboniferous , perhaps Devonian . If the plant remains consist of leaves resembling those of our modern trees , the rocks are probably Cretaceous or Tertiary . In the same way , rocks containing fossil shells almost exactly like those which are now occupied by living animals on the sea-shore , are probably Tertiary , and in proportion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age . A great abundance of crinoids suggests the Carboniferous . Abundance of sponges , corals and large brachiopods , with fewer lamellibranchs , suggest the Carboniferous or Devonian . Predominance of lamellibranchs indicates a probable age not older than Triassic , etc . With a little practice in observing rocks of known age , one can tell ordinarily , although by no means always , a Paleozic rock , a Mesozoic rock , or a Tertiary rock from the general look of the fossils , even if one can not determine a single species . Where a certain series of strata has been determined by paleontologists , one can attentively examine the fossils contained , and can then very likely recognize beds of the same age in another part of the same district or even in another district . CHARACTERISTICS OF THE DIFFERENT FOSSILS. * The fossils which have been referred to belong mostly to // the anima kingdom ; some of them to the vegetable kingdom . how is the animal kingdom divided ? The animal kingdom is divided into five sub-kingdoms . Beginning with the lowest they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 . Articulates. 5 . Vertebrates . Wheat are protozoans ? Protozoans are minute animals , ( usually from a 100th to a 10,000th of an inch in length . ) They have no external organs save a mouth and minute thread-like organs , and no digestive apparatus beyond a stomach . The stomach and the mouth are sometimes wanting . There is no heart or circulating system beyond a palpitating vesicle . What are rhizopods and foraminifers ? Among protozoans , the rhizopods are of especial interest . The shells are usually much smaller than the head of a pin . The most common kinds have calcareous shells called foraminifers , and these have contributed largely to the formation of the limestone strata . They consist of one or more shells , and the compound kinds present various shapes . // What are radia'es ? Radiates have a radiate structure , like a flower ? that is , they have similar parts or organs repeated around a vertical axis . These animals have a mouth and stomach for eating and digestion , and are widely diverse from plants , although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are crinoids ? Among the radiates , crino'ds are animals like an inverted star-fish or sea-urchin , standing on a stem like a flower . What are graptolites ? The graptolites were ancient , delicate plume-like animals which belonged in the sub-kingdom of radiates . What are mol usks ? Mollusks possess a soft fleshy bag , containing the stomach and viscera . They do not possess a radiate structure nor jointed appendages . Similar parts are repeated on right and left sides of a median plane , and not around a vertical axis , as in radiates . How are mollusks subdivided ? Mollusks are divided into : 1 . Ordinary mollusks. 2 . Ascidian mollusks. 3 . Brachiate mollusks . The ordinary mollusks are divided into : 1 . The acephals , or headless mollusks , the head not // being distinctly defined in outline ; as the oyster and clam. 2 . The cephalates , having a defined head ; as the snail . 3 . The cephalopods , having the head furnished with long arms ( or feet ) ; as the cuttle-fish . What are lamellibranchs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the group of lamellibranchs . These common species are well known as bivalves . One valve is on the right , and the other on the left , of the animal . The clam and the oyster are familiar examples . What are gasteropods ? in the cephalates , one of the two groups are the gastFropods . These are contained in univalve shells ( shells all in one piece ) . The animal crawls on a flat spreading fleshy organ called the foot . The snail is a familiar example . What are cephalopods ? Cephalopods , or cuttle-fishes , are of two kinds , one having external shells and four gills ; and another having sometimes internal shells , but not external , and having but two gills . The external shells are distinguished from those of the gasteropods or ordinary univalves by nearly always having transverse partitions ? whence they are called chambered shells . They may be straight or coiled , but when coiled are usually coiled in a plane , and not a spiral . The animal occupies the outer chamber of the shell . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost exclusively naked species , such as the cuttle-fish and squid . What are ammonites ? The ammonites are a genus of cephalopods , and have very beautiful and often large coiled and fluted shells . What are brachiopods ? Among brachiate mollusks , brachiopods have a bivalve shell , and in this respect are like ordinary bivalves . But the shell , instead of covering the right and left sides , covers the dorsal and ventral sides , or its plane is at right angles to that of a clam . Moreover , it is symmetrical in form , and equal on either side of a vertical line . The valves are almost always unequal ; the larger is the ventral , and the smaller the dorsal . What are articulates ? Articulates consist of a series of joints or segments . The legs , where any exist , are jointed , and there is no internal skeleton . The articulates include worms , crusta-ceans , and insects . TVhat are crustaceans ? The crustaceans have the body in two parts ? the front consisting of a head and thorax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lobsters , and shrimps are examples . What are trilobites ? Among crustaceans , the trilobites existed only in Paleo-zoic time . They had jointed bodies with a crust-like // exterior . They are more like the horse-shoe crab of the Atlantic coast than any other living species . What are vertebrates ? The fifth animal sub-kingdom comprises the vertebrates . These have a jointed internal skeleton , and a bone-sheathed cavity along the back for the great nervous cord , distinct from the cavity of the viscera. how are vertebrates divided ? The classes of vertebrates are : 1 . Mammals , which are the highest branch of the animal kingdom . They suckle their young and breathe with lungs . Ordinary quadrupeds ( four-footed animals ) are all mammals . 2 . Birds produce their young in the egg form . They have a heart of four cavities ; they breathe by lungs , are covered with feathers , and are adapted for flying . 3 . Reptiles produce their young in the egg form . They breath by lungs , have a heart of three or four cavities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are crocodiles , lizards , turtles , and snakes . 4 . Amphibians produce their young in the egg form . When young they breath by gills , and afterward by lungs alone . They possess a heart with three cavities , and are naked or covered with scales . Examples are frogs and salamanders. 5 . Fishes usually produce their young in the egg form . They possess a heart , usually of two cavities . They breathe by gills , and are naked , or covered by scales . // What are osseous fishes ? The osseous fishes or teliosts include nearly all modern kinds , except the sharks and rays . They usually have membranous scales . They are not known among fossils before the Middle Mesozoic . How are reptiles classified ? Reptiles are divided into snakes , saurians , and turtles . The saurians vary in length from a few inches to fifty feet . What were dinosaurs and pterosaurs ? Among the saurians the tribe of dinosaurs , reptiles of great size , now extinct , possessed some mammalian and many bird-like characteristics . Another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pterodactyls were the most common genus . The little finger of the forefoot was excessively prolonged , and from this a membrane extended to the tail and made a wing for flying . The remaining fingers were short , and furnished with claws . They had the habits of bats , and wings of a similar character . What were ichthyosaurs ? The ichthyosaurs were a genus of the group of enaliosaurs , or swimming saurians . They were gigantic animals , 10 to 40 feet long , having paddles somewhat like the whale , long head and jaws , and an eye of enormous dimensions . // How is the vegetable kingdom divided ? The vegetable kingdom is primarily divided into cryptogams , which have no distinct flowers or proper fruit , ( such as ferns and sea-weed ) , and phenogams , having distinct flowers and seed , ( such as our ordinary trees and plants ) . How are the phenogams subdivided ? The phenogams are divided into : 1 . Gymnosperms . The plant has a bark , and grows by an annual addition to the exterior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The flowers are very simple , and the seed naked . Examples are the pine , spruce , hemlock , etc . Gymnosperms include : ( 1 ) Conifers . ( 2 ) Cycads . The conifers include most of the common evergreen trees . Their wood is simply woody fibre , without ducts . The cycads had the habit of palms , while related to the pine tribe . 2 . Angiosperms . Growing by external annual rings , like the gyuuiosperms ; having regular flowers and covered seeds . Examples are the maple , elm , rose , etc. 3 . Endogens , having regular flowers and seed , but with no bark and no rings of growth . In a transverse section of a trunk or stem , the ends of fibres are shown . Examples are the palm , Indian corn , lily , etc . How are the cryptogams subdivided ? The cryptogams are subdivided into : 1 . Thallogens . Consisting wholly of cellular tissue ; // growing mostly in fronds without stems , and in other spreading forms ; as , ( 1 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 ) Fungi , or mushrooms . 2 . Anogens . Consisting wholly of cellular tissue ; growing up in short , leafy stems ; as , ( 1 ) Mosses. ( 2 ) Liverworts . 3 . Acrogens . Consisting of vascular tissue in part , and growing upward ; as , ( 1 ) Ferns . ( 2 ) Lycopods ( ground pine ) . ( 3 ) Equiseta , or horse-tail ; and including many trees of the coal period . What were lepidodendrids ? Among the fossil lycopods , the lepidodendrids ( tall trees , with the exterior embossed with scars in alternate order , ) were of many kinds . In foliage , they resembled the pines and spruces of the present day . What were sigillarids ? The sigillarids differed from the lepidodendrids in having the scars in vertical order . The trunk was woody , but not firm within ; and it had a large pith . What were calamites ? In the Paleozoic , the equisetm , or horse-tails , were represented by plants called calamites . They had a reedlike appearance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE ORDER OF SUCCESSION AS FOUND IN ACTUAL PRACTICE . Is the succession of geologic periods , as previously stated , always shown in the sedimentary rocks of a given district ? Not always ; indeed , not usually . Any one of the geologic ages may not be represented at all , may be represented by very thin beds , or by strata thousands of feet thick . Often rocks of only a few of the geologic ages are present . Tertiary beds may rest directly upon those of the Cambrian age ; or the Quaternary may rest upon the Archaean . In fact , there is every possible combination . What is the reason for this lack of uniformity ? In a certain part of the earth 's surface there may have been no sediments during a certain age or ages . If the region was a land area ( luring any period this would be the case , for stratified rocks are laid down in water . Again , after the sediments were formed , during a certain period , they may have changed into land , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the rivers . Then , when the land became again submerged and new strata were deposited in their place , the new beds may have come to rest on those of an age much greater than the series usually found next underneath them . What is an erosion gap and an uncon f ormity ? In the case just mentioned , the line of contact between the two series of strata will be irregular , for the newer beds will have been deposited over the hills and hollows of the older topography , although the stratification in both // series may be parallel . This is called an erosion gap ; sometimes an unconformity by erosion . Frequently , in the interval between the deposition of the earlier series and that of the later one , there occur move-ments in the earth 's crust , so that the beds of the older series are bent or folded ; then the new series does not have its stratification parallel , but rests discordantly on the bent and worn edges of the old strata . This is a true uncon-formity ( Fig. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Can one tell from the kind of rock what age it belongs to ? In general , the nature of the strata , whether limestone , quartzite , etc. , is of little value in determining to which of the geological periods it belongs . A certain stage of the Carboniferous , for example , may be represented by a sandstone in one district , a limestone in another . Is a given bed necessarily of one kind of rock throughout ? A bed may pass laterally from one kind of rock into another ( as from a sandstone into a limestone ) , within a space of a few miles or even much less . // Example : On the Kuskokwiln river , Alaska , the writer observed a series of interbedded sandstones and shales , where the sandstone passes laterally into shale in a remarkable way . A thick bed of sandstone splits into separated beds which become alternate with beds of shale , and these rapidly grow thinner as the shale beds increase in thickness until the shale forms nearly the entire rock ( Fig. 3 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one considers sediments now being formed , one will find such transitions common along the sea-shore . For example , there is found at one point mud , at another sand , at another gravel or cobbles , all being deposited at the same time . When such a deposit is hardened and becomes stone , it will show within a single bed the change from a shale to a sandstone , and from a sandstone into a con-glomerate. // Can strata be identified by their physical characters ? If only the foregoing exception is remembered as a guard against over-confidence , it is possible to trace certain strata a long distance by their physical characters , which they may retain for hundreds of miles . Sometimes the peculiarities of certain strata are so marked that , when one finds in adjacent districts rocks possessing these peculiarities , there is a strong suggestion of identity of age . Example : The Ethological identity of the peculiar particolored , thin-bedded shales , lithographic limestones and quartzite of the Parting Quartzite series in Aspen , Colorado , with Devonian strata described by Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impressed the writer , that other conditions being fay orable , he provisionally classified the Aspen beds as Devonian , although the localities are hundreds of miles apart . This correlation was afterward borne out by the discovery of Devonian fossils in the Aspen beds . Yet correlation from physical characters alone , without sufficient guardedness and auxiliary evidence , has frequently led into the most awkward errors . Does a certain kind of rock ever constitute beds of the same age over large areas ? A certain character of strata may persist in some instances over a wide region ? even over large portions of continents . Some physical features of strata of a certain period seem to be of almost world-wide occurrence . In rocks belonging to the Triassic , all over the world , there is // an astonishing quantity of massive red sandstone ; yet all massive red standstones are by no means Triassic , and conversely , all Triassic rocks are not red sandstone . COMPARISON AND CORRELATION . Mode of Determining the Relative Age of Different Strata . How can one determine the relative age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? The relative age of a series of strata may often be determined by making reference to other strata , the age of which is definitely known . The first rule to be observed , is the simple rule of superposition , by which the upper of two series of strata , or of two beds , is usually the younger . This is to be applied not only where the beds are horizontal but where they are folded ; it is easy to do this , except in the rare case where the folding has been so great that some beds have been overturned , and the normally lower ones come on top . In this case the study of the folding , the fossils present in the rock , etc. , will afford the data requisite for solving the problem . This rule does not necessarily apply where a fault separates the two beds in question . How may the relative age of different series of strata , not in contact with one another , be judged ? Where two rocks are not found in actual contact , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rocks close together , the more metamorphosed or hardened one is probably , the older ; likewise , that one which shows most // folding and faulting , and other evidence of disturbance , is probably the older . One rock , such as conglomerate , may contain pebbles which have been derived from the other : in this case the conglomerate is clearly the younger . Many such tests will present themselves to the careful investigator . Mode of Correlating Similar Strata in Adjacent or Separated Regions . How are similar strata in different localities identified as such ? This point has already been dwelt upon , but may be briefly summarized . The correlation or matching of similar strata in adjacent or separated regions is usually done by means of the fossils which they contain . If these fossils are nearly the same in two different localities , the beds may be correlated ; or , if , although not belonging to the same species , they are known to represent a similar stage in the development of life . When fossils are lacking , the physical characteristics may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question may be traced wholly or partly from one district to another ; or , if its peculiarities are very striking , a correlation between separated districts may often be made without tracing out the intervening portions . Thin beds are usually traced out and correlated by their physical characteristics , which are apt to be more definitive in this case than fossils . // THE ASSOCIATION OF VALUABLE MINERALS WITH CERTAIN STRATA . What is the commercial application of the knowledge of the principles concerning strata ? Whenever valuable minerals are confined wholly or partly to a certain bed or beds , the ability to recognize and trace that bed in different localities often leads to the discovery of new mineral districts and of new mines . GENERAL RELATIONS OF STRATIFIED ORES . How is it that minerals are sometimes preferentially associated with a certain sedimentary bed or beds ? The association of a valuable mineral with certain sedimentary beds may be either primary or subsequent . That is , the mineral may have originally been precipitated in bed form , along with the other strata , or it may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Among valuable minerals known to be deposited originally in bed form , we may cite , besides coal , some gypsum deposits , salt beds and many other non-metallic minerals . In this way metallic minerals are also deposited in a greater or less state of concentration . Iron and manganese are deposited both in bogs and in the ocean depths ; and in some rich muds copper in slight amounts and , to a certain extent , even silver and gold are precipitated . Many of these first named deposits afford workable minerals just as they are deposited ; others , especially those of the less common metals , require further // concentration by percolating waters , but in the end the ore will still be confined to the parent bed or its neighborhood . Ores introduced by circulating waters into strata , subsequent to their formation , often choose one bed in preference to another in consequence of some chemical or physical peculiarity favorable to deposition : and thus the resultant ore-body takes on a bedded form . Example : In Piemonte , near Brosso , Italy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regularly interstratified with beds of limestone and mica-schist . Nearby , at Traversella , are deposits of pyrite , magnetite and copper pyrite in dolomite . At both these places the deposits are confined to the flanks of an intrusive quartz-bearing diorite , and the chief ore-deposits are accompanied by garnet or hornstone ( altered and hardened limestone ) , together with other metamorphic rocks . The conclusion has hence been reached , that the ores are due to the influence of the intrusive rock ; that first gases , and later hot springs , both emanating from the diorite , attacked and mineralized the intruded strata . The limestone strata were more strongly affected than the mica-schists and were replaced by ores , so that they now are represented by ore-beds intercalated in the schists . Strong fractures permitted the gases and water to penetrate far from the diorite. so that the mineralization was extensive. * Is it important to tell whether a bed of ore is primary or secondary ? Such a distinction is important , for the reason that in the first case the ore will invariably follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be always expecting it to deviate from it or to occur in other forms . This latter caution must also be maintained in regard to those primary bedded deposits which have undergone secondary concentration by circulating waters . These waters , besides concentrating the ore within the parent bed , are likely to carry it out and to form ore-deposits at a distance from it . What chief points must one keep in mind in following an ore-bearing stratum ? In any case one of the chief things is to be able to trace and recognize the same bed in different places . Whether the occurrence of ore in bedded form is primary or secondary , it must be associated with a fairly constant character of the rock . If the deposit is original , the conditions which brought about the deposition of the same valuable mineral in various places must have given rise to other uniform physical characters . If it is secondary , the physical or chemical character , which determined the precipitation of ore along a certain bed , must be present wherever we can reasonably look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ containing replacement deposits passes laterally into a sandstone , the ore may be poor or wanting in the sandstone . If a shale bed , which by its impermeability or its organic matter has determined the deposition of ores in or near it , passes into a sandstone or limestone , again we must look for a change , and , very likely , the disappearance of this ore-horizon . For this reason , in tracing an ore-horizon , physical and chemical points are among the most valuable means of identification , // and where such points fail the chances are that the orehorizon fails too . Do ore-bearing strata ever extend as such for long distances ? Often a certain bed may be traced by its physical characters hundreds of miles , and is everywhere a valuable indication of contained ore . Example : In the Lake Superior district , the ore-deposits are confined to a certain set of beds , easily recognizable by their peculiar physical characters . These beds make up the iron-bearing formation they are sometimes slaty , sometimes massive , generally dark-colored rock ? and by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This point is brought out in the following quotation from Mr. Oscar Rohn. * " It may be well to recall that the iron ore-deposits of the Lake Superior district always occur in certain characteristic formations , called iron-bearing formations , which are associated with a series of conglomerates , quartzites , slates , and vein stones So well understood and so generally recognized is the association of ore-deposits with a characteristic rock formation that in all welldirected prospecting the limits of the formation are sought , and underground work confined to the area within these limits . " How may the presence of a known ore-bearing stratum be recognized in a place where it does not outcrop ? The relation of an ore-bearing bed to other beds lying // above and below should be studied and borne in mind . Often where the ore-bearing bed is not exposed at the surface , or is covered with surface debris , the recognition of a bed having a known relation to the ore-bed leads to the discovery of the latter and its contained ore-deposits . PREFERENTIAL ASSOCIATION WITH CxIITAIN GEOLOGIC PERIODS . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To a limited and unreliable extent , even in the most favorable cases : generally not at all . Formerly this association was thought to be very important , however . A famous and able geologist , Sir Roderick Murchison , as late as 1851 and 1859 , made the statement that the chief sources of gold were in Paleozoic rocks , particularly in the Lower Silurian , ? an opinion largely based on a fragmentary knowledge of Australian geology . Since then , in Australia , gold has been worked in Carboniferous , Devonian and Silurian rocks , and even in the Triassic and Jurassic ; in South Africa the gold is largely in Devonian strata . However , when we come to consider the world 's great mining regions , we observe that it is indeed the older strata which in many cases carry the ores . The older rocks have had more time than the younger ones and more opportunity to become the seat of ore-deposition ; they have also been , in most cases , deeply buried by the younger strata and so brought under such physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // centration ; under these conditions they have been pierced by intrusive rooks and subjected to all the accompanying processes of alteration and concentration . To what geologic period do metalliferous veins generally belong ? Metalliferous veins seemed to have formed at every period of the world 's history . As shown in the first chapter , they are the result of concentrating by agencies which have been active since the earliest age down to the present dry . The age of veins , as actually proven , is extremely various , ranging from the Archaean through the Paleozoic , Mesozoic and Tertiary . Passing over the cases of veins and other ore-bodies belonging to older periods , we may mention that , in America , the rich silver districts of Leadville and Aspen , Colorado , and Eureka , Nevada , are of Tertiary age . Moreover , in the Monte Cristo district , Washington , the present writer has reached the conclusion that the veins are chiefly Quaternary ( Pleistocene ) . At Steamboat Springs , in Nevada , the actually escaping waters have deposited silica along the fissures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mercury , in some quantity , and traces of gold . Similar phenomena have been noted in other places . Example : Workable deposits of cinnabar and stibnite ( sulphides of mercury and antimony ) at Monte Amianta and other places in Tuscany , Italy , have formed subsequent to early Pleistocene volcanic eruptions ( andesite and trachyte ) . The cinnabar is found in the volcanic rock as well as the associated sediments , and has formed by // preference in limestone beds . The stibnite is closely connected with the cinnabar , and is associated with arsenic sulphide ( realgar ) , pyrite and limonite , and sulphur . Most of the ore-deposits are intimately connected with sulphur springs or emanations of sulphuretted hydrogen , which are accompanied by incrustations of sulphur , and silicious sinter which sometimes contains cinnabar. * In opened mines and in placers it has been found that surface waters still precipitate all sorts of metals , even gold , from solution . Example : The formation of lead and zinc sulphides is now taking place in the Missouri mines . An instance may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shales , became filled with water and was left so for ten or twelve years . In 1898 , when it was re-opened , the surface of the shales , on the roof and sides of the tunnels , was found to be thickly encrusted with minute crystals of blende . In places , the blende was deposited on the pickmarks made when the tunnel was run.jCan any statement be made concerning the most favorable geological age for ore-deposition ? The ore-deposits of earlier ages have been exposed , along with the containing rocks , to destruction by erosion ; and , even where the containing rocks have not been removed , circulating waters have very often attacked the ores and transformed them wholly or partly into secondary or subsequent deposits . On the other hand , ores of comparaARRANGEMENT // Lively recent date , such as those of the Tertiary , will , in mountain regions , have undergone only the right degree of erosion for laying them open to the eye of man . So it is possible that the younger ore-deposits will be found to preponderate over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That is to say , ? other things being equal , important oredeposits are rather more likely to occur in rocks belonging to the older geologic ages than in the younger ones ; and their date of formation is more apt to belong to the younger geologic ages than to the older ones . What is in general the age of primary bedded deposits ? In river beds and on sea-beaches , gold-placers , tinplacers , etc. , are today being formed , as they have been in past ages . Most of the world 's productive placers are Quaternary , for these are easily found and have not been destroyed by erosion , as is the case with many of the older surface deposits . Yet in California , British Columbia , and Australia , Tertiary gravels , especially when protected by overflows of lava , have afforded immense wealth . Similar deposits exist in various older formations . Some authorities consider the Witwatersrand gold-bearing conglomerates , which occur amid a Devonian formation , as beach placers of that period ; and placers of Cambrian and even pre-Cambrian age have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iron , manganese , gypsum , etc. , are being chemically precipitated in bed form in the bottoms of lakes , seas and oceans ; and this process is known to have been active during the past ages . // Is it true that different geologic ages have no special characteristics as regards mineral deposits ? It seems to be the case that in the different geologic ages the general conditions varied more or less uniformly ; and in some of these ages the conditions for forming certain mineral deposits were better than in others . Are coal and oil deposits confined to certain geologic periods ? At certain periods of the earth 's history vegetation flourished very rankly and swamps were very abundant , enabling the preservation of accumulated layers of vegetable matter , which thus became a part of the strata of that period , and , by consolidation and metamorphism. have turned into lignite , soft or hard coal . The Carboniferous period was favorable to this process , and much coal was formed then . It was thought , indeed , at one time , that coal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has been found in quantity in other formations . In Virginia , there is good coal in Triassic strata . In the Western United States , great quantities of coal are found in the Cretaceous , and on the Western coast , especially in Alaska , it is abundant in the Tertiary . In Alaska we can see at the present day the first process of coal formation in the great areas of swamp-peat , which is often many feet thick , and shows the closest resemblance in habit to the late Tertiary lignites of the same region . When these peatswamps shall have been covered up by later strata , and consolidated and changed by pressure , they will become coal-beds. // Thus we see that we can not confine the formation of coal-beds to any one geologic period . Yet we may still regard the Carboniferous rocks as especially likely to contain such deposits , while we should hardly expect to find good coal-seams in the Cambrian and Silurian . These favorable conditions , during a certain period , were not world wide . At one place was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carboniferous , over eastern North America , there was much land , lagoons and flourishing vegetation ; in the western United States there was generally deep sea . So in the eastern area we . find coal plentifully in the Carboniferous , especially in certain beds , which can sometimes be traced for hundreds of miles ; while in the western area the Carboniferous was not especially a coal-bearing period . Conversely , in the Rocky Mountain region the Cretaceous is the great coal-bearing horizon ; but this is not the case in the eastern United States . Oil is another mineral for which the conditions of formation have been more favorable in certain periods than in others . Abundance of organic life during these periods seems to have been the favoring circumstance , for the organic matter has by its decomposition formed the oil . Are there minerals other than coal and oil which were deposited more abundantly in certain periods ? In some periods , more than in others , there appear to have been large areas of shallow evaporating seas , from which certain mineral substances were precipitated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new , Permian strata ( the // youngest part of the Carboniferous age ) contain , in many places , deposits of salt , gypsum , etc . Is a knowledge of fossils ? of value in identifying the same orebearing stratum in different districts ? Besides the identification of an ore-bed by its physical characteristics , it is frequently possible to recognize it by means of its contained fossils . The fossils are the only safe evidence of identity in age , when the districts to be compared lie someo distance apart . Beds having the same physical appearance may , and do , occur in many ages , while perhaps only in one did there exist the finer conditions which were favorable to the production of deposits of valuable minerals . Example : Dr. Le Neve Foster relates that a French inspector of mines . M. Meugy , hearing of the discovery of phosphate of lime in a certain part of the Cretaceous in England , and knowing from fossil evidence that beds of the same age existed iii France , concluded that the French beds might also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by prospecting . PREFERENTIAL Assoc LATION WITH CERTAIN KINDS OF SEDIMENTARY ROCKS . Are certain kinds of minerals preferentially associated with certain kinds of sedimentary rocks ? Certain kinds of rocks are sometimes preferred by certain minerals for deposition ; but there is no regular rule . The association may be either primary or secondary . // CONTEMPORANEOUS DEPOSITION OF ORES AND STRATA . In what cases is such association primary ? In coarse sediments which are evidently shallow water or shore-formations , such as coarse impure sandstones , conglomerates and clays , mixed with vegetable material and plant remains , we may suspect coal or oil , or natural gas . Example : The petroleum-bearing strata of all periods and of all parts of the world show , according to Dr. Rudolf Zuber , * a remarkable resemblance in their formation and composition . Everywhere they are bituminous clayshales , and variegated , mostly bright-colored , clays , interstratified with sandstones and conglomerates . Limestones , which may also occur in such series , contain tarry materials , but rarely true petroleum . There is a surprising resemblance between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil-bearing formation , with oil-bearing formations in the Jurassic of Germany , and in the Eocene of Galicia . The oil-bearing strata of the Upper Triassic in the western part of the Argentine Republic are like the middle Tertiary ( Oligocene ) oil-bearing rocks of the Carpathian Mountains ; the green oil-bearing shales , lying between the Jurassic and the Cretaceous , in the northern part of the Argentine Republic , can not be distinguished from the Galician Eocene strata . The oil-bearing strata at Baku in the Caucasus are identical in appearance with the Carpathian Oligocene shales and sandstones. // Deposits of salt , gypsum , etc. , may be looked for especially in connection with red sandstones . This association has been explained by the fact that when sea-water evaporates , the first precipitate is oxide of iron ( which gives the red color to the rocks ) ; this is followed by gypsum and then by salt . Can one admit such an association for metallic minerals ? It is as yet an open question as to whether copper may not also be admitted to the same association @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thin bed of bituminous shale lying between two thick deposits of Permian sandstone . The ore contains . besides copper , silver , lead , zinc , antimony , mercury , nickel and cobalt . This Kupferschiefer outcrops over a large district and frequently there is copper either in it or in the other beds of the Permian . At St. Avoid and Wallerfangen , ( also in Germany ) , copper ores which occur iii Triassic sandstone , have been supposed to be contemporaneous with the enclosing rock . In Utah , in the Silver Reef district , red and gray Triassic sandstones and shales contain bedded copper-silver deposits . In the Nacimiento mountains in New Mexico copper ores occur in Triassic sandstones , associated with plant remains . Similar deposits , although without the organic remains , have been described by Prof. W. P. Blake as occurring in Arizona . Prof. James F. Kemp gives many examples of copper ores in Triassic and Permian sandstones . " Copper ores , " he says , " arc very common throughout the estuary Triassic rocks of the // Atlantic coast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are three separate copper-bearing zones , forming three lines of outcrop that extend in a general northeasterly direction over a range of about three counties . May not these bedded deposits of metallic minerals have been introduced into the beds subsequent to their deposition ? Some observers have reasoned that the above deposits were deposited contemporaneously with the other strata ; while others , finding evidence of the concentration of the ores especially along fault-planes and other water-channels , have believed that the metals were introduced from extraneous sources through these channels , and are only in bed form because the layers of organic material served to precipitate the metals in the ascending waters . The present writer believes that the theory of original precipitation contemporaneously with the strata has strong features to recommend it , even though he regards a later concentration by circulating waters as proven in many cases . If these bedded deposits are even in part original , where did the metals come from , and how were they precipitated ? Organic matter is known to be a powerful precipitant of metals from solution . Metals are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Phillips , t the waters of the Mediterranean contain one centigram of copper to the cubic meter . The same writer remarks that the " black and usually very sulphurous matter deposited in basins // where sea-water has been left to itself constantly contains copper , and the same is generally true with regard to the dark-colored gypseous muds of all ages . " Luther Wagoner* found that mud from San Francisco Bay contained gold and silver ; and that samples rich in organic matter contained more than at other places . He concluded that organic matter in mud reduces some silver from the seawater , and probably some gold . Example : In the Sierra Oscura , New Mexico , are red sandstones and shales of probably Permian age . Some of these red sandstone beds contain copper for an extent of a number of miles . In a certain portion of the region there are at least three distinct copper-bearing sandstones , in which the ore is chalcocite and copper carbonate , disseminated in minute grains . No dikes or igneous rocks of any kind have been found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not occupy lines of faulting ; and , indeed , were certainly formed before the main faults of the district . The mode of occurrence of the ore in regular beds , in part replacing plant remains , suggests that the copper was deposited from the waters which deposited the enclosing sediments.f How can one explain the hypothesis that certain geologic periods were more favorable for this process than others ? It may well be that during periods like the Permian and Triassic , where the presence of great land-locked evaporating shallow seas is shown by beds of gypsum , salt , etc. , with impure red sandstones , the precipitation of metals in // the muds was greater than at other timnes . In the first place , the evaporation of the sea-water would concentrate the metals , along with the other substances in solution ; in the second place , the shore-line conditions would furnish beds rich in organic matter , for the reduction and precipitation of these metals . SELECTION OF FAVORABLE STRATA FOR THE SUBSEQUENT DEPOSITION OF ORES . Subsequent bedded deposits , where the minerals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequently a preference for one kind of rock . Do sandstones especially attract the precipitation of ores ? Porous sandstones afford channels for waters , and many tiny cavities which may be filled with precipitated minerals ; hence they are often selected for ore-deposition in preference to adjoining strata . Do schists especially attract the deposition of ores ? Schists are often selected for impregnation with valuable minerals for the same reasons as sandstones ; moreover , shales , slates and schists containing organic matter often act as precipitants to ore-bearing solutions , and hence become the seat of ore-deposition in preference to other beds . Example : A small basin of coal-shales , near Belleville , Jasper county , Missouri , carries beautifully preserved fossil plants . The outer surface of the mass of shales , for a // depth of about a foot , contains scattered crystals of blende , with some galena and pyrite . The central portion does not carry any mineral , the mass having been mineralized from the outside , toward the interior , so far only as the mineralbearing waters could penetrate the dense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distorted otherwise perfect fossil plants , giving evidence that the deposition of the minerals was of later date than the embedding of the plant . remains. * How does a stratum impervious to water cause the precipitation of ores in bedded form ? A porous stratum may absorb the waters coming to it from transverse fissures or other channels , may spread these waters out , make their circulation sluggish , and so induce the precipitation of ores . An impermeable stratum , such as a b d of s ale , may refuse all passage to solutions , and compel them t slacken and spread out on its upper or under side ( according to whet er the waters are ascending ( r descendin ) , and likewise bring about precipitation . Example : In a series of interbedded sandstones and shales at Rico , Colorado , occurs a bed relatively impervious to water the so-called " blanket " ( Fig. 4 ) . In the case of t e Enterprise mine . the blanke seems to have been formed from the fine residue left from the dissolution of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collapse of the overlying beds , as the gypsum disappeared . The rocks have been seamed by nearly vertical fissures , and mineralizing solutions rising along these have been // checked by the blanket , and have deposited their ores in it , on its under side . The ore-deposits , therefore , have a constant relation to this particular bed , but the association is a subsequent one , the ores having been introduced after the deposition of the sediments . Why may ores be deposited in a rigid stratum in preference to soft strata ? A certain stratum may , on account of its rigidity , be favorable to the formation of open fractures , which cease in neighboring soft beds . Hence veins formed along such fractures may be confined chiefly to the more rigid strata . Why is it that subsequent ore-deposits frequently show a preference for limestones over associated rocks ? Limestone lends itself readily to the process of cavitymaking by the dissolving action of waters , more than any other rock , and these cavities are sometimes filled up by minerals . Yet true cave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be . At Eureka , in // Nevada , rich ores occur in caves , but it seems that the caves have been formed by the shrinkage of ore-bodies , attendant upon their alteration . Limestone is easily replaced by metallic minerals , and for this reason is frequently chosen above other rocks , by circulating waters , as a locus for the precipitation of the metals they carry . Silver-lead deposits , especially , prefer limestone . Iron deposits also frequently choose this rock . Example : The superior suitability of limestones over other rocks for replacement deposits , particularly of lead , is shown in the case of the Derbyshire lead mines in England . In this district there occur , in limestone , intrusive sheets of igneous rock . Fractures traverse both limestone and intrusive rock , and these fractures , together with the joints and the bedding planes of the limestones , have evidently furnished the channels along which the ore-bearing solutions have circulated . The galena which constitutes the ore , however , has been deposited only in the limestone , and in the intrusive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) How may the chemical peculiarities of certain strata induce the precipitation of ores in them ? Besides the chemical suitability of limestone for replaceARRANGEMENT // meat , and the precipitating action of beds containing organic matter , other peculiarities of certain stratified rocks may induce ore-deposition . In shale beds there is always a considerable percentage of iron . This usually combines with sulphur contained in organic matter to form sulphide of iron ( pyrite ) . Pyrite has been shown by experiment to be active in causing other metallic minerals , especially gold , to precipitate . Example : At Ballarat , in Australia , there are certain thin beds of slate containing pyrite . These are called " indicators , " * for , whenever the auriferous quartz veins of the district intersect them , the veins become uniformly rich , even though in the remainder of their course they will not repay working . The recognition and tracing out of these indicator beds , therefore , becomes , perhaps , the most important geologic work for mining men in these districts . Even when the beds have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traversing lodes is the same . In sum , then , what sedimentary rocks are most likely to become the site of ore-deposition from circulating waters ? Among the stratified rocks , now one , now another , may by its peculiarities induce its selection in preference to adjoining strata , as a site of ore-deposition . The problem admits of no empirical solution , but in each individual case a comparison of the physical and chemical features of each bed present may aid in deciding which is most favorable , // and in discovering the main mineral belt . Shale beds containing organic matter ( especially if the beds be limy and so easily adapted to the process of replacement ) offer perhaps the most favorable situation for ores . Next in order comes limestones , while conglomerates are in general not so favorable . Quartzites are the least favorable of all , although even here ore-bodies are not infrequent . CHAPTER III . THE STUDY OF IGNEOUS ROCKS AS APPLIED TO MINING . PHYSICAh CHARACTERS OF IGNEOUS ROCKS . What is an igneous rock ? A rock is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has cooled from a molten condition . How can one tell if a rock is igneous or not ? An igneous rock bears marks indicating its origin , just as the stratified and sedimentary rocks do . In the first place , since igneous rocks were not deposited in successive layers in water , there is no true stratification . Do igneous rocks never have a banded structure ? In the case of lavas , when one flow after the other is poured out , the accumulated rocks will be definitely layered , for between each flow there may be fragmental broken material . Each flow also may , perhaps , differ slightly in texture and composition from the earlier and the later flows , and within itself the top and bottom will generally be finer grained than the center , on account of having // cooled more quickly . When an igneous rock flows in a viscous , only incompletely molten condition , as it frequently does , it may be drawn out into long bands differing more or less from one another in structure , texture and composition . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many feet in thickness . This structure is flow-banding . Does the crystalline structure afford a test for igneous rocks ? The structure of the igneous rock , when closely examined , is the best test of its origin . In the first place , it is usually crystalline . On hardening from a molten or otherwise fluid condition solid substances tend to assume the beautiful and often highly complicated geometric forms which are peculiar to them . In the molten state all the elements are intimately mingled as consolidation commences they begin to group themselves together according to their affinities , and to form certain combinations which we call minerals , each having a crystal form mathematically distinct from that of unlike minerals . Are all igneous rocks thus made up of crystalline minerals ? If the consolidation is extremely sudden , this crystallization has not time to take place ( at least we can not detect it , even with a microscope ) , or is shown only by beautiful groupings of the rock materials , with no definite separation into minerals . The rock , thus quickly hardened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Obsidian cliff , in the Yellowstone National Park , rises in nearly vertical walls for 150 or 200 feet . It // has been formed as a surface flow , and is a natural glass , the result of rapid cooling of a fused mass of rhyolitic lava . This glass covers an area of about 10 square miles. * Is this glassy condition of igneous rocks usual ? Nearly always the cooling is slow enough , even in the case of lavas suddenly poured out , to allow at least the beginning of crystallization . If the period of cooling is relatively short , the crystals will be small in size , sometimes only perceptible with a microscope ; if it is slower , the crystals grow till they are very easily visible to the naked eye . How does one study an igneous rack , to distinguish it from sedimentary and metamorphic ones ? When one observes such a rock , he observes its compact texture ( one crystal fitting into another without loss of space ) ; he notes the straight sharp geometric outlines of some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intergrowths with neighboring crystals ) , in distinction to the rounded or broken outlines of the grains of the sedimentary rock . He observes , also , that in general the more prominent crystals do not have any common direction of elongation ; that is , they are not parallel with one another , as are usually the crystals of metamorphic rocks , but lie in all possible positions . Can one always readily distinguish igneous rocks by this test ? There are exceptions to this rule , and in the field the ? // observer will meet difficult cases . In some hardened rocks where the individual grains are not visible to the naked eye , it may be hard to decide as to the origin , without a microscope . There are , also , cases of igneous rocks where there is a general parallelism of the crystals , though never on so complete a scale as in metamorphic rocks . In the cases referred to , the crystals , originally not parallel , have been so arranged by flowage . THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF IGNEOUS ROCKS . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in various ways , according to various classifications . All these classifications are more or less artificial , and each worker must select the one which serves his purpose best . Various features have served as main distinctions ? chemical composition , mineral composition , form , structure , geologic age , mode of occurrence , locality , etc . For one purpose a chemical classification may be best , for another a classification as to mode of occurrence , etc . The commonly accepted classification is based partly on mineral composition , partly on chemical composition , and partly on structure . How are the different kinds of igneous rocks studied and identified ? Since the adaptation of the microscope to petrographic work , the science has been revolutionized ; and now all the real study is done with that instrument . As a result of the detailed investigation thus made possible , the distinctions // have in many cases been finely drawn , and the number of rock names has rapidly multiplied . Is it an easy thing to name an igneous rock correctly in the field ? Petrologists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , without resource to their microscope . To take lava-rocks , for example , one can not always decide without the microscope between many varieties of rhyolite , phonolite , trachyte and andesite . The same is true of the dike rocks , which have received a great number of special names , now falling into disuse . In coarse-grained rocks , the petrologist can be more certain , yet it sometimes becomes difficult in the field to distinguish certain kinds of granites , syenites and diorites from one another , and to decide between some diorites and diabases . CLASSIFICATION OF IGNEOUS ROCKS FOR MINING MEN . To what extent is it possible and necessary for the miner to classify igneous rocks ? When such is the case , it is plain that the fine distinctions of rock species are beyond the mining engineer and the miner . Luckily , such distinctions , even could he make them , would be of slight use to him . But broad demarcations are necessary , and may be made upon physical characteristics , without the microscope and chemical analysis , and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is such a practical classification based ? The classification the writer offers for this purpose is based on : ( 1 ) Structure . ( 2 ) Mineralogical composition . Rocks are first divided into granular , coarse porphyritic , fine porphyritic , and glassy forms . What is meant by a granular igneous rock ? The term granular is applied to a fairly even texture , the constituent minerals being of nearly uniform size , and generally interlocking . 1TThat is meant by a porphyritic igneous rock ? porphyritic rocks do not have their constituent minerals of uniform size . There is a fine grained portion , which may be dense and show no crystals to the naked eye , or may sometimes be non-crystalline , like glass . This is the groundmass . Through it are sprinkled crystals of larger size , generally with perfect geometric outline , and often separated from one another . so as to be completely surrounded by the groundmass . These are porphyritic crystals or phenocrysts , and the rock possesses porphyritic structure . In the coarse porphyritic structure , the groundmass is crystalline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the naked eye , or by the aid of a hand-lens , and the porphyritic crystals are correspondingly large . In the fine , porphyritic structure , the groundmass is fine , the individual grains being difficultly or not at all discernible to the naked eye ; or it may be glassy . // What is mem:t by a glassy igneous rock ? Glassy rocks have no or few porphyritic crystals ; neither do they show any grains , even under the microscope ? they are smooth and homogeneous , like glass . What is the relative abundance of these different kinds of rock ? Granular rocks , coarse porphyritic and fine porphyritic rocks are common ; wholly glassy rocks are relatively rare , and are found chiefly among the outpourings of volcanoes . CLASSIFICATION OF IGNEOUS ROCKS . A. GRANULAR ROCKS . Relatively coarse ; crystals of constituent minerals easily visible to the naked eye , and all of about the same size . 1 . Granitic Rocks . Color gray , reddish or greenish . Relatively light in color and weight . Quartz abundant , while dark minerals ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small portion of the rock . Mica apt to be more abundant than in other granular rocks . Forms of mineral grains in general short and blunt . Chief constituent minerals , quartz , feldspar , mica , hornblende. 2 . Montle Rocks . Of medium dark color and medium weight ; mottled , generally green , rocks . Quartz scarce or absent ; dark minerals ( especially hornblende ) fairly abundant . Mica may be present , but is generally less in amount than other dark minerals . Pyroxene may occur . Grains of individual minerals have a tendency to elongated forms , though they may be short . Constituent minerals , feldspar , hornblende , mica. 3 . Diabasic Rocks . Very dark and heavy , green of // various shades , often black . No quartz , and very large proportion of dark minerals . Mica almost always absent . Pyroxene is usually very abundant , and there is often olivine and hornblende . Magnetite in small grains ( usually invisible to the naked eye ) is nearly always present . Crystal forms generally elongated . Chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peridotitic Rocks . Color , very dark green or black , darker and heavier than any of the foregoing . Are distinguished by the absence of feldspar . Often contain considerable quantities of the metallic minerals ( such as magnetite , pyrrhotite , ilmenite , etc. ) in small grains . Chief constituent minerals , olivine , pyroxene , and hornblende . Any one of these , or any two , may in some cases ' be entirely lacking , leaving the rock composed essentially of two of the above-named minerals , or even one . B COARSE PORPHYRITIC ROCKS . Are spotted with well-formed crystals of the common rock-forming minerals , quartz , feldspar , mica , hornblende , pyroxene , etc. , which are contained in a groundmass composed of interlocking crystals of markedly smaller size than the porphyritic crystals . 1 . Granitic Porphyry . Combines the coarse porphyritic structure with the same physical and mineralogical characters as the granitic rocks , as defined above . Chief constituent minerals , quartz , feldspar , mica , hornblende. 2 . Dioritic Porphyry . Combines the coarse porphyritic structure with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as described above . Chief constituent minerals , feldspar , hornblende , mica. 3 . Diabasic Porphyry . Combines the coarse porphyritic structure with the same physical and mineralogical characters as diabasic rocks , as described above . Chief constituent minerals , feldspar , pyroxene , olivine. // C. FINE PORPHYRITIC RocKs . Like the coarse porphyritic rocks , but the groundmass is finer , so that the individual crystalline grains in it are barely or not at all visible to the naked eye . 1 . Rhyolitic Rocks . These are chemically and mineralogically the same as the granitic rocks and the granitic porphyry rocks , but differ in having the fine porphyritic structure . Rhyolitic rocks are generally of light color ( white , light gray , pink , red , etc. ) and of relatively light weight . As porphyritic crystals they generally show quartz , hexagonal in cross-section , and frequently short , blunt feldspar . Crystals of dark mica are usual , and often also hornblende ; but the amount of dark minerals is relatively small . The groundmass is generally rather rough to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earthenware ; the individual grains in it are usually not distinguishable . Chief constituent minerals , quartz , feldspar , mica , hornblende. 2 . Andesitic Rocks . These are chemically and mineralogically the same as the dioritic rocks and the dioritic porphyry rocks , but differ in having the fine porphyritic structure . In color the andesitic rocks are dark gray , medium brown , dark red , etc . They are of medium weight . Quartz is usually not found as porphyritic crystals , and mica is not as common as in rhyolitic rocks . The porphyritic crystals are most apt to be feldspar and hornblende , often pyroxene . Dark minerals in general are rather abundant . Groundmass generally slightly coarser than with the rhyolitic rocks ; the individual grains , though they may be tiny , are often visible either to the naked eye or through a hand-lens . Chief constituent minerals , feldspar , hornblende , pyroxene , mica. 3 . Basaltic Rocks . These are chemically and mineralogically the same as the diabasic rocks , and the diabasic // porphyry rocks , but differ from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crystals are generally few , and do not differ so markedly in size from the groundmass crystals as in the rhyolitic rocks and the andesitic rocks . The groundmass is generally coarser than in the andesitic and rhyolitic rocks ; the individual grains in it , though fine , can often be seen by the naked eye . If they can not , there are very likely no porphyritic crystals to be seen . Basalts contain as a rule no quartz or mica . They are usually black in color and heavy . Where minerals can be distinguished in them , , they are usually pyroxene , feldspar , or olivine . Chief constituent minerals , feldspar , pyroxene , olivine . ADDITIONAL DEFINITIONS . Does this classification embrace all the rock names necessary to a miner ? In the writer 's opinion , this is about as far as one who is not a petrologist can safely go . There are , however , other rock names frequently used by miners , on which observations will be made . What is quartz porphyry ? This is familiar to mining men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other mining regions . The name , formerly in good use by geologists , is being dropped for granite porphyry or rhyolite porphyry , the former for the coarse grained , the latter for the finer grained varieties . The description of granite porphyry is that of quartz porphyry. // What is syenite ? This is a favorite term with miners . A syenite is a granite without quartz . Like granite , it has a light color and relatively light weight , contains relatively small amounts of the dark-colored minerals , and is apt to contain mica , It is not always easy to distinguish syenit. - from diorite in hand specimens . Syenites are comparatively rare rocks . What is trachyte ? Trachyte was formerly a much-used term with geologists . In the Great Basin of Nevada , for example , enormous quantities of volcanic rocks were classified as trachyte . Now microscopic study has shown them to be mainly andesites , and that none of them are trachytes . Trachyte is still a popular term with miners , but now we know it to be a comparatively rare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as rhyolite does to granite ; it has the chemical and mineralogical composition of syenite , but with the fine porphyritic structure . It is , therefore , a rhyolite without quartz . What is phonolite ? Since this rock occurs in connection with the famous gold ores of Cripple Creek , in Colorado , it has become well known in the mining world . It is often difficult to identify phonolite without microscopical or chemical tests . Phonolite contains , besides feldspar , nepheline , leucite , or both , and pyroxene , sometimes hornblende . The colors are // usually gray or green . Phonolites are also relatively rare rocks . It is popularly supposed that the metallic ring emitted by fragments of some volcanic rocks is a test for phonolite ; but this is an antiquated idea . i hyolites and other rocks frequently give this ring . What is amygdaloid ? Amygdaloid is a terns applied to lavas which are cellular , that is , are full of little holes or amygdules , which were filled by steam at the time of consolidation . In the Lake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ native copper , and so become ores and of considerable interest to the miner . What is dolerite ? Dolerite is a term that has been used , sometimes instead of diabase , sometimes instead of basalt . What is gabbro ? The term gabbro is applied to certain granular rocks consisting chiefly of feldspar and pyroxene . It thus falls within the group of diabasic rocks , in the foregoing classification . What is felsite ? Felsite is a general term applied to certain light-colored , very fine-grained igneous rocks , chiefly altered rhyolites . Strictly speaking , felsite is hardly an accurate term , and most rocks so called may be proved to be rhyolite or // rhyolite porphyry . In felsites the porphyritic crystals are small and few , or have become inconspicuous on account of decomposition , and so are not visible to the naked eye . The term is an allowable one , and , on account of its broad definition , not difficult of application . Example : Study of the felsites of Carodoc , Wales , show microscopic structures which had been altered almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ originally partly rhyolites and partly sedimentary beds derived from the erosion of rhyolites ( rhyolite tuffs ) . * What is greenstone ? Greenstone is a general name applied to certain igneous rocks , generally rather fine-grained , of a general dark green color . The term is used by geologists , especially when no more accurate definition is possible in the field . The greenstones are usually old rocks geologically , and the green color is the result of thorough alteration . They are diabases or diorites , sometimes old andesites and basalts . The term is admissible and of easy application . Example : In northeastern Minnesota , on the eastern part of the Mesabi iron range , are rocks which have been called greenstones because of their general dark greenish color . They are crystalline rocks composed usually of hornblende and feldspar . Mineralogically , the rocks are diorites , but they have been recrystallized from other rocks , some of which were certainly diabases and andesites and some probably diorites or gabbros. // What is pegmatite or giant granite ? Pegmatite or giant granite is a name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grain is exceedingly coarse , individual crystals being frequently several inches across . What is serpentine rock ? This is a rock consisting partly or wholly of the darkgreen , greasy-feeling mineral serpentine . It is a metamorphic or altered rock , and in many cases is derived from igneous , chiefly peridotitie rocks . The decomposition of the olivine and pyroxene of peridotites usually affords serpentine . What is trap ? Trap is an old general name for dense , dark-colored dike rocks . The term is still in use . A trap dike , more accurately considered , may be made up of andesite , basalt , diorite or diabase , etc . What is breeds ? * Breccia is an Italian word , applied to crushed and broken , yet still consolidated rock . A breccia resembles a conglomerate in being composed of coarse fragments packed together ; but in the former the pieces are sharp and angular , in the latter rounded by water action , indicating their origin . It is generally easy to recognize a breccia , but sometimes it is difficult , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a rock , as along the vicinity of // a fault , a breccia is developed , called a friction breccia . Lava , on the other hand , is often shattered by explosion attending its eruption or by being forced into renewed movement when partially hardened . The result is a volcanic breccia . What is pumice ? " Pumice is a glassy lava , which at the time of hardening was so full of steam-filled cavities that it now has a spongy structure , and is so light that it often floats : it is a sort of lava froth . TRANSITIONS BETWEEN DIFFERENT KINDS OF IGNEOUS ROCKS . Are the divisions of igneous rocks , as given , sharply divided from one another in point of mineralogical composition ? Igneous rocks form a connected series , with gradual transitions from one of the artificial divisions above outlined to the other . This is the case in any classification . No matter how many divisions are made , some rocks will be found occupying the border lines . So it is very possible , for example , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which closer study would show to be a diabase . The suffix " ic , " as diorit-ic , in the foregoing scheme , expresses a provisional determination , and saves one from the charge of making hasty and faulty decisions . Are the different igneous rocks separated sharply in point of texture ? In point of texture there are all transitions between // granitic rocks , granitic porphyry rocks , and rhyolitic rocks ; also between dioritic rocks , dioritic porphyry rocks and andesitic rocks ; and , again , between diabasic rocks , diabasic porphyry rocks and basaltic rocks ; in short , between granular rocks , coarse porphyritic rocks , and fine porphyritic rocks . How did these different textures originate ? The difference in general seems to depend on the rapidity with which the rock cooled , those which cooled more slowly having had more time to crystallize , and hence producing larger crystals and coarser rock texture . The rapidity of cooling depends in large part on proximity to the surface . Those which cool at the surface chill quickly ; while those that harden deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long time . Therefore it is that the lavas or surface rocks are almost wholly of fine porphyritic structure . Small masses of molten rock thrust into older harder rocks and there cooling ( dikes ) , generally have the coarse porphyritic structure , though often the fine porphyritic . Large masses of rock cooling at a distance from the earth 's surface have generally the granular structure . Cases may occur where a rock mass may be fine porphyritic on the edges , where it cooled quickly , coarse porphyritic further in , and granular in the center , but in general rocks are more or less homogeneous . Are the different igneous rocks sharply separated in point of composition ? Similarly , a single rock mass may vary in composition , so // that , for example , it is a diabase on the borders and a diorite in the center ; yet usually the different types of rock are distinct in the field . Example . The exceptional occurrence of different rocktypes as part of a single dike is shown at a locality in Michigan , near Crystal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , four feet wide , which cuts a mass of gabbro . Near the center of the dike the rock is a granite , containing biotite , while the sides consist of diorite without any quartz . The two rocks are supposed to have separated one from another while the mass was in a molten state. * FORMS OF IGNEOUS ROCKS . In what different forms do masses of igneous rocks occur ? The forms in which igneous rocks occur may be outlined thus : 1 . Fundamental . 2 . Intrusive ( Masses , dikes , sills or sheets. ) 3 . Extmusive . ( Lavas . ) What are the fundamental igneous rocks and what is their origin ? The fundamental igneous rocks underlie the oldest stratified rocks . They are mostly Archaean granites and form the floor on which the first recognizable sediments were laid down . Many of them may be metamorphosed and crystallized early sediments . GEOLOGY APPLIED TO MINING . What are intrusive rocks ? In the molten rocks , which exist below or within the crust of the earth , important movements and migrations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steam which it contains and by other causes , and so forces its way into and through the hard rocks nearer the surface . It enters these rocks along the line of least resistance ? along fissures , fault-planes , joints , crushed zones , or bedding planes . What is an intrusive mass ? The molten rock may come up in large volume , thrusting aside or absorbing the rocks it enters ( the intruded rock ) , and thus forming a mass of irregular shape . What is a dike of igneous rock ? Where the molten rock ascends along fissures or other similar channels , it will form a zone , or a body with very slight thickness as compared with its extent in other directions . In form , a dike has the same characters as a vein . Its boundaries are generally straight planes , and it may dip away from the horizontal at all possible angles . A dike may be an inch or a mile across , but it is usually vastly longer than it is thick . ( Fig. 6 . ) From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dikes which run out into the surrounding formations . What are sheets or sills of intrusive rock ? In a sedimentary rock , when the dikes run along the bedding planes , and so are parallel , or nearly so , to the // stratification , they are called sheets or sills . A sheet or sill may be thick or thin ; there sometimes may be many of them , alternating with beds of sedimentary rock . How is it that we find fundamental and intrusive igneous rocks at the earth 's surface ? Although fundamental and intrusive rocks were originally far below the surface , yet by the long process of erosion the overlying mass has been stripped off and these rocks are exposed to the light of day . That is why we now find them at the surface as often as we do those which were poured out of volcanoes . What are extrusive rocks or lavas ? Extrusive rocks are those which reach the surface by means of the conduits above mentioned , and overflow either from volcanoes , as explosive eruptions , with ashes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or fissures . Beneath the surface are dikes which have been the feeders , and the same lava may have spread out along the bedding planes of the stratified rocks as sheets or sills . Example : Examples of the pouring out of lavas from volcanoes , with attendant showers of ash , pumice , etc. , are too well known to require specific mention . An instance of the quiet welling out of a great mass of lava along fissures is furnished by the Columbia river basalt , which covers a great arid plain in Idaho , Oregon and Washington . This lava consists of a series of flows from 20 to 150 feet thick , piled one on top of another . The dikes which were the feeders to the flows are now in part exposed in Oregon , by the erosion of the overlying rock ; // and the lack of any ash or fragmental material , or volcanic cones , shows that the eruption was quiet. * In Idaho a total thickness of as much as 5,000 feet of this basalt is shown by the Snake River @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eruption of the lava there was in this region a varied topography , but the mountain ranges , deep valleys , and canons were all blotted out by the swiftly succeeding flows , until only the very highest peaks still show their heads.t GENERAL RELATION BETWEEN IGNEOUS ROCKS AND ORE-DEPOSITS . Is there any relation between igneous rocks and ore-deposits ? There is the very closest connection . Probably nine out of ten ore-deposits have some visible relation to a body of igneous rocks . In general , also , a country free from igneous rocks has a scarcity of ore-deposits . What is the reason for this relation ? The reasons for this are , in part at least , known . All igneous rocks contain metals . Iron , for example , is present in every igneous rock in large amount ? the percentage of the whole rock being in some diabases and basalts 15 or 20 per cent. , or even more . Manganese , also , is present in most igneous rocks in noticeable quantities . When we come to the rarer metals , we naturally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have proved the presence cf // such metals as copper , lead , zinc , nickel , tin , etc. , in nearly every kind of igneous rock . These metals usually occur as constituents of the dark-colored silicates ( hornblende , pyroxene , dark mica , olivine , etc . ) Even the rarest , such as silver , platinum and gold , are similarly found , though in small quantities . Do metals occur in igneous rocks except as constituents of the dark-colored silicates ? The commoner metals occur in igneous rocks in the same form that they do in ore-deposits ? in the form of sulphides and oxides . This has been proved in the case of iron pyrite , the magnetic sulphide of iron ( pyrrhotite ) , the magnetic oxide of iron ( magnetite ) , the magnetic oxide of iron with titanium ( ilmenite or titanic iron ) , the oxide of iron and chromium ( chromite ) , etc . Example : In the diabase rocks of the Grass Valley district , California. , there are small , very abundant grains of pyrite , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and feldspar of the rocks in such a way as to prove that the metallic minerals are of primary origin ( that is , that they have crystallized out of the cooling molten rock , and have not been introduced subsequent to its consolidation ) , and indeed were the first of the rock-forming minerals to solidify . ( Fig. 7 . ) Do not the sedimentary rocks also contain disseminated metals ? Chemical investigation seems to bear out the statement that as 4 rule the sedimentary rocks , although they also // contain small quantities of the metals , yet are relatively poorer in these than the igneous rocks . Example : Mr. Luther Wagoner* has made a series of delicate determinations of gold and silver in certain igneous and sedimentary rocks of California . Four specimens of granite showed respectively the following weights in milligrams per ton : gold , 104 , 137 , 115 , 1130 ; silver , 7660 , 1220 ; 940 ; 5590 . One specimen of syenite contained gold , 720 ; silver , 15,430 . A specimen of diabase contained gold , 76 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold , 26 ; silver , 547 . The sedimentary rocks tested were three specimens of sandstone and two of marble ( one of the latter from Italy ) . The sandstones gave respectively in gold , 39 , 24 , and 21 ; in // silver , 540 , 450 , 320 . The California marble showed gold , 5 ; silver , 212 ; the Italian sample , gold , 8.63 ; silver , 201 . Several assays in San Francisco Bay mud ( containing some organic material ) gave gold , from 45 to 125 . Two assays of sea-water gave a mean gold 11.1 ; silver , 169.5 milligrams per ton . On the average , therefore , the granite contained 371 milligrams gold and 3852 silver ; while , as before stated , the syenite contained 720 gold and 15,430 silver ; the diabase 76 gold and 7440 silver ; and the basalt 26 gold and 547 silver . Taking the sedimentary rocks , the sandstones averaged 28 gold and 437 silver ; the marble , 7 gold and 206 silver ; and the bay mud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find a mean of gold 330 and silver 5547 , while the mean of the sedimentary rocks ( sandstones and marbles ) is 17 gold and 344 silver . That is to say , the mean of the igneous rocks assayed contains about 19 times as much gold and 16 times as much silver as the mean of the sedimentary rocks . Are disseminated metals equally abundant in different kinds of sedimentary rocks ? In regard to the sedimentary rocks , it will be noticed that the sandstones in these tests contained on an average four times as much gold , and over twice as much silver as the marbles ; while the bay mud ( which in hardening would become shale ) contained nearly 13 times as much as the marble . Are disseminated metals equally abundant in different kinds of igneous rocks ? As regards the igneous rocks , if we take the silicious or acid rocks ( granite and syenite ) thus examined and compare 141 // their mean with that given of the basic rocks ( diabase and basalt ) , we find that the silicious rocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a half times as much silver as the basic ones . It remains to be seen whether further data would confirm these results . What bearing has the presence of disseminated metals in igneous rocks on the question of the relation between igneous rocks and ore-deposits ? The metals disseminated in igneous rocks often become concentrated by various agencies . Is there no other reason for this relation ? There is another reason , and one perhaps as important , why ore-deposits are so closely connected with igneous rocks . These rocks retain their heat a long time before cooling . In the case of rocks that cool beneath the earth 's surface , it is safe to day that they keep their heat for centuries of centuries . So all circulating waters passing through them become heated , and the hot water having less specific gravity than cold water ( water expands on heating ) has a tendency to rise , and to appear at the surface as hot springs . This hot water has a power of solution ? and hence a power of concentrating the disseminated metals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) into ore-deposits ? many times greater than cold waters . There are three phenomena frequently found to be connected : igneous rocks , hot springs and ore-deposits . Often , however , we find districts where the igneous rocks have // long ago cooled , even far beneath the surface , and where there are ancient ore-deposits , but no longer hot springs . Is the presence of hot springs favorable to the finding of ore-deposits ? The presence of hot springs in a country is favorable to ore-deposits ; but their absence can not be taken as a sign that such deposits do not exist . plot springs are most likely to occur in regions of younger eruptive rocks , ( Ter tiary , for example ) , where the under rocks are still hot ; and not so often in the older and perfectly chilled rocks . How are the disseminated ores of igneous rocks concentrated , before or during cooling ? * While the rock is still partially molten and fluid , the different elements have some power of moving about , and it is usually held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they tend to group themselves and form bodies more or less concentrated . How is the process of magmatic segregation supposed to effect the concentration of basic materials ? During the earlier period of cooling , the metallic sulphides and oxides , which are among the first minerals to crystallize , and are especially abundant in basict rocks , may collect . In some igneous rocks rich in iron , the iron becomes espe cially abundant in places and even may be sufficiently // concentrated to form an ore , though always retaining its character of an original constituent . In Greenland , masses of native iron have been found in basalt . Magnet-ite , the magnetic oxide of iron , is sometimes sufficiently abundant to form ore-bodies in this way . Such is the case , for example , in Sweden , in Rhode Island , in the Lake Superior region , in Canada and elsewhere . Example : The titaniferous iron ores ( magnetites ) of the Adirondack Mountains in New York are associated in all cases with basic igneous rocks , which have been intruded into older gneisses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rock ( generally gabbro ) to ore usually takes place gradually , but within a short space . There is no ore along contacts , nor any evidence of the formation of the ore after the consolidation of the rock . The basic rock itself has been split up by segregation of its essential minerals , so that some portions are almost entirely of feldspar , while other portions contain large amounts of pyroxene ( making a gabbro ) . It is plain that the mag-netite which forms the ores has been segregated , like the feldspar and pyroxene , while the rock was in a partially molten state ; and it is possible that the high specific grav-ity of the iron may have been influential in bringing about this result. * Are there other ore-deposits , besides those of iron , which are thus known to be original , and due to magmatic segregation of basic materials in igneous rocks ? The mixture of oxide of chromium and oxide of iron // ( chromite ) is frequently found in tiny crystals in the igneous rocks , and may be so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It may even form solid masses , crowding out the other rock-forming minerals . Many of the known chrome ore-deposits have been held to belong to this class . Corundum , the oxide of aluminum , used chiefly as an abrasive ( the pure varieties are precious stones ? sapphire and ruby ) , has , in a number of cases , been found to be an original constituent in igneous rocks , not only in small quantities , but in those accumulations which are mined as ores . Nickel is found in fresh igneous rocks as part of a number of minerals . Pyrrhotite , which is a magnetic sulphide of iron , very commonly contains nickel , and is one of the principal ores ; it is a not uncommon rock-forming mineral . Large masses of nickelifeious pyrrhotite have been explained by good authorities as original constituents of igneous rocks ; but others have questioned these conclusions . How does the process of magmatic segregation effect the concentration of siliceous materials ? During the final stages of consolidation , heated waters , steam and gases ( containing silica , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are left over from the cooling mass , deposit their solid portions in the form of pegmatite or quartz , as nests or veins in the hardening rock or in some neighboring formation . It is held by some that certain of the quartz veins having this origin contain sufIGNEOUS // ficient gold to render them ores ; but this conclusion is not yet universally accepted . Do the residual silicious solutions always form pegmatites and quartz veins ? The residual silicious solutions , instead of forming definite veins , may penetrate the rock with which the cooling igneous mass is in contact , and there may deposit their solid portions , usually by replacement of the original rock . When the resulting altered rock contains ores , it is called a contact metamorphic deposit . What are the characteristics of contact metamorphic deposits ? The first mark identifying this class of deposits is their location at the contact of an intrusive igneous rock with another rock , or in evident close relation to it . But this is not sufficient , for other deposits may in some cases be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this the easiest channel . In the true contact metamorphic deposit , mineralization has been accomplished by materials pressed out of cooling rock . These materials consist of heated waters and aqueous gas , mingled with other gases of various kinds , and both the escaping waters and the gases may carry in solution metallic and other minerals , which they may deposit near the contact , in concentrated form . Under these conditions certain minerals are characteristically formed which are rare in simple hydatogenic* deposits . Such are minerals like fluorite , I ( H IS0L ( d Al ' 1I.IIi ) TO 11 . I1AG. tourmaline and topaz , containing the volatile elements boron and fluorine . Garnet is also a rather characteristic mineral of these deposits . According to W. Lindgren , * a characteristic feature is the association of oxides of iron with sulphides.t Example : The ores at the old Tungsten mine , Trumbull , Connecticut , have been formed at the contact of an igneous rock ( now metamorphosed to hornblende gneiss ) and a limestone into which the igneous rock was intrusive . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in beds from 3 to 5 feet thick . It consists of quartz containing iron pyrites , epidote , calcite , mica , and the wolfram minerals ( scheelite and wolframite ) for which the mine has been worked . Zoisite , garnet , scapolite , hornblende , and marcasite , are also found . This ore-bearing contact zone was due to the action of solutions at the contact of the intruded igneous rock , these solutions being both heated andunder pressure. $ Associated veins are of pegmatite or vein quartz , and contain , besides feldspar , muscovite and other common minerals , topaz in large masses , fluorite , etc . H/hat are some of the special results of vapors and gases in the residual material under discussion , as regards deepseated deposits ? The deposits formed by the material expelled from cooling igneous rock probably vary according to the nature and the // relative abundance of the gases . Pegmatites usually show , from the presence of certain minerals containing well-known gases in their composition , the presence and agency of those gases in their formation . Tin-veins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earthy , are probably often formed largely by the action of abundant gases , escaping from cooling granular rocks , deep below the surface . What characteristic evidence as to their origin do veins of this class offer ? The characteristic sign of the origin of these veins is the presence of minerals which do not easily form under simple aqueous conditions , but are commonly produced by the action of vapors . Among these minerals are tin-stone ( cassiterite , oxide of tin ) itself , and others like tourmaline , topaz , etc . Many apatite ( phosphate of lime , with fluorine or chlorine ) deposits also probably belong to this class , as the presence of the volatile elements ( chlorine and fluorine ) in the mineral itself indicates . One of the commonest minerals found in association with the apatite , that is , scapolite , bears the same evidence , for the scapolites are minerals whose composition is practically the same as the feldspars , save for the presence of chlorine , indicating the agency of this gas at the time of formation . Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rocks at or near the surface ? At the surface , orifices emitting vapors and gases from cooling volcanic rocks are termed fumaroles . From these // gases valuable earthy and metallic minerals may be deposited . This fumarolic activity may persist for ages . Alunite or natural alum ( sulphate of aluminum and potash ) , for example , is formed in commercially valuable quantities by the action of sulphurous gases on igneous rocks containing potash and aluminum . Sulphur , deposited in this way , is actively exploited in Italy and elsewhere . On the walls of fissures in lava , where steam and other gases escape , various metallic minerals have been found which are due to this action , such as specular iron ( hematite , oxide of iron ) , cinnabar ( sulphide of mercury ) , realgar ( sulphide of arsenic ) , etc . Other ores very likely are sometimes formed in this way . Example : The Bassick mine is in Custer county , Colorado . The rock of the region is gneiss , but an explosive volcano has broken through , producing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chiefly of volcanic rock . In places these boulders are coated with rich metallic minerals . The first coat consists of lead , antimony , and zinc sulphides ; an intermediate coat is of zinc sulphide , rich in silver and gold ; other coats are of chalcopyrite ( sulphide of copper and iron ) , and pyrite ( sulphide of iron ) . Tellurides of the precious metals also occur . These ores are very generally considered by geologists to have been brought up in the form of vapor during the fumarolic activity of the volcano . // SPECIAL RELATIONS BETWEEN CERTAIN IGNEOUS ROCKS AND ORE-DEPOSITS . ADVANTAGES OF DIFFERENT FORMS OF IGNEOUS ROCKS . What especial phases do the processes attendant upon cooling show in fundamental igneous rocks ? Fundamental rocks are generally of coarse grain , showing slow consolidation . Since they have cooled in many cases at great depth , gases and vapors attending this process may have formed characteristic ore-deposits . Tin-veins , for example , are , as noted , generally confined to such rocks , of granitic composition . What advantages or disadvantages do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ springs are allied occurrences ; yet , unless the flows of these rocks are very thick , they are too near the surface for hot-spring action to exercise its best effort in producing mineralization ; for the heat of the rocks disappears with comparative rapidity , and with it the great concentrating power of the waters . Where the flows are very thick , however , the central portions remain warm for a very long time , and the hot-spring action is prolonged and becomes more productive of results . Fumarolic activity , properly speaking , and fumarolic deposits are confined to extrusive rocks ; while contact metamorphic deposits are lacking . // What advantages have intrusive rocks over others in bringing about ore-deposition ? Intrusive rocks are the most favorable for promoting the formation of ores . Like all igneous rocks , they contain disseminated metals . On account of their being distant from the surface , they cool with comparative slowness , especially if they are in bodies of considerable size ; and thus the conditions for ore concentration are prolonged . Intrusions come in contact with other igneous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are better fitted than the sedimentaries for instigating the processes of ore-deposition and for furnishing the disseminated metals to the mineralizing waters , yet the latter are more suitable for precipitating the dissolved metals . This is due to the easy dissolution and replacement of the limestones , to the tiny pores of the sandstones , which permits interstitial deposition , and to the organic matter of the shales , which often acts as a direct precipitant . Hence , where the two classes of igneous and sedimentary rocks are intimately associated , the most favorable conditions are realized . ADVANTAGES OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF IGNEOUS ROCKS . Preferences of Certain Igneous Rocks for Certain Ores , Displayed During the Cooling Processes . Are the dark basic rocks more closely associated with oredeposits than the light siliceous ores ? It has been found by chemists who have investigated the metallic contents of fresh igneous rocks that the metals // were mostly present iri the dark " ferro-magnesian " min erals ? hornblende , pyroxene , black mica , olivine , etc . This being the case , we might expect ore-deposits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than with the silicious ones . But this is only partly the case ; the preference seems to depend chiefly on the kind of metal . Are some metals preferentially associated with light-colored and silicious rocks ? Tin is usually found in , or in relation with , granite ; and a general close connection with silicious rocks seems the case with tungsten and molybdenum . Example : In the Malay Peninsula tin deposits are found , mainly on the western slope of the mountain range that forms the backbone of the peninsula . This range is com posed largely of granitic rocks , with some limestone and sandstone . The ore is cassiterite , associated with tourma line , hornblende , tungsten minerals , magnetite , muscovite , topaz , fluorite , sapphire , etc . Veins are found generally in the granite , less frequently in the other rocks. * Are some metals associated by preference with dark-colored and basic rocks ? Chromium ore-deposits ( chromite ) , for example , are hardly found save in very basic rocks ? peridotites . When these peridotitic rocks decompose , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quently occurring in serpentine rock . Iron ( generally magnetic , often containing titanium ) also // forms ore-deposits in many basic rocks . As these rocks are , by their very definition , richer in iron than the silicious ones , iron deposits in general may be allowed to exhibit a certain preference for them . Copper usually prefers basic rocks ; on the other hand , there are many instances of rich copper deposits in silicious rocks . Example : In Cuba , serpentine is abundant among the most ancient rocks . The serpentine is of igneous origin , being derived from the alteration of dark , basic , igneous rocks ( such as peridotite ) . This rock is and has been considered the most productive of metals among the formations of the island . It contains large deposits of copper , ores of iron and chromium , and gold. * Platinum was formerly only found in placers . In Russia , however , some years ago , the metal was found as an original constituent in peridotitic rocks , and late inquiry in America has fixed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kemp has reported platinum in peridotite from the Tulameen region , British Columbia . It was also reported from " fine-grained dark basaltic rock " in British Columbia in 1895 by Mr. Carmichael , l- assayer for British Columbia . It seems , therefore , to be chiefly confined to the basic rocks , and it is , indeed , an intimate associate of chromite . Yet it has been found to occur , though less abundantly , even in so silicious a rock as syenite. // Most of the other minerals have , as far as known , slight or no preference for certain igneous rocks . Preferences of Certain Igneous Rocks for Certain Ores , Displayed by Selective Precipitation of Metals from Solution . May ores show a preference for one igneous rock over another , on account of the different effect of different rocks in precipitating ores from solution ? When ore-bearing solutions traverse a variety of igneous rocks , there will be certain chemical reactions between the so utions and the walls of the fracture which has afforded them a channel . Where the rock is porous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traverse it thoroughly and slowly , there the opportunity for such reactions is very great . In igneous rocks of different mineralogical and chemical composition , the same solutions will react in different ways , and the substances precipitated from solution as a result of these reactions will be apt to differ , both in quantity and quality . The result will be variable , and will depend as much on the specific character of the solutions ( which vary greatly ) as on the character of the rock . Thus it may happen that an ore-bearing solution will form a rich deposit in one igneous rock and in another , along the same fracture , very little . Moreover , on account of the different character of solutions , a certain rock may in one case be selected by preference for ore-deposition , and in another case may be specially avoided . // Example : At Butte , Montana , two granites of different ages occur , one of which is ten per cent . more silicious than the other . The less silicious granite contains a considerable amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . An important class of copper ores here have formed by replacement of the igneous rocks . The fractures , along which circulated the solutions that deposited the ore , cut both rocks . In the less silicious granite , the veins are commonly rich in copper ; in the more silicious granite they are almost equally wide and strong , but are lean , and composed chiefly of quartz , with comparatively little pyrite and copper . Microscopic study of the rocks show that in the process of replacement the hornblende was the first mineral to be altered to ore , indicating that the nature of the solutions were such as to react most readily with this mineral . It is believed that the presence of the hornblende and other dark minerals in the less silicious granite , and their absence in the more silicious rock , determined the preferential precipitation of the ores in the former. * ( Fig. 8. ) // ORE-BODIES IN THE ROLE OF INTRUSIVE ROCKS . Are metallic minerals ever thrust up in a molten condition in the form of dikes , requiring no further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain metallic minerals may become segregated in molten masses so as to form oredeposits . If these metallic segregations , instead of remain ing where they originate , are disturbed by some movement , and forced up into the rock above while still wholly or partly fluid , it is conceivable that we should have dikes of ore . The occurrence of iron ore ( magnetite ) in this form has actually been reported . Example : On Calamity brook , near lake Sanford , in the Adirondack Mountains , are dikes of titaniferous magnetite in anorthosite ( a granular rock composed almost wholly of labradorite , a species of feldspar ) . The ore in the hand specimen appears to be an exceedingly ferriferous gabbro , and it contains inclusions of anorthosite , through which run little dikes of pyroxene , garnet , and ore that end in streaks of pyrites . The anorthosite inclusions are believed to be masses of the country rock which were torn off during the intrusion of the ore and about and through w1 ich gaseous action developed the little dikes , and streaks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the microscope , show coarsely crystalline aggregates of ilmenite or titaniferous magnetite , pyroxene , and a little biotite . Regarded as ores , they vary in richness , being sometimes nearly pure magnetite , and again more than half silicates. * // IGNEOUS ROCKS INTRUSIVE SUBSEQUENT TO ORE-DEPOSITION . May not intrusive igneous rocks sometimes form later than an ore-body , and so , though closely associated with it , yet have no part in its formation ? Just as faults may be earlier than ore-deposition in a certain case , and may furnish the channels along which the ore is concentrated , or may be later than ore-deposition , may cut and displace the ore-body , and , far from being a help in the ore-concentration , may be only a hindrance and vexation to the miner ? just so an intrusive igneous rock may be earlier than ore-deposition and be largely responsible for it , or may be later and cut it up and separate it . Where two igneous rocks are intruded at various times // in the same place , the ore-deposit resulting from the influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Example : The hematite and magnetite iron ores of Santiago province , Cuba , * have , since their formation , been cut , floated up , and surrounded by intrusive masses of porphyry , so as to entirely alter their form ( Fig. 9 ) . CHAPTER IV . THE STUDY OF DYNAMIC AND STRUCTURAL GEOLOGY AS APPLIED TO MINING . PART I. GENERAL CONCEPTIONS AND MAPPING . DEFINITIONS . What is dynamic geology and structural geology ? Dynamic geology is a study of the physical forces which produce changes in the earth 's crust . These forces ( due to the contraction of the earth from cooling , to migrations of molten rock beneath the solid crust , or to the unequal weight of different features of the surface , bringing about unstable equilibrium ) produce bending and breaking in the rocks . Such disturbance is mainly noticeable in the stratified rocks , the beds of which are forced out of their original horizontal position into all manner of folds ; or they arc even broken , with one part thrust past the other along the line of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study of the arrangement or structure of these bent and broken rocks is called structural geology . // FOLDS AND FAULTS . What is the meaning of the term dip ? The inclination of a bed ( or other geological feature having a plane direction ) is the dip , which is measured in degrees from the horizontal . Should we use the word hade instead of dip , in speaking of veins ? The inclination of veins , dikes , faults , etc. , is also called hade , and is measured in degrees from the vertical . There is , however , no need to have two opposing terms for any one thing , and it is better to apply the term dip to the inclination of the veins , faults , etc. , as well as strata , and to measure it in the same way . What are the principal kinds of folds ? Folds are chiefly divided into two kinds , according to whether they are open above or below . These are called respectively synclines and anticlines . A line drawn from the apex of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lowest point of a syncline ) , midway between the two sides or limbs of a fold lies in the axis ( Fig. 10 ) . If the axis is vertical , the two sides ( or limbs ) have the same dip ; if the axis is inclined the clips of the limbs will be unequal , unless they are parallel , as when the folding is intense and they have been jammed together , forming a compressed or close fold . ( Fig. 11 ) . 122 GEOLOGY APPLIED TO MINING . The opposite of a close fold is an open fold ( Fig. 10 ) . What are overthrown folds ? In open folds the limbs normally dip in opposite direc-tions ; yet the folds may be such that the limbs incline in the same direction , though not necessarily at the same angle . This constitutes an overthrown fold ( Fig. 12 ) . In extreme cases the axis may assume a horizontal position . // What is a monocline ? Where strata suddenly change from a horizontal to an inclined position and then become horizontal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monocline-is formed ( Fig. 13 ) . What is a normal fault and what is a reversed fault ? Most fault planes have an inclination or dip between the horizontal and vertical . When the rocks on the upper side have moved down , relative to the rock on the under side , the fault is called normal . If the reverse movement has taken place , the fault is called a reversed or thrust fault . // The majority of faults are normal ; but reversed faults are frequent ( Figs. 14 and 15 ) . What are compensating faults ? Where a stratum or vein is faulted in many places it sometimes happens that one fault will displace the bed , and another will bring it hack to its original position . The two faults are thus compensating . In other words , the block comprised between the t ? o faults has been moved out of line , leaving the rest iii place . // Example : The accompanying figure represents compensating faults in the Omaha mine , Grass Valley , California . These faults displace a vein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and iron pyrite , and other sulphides , with some free gold ( Fig. 16 ) . * What connection have faults with folds ? A monocline may easily pass into a fault . Faults along the axes of folds are also comniou , for along the axes rocks are weakened by bending and therefore liable to break . The directions of faults are likely to conincide with those of folds in the same region , for they both may originate as a result of the same kind of pressure . // EFFECTS OF EROSION ON FOLDED AND FAULTED ROChS . What is erosion ? Erosion may be defined as the process of wearing away . As applied to geology , it signifies the wearing away of the rocks at the surface , chiefly by the action of streams . Are folds and faults visible as such at the surface ? Deformation ( as folding and faulting taken together may be called ) would affect the earth 's surface precisely as it does the rocks , were it not for the counteracting effects of erosion . Erosion is a slow process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also a slow process ? rarely spasmodic . It goes on beneath our feet today so gently that we do not notice it except where there is a slip in the gentle mechanism and an earthquake results . Sometimes deformation is more rapid in moulding the earth 's surface than is erosion ; sometimes erosion is the more active . But after deformation has stopped , owing to the easing of the deforming pressure , erosion still keeps on , so in the end it mostly has its own way and shapes the minor features of the earth to suit itself . Therefore , folds and faults are sometimes , but not usually , directly expressed as such at the surface . What are the effects of erosion and deformation in producing topographic features ? Erosion and deformation are usually in opposition ; the latter lifts up mountains while the former is engaged in // wearing them down . Both forces , even if each were left to itself , tend to produce irregularities ? ridges and furrows ? in the earth 's surface . Simple deformation makes upfolds ( anticlines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are valleys . In the work of erosion rivers cut deep trenches which are valleys , and the high parts left be-tween are the mountains . The first named are mountains and valleys of deformation ; the second , mountains and valleys of erosion . Example : The Uinta range , in Utah , as shown in the accompanying figure ( Fig. l7 ) , is an anticlinal range , the upfold in the strata corresponding with the topographic dome . The great thickness of stratified rocks between the dotted line on the figure and the present mountain tops ( a thickness greater than the height of the mountains above the plains ) has been stripped off by erosion . Still , if the // present relief of the range is directly due to the upfolding of the crust , as geologists have held , this is a range of deformation . Are mountains of erosion upfolds of the crust ? Mountains of erosion are not necessarily upfolds . Upfolds tend to weaken the rocks so that they are more easily washed away , leaving valleys , with synclinal mountains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together ; and they may trend diagonally or at right angles to the trend of the folds . In general , what relation has topography to folds ? As the result of these inharmonious processes , we may expect to find the relief or topography bearing any conceivable relation to the structure . In a hilly or mountainous region the structure is sometimes suggested by the topography , but more frequently the topography only obscures its elucidation . It even frequently happens that a highly folded region may have become by long erosion topographically a plain . What is the relation between topography and faults ? As with folds , so with faults . Faults break the earth 's surface and the moving of one rock past the other produces a cliff or scarp ( simple fault-scarp ) . Only recent faults show this ( Fig. 18 ) . The erosion which attacks a faulted surface may do one of several things , dependent on the different nature of the rocks on either side of the fault brought together by the // movement . There may result a scarp ( erosion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or the fault may not influence at all the outlines of the topography . An erosion fault-scarp is produced when the rock on one side of the fault is softer , and so more easily worn away , than on the other . If the rock on the upthrown side of the fault is harder than that on the downthrown side , the scarp will // face the downthrown side , that is , it will simulate a simple fault-scarp . This may be called a normal erosion faultsearp . But if the rock on the downthrown side is harder , it will eventually become higher by the wearing away of the upthrown side , and the scarp will face this latter side . This is a reversed erosion fault-scarp ( Fig. 19 ) . Since therefore we can not tell beforehand what relation the rock structure will have to the topography , how are we to work out the structure problems ? Structure can be satisfactorily worked out only by reasoning from the attitude and position of the rocks as they appear at the surface or outcrop . THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surface ? When we start out to study the geology of a district , we find here one rock and there another ; here a bed with a certain inclination , there another bed inclining with a different angle in another direction ; then soil and forests without outcrops , valley bottoms free from hard rock , etc . The underground rocks do not outcrop continuously save in high mountainous regions . IVhy do not rocks outcrop cont nuousl y ? Exposed rocks break up at the surface , under the influence of heat and cold , frost and thaw , rain and wind , the roots of trees and plants , and the decomposing acids , chiefly derived from vegetation , which soak down into the rocks and attack them . The result is that such rocks crumble // into sand and clay . Vegetation takes root , flourishes and dies , and new generations of plants arise ; thus a top loam is formed , by the accumulation of vegetable remains . This loose decomposed material , or soil , is often found in place , directly over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on account of its looseness , it usually moves downhill , into the valleys , and out towards the sea , in a steady but very leisurely journey . Thus steep mountain tops become stripped and expose only fresh rock , while their lower slopes are covered thickly with coarse fragments , and the valleys below are deeply filled with soil ( wash or drift ) . Farther down the valleys , towards the sea , tli 's wash is apt to cover larger and larger areas of solid rock ( bed-rock ) until at last it rests in the sea and there builds up a new series of sediments . Besides the rocks that go to pieces slowly and thoroughly , a great deal is broken up more suddenly and violently by rapid mountain streams . Are glaciers active in making soil and gravel ? Thousands of years ago , there existed a great continental glacier , ( like that which now covers much of Greenland so deeply that we do not know where the land leaves off beneath it and the sea commences ) over most of British North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States . Its southern limit extended on the east into New Jersey , while on the extreme west it hardly got below the present northern boundary of the United States . In the mountains of some of our Western States such as Washington and Oregon , we still have local glaDYNAMIC // tiers , occupying valleys , broad mountain sides or coasta ' slopes . Alaska contains many such glaciers , some of which cover thousands of square miles . Glaciers are powerful rock crushers and erosive agents , and in their slow imperceptible forward flow they leave the material , which they have crushed and mingled , either beneath them or along their margins . Therefore the region of the old continental glaciers ( the glaciated area ) is generally thickly covered by broken and mixed rock and soil ( glacial drift ) from which the bed-rock peeps out only in places ( Fig. 20 ) . Does this covering of soil and gravel make the unravelling of the structure difficult ? On the high mountains , where the rock is all exposed , it is possible for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless it is complicated ; but in a country where outcrops are not abundant it is difficult to read even simple structure . THE SYSTEMATIC WORKING OUT OF GEOLOGIC STRUCTURE . STRIKE AND DIp . How shall one start to work out the structure of folded and faulted rocks ? To work out the structure of a region , one must first learn to take the strike and dip of stratified rocks , for these rocks furnish the best key to the disturbances which the crust has undergone since their deposition . We know that they were // laid down horizontally : hence , when we find them tilted at a certain angle , we know that the crust at this point has been deformed to this extent . How does one record strike and dip ? The dip has already been defined as the inclination of a bed , measured in degrees , from the horizontal . The strike is the direction of the outcropping edge of an inclined bed , on a horizontal surface ( such as it would be on a flat plain ) and is generally recorded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fig. 21 ) . The writer prefers referring all readings so far as convenient , to the north point , ? thus , N. 10 ? E. , N. 90 ? E. , N. 75 ? W. , etc . The direction of the dip is invariably at right angles to the strike , but the inclination may be to one side or the other of the line of strike . Hence , in recording the dip , it is only necessary to note the general direction ( the exact direction being known from the strike ) and the angle of inclination . Thus , strike N. 60 ? E. , dip 25 ? N. W. ; or strike N. 35 ? W. , dip 6 ? S. W. // How accurately should strike and dip be read ? It is generally useless to read the strife and dip closer than a degree ; for the attitude of a bed generally varies constantly , though often slightly , so that greater accuracy in one place will not help in the broader problems . How should the strike be read ? For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for reading the dip ) , is sufficient . To read the strike , get the line of sight of the compass ( the line between the sights , or the straight edge of a square compass ) parallel to a line made by a horizontal plane cutting the surface of a bed , and read the angle between this and the north point of the compass needle . Thus , if this line is 30 ? to the right of the north point of the needle , ( the observer facing in a northerly direction ) , its direction is N. 30 ? E. magnetic . The reading may be corrected subsequently so as to read to the true north , by applying the known magnetic variation . The angle of this variation is to be added to the angle read , or subtracted from it , according to whether the variation in the region under examination is to the east or to the west of the true north . For example , in Maine at a place where the variation ( declination ) is 18 ? W. ( that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of true north ) a magnetic strike reading N. 30 ? E. would be corrected by subtracting the variation , to N. 12 ? E. true ; in Oregon , at a pace where the variation is 20 ? E. , the same magnetic reading ( N. 30 ? E. would be corrected , by adding the variation , to N. 50 ? E. true . // How should the dip be read ? To read the dip there is , in the clinometer compass , a little weight which hangs down and so is vertical . One side of the square compass being held parallel to the dip of the rock , the number of degrees of this dip from the horizontal ( or froin the vertical , if one pleases ) is registered on a scale across which the weight swings . There are other clinometer arrangements , but for ordinary geological work this simple one is as good as any . A graduated scale of degrees pasted on the cover of a notebook , with a small coin at the end of a thread , as weight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the book being held parallel with the dip in measuring . How can one best find the horizontal lineF In measuring strike and dip , it is best to judge with the eye the general horizontal direction and greatest inclination of an outcrop , and to hold the compass in the hand , away from the outcrop , as near these average directions as possible . The strike and dip usually vary much locally . Sometimes it is easiest to scratch a horizontal line on the exposed face of a bed , to get the true strike . One may remember that the dip is always the greatest inclination of a bed . RECORDING OBSERVATIONS ON JIAPS . What is necessary for the continuance of the work ? The next necessary thing is to have some sort of map . If there is none on the proper scale , a small-scaled reap may be enlarged , and corrected as one works . Where there // is none at all , a sketch map will have to serve . For such a sketch map , directions are easily found with a compass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pedometer ; by an odometer attached to a carriage , or a cyclometer on a bicycle . Elevations can be taken with an aneroid barometer . For accurate work , an accurate map is necessary . Such a map is most easily made with a plane-table , a method by which the surveying and the plotting go on simultaneously . The principal points are determined by triangulation , the elevations by means of vertical angles read with a transit , ( or alidade of a plane-table ) from the chief stations , and the minor points sketched and re-sketched from the different stations until they are approximately correct . For still more accurate work the position and elevation of nearly all the points are determined by stadia work . In these last two ways are made the beautiful contoured maps of the United States Geological Survey . Levelling may also be used for determining elevations . A contoured map , or at least one where the chief elevations are definitely recorded , is essential to any but the rudest of geological work , for it enables the student afterward to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as exhibited on a plane map , ? a projection of the real surface on a horizontal plane ? can hardly be understood . What does the student record on this map ? Upon this base-map the student should record every outcrop which he judges necessary . In a complicated country or where outcrops are few , often every rock 1 ; 8 GL'or.oGY 1PPLTED TO ATTNTNG. exposed is necessary . But where there are many outcrops of the same strike and dip and of the same kind of rock , or where the structure is simple , many may be omitted . The outcrops which are recorded may generally be located on the map ( especially a detailed map ) by locating the topography of the place in question i. e. , if the outcrop occurs on top of a hill , and the top of that hill is shown on the map , one can place the outcrop as closely as necessary . Where there are few landmarks , it is often necessary to locate outcrops instrumentally , by means of intersection from two known points , or by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the result being plotted on the map according to the scale used . How are strike and dip recorded ? For recording the strike and dip , the following sign is commonly used , the long line being the strike , and the arrow , with the angle written close to it , recording the direction and inclination of the dip ( Fig. 22 ) . How should the different rocks be plotted ? The kind of rock may be written on the map , but it is better to use an arbitrary sign for each rock , or , better still , a color . A box of colored pencils may be used for this , and each color may be taken to represent one of the Important rocks of the district in question . For example , blue can be used for limestone , brown for quartzite , red for granite , and so on . // When all the data are thus plotted , does it help our comprehension of the structure ? When all available outcrops have been recorded , the general distribution of each color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In this way it often can be predicted , frequently with great accuracy , what rocks underlie the coverings of soil and glacial drift or valley wash , where there are no outcrops . By extending the line of strike in different outcrops of the same formation till they come together , the extension of beds under covering materials can be made out with especial certainty . If there is great and uniform disconnection along a certain line , between the strikes of such outcrops thus extended , then the geologist knows that this line is a fault-Ene , though it may not be visible to the eye ( on account of covering material ) ; and even the amount of discordance , or displacement of the fault , can often be closely calculated . MIGRATION OF , OUTCROPS . Do the lines of outcrop of veins , faults , etc. , on the surface , always give an accurate idea of their direction ? One must cultivate some geometrical perception to grasp the true attitude of beds , dikes , faults , etc. , from the puzzling lines of outcrops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is irregular . The surface is a very uneven plane , which cuts these beds , dikes and faults at all angles , and since they themselves lie at all angles , the intersections may be infinitely varied . A bed or fault having a straight strike may have an outcrop
