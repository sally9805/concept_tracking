 |p0152  UNTIL quite recent years the criminal law has undergone no essential change during many ages . Penal statutes and codes , from time immemorial , have consisted of definitions of prohibited acts and have prescribed in each case a definite penalty . As the crimes and misdemeanors so defined differ in gravity , the aim of the codes has always been to so adjust the punishment to the estimated enormity of the offense that the graver the crime the heavier shall be the punishment . To preserve this equilibrium in the apportionment of punishment to offense has always been the underlying principle in the development of the criminal law . Exact retribution has been accepted as the ideal of justice and is the basis on which has rested the entire penal system for the treatment of crime . The attempt to realize this ideal has been far from successful . The widest variance has resulted in gauging the relation of penalty to offense . Thus , for example , the highest penalty for the very common crime of larceny is imprisonment for two years in Louisiana and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five years in New Hampshire , imprisonment for life in Maine , death in Missouri , while in Delaware perjury is punishable only by a fine of $50o to $2,000 , without any imprisonment at all . The severest punishment for forgery is three years ' imprisonment in Delaware and imprisonment for life in New York . The average sentences for arson range from two years in Arkansas to seventeen and a half years in Rhode Island ; for burglary , from one year and six months in New Mexico to eight years and four months in Georgia ; for robbery , from one year and nine months in Delaware to twenty-two years in Alabama. * This diversity of penalties for the same offense extends through the entire catalogue of crimes ; it shows that the theory of retributive punishment is not a practicable theory , but is one that effects unequal and grossly unjust results and thus seriously weakens the moral force of the criminal law . The attempt to adjust the penalty for a defined crime to the guilt of the offender is not merely difficult ; it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of exact definition , and such definitions are essential in every penal code ; but the degree of guilt in the person committing the crime is not susceptible of definition or of human admeasurement . There are a thousand facts and circumstances , relating to the degree of provocation or temptation , the habits and natural temperament of the offender , the motives that controlled him , the environment of his past life , the extent of his intelligence , his inherited qualities , and countless individual incidents , every one of which goes to aggravate-or to palliate the guilt of that particular crime . The problem , from the very nature of the case , is insoluble ; it is beyond the compass of human intelligence . The absolute necessity of providing for the differences of individual cases demanded some elasticity in the retributive system . To prescribe a fixed and uniform penalty of eight years ' imprisonment for assault with intent to kill , for instance , applicable alike to every case coming within the definition of that crime , regardless of the provocation or lack of provocation attending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of justice . The device was long since adopted of softening the rigidity of a uniform sentence by enacting a minimum and a maximum term of imprisonment for each crime punishable by  |p1053  imprisonment ? " not more than ten nor less than five years , " " not more than one year , " " not more than three years and not less than six months . " Expressions like these are found in almost every penal statute . They are designed to cast upon the judge conducting the trial the duty of measuring the prisoner 's guilt and of pronouncing a just sentence , the duration of which , the law decrees , must lie within the limits named . This imposes upon the judge a cruel responsibility . He is required to form an estimate of guilt which involves a probing of the prisoner 's motives , character , training , temperament , opportunities ? that lie open to omniscience alone ? and that , too , on the most slender and inadequate data , for on a criminal trial these determinative facts and circumstances are not ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way ) the subject of judicial investigation . And so the most conscientious judge is compelled to make a haphazard guess , based upon the appearance and bearing of the prisoner and the scanty facts established by the testimony , and so pronounces sentence ? five years , or , it may be , twenty years . Besides this inherent difficulty of making bricks without straw , the commitment of the length of the sentence to the discretion of the judge introduces another personal equation into the case . The judge has a temperament as well as the prisoner . He may be constitutionally inclined to mercy , or , on the other hand , he may be habitually severe and even harsh in his judgments of men ; his sympathies may be easily moved , or he may have an irritable , moody , stern temper . A prisoner arraigned before one judge may receive a sentence of two years , when it is certain that if tried before another judge he would have been condemned for twenty years . All these inequalities and uncertainties effect injustice ; they cast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is the logical consequence of the retributive theory that when a convict has duly served his sentence he is said to have atoned for his offense ; so far as the State is concerned he is purged of his crime and is entitled to regain his freedom as if he had never violated the law . This right to a discharge is an absolute one and wholly irrespective of the convict 's character or purposes . It may be morally certain that he will immediately return to a life of crime ; he may even avow openly his plans and intention to do so ; still , the law has no provision for his further detention and , by the expiration of the term of his sentence , he becomes ipso facto a free man . This is practically the most dangerous feature of the retributive system . Discharged convicts now constitute by far the most hardened and desperate class of criminals ; they are the experts , the instigators , the skilled leaders in criminal enterprises . And whenever a crime of unusual enormity shocks the public , investigation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and executed by ex-convicts . Not less than ten thousand felon convicts are discharged from the prisons of the United States every year . By this vast army the retributive penal system is constantly replenishing the criminal class , renewing its strength , stimulating its energy and supplying it with experienced leaders . The defects in our penal system thus passed in review are the logical results of the retributive theory of punishment . Let the theory be subjected to a closer analysis : When a criminal is found guilty , why does the State condemn him ' . o imprisonment ? What justifies such imprisonment and what is the object to be attained by it ? The State confines a convicted criminal in prison , according to the theory of retributive punishment , in order to make him suffer ; the suffering is the penalty of his crime , and when it has been prolonged to a degree commensurate with his guilt the prisoner is held to have paid the penalty and to be purged of the crime . Justice is then said to be satisfied and the incident is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is held to have discharged its full duty when it has thus forced the prisoner to make atonement for his crime . This is a very narrow view of the relation of the State to crime , and a very false view of the ends of government by law . The State is justified in imprisoning a convict on precisely the same ground that it is justified in confining in an asylum a lunatic who is suffering from violent mania , or in forcibly placing  |p1054  in a hospital a smallpox patient who is at large . The reason for the enforced restraint in all such cases is the same ; it is not safe for the community that these persons should have their freedom . The motive properly governing the action of the State , the end to be attained , are in each case the same , namely : the protection of the public . Not retributive punishment , but public protection , is the legitimate aim and the sole end of government in the treatment of crime and of criminals . The acceptance of this substitution in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upheaval of its entire structure relating to penalties . The question is no longer one about penalties , whether the prisoner shall suffer , how much or how long he shall suffer , when and how he shall atone for his crime . The only practical question is , What method of treating the convict will best serve the protection and well-being of the community ? To sentence a burglar at the time of his conviction to imprisonment for the term of five years is as irrational as it would be to send the lunatic to an asylum for the pre-ordained time of five years , or the smallpox patient to a hospital for exactly three weeks . The lunatic and the person afflicted with contagious disease must be confined until they are cured ? until it is safe for the public that they be discharged . The same course is the only rational one to adopt for the criminal . To grant liberty to a convict without any reasonable ground of assurance that he will lead a law-abiding life is an act of suicidal folly ; it is itself a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The indeterminate sentence has been devised in recognition of the principle of public protection as opposed to that of retribution . By this sentence a person convicted of crime is sentenced to imprisonment ? not for any fixed or definite term ? but to imprisonment simply . The imprisonment is to continue until the prisoner shall have undergone such a change in his character , habits and purposes as to render it safe , in the judgment of a competent tribunal , to restore him to freedom . Of course , the indispensable concomitant of the indeterminate sentence is a reformatory system of prison treatment . Confinement in prison affords protection to the public only while it lasts . Effectual and permanent protection can be secured in but two ways : either the prisoner must never be restored to freedom , or else he must be so reformed that he can , with safety to the public , be set at liberty . The latter alternative is not only the more humane ; it is also the more economical , and on both grounds the protection and well-being of the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imprisonment , of the criminal . There is hardly any other branch of science in which such useful and demonstrable results have been accomplished within the last thirty years as have been achieved in the science that deals with the administration of prisons . It has been fairly demonstrated that a large percentage , much more than a majority , of all convicts can be so transfoi med , through prison discipline and training , that they can safely be intrusted with freedom and that they will abstain from crime and lead industrious and honest lives . What these reformative methods are in detail , how they are applied and how they effect their end constitute a most interesting study . It is possible within the limits of the present article only to refer to one feature of them which closely bears upon the indeterminate sentence : A cardinal principle of the reformative system is the individual treatment of prisoners . Every effort is made to gain and to record all available information regarding the past life of each prisoner . His life while in prison passes under close scrutiny , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Every convict is subjected to special treatment adapted to his capacity and having reference to his points of strength and of weakness ; in numberless ways he is subjected to tests , and his successes and his failures are carefully noted in his record . By these methods the inmost character and purposes of the prisoner become unfolded to the prison officers ; the system is so searching that shams and deceit are unavailing and are wellnigh impossible . Moral , industrial and educational agencies are constantly em/ ployed in the effort to develop in the prisoner habits of industry and thrift , principles of honesty , worthy aspirations and correct views of life . When it comes to the question of his fitness or unfitness for freedom the record of his life in the prison yields ample data upon which to found a judgment regarding his capacity , his power of self-control , the strength of his moral purposes ? in a word , regarding his intention and his ability to lead an honest life . The decision can safely be intrusted to a board , of experienced men acting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the judgment arrived at can be formed with as much confidence in its correctness as , for example , in the decision of a body of physicians that an insane patient has recovered his sanity . It is the vital principle of the indeterminate sentence that no convict should be discharged until he is fit for freedom . This principle is of inestimable value and is beneficent in the protection it gives not only to the public but to the convict himself . However degraded or desperate , the criminal is still a weak human being ; he needs restraint and uplifting influence from without ; if left to himself he is sure to sink deeper in degradation and vice until he accomplishes his destruction . The worst fate that can befall such a being is to be turned adrift to wallow in the mire . The indeterminate sentence reverses the attitude of the State toward the criminal . Under the retributive theory the State presents itself to the wrongdoer as an avenging fury , pursuing him in order to inflict suffering upon him and , when it has wreaked its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the future . This view of the State ? and is it not justified ? ? serves to embitter the criminal ; he regards society and all government embodied in the State as his worst enemy , to be defied and defeated . By the indeterminate sentence , on the other hand , the State presents itself to the criminal as a beneficent power , seeking his amelioration and aiming to rehabilitate him and restore him to manhood . In another way the indeterminate sentence is a most potent instrumentality toward the reformation of the convict : Under this system the duration of the convict 's imprisonment is dependent upon the convict himself . None of the reformative agencies can be effective without his active co-operation . The instinctive love of freedom , the longing for release , constitute the strongest motive that animates the prisoner . And when he is made to realize that he has to work out his own salvation and that the length of his imprisonment depends on his own exertions , the strongest possible stimulus is applied to him to surrender himself to the reformative influences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applicable to every offense . Capital crimes , which incur the sentence of death or imprisonment for life , ought to be excepted from its operation . Such crimes import so frightful a danger to the community that the risk of their repetition by persons once convicted of them can not safely be incurred . If peculiar circumstances can in any case justify the release even of a convict guilty of a capital crime , the power to pardon vested in the Governor is plenary . It is also a question how far this form of sentence can be successfully applied to petty misdemeanors . But for the great body of crime lying between the extremes at each end of the scale the indeterminate sentence is the most effective measure of public protection and the most useful instrumentality toward the convict 's reformation that has ever been devised . The indeterminate sentence is no longer a mere doctrinaire 's theory . It has now become firmly imbedded in American criminal jurisprudence . In modified forms , all of which , however , embody its vital principle , it has been incorporated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notably New York , Massachusetts , Connecticut , New Jersey , Ohio , Illinois , Indiana , Minnesota and Colorado . In most of these States the indeterminate sentence is agglutinated to the old penal codes by the provision that the term of imprisonment under it shall not be less than the shortest , and shall not exceed the longest , term prescribed by the codes for the offense committed . Such limitation between a minimum and a maximum term is not logically defensible , but until the system of reforma/ tory treatment ( which is the necessary complement of this sentence ) shall have become more fully matured and universally adopted the limitation is probably a prudent one . Another essential concomitant of the indeterminate sentence is the feature of conditional release on parole . When a convict is deemed fit for release a situation where he can have employment is procured for him through the efforts of his friends or through the agency of the State and he is sent there on probation . He remains for a term ( generally six months ) a ward of the State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he falls into evil ways and seems to be gravitating back toward crime , he is rearrested and returned to prison for further treatment . If he passes the probationary period leading an honest life and demonstrating his intention and ability to abstain from crime , he obtains a final and absolute discharge . The indeterminate sentence is distinctively an American institution . The State of New York has the honor of first incorporating this form of sentence in effective legislation . In the New York State Reformatory at Elmira Z. R. Brockway developed the system and exhibited to the world a demonstration of its value . Among the States that have since adopted it are those which stand foremost in power and influence , and there is reason to believe that the indeterminate sentence will ultimately become a fundamental element in the criminal jurisprudence of all the States and of the Federal Government . In the universal adoption of the indeterminate sentence , with all that it logically involves , rests the strongest hope for final victory in the contest , which has hitherto been a losing contest , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
