IT has been the belief of certain kindly philosophers that if the one half of mankind knew how the other half lived , the two halves might be brought together in a family affection not now so observable in human relations . Probably if this knowledge were perfect , there would still be things to bar the perfect brotherhood ; and yet the knowledge itself is so interesting , if not so salutary as it has been imagined , that one ' call hardly refuse to impart it if one has it , and can reasonably hope , in the advantage of the ignorant , to find one 's excuse with the better informed . City and country are still so widely apart in every civilization that one can safely count upon a reciprocal strangeness in many every-day things . For instance , in the country , when people break up housekeeping , they sell their household goods and gods , as they did in cities fifty or a hundred years ago ; but now in cities they simply store them ; and vast warehouses in all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warehouses are of all types , from dusty lofts over stores , and ammoniacal lofts over stables , to buildings offering acres of space , and carefully planned for the purpose . They are more or less fire-proof , slow-burning , or briskly combustible , like the dwellings they have devastated . But the modern tendency is to a type where flames do not destroy , nor moth corrupt , nor thieves break through and steal . Such a warehouse is a city in itself , laid out in streets and avenues , with the private tenements on either hand duly numbered , and accessible only to the tenants , or their order . The aisles are concreted , the doors are iron , and the roofs are ceiled with iron ; the whole place is heated by steam and lighted by electricity . Behind the iron doors , which in the New York warehouses must number hundreds of thousands , and throughout all our other cities , millions , the furniture of a myriad households is stored ? the effects of people who have gone to Europe , or broken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been divorced . They are the dead hones of Homes , or their ghosts , or their yet living bodies held in hypnotic trances , destined again in some future time to animate some house or flat anew . In certain cases the spell lasts for many years , in others for a few , and in others yet it prolongs itself indefinitely . As the reader may remember , the Easy Chair was itself in storage for eight years ; and during this period it often had moments of subliminal encounter not only with other movables , but with the owners of them , which were of a quality too weird for record in any but a fiction number , and wholly unfit for this season of Christmas mirth . But the Easy Chair may mention here the case of one owner who visited the warehouse to Lake out the household stuff that had lain there a long fifteen years . He had been all that while in Europe , expecting any day to come home and begin life again in his own land . That dream had passed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shipping it to Italy . The Chair did not envy him his feelings as the parts of his long-dead past rose round him in formless resurrection . It was not that they were all broken or defaced . On the contrary , they were in a state of preservation far more heartbreaking than any decay . In well-managed storage warehouses the things are handled with scrupulous care , and they are so packed into the appointed rooms that if not disturbed they could suffer little harm in fifteen or fifty years . The places are wonderfully well kept , and if you will visit them , say in midwinter , after the fall influx of furniture has all been hidden away behind the iron doors of the several cells , you shall find their far - branching corridors scrupulously swept and dusted , and shall walk up and down their concrete length with some such sense of secure finality as you would experience in pacing the aisle of your family vault . That is what it comes to . One may feign that these storage warehouses are cities , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are stowed exanimate things once so intimately of their owners ' lives that it is with the sense of looking at pieces and bits of one 's dead self that one revisits them . If one takes the fragments out . to fit them to new circumstance , one finds them not only unconformable and incapable , but so volubly confidential of the associations in which they are steeped , that one wishes to hurry them back to their cell and lock it upon them forever . One feels then that the old way was far better , and that if the things had been auctioned oil , and scattered up and down , as chance willed , to serve new uses with people who wanted them enough to pay for them even a tithe of their cost , it would have been wiser . Failing this , a fire seems the only thing for them , and their removal to the cheaper custody of a combustible or slow-burning warehouse the best recourse . Desperate people , aging husbands and wives , who have attempted the reconstruction of their homes with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been known to wish for an earthquake , even , that would involve their belongings in an indiscriminate ruin . In fact each new start in life should be made with material new to you , if comfort is to attend the enterprise . It is not only sorrowful but it is futile to store your possessions , if you hope to find the old happiness in taking them out and using them again . It is not that they will not go into place , after a fashion , and perform their old office , but that the pang they will inflict through the suggestion of the other places where they served their purpose in other years will be only the keener for the perfection with which they do it now . If they can not be sold , and if no fire comes down from heaven to consume them , then they had better be stored with no thought of ever taking them out again . That will be expensive , or it will be inexpensive , according to the sort of storage they are put into . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself especially addressing , may be surprised , and if they have hearts they may be grieved , to learn that the fire-vol .. CIV. ? No. 675 . - 17proof storage of the furniture of the average house would equal the rent of a very comfortable domicile in a small town , or a farm by which a family 's living can be earned , with a decent dwelling in which it can be sheltered . Yet the space required is not very great ; three fair-sized rooms will hold everything ; and there is sometimes a fierce satisfaction in seeing how closely the things that once stood largely about , and seemed to fill ample parlors and chambers , can be packed away . To be sure they are not in their familiar attitudes ; they lie on their sides or backs , or stand upon their heads ; between the legs of library or dining tables are stuffed all kinds of minor movables , with cushions , pillows , pictures , cunningly adjusted to the environment ; and mattresses pad the walls , or interpose their soft bulk between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carpets sewn in cotton against moths , and rugs in long rolls ; the piano hovering under its ample frame a whole brood of helpless little guitars , mandolins , and banjos , and supporting on its broad back a bulk of lighter eases to the fire-proof ceiling of the cell ; paintings in boxes indistinguishable outwardly from their companioning mirrors ; barrels of china and kitchen utensils , and all the what not of house-holding and housekeeping contribute to the repletion . There is a science observed in the arrangement of the various effects ; against the rear wall and packed along the floor , and then in front of and on top of these is built a superstructure of the things that may be first wanted , in ease of removal , or oftenest wanted in some exigency of the homeless life of the owners , pending removal . The lightest and slightest articles float loosely about the door , or are interwoven in a kind of fabric just within , and curtaining the ponderous mass behind . The effect is not so artistic as the mortuary mosaics which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brethren in the crypt of their church , but the warehousemen no doubt have their just pride in it , and feel an artistic pang in its final or provisional disturbance . It had better never be disturbed , the Easy Chair insinuates again , for it is disturbed only in some futile dream of returning to the past ; and we never can return to the past on the old terms . It is well in all things to accept life implicitly ; and when an end has come to treat it as the end , and not vainly mock it as a suspense of function . When the poor break up their homes , with no immediate hope of founding others , they must sell their belongings because they can not afford to pay storage on them . The rich or richer store their household effects , and cheat themselves with the illusion that they are going some time to rehabilitate with them just such a home as they have dismantled . But the illusion probably deceives nobody so little as those who cherish tho vain hope . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cherish it till their furniture or themselves fall to dust ? they can not begin life anew , as the poor do who have kept nothing of the sort to link them to the past . This is one of the disabilities of the prosperous , who will probably not be relieved of it till some means of storing the owner as well as the furniture is invented . In the immense range of modern ingenuity , this is perhaps not impossible . Why not , while we are still in life , some sweet oblivious antidote which shall drug us against memory , and after time shall elapse for the reconstruction of a new home in place of the old , shall repossess us of ourselves as unchanged as the things with which we shall again array it ? Here is a pretty idea for some dreamer to spin into the filmy fabric of a romance , and the Easy Chair handsomely makes a present of it to the first corner . If the dreamer is of the right quality he will know how to make the reader feel that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstances it must always be a mistake to do so , and he will subtly insinuate the disappointment and discomfort of the stored personality in resuming its old relations . With that just mixture of the comic and pathetic which we desire in romance , he will teach convincingly that a stored personality is to be desired only if it is permanently stored , with the implication of a like finality in the storage of its belongings . Save in some such signal exception as that of the Easy Chair , a thing taken out of storage can not be established in itsformer function without a sense of its comparative inadequacy . It stands in the old place , it serves the old use , and yet a new thing would be better ; it would even in some subtle wise be more appropriate , if the Chair may indulge so audacious a paradox ; for the time is new , and so will be all the subconscious keeping in which our lives are mainly passed . We are supposed to have associations with the old things which render them precious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? If that is true of the inanimate things , how much truer it is of those personalities which once environed and furnished our lives ! Take the article of old friends , for instance : has it ever happened to the reader to witness the encounter of old friends after the lapse of years ? Such a meeting is conventionally imagined to be full of tender joy , a rapture that vents itself in manly tears , perhaps , and certainly in womanly tears . But really is it any such emotion ? Honestly is not it a cruel embarrassment , which all the hypocritical pretences can not hide ? The old friends smile and laugh , and babble incoherently at one another , but are they genuinely glad ? Is not each wishing the other at that end of the earth from which he came ? Have they any use for each other such as people of unbroken associations have ? The Easy Chair has lately been privy to the reunion of two old comrades who are bound together more closely than most men in a community of interests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had kept account of each other 's opinions as well as experiences ; they had exchanged letters , from time to time , in which they opened their minds fully to each other , and found themselves constantly in accord . When they met they made a great shouting , and each pretended that he found the other just what he used to be . They talked a long , long time , fighting the invisible enemy which they felt between them . The enemy was habit , the habit of other minds and hearts , the daily use of persons and things which in their separation they had not had in common . When the old friends parted they promised to meet every day , and now , since their lines had been cast in the same places again , to repair the ravage of the envious years , and become again to each other all that they had ever been . But though they live in the same town , and often dine at the same table , and belong to the same club , yet they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more apart , and are uneasy in each other 's presence , tacitly self-reproachful for the same effect which neither of them could avert or repair . They had been respectively in storage , and each , in taking the other out , has experienced in him the unfitness which grows upon the things put away for a time and reinstated in a former function . The Easy Chair is above all optimistic , and above all cheerful , and especially at Christmas . It is in fealty to its tradition that it has touched upon these facts of life , and with the purpose of finding some way out of the coil . There seems none better than the counsel of keeping one 's face set well forward , and one 's eyes fixed steadfastly upon the future . This is the hint we will get from nature if we will heed her , and note how she never recurs , never stores or takes out of storage . Fancy rehabilitating one 's first love : how nature would mock at that ! We can not go back and be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can go back and be children . As we grow older , each year 's change in as is more chnsmal and complete . There is no elixir whose magic will recover us to ourselves as we were last year. : but perhaps ( and here the Easy Chair 's inextinguishable optimism sheds its cheery ray upon the desolate conspoet ) we shall return to ourselves more and more in the times , or the eternity , to come . Some instinct or inspiration implies the promise of this , but only on condition that we shall not cling to the life that has been ours , and hoard its mummified image in our hearts . We must not seek to store ourselves , but must part with what we were for the use and behoof of others , as the poor part with their worldly gear when they move from one place to another . It is a curious and significant property of our outworn characteristics that , like our old furniture , they will serve admirably in the life of some other , and that this other can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ours , or ever hope to resume them . They not only go down to successive generations , but they spread beyond our lineages , and serve the turn of those whom we never knew to be within the circle of our influence . Civilization imparts itself by some such means , and the lower classes are clothed in the cast conduct of the upper , which if it had been stored would have left the inferiors rude and barbarous . We have only to think how socially naked most of us would be if we had not had the beautiful manners of our exclusive society to put on at each change of fashion when it dropped them . All earthly and material things should be worn out with use , and not preserved against decay by any unnatural artifice . Even when broken and disabled from overuse they have a kind of respectability which must commend itself to the observer , and which partakes of the pensive grace of ruin . An old table with one leg gone , and slowly lapsing to decay in the wood-shed , is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with all its legs intact , stored with the rest of the furniture from a broken home . Spinning-wheels gathering dust in the garret of a house that is itself falling to pieces have a dignity that deserts them when they are dragged from their refuge , and furbished up with ribbons and a tuft of fresh tow , and made to serve the hollow occasions of brie-I-brae , as they were a few years ago . A pitcher broken at the fountain , or a battered kettle on a rubbish heap , is a venerable object , but not crockery and copper-ware stored in the possibility of future need . However carefully handed down from one generation to another , the old objects have a forlorn incongruity in their successive surroundings which appeals to the compassion rather than the veneration of the witness . It was from a truth deeply mystical that Hawthorne declared against any sort of permanence in the dwellings of men , and held that each generation shokIld newly house itself . He preferred the perishability of the wooden American house to the durability of the piles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with some moral miasm from the succession of sires and sons and grandsons that had died out of them . But even of such structures as these it is impressive how little the earth makes with the passage of time . Where once a great city of them stood , you shall find a few tottering walls , scarcely more mindful of the past than " the cellar and the well " which Holmes marked as the ultimate monuments , the last witnesses , to the existence of our more transitory habitations . It is the law of the patient sun that everything under it shall decay , and if by reason of some swift calamity , some fiery cataclysm , the perishable shall be overtaken by a fate that fixes it in un. - wasting arrest , it can not be felt that the law has been set aside in the interest of men 's happiness or cheerfulness . Neither Pompeii nor Herculaneum invites the gayety of the spectator , who as he walks their disinterred thoroughfares has the weird sense of taking a former civilization out of storage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actual world . As far as his comfort is concerned , it had been far better that those cities had not been stored , ? but had fallen to the ruin that had overtaken all their contemporaries . Iv No , good friend , sir or madam , as the ease may be , but most likely madam : if you are about to break up your household for any indefinite period , and are not so poor that you need sell your things , he warned against putting them in stor-age , unless of the roost briskly combusti-ble type . Better , far better , give them away , and disperse them by that means to a continuous use that shall end in using them up ; or if no one will take them , then hire a vacant lot , somewhere , and devote them to the flames . By that means you shall bear witness against a custom that insults the order of na-ture , and crowds the cities with the cemeteries of dead homes , where there is scarcely space for the living homes . Do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storage and find it adapted to the ends that it served before it was put in . You will not be the same , or have the same needs or desires , when you take it out , and the new place which you shall hope to equip with it will receive it with cold reluctance , or openly refuse it , insisting upon forms and dimensions that render it ridiculous or impossible . The law is that nothing taken out of storage is the same as it was when put in , and this law , hieroglyphed in those rude graffiti apparently inscribed by accident in the process of removal , has only such exceptions as prove the rule . The Easy Chair , as it has hinted , is one of these , for it has been in storage and is now out , and is serving an old use in an old place . But is it the exception ? Is it the Easy Chair of other years , quite , quite unchanged in its outlook and its point of view ? That is too much to believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a difference . The world to which it has returned is not the same , and that makes all the difference . Shall we talk now of Lablache and Grisi , of Donizetti and Rossini , to a generation that knows only De Reszke and Melba , and Wagner and Mascagni ? Shall we praise quality in literature to a public that tests literary success quantitatively ? Surely yes , for truth and beauty do not change , however the moods and fashions change . The ideals remain , and these alone you can go back to , secure of finding them the same , to-day and to-morrow , that they were yesterday . This perhaps is because they have never been in storage , but in constant use , while the moods and fashions have been put away and taken out a thousand times . Most people have never had ideals , but only moods and fashions , but such people , least of all , are fitted to find in them that pleasure of the rococo which consoles the idealist when the old moods and fashions reappear .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
