txt deleted 24 lines When Chairman Bedell had read Mayor Lew 's letter he gave it out for publication . with the announcement that he thought Mayor Low 's plan would have the approval of the Railroad Committee . Mr. Bedell , after reading over the substitute bill proposed by Mayor Low for his condemnation bill , said he indorsed it . and would report it from the Railroad Committee as a substitute for his bill , No. 1,124 . " All that I have been aiming to do , " said Mr. Bedell , " was to provide a way in which the substitution of electricity for steam in the tunnel could be made . My bill , No. 1,124 , had no other purpose , though it was severely criticised . I have read the Mayor 's bill through , and , as it seems to meet the needs of the situation , I am perfectly willing to accept it as a substitute for my bill . " The Mayor 's condemnation bill was introduced in the Senate to-night by Senator Elsberg . The Senate Ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the bill . it is understood that the Governor will send in an emergency message on Wednesday morning calling for the immediate passage of the bill , so that it will not have to be delayed by being printed and being kept on the files of the members for three days before its passage . Special to The New York Times . ALBANY , March ** a letter to Chairman Bedell of the Assembly Committee on Railroads , Mayor Low makes known his position with regard to legislation to remedy existing conditions in the Park Avenue tunnel . The Mayor 's letter was handed to Mr. Bedell to-night by As , sistant Corporation Counsel Whitman . Briefly stated , the Mayor 's position is as follows : I. He accepts the Apgar bill , which fixes May 1 , 1905 , as the date when the use of steam in the tunnel shall become unlawful . 2 He rejects Mr. Bedell 's bill , No. 1,124 , granting sweeping general powers of condemnation to permit the railroad company to acquire property needed to put the change into effect , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ propositions : 1 . That the city and the railroad ccmpany shall have the right to agree on plans and terms . 2 . If either party fails to agree on plans and terms , the controversy shall be submitted to the Railroad Commission . 3 . If unsatisfactory to either party , the party disagreeing shall have the right of appeal to the Court of Appeals of the First Department . The Mayor 's letter is as follows : " The Hon. Louis Bedell , Chairman , &c.:; " In reply to your letter of March 5 , I have now the pleasure to inform you of my position with reference to the bills relating to the desired change of power in the tunnel used by the New York Central and Hudson River Railroad Cmpany . This subject divides itself into two parts  --  first , the question of fixing a date by which such change of power shall be completed , and , second , the method by which the plans necessary to accomplish this result shall be carried into effect . " The elements of the problem are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the city , are determined that a change must be made as promptly as possible , from steam to electricity , or to some other equally unobjectionable power , in the Park Avenue tunnel . It is , therefore , just as essential that a method shall be devised which shall make sure of a prompt agreement upon some plan , as that a mandatory bill shall be passed compelling the desired change . In the meantime it must be taken for granted that a change from steam to electricity will necessitate changes in the terminal arrangements at the Grand Central Station likely to affect some of the streets and thoroughfares . of . New , YorkCity very importantly . As - to these changes the city and its inhabitants are vitally interested . " On the other-Wand , the traveling public of the State and of the Nation are equally interested in having whatever plans may be adopted , adequate in every respect , from a railroad point of view . " Here , then , are three interests to be harmonized : - " First  --  The demand that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as rapidly as possible . ' Second  --  The special interests of the city , including those of the property owners immediately affected by any change of terminal arrangements . " Third  --  The demand of the traveling public for adequate facilities . Under these circumstances , I am prepared to assent to Assembly Bill No. 1,417. known as the Apgar bill , which fixes May 1 , 1905 , as the day when the use of steam in the tunnel shall become unlawful , but which grants to the State Board of Railroad Commissioners , upon reasonable cause being shown , and upon proper proof i that the work of changing the motive power in said tunnel has been diligently and in good faith progressed . the power to extend the time during which trains may be operated by steam locomotives in said tunnel , either in whole or in part . " If the railroad company were , in fact , unwilling to make the desired changes , I should certainly continue to urge the fixing of a date that should stand as a mandate of the Legislature unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the letter already made public addressed to me by the President and eight of the Directors of th-3 railroad company , I believe that the Apgar bill is in a form well Calculated to assure the desired results . If the Legislature sees fit to go further in the matter of fixing a date I shall not object , but personally I believe it would be better judgment to take the company at its word . - As to the rest I submit herewith as a substitute for Assembly bill No. 1,124 and ask for its introduction a bill which providec for the following procedure : - First , the railroad company shall make an earnest effort to agree with the city upon acceptable plans and upon a satisfactory equivalent for privileges granted and for city property taken . In the event of such agreement the plans are to be submitted for approval or rejection to the State Board of Railroad Commissioners . If approved by this commission , after a public hearing . the bill provides for the necessary condemnation of property and the immediate execution of the plans thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commission the railroad company must start again . If , on the other hand . the railroad company and the city can not agree upon the plans there is an appeal open to both parties to the State Board of Railroad Commissioners ; and in the event of continued disagreement further appeal may be taken by the city to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court , First Department . whose decision will be final . If the railroad company and the city agree upon the plans , but fail to agree upon the equivalent to be given to the city , then the courts in the last resort are to determine the compensation . The bill also provides that an agreement must be reached between the railroad company and the city within sixty days after the plans are submitted to the city , or else the city shall be deemed to have disapproved the plans . By this provision the public demand that the desired changes shall be brought about as quickly as possible . and that they be given full force and effect . In the meanwhile , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city have two appeals ; first ? to the State Board of Railroad Commissioners : second , to the Appellate Division Property owners affected will have a hearing as to any proposed plans by the city and again by the State Board of Railroad Commissioners ; and in the event of disagreement between the railroad company and the city by the said Appellate Division of the Supreme Court . In the event of the . condemnation of their property . after plans have been approved , the usual procedure will be followed I do not know how all the interests concerned can be more fairly safeguarded " The Mayor 's position is wholly unsatisfactory to the people of Westchester County . according to the statement made tonight by Assemblyman J. Mayhew Wainwright . and will be antagonized by them to the end . " I had a long conference with Mayor Low while in New York Saturday . " said Mr. Wainwright . " and was informed of his views . I disagree with him entirely in his conclusions and the solution which he proposes will not receive indorsement by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to-night protesting against the Mayor 's plan . I shall push my bill and do all I can to have it passed . The Apgar bill . which the Mayor favors. was handed to me by Chairman Bedell of the Railroad Committee with the request that . I introduce it , and I refused . He then gave it to Mr. Apgar . As I see it , the . Apgar bill provides no relief whatever ; it amounts to no more than an expresgion of opinion On the part of the Legislature . While it fixes May 1 , 1905 , as the date when the use of steam in the tunnel shall Engineer Wisker Pleads " Not Guilty . " Judge , having overruled the demurrer offered by counsel for John M.
