txt Mankind may be able to communicate with the inhabitants of Mars in July next , says Prof. William Henry Pickering of Harvard , who suggests adopting a method of flashing messages when that planet approaches the earth to within 35,000,000 miles , or 5,000,000 miles nearer than ever before , he declares . Ten million dollars is the sum at which he sets the putting of this method into practical use , but once this means of celestial communication is established , he predicts that the messages will be easily recognized and undoubtedly answered , if there is intelligent life on Mars . While astronomers all over the world are following with deep interest the movements of Mars , while at the great Harvard observatories at Flagstaff , Ariz. , and in Peru scientists are eagerly awaiting the possibility of new discoveries which may prove indisputably the generally accepted belief that the planet is peopled with beings of intelligence . Prof. Pickering stands ready to furnish a method . painstakingly and carefully worked out , for actually talking with the Martians , in case the coming proximity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was intelligent life on Mars it would be possible to signal the planet if we desired to do so , " he tells . " plan of communication would necessitate the use of a series of mirrors so arranged as to present a single reflecting surface toward the planet . Of course one mirror would do as well , but as the area necessary for reflecting the sunlight over40,000,00urniies would have to be more than a quarter of a mile of glass a single mirror would not be practicable . We would have to use a . number of mirrors . " These mirrors would all have to be attached to one great axis parallel to the axis of the earth , run by motors , and so timed as to make a complete revolution every twenty-four hours , thus carrying the reflecting surface around with the axis once a day and obviating the necessity of continually readjusting it to allow for the movements of the planets .

A private watchman was hired . Since then two more letters were received at the house , and the last said that if the money was not forthcoming by n o'clock on Saturday night the Italian and his family would be blown uo .

Detectives from the Italian Squad were assigned to it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as promised by the Black Hand , but there was a feeling of unrest among those in the neighborhood . Mr. Leach said that his client was so scared that he would have paid . the money , but he could n't get it , as all his capital was tied up in tenement houses . The lawyer added that the letters did not contain the usual threats in words ; the intention of the writer , lf the $2,500 was not produced , was conveyed by the bomb symbols drawn at the side .
