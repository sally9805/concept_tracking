As Dr. Richard Strauss has endeavored to embody a metaphysical system in a symphonic composition , so Mr. Thomas Hardy has sought to express a philosophy of history in a closetdrama . Both feats are quite impossible of achievement upon the terms of the arts respectively involved , yet both produce deeply intereating results because of the powerful personalities which they exhibit . The symphonic poem throws little light upon the doctrines of Nietzsche.Zoroaster , but much upon the inner workings of the composer 's mind ; the historical drama likewise adds little to our insight into the Napoleonic wars , but does much to illuminate the point of view from which its author contemplates the significant happenings in the tragi-comedy of human life . It takes for its motto the words : And I heard sounds of insult , shame , and wrong , And trumpets blown for wars .  | " It might even better have taken Matthew Arnold 's familiar lines about Heine : The Spirit of the world , Beholding the absurdity of men ? Their vaunts , their feats ? let a sardonic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The word " short " in the quotation would hardly be applicable , for Mr. Hardy 's portentous production extends to nineteen acts and one hundred and thirty scenes , but the " sardeuie smile " is everywhere in evidence , and " the spirit of the world " is one of the speaking characters of the drama . The mere enumeration of these characters fills four pages of print , and one of the four is a list of the " phantom intelligences " who hover about the scene , and comment upon the action after the fashion of a Greek chorus . There is the Ancient Spirit of the Years , the Spirit of Pities , the Spirit of Rumour , and Spirits Sinister and Ironic , besides the Shade of the Earth and a sufficient number of Recording Angels . These ideal shapes are not kept mostly outside the main action , as in " Faust , " but mingle with it at every point , and penetrate the scene with their intelligence . Their part is so important that we must quote in full the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and what he intended should be their function in his artistic plan . " It was thought proper to introduce , as supernatural spectators of the terrestrial drama , certain impersonated abstractions , or Intelligences , called Spirits . They are intended to be taken by the reader for what they may be worth as contrivances of the fancy merely . Their doctrines are but tentative , and are advanced with little eye to a systematized philosophy warranted to lift ' the burthen of the mystery ' of this unintelligible world . The chief thing hoped for them is that they and their utterances may have dramatic plausibility enough to procure for them , in the words of Coleridge , ' that willing suspension of disbelief for the moment which constitutes poetic faith . ' The wide prevalence of the Monistic theory of the Universe forbade , in this twentieth century , the importation of Divine personages from any antique Mythology as ready-made sources or channels of Causation , even in verse , and excluded the celestial machinery of , say , ' Paradise Lost , ' as peremptorily as that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' And the abandonment of the masculine pronoun in allusions to the First or Fundamental Energy seemed a necessary and logical consequence of the long abandonment by thinkers of the anthropomorphic conception of the same . " This explanation , which is also a confession of faith ( of a lack of faith , some will say , with too great a readiness to jump at conclusions ) , is absolutely essential to any comprehension of the mood or temper in which the drama has been wrought ; it sets the work apart from those others which likewise make use of supernatural machinery , but which use it in such a way as to give at least temporary credence to the concrete forms in which the outworn religions have shaped forth their envisagement of life 's inmost meaning . A great historical period , then , viewed on the one hand with the eye of the most minute and relentless realism , and on the other seen absolutely sub specie ceternitatis , is what Mr. Hardy has given us in " The Dynasts , " of which the first six acts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theme , rather than the temporal aspect , is what chiefly concerns him , is a fact of which we are not permitted to doubt for a moment . He makes this perfectly clear in the scene of Napoleon 's Coronation at Milan , where the dumb show of ceremonial becomes the subject of spiritual comment after the following fashion : " Spirit of the Pities . " What is the creed that these rich rites disclose ? Spirit of the Years . " A local thing called Christianity , Which the wild dramas of this wheeling sphere Include , with divers others such , in dim , Pathetical , and brief parentheses ; Beyond whose reach , uninfluenced , unconcerned , The systems of the suns go sweeping on With all their many-mortaled planet train In mathematic roll unceasingly . Spirit of the Pities . " I did not recognize it here , forsooth ; Though in its early , lovingkindly days Of gracious purpose it was much to me . " From this point of view the mightiest figures in human history shrink to mere manikins , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puppets controlled by a mysterious and inexorable destiny . Perhaps three-fourths of the present volume is in the form of verse ? blank verse for the dialogue of mortals , lyrical measures of various forms for the discourse of spirits . But the verse , whatever its form , is such as to defy all the conventional canons of poetic diction , being devoid of grace and melody , and having in their stead only sheer intellectual weight and merciless logic . Two more illustrations may be given besides those already introduced for illustration of the author 's thought . Here are the words spoken by Pitt upon hearing the news of Austerlitz : " O God that I should live to see this day ! ' Defeated ? the Allies ? quite overthrown At Austerlitz ? last week . ' ? Where 's Austerlitz ? ? But what avails it where the place is now ; What corpse is curious on the longitude  | And situation of his cemetery ! . . . The Austrians and the Russians overcome , That vast adventuring army is set free To bend unhindered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans through all these plodding years Announce them built in vain ! . . His heel on Europe , monarchies in chains To France , I am as though I had not been . " And here is part of the antiphonal song of the Recording Angels , chanted to , , mrial music " : " Feeble-framed dull unresolve , unresourcefulness , Sat in the halls of the Kingdom 's high Councillors , Whence an untactical torpid despondency Weighed as with winter the national mind . " Surely such dactyls as these were never shaped before ; that they are the utterance of an angelic voice seems to be one of the deepest of the ironies in the author 's whole ironic scheme . Clearly this work must be taken on Mr. Hardy 's own terms ; the ordinary terms of literary art would compel its summary rejection , and it is quite impressive enough to force as to set those terms aside . The conception of the historical Napoleon here presented is essentially just . It is that of the hero perverted until he has become the N man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom " The large potencies Instilled into his idiosyncrasy ? To throne fair Liberty in Privilege 's room ? Are taking taint , and sink to common plots For his own gain . " The three figures of Napoleon , Nelson , and Pitt stand out far above the mass of historical characters that Mr. Hardy has brought into his drama . Women hardly appear in the foreground of the action , and few of them are even named in the long list of dramatis personce . The section of the work now published may be summed up historically with the five words Milan , Boulogne , Ulm , Trafalgar , and AusterIitz . The Peninsular War will be the central theme of the second section , with Jena and Wagram for subjects of secondary interest . Moscow , Elba , and Waterloo will be the capital headings of the third and concluding section , followed by an epilogue in a Wessex village , and an " after scene " in " the overworld , " to match the " fore scene " with which the work is opened . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the effect that the remaining sections are " in hand , " although " their publication is not guaranteed . " We trust that they may see the light . So grandiose a plan , conceived by so forceful and distinguished a writer , could not suffer frustration without the world 's being left the poorer . An undertaking no less ambitious than that of Mr. Hardy , and one which , if of less weight as an embodiment of ripened wisdom , is of far greater weight as an expression of the poetic imagination , is Mr. William Vaughn Moody 's trilogy on the Promethean theme . Our opinion of " The Masque of Judgment , " holding it to be one of the most extraordinary productions of recent literature ? a poem in so high a sense that it may be doubted whether its author has a peer among the younger singers of our race ? was expressed in these pages three years ago . It now appears that " The Masque of Judgment was planned as the intermediate section of a three-fold drama , of which ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part , and which some as yet unnamed and unimaginable work ( as far as the public is concerned ) will bring to a conclusion . With two-thirds of this drama already in our possession , we trust that no untoward and malign fate will deprive us of the completion of a production which offers every promise of enduring life . Aschylus , Goethe , and Shelley ? these are the names that any treatment of the Prometheus myth must bring to mind . Now there are two ways in which the great names of literature may be brought to mind . One of them is by the appalling contrast between the work of genius for which they stand and the work of some mediocre modern talent that seeks their shadow ; the other is by the suggestion of an evident kinship that makes it not altogether preposterous to speak in the same breath of the masters and some modern disciple who has caught his inspiration from their teaching . We have no notion of discovering a new 2 schylus , or Goethe , or Shelley , in Mr. Moody , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatly daring , dealt so worthily with their famous theme that we may not fairly charge him with rashness ; that he has , to use a figure naturally suggested by that theme , filched some spark of fire from their heaven for our use . " The Fire-Bringer " opens upon a world made desolate by the wrath of Zeus . The floods have swept over it , destroying the race of men , save only the few rescued by Deukalion 's ark . The stone men and women sprung from the " big seed " cast by Deukalion and Pyrrha have indeed in a way repeopled the world , but they are stolid figures , unawakened to the life of the spirit , and groping about over an earth made dark by the cloud-pall that still overhangs it , and made dismal by the ooze  | and slime left by the " black ebb " of the waters . Prometheus has in vain ranged the world in search of a spark of fire , and has even scaled the heavens only to be baffled in his quest . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faith of Pandora bring to him a gleam of cheer and strengthen his high purpose . Prometheus thus describes his first fruitless search : " I clambered down Old earthquake-cloven rifts and monstrous chasms Where long ago the stripling Titans peered At play and dared not venture , ? found me out Flint-stones so buried in disastrous rock I thought the Darkener sure had passed them by ; But not a spark lived in them . Past the walls Rhipean , and the Arimaspian caves , I sought the far hyperborean day , But not a banner of their rustling light Flapped through the sagging sky , nor did the Fates Once fling their gleaming shuttles east or west . By Indian Nysa and the Edonian fount Of Hnmus long I lurked , in hope to find Young Dionysus as he raced along And wrest his pine-torch from him , or to snare Some god-distracted dancing egipan , And from his garland crush a wine of fire To light the passion of the world again And fill man 's veins with music ; but there went A voice of sighing through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mist Desolate creatures sorrowed for the god . Across the quenched Egean , where of old The shining islands sang their stasimon , Forever chorusing great hymns of light Round Delos , through the driving dark I steered To seek Hephnstos on his Lemnian mount ; But found him not . His porches were o'erthrown , His altar out , and round his faded peak The toiled Cyclops , bowing huge and dim , Uncouthly mourned . " But in the hour of his deepest dejection , new hope comes to the Titan with the advent of Pandora , who brings him a fennel stalk ; he receives it as the token of a fresh endeavor , and the first act closes as he departs To find somewhere through the piled gloom A mountain-path to unimagined day . " In the second act , the few maddened survivors of the deluge , in their last frantic effort to appease the anger of Zeus , come bringing the child Alcyone , and press about Deukalion and Pyrrha , demanding of them also the sacrifice of their child JEolus as a supreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then reluctantly consents , and the sacrifice is about to be consummated when Pyrrha interposes , and declares that the knife shall not yet fall , " Not till Prometheus comes or makes a sign ! " In the hour of heavy suspense , the voice of Pandora is heard singing down the slopes , and her appearance is eagerly awaited . Then follows this supremely beautiful scene : " A Man 's Voice . " Take heed there to the lad where he bath risen His height upon the altar ! And the maid Is risen . Look to them Pyrrha . Children ! lEolus ! What is ' t with you ? What search ye in the heavens ? Or to what high thing do your spirits strain And your hands tremble up ? Lotus and Alcyone ( looking and pointing upward ) . The stars ! The stars ( Pause . ) Deukalion . Why hath so deep a hush fallen on the night ? I heard a whispering cry . What whisper they ? Pyrrha . EEolus pointed ? whispering of the stars . Lolus . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Deukalion . Speakest thou Of stars ? Pyrrha . Ay , so he whispered ! Deukalion . Thou ? and thou ? Pyrrha . Nothing , nothing . My soul was as a lake Spread out in utter darkness ; to its depth There pierced a silvery trembling ? Deukalion . Look again . Wife , cease to pray ! Look out again ! Pyrrha . The dark Gathers and flees , and the wide roof of night Leans in as it would break ; the mountainous gloom Unmoors , and streameth on us like a sea . 0 Earth , lift up thy gates ! It is the stars 1 It is the stars ! It is the ancient stars ! It is the young and everlasting stars ! " And then there follow page upon page of glorious poetry , the rapturous expression of the restoration to the world of light and life and joy . And then at last the sun streams out over the earth , dazzling to the long-darkened eyes of the survivors , and intolerable to the eyes of the men sprung from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pandora is heard again , and then the voice of Prometheus , " Thou gayest me the vessel ; it is filled . " and the answering voice of Pandora , " I am the vessel , and with thee ' t is filled . " And then Prometheus appears , and gives to  | the children now saved from death the fenne stalk with its priceless treasure of fire . " Unto this twain , man-child and woman-child , I give the passion of this element ; This seed of longing , substance of this love ; This power , this purity , this annihilation . Let their hands light the altar of the world . ' T is yours forever . I have brought it home ! " The third and closing act of the dram ; brings retribution to the daring saviour o mankind . The scene is the tomb of Deuka lion , - whither the remains of the king havi been borne to rest beside his stranded ark oz the mountain side . A chorus of old men is fol lowed by choruses of girls and young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' and of the mysterious whisperings in their ear ! of the winged Eros . The funeral cortege de parts , leaving the mourners beside the tomb And then amid gathering clouds , and thunders and the flashes of angry lightning the pursui of Prometheus is foreshadowed . Pandora ap pears questioning , ? " Deemest thou That he will yield himself unmurmuring up , Or will he make wild war along the peaks ? " To the cry Prometheus himself answers , sud denly appearing and clasping her in his arms " Be comforted ; it is established sure . Light shall arise from light , day follow day , Season meet season , with all lovely signs And portents of the year . These shall not fail ; From their appointed dance no star shall swerve , Nor mar one accent of one whirling strophe Of that unfathomed chorus that they sing Within the porch and laughing-house of Life , Which Time and Space and Change , bright caryatids Do meanwhile pillar up .

Himself the heavens , himself the scornful gods , The sun , the sun-thief , and the flaming reed That kindles new the beauty of the world . " At the end of the long monologue which if thus begun , Prometheus departs to meet the doom which he clearly foresees , sustained it spirit by the thought of what he has done foi the race of men , and by his memory of Pan . dora , to whom he speaks these pregnant last words : " There where I go thou art .

And amid the peace of the following starlight , and the flush of the succeeding dawn , this lyrical drama ends with a hymn to Apollo , chanted by a chorus of young men coming up the mountain slope . " For thou alone , 0 thou alone art he Who settest the prisoned spirit free , And sometimes leadest the rapt soul on Where never mortal thought has gone ; Till by the ultimate stream Of vision and of dream She stands With startled eyes and outstretched hands , Looking where other suns rise over other lands , And rends the lonely skies with her prophetic scream .

The song is indeed a thing not of earth , and some may find a cause for reproach in this very fact ; to us it is rather a cause for thankfulness , since it shows us that even in this prosaic modern world of ours the poetic spirit may still achieve something of the accent and the utterance of the great voices of the past .  |
