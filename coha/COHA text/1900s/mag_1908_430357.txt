YOU may go to Damascus now by rail , if you like , and have a choice between two rival routes , one under government ownership , the other built and managed by a corporation . But to us ( the Patriarch , the Pastor , the Lady , and the Writer ) , encamped among the silvery olives at Baniyas , beside the springs of Jordan , it seemed a happy circumstance that both railways were so far away that it would have taken almost as long to reach them as to ride our horses straight into Damascus . We were delivered from the modern folly of saving time by travelling in a conveyance more speedy than picturesque , and left tree to pursue our journey in a leisurely , independent fashion and by the road that would give us most pleasure . So we chose the longer way , the northern path around Mount Hermon , instead of the more frequented road to the east by Kafr Hawar. flow delightful is the morning of such a journey ! The fresh face of the world bathed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we four friends made our rendezvous from the far countries of sleep ; the relish of breakfast in the open air ; the stir of the camp in preparation for a flitting ; canvas sinking to the ground , bales and boxes heaped together , mule-bells tinkling through the grove , horses refreshed by their long rest whinnying and nipping at each other in play ? all these were charming variations and accompaniments to the old tune of " Boots and Saddles . " The immediate effect of such a setting out for a day 's ride is to renew in the heart those " vital feelings of delight " which make us simply and inexplicably glad to be alive , and to deliver us from those morbid questionings and exorbitant demands by which we are so often possessed and plagued as by some strange inward malady . We felt a sense of health and harmony diffused through body and mind as we rode over the beautiful terrace which sloped down from Baniyas to Telel-Nadi . We were glad of the green valonia-oaks that spread their shade over us , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hillside . We were glad of the crested larks that rose warbling from the grass , and of the buntings and chaffinches that made their small merry music in every thicket , and of the black and white chats that shifted their burden of song from stone to stone beside the path , and of the cuckoo that told his name to us from far away , and of the splendid bee-eaters that glittered over us like a flock of winged emeralds as we climbed the rocky hill towards the north . We were glad of the broom in golden flower , and of the pink and white rock-roses , and of the spicy fragrance of mint and pennyroyal that our horses trampled out as they splashed through the spring holes and little brooks . We were  | glad of the long , wide views westward over the treeless mountains of Naphtali and the southern ridges of the Lebanon , and of the glimpses of the ruined castles of the Crusaders , Kal'at esh-Shakif and Hunin , perched like dilapidated eagles on their distant crags . Everything seemed to us like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for that any of all the world 's beauty . We could not have explained or justified it to any sad philosopher who might have reproached us for unreasoning felicity . We should have been defenceless before his arguments and indifferent to his scorn , for we should have ridden on into the morning , reflecting in our hearts something of the brightness of the birds ' plumage , the cheerfulness of the brooks ' song , the undimmed hyaline of the sky , and so , perhaps , fulfilling the Divine Intention of nature as well as if we had clouded our mirror with melancholy thoughts . We were following up the valley of the longest and highest , but not the largest , of the sources of the Jordan : the little river Hasbani , a strong and lovely stream , which rises somewhere in the northern end of the Wadi et-Teim , and flows along the western base of Mount Hermon , receiving the tribute of torrents which burst out in foaming springs far up the ravines , and are fed underground by the melting of the perpetual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to cross one of these torrents , by a rude stone bridge or by wading . All along the way Hermon looked down upon us from his throne , nine thousand feet in air . His head was wrapped in a turban of spotless white , like a Druse chieftain , and his snowy winter cloak still hung down over his shoulders , though its lower edges were already fringed and its seams opened by the warm suns of April . Presently we crossed a bridge to the west bank of the Hasbani , and rode up the delightful vale where poplars and mulberries , olives , almonds , vines and figs , grew abundantly along the course of the river . There were low weirs across the stream for purposes of irrigation , and a larger dam supplied a mill with power .  | To the left was the sharp barren ridge of the Jebel ez-Zohr separating us from the gorge of the river Litani . Groups of laborers were at work on the watercourses among the groves and gardens . Vine-dressers were busy in the vineyards . Ploughmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hillside . The little river , here in its friendliest mood , wound merrily among the plantations and orchards which it nourished , making a cheerful noise over beds of pebbles , and humming a deeper note where the clear green water plunged over a weir . We had now been in the saddle five hours ; the sun was ardent ; the temperature was above eighty-five degrees in the shade , and along the bridle-path there was no shade . We were hungry , thirsty , and tired . As we crossed the river again , splashing through a ford , our horses drank eagerly and attempted to lie down in the cool water . We had to use strong persuasion not only with them , but also with our own spirits , to pass by the green grass and the sheltering olive-trees on the east bank and push on up the narrow , rocky defile in which Hasbeiya was hidden . The bridle-path was partly paved with rough cobblestones , hard and slippery , which made the going weariful . The heat lay on us like a burden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now gave us no pleasure . We had made the greedy traveller 's mistake of measuring our march by the extent of our endurance instead of by the limit of our enjoyment . Hasbeiya proved to be a rather thriving and picturesque town built around the steep sides of a bay or opening in the valley . The amphitheatre of hills was terraced with olive-orchards and vineyards . There were also many mulberrytrees cultivated for the silkworms , and the ever-present figs and almonds were not wanting . The stone houses of the town rose , on winding paths , one above the other , many of them having arched porticoes , red - tiled roofs , and greenlatticed windows . It was a place of about five thousand population , now more than three-fourths Christian , but formerly one of the strongholds and capitals of the mysterious Druse religion . Our tents were pitched at the western end of the town , on a low terrace where olive-trees were growing . When we arrived we found the camp surrounded and filled with curious , laughing children . The boys were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an old man who seemed to be in charge brought them to order , and at least fifty of them , big and little , squatted in a semicircle on the grass below the terrace , watching us with  | their lustrous brown eyes . They looked full of fun , those young Druses and Maronites and Greeks and Mohammedans , so I tried a mild joke on them , by pretending that they were a class and that I was teaching them a lesson . " A , B , C , " I chanted , and waited for them to repeat after me . They promptly took the lesson out of my hands and recited the entire English alphabet in chorus , winding up with shouts of " Goot mornin ' ! How you do ? " and merry laughter . They were all pupils from the mission schools which have been established since the great massacre of 1860 , and which are helping , I hope , to make another forever impossible . One of our objects in coming to IIasbeiya was to ascend Mount Hermon . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both of them assured us that the adventure was impossible on account of the deep snow , which had increased during the last fortnight . We could not get within a mile of the summit . The snow would be waist-deep in the hollows . The mountain was inaccessible until June . So , after exchanging visits with the missionaries and seeing something of their good work , we rode on our way the next morning . The journey to Rasheiya was like that of the preceding day , except that the bridle-paths were rougher and more precipitous , and the views wider and more splendid . We had crossed the Hasbani again , and leaving the Druses ' valley , the Wadi et-Teim , behind us , had climbed the high table-land to the west . We did not know why George Cavalcanty led us away from the path marked in our Baedekers , but we took it for granted that he had some good reason . It is well not to ask a wise dragoman all the questions that you can think of . Tell him where you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get there . Certainly we were not inclined to complain of the longer and steeper route by which he had brought us , when we sat down at lunchtime among the limestone crags and pinnacles of the wild upland and looked abroad upon a landscape which offered the grandeur of immense outlines and vast distances , the beauty of a crystal clearness in all its infinitely varied forms , and the enchantment of gemlike colors , delicate , translucent , vivid , shifting and playing in hues of rose and violet and azure and purple and golden brown and bright green , as if the bosom of Mother Earth were the breast of a dove , breathing softly in the sunlight . As we climbed towards Rasheiya we found ourselves going back a month or more into early spring . Here were the flowers that we had seen in the plain of Sharon on the first of April , gorgeous red anemones , fragrant purple and white cyclamens , delicate blue irises . The figtree was putting forth her tender leaf . The vines , lying flat on the ground , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few inches long , was in its first flush of almost dazzling green . The town , built in terraces on three sides of a rocky hill , 4100 feet above the sea , commanded an extensive view . Hermon was in full sight ; snow - capped Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon faced each other for forty miles ; and the little lake of Kafr Kuk made a spot of blue light in the foreground . We camped on the threshing-floor , a level meadow beyond and below the town ; and there the Rasheiyan gilded youth came riding their blooded horses in the afternoon , running races over the smooth turf and showing off their horsemanship for our benefit . There is something very attractive about these Arabian horses as you see them in their own country . They are spirited , fearless , sure-footed , and yet , as a rule , so docile that they may be ridden with a halter . They are good for a long journey , or a swift run , or a fantasia . The prevailing color among them is gray , but you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . An Arabian stallion satisfies the romantic ideal of how a horse ought to look . His arched neck , small head , large eyes wide apart , short body , round flanks , delicate pasterns , and little feet ; the way he tosses his mane and cocks his flowing tail when he is on parade ; the swiftness and spring of his gallop , the dainty grace of his walk ? when you see these things you recognize at once the real , original horse which the painters used to depict in their " Portraits of General X on his Favorite Charger . " I asked Cavalcanty what one of these fine creatures would cost . " A good one , two or three hundred dollars ;  | an extra-good one , four hundred ; a fancy one , who knows ? " We found Risheiya full of Americanism . We went out to take photographs , and at almost every street corner some young man who had been in the United States or Canada saluted us with : " How are you to-day ? You fellows come from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elected yet ? I voted for McKinley . I got a store in Kankakee . I got one in Jackson , Miss . " E1 beautiful dark-eyed girl , in a dreadful department-store dress , smiled at us from an open door and said : " Take my picture ? I been at America . " One talkative and friendly fellow joined us in our walk ; in fact he took possession of us , guiding us up the crooked alleys and out on the housetops which commanded the best views , and showing us off to his friends , an old gentleman who was spinning goats ' hair for the coarse black tents ( St. Paul 's trade ) , and two ladies who were grinding corn in a hand-mill , one pushing and the other pulling . Our self-elected guide had spent seven years in Illinois and Indiana , peddling and storekeeping . He had returned to Rasheiya as a successful adventurer and built him a stone house with a red roof and an arched portico . Was he going to settle down there for life ? " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want sell my house now . This country beautiful ; I like look at her . But America free ? good government ? good place to live , Gee whiz ! I go back quick , you bet . " Our path the next day led up to the east over the ridges of the slight depression which lies between Mount Hermon and the rest of the Anti-Lebanon range . We passed the disconsolate village and lake of Kafr Kuk . The water which shone so blue in the distance now confessed itself a turbid , stagnant pool , locked in among the hills , and breeding fevers for those who lived beside it . The landscape grew wild and sullen as we ascended ; the hills were strewn with shattered fragments of rock , or worn into battered and fantastic crags ; the bottoms of the ravines were soaked and barren as if the winter floods had just left them . Presently we were riding among great snowdrifts , It was the first  | day of May . We walked on the snow , and packed a basketful on one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We had gone back another month in the calendar and were now at the place where " winter lingers in the lap of spring . " Snowdrops , crocuses , and little purple grape-hyacinths ere blooming at the edge of the drifts . The thorny shrubs and bushes , and spiny herbs like astragalus and cousinia , were greenstemmed but leafless , and the birds that fluttered among them were still in the first rapture of vernal spring , the gay music that follows mating and precedes nesting . Big dove - colored partridges , beautifully marked with black and red , were running among the rocks . We were at the turn of the year , the surprising season when the tide of light and life and love swiftly begins to rise . From this Alpine region we descended through two months in half a day . It was mid-March on a beautiful green plain where herds of horses were feeding around an encampment of black Bedouin tents ; the beginning of April at Khan Meithelun , on the post-road , where there were springs , and poplar-groves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lemonade cooled by the snows of Hermon ; the end of April at Dimas , where we found our tents pitched upon the threshingfloor , a levelled terrace of clay looking down upon the flat roofs of the village . Our camp that night was 3600 feet above sea-level , and our morning path followed the telegraph-poles steeply down to the post-road , and so by a more gradual descent along the hard and dusty turnpike towards Damascus . The landscape , at first , was bare and arid , rounded reddish mountains , gray hillsides , yellowish plains faintly tinged with a thin green . But at El - Hami the road dropped into the valley of the Barada , the farfamed river Abana , and we found ourselves in a verdant paradise . Tall trees arched above the road ; white balconies gleamed through the foliage ; the murmur and the laughter of flowing streams surrounded us . The railroad and the carriage-road met and crossed each other down the vale . Country houses and cafes , some dingy and dilapidated , others new and trim , were half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Poplars and willows , plane- trees and lindens , walnuts and mulberries , apricots and almonds , twisted figtrees and climbing roses , grew joyfully wherever the parcelled water flowed in its many channels . Above this line , on the sides of the vale , everything was bare and brown and dry . It was an embroidered sash of bloom laid across the sackcloth of the desert . And in the centre of this long verdure ran the parent river , a flood of clear green , rushing , leaping , curling into white foam , filling its channel of thirty or forty feet from bank to bank , and making the silverleafed willows and poplars , that stood with their feet in the stream , tremble with the swiftness of its cool , strong current . Truly Naaman the Syrian was right in his boasting to the prophet Elisha : Abana , the river of Damascus , is better than all the waters of Israel . The vale narrowed as we descended along the stream , until suddenly we passed through a gateway of steep cliffs and emerged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The river , parting into seven branches , went out to water a hundred and fifty square miles of groves and gardens , and we followed the road through the labyrinth of rich and luscious green . There were orchards of apricots enclosed with high mud walls ; and open gates through which we caught glimpses of crimson rose-trees and scarlet pomegranates and little fields of wheat glowing with blood-red poppies ; and hedges of white hawthorn and wild brier ; and trees , trees , trees , everywhere embowering us and shutting us in . Presently j a saw , above the leafy tops , a sharp - pointed minaret with a golden crescent above it . Then we found ourselves again beside the main current of the Barada , running swift and merry in a walled channel straight across an open common , where soldiers were exercising their horses , and donkeys and geese were feeding , and children were playing , and dyers were sprinkling their long strips of blue cotton cloth laid out upon the turf beside the river . The road began to look like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before us ; there were glimpses of gray walls and towers , a few shops and open-air cafes , a couple of hotel signs . The river passed under a bridge and disappeared by a hundred channels beneath the city , leaving us at the western entrance of Damascus . I can not tell whether the river , the gardens , and the city would have seemed so magical and entrancing if we had come upon them in some other way or seen them in a different setting . You can never detach an experience from its matrix and weigh it alone . Comparisons with the environs of Naples or Florence visited in an automobile , or with the suburbs of Boston seen from a trolley-ear , are futile and unilluminating . The point about the Barada is that it springs fullborn from the barren sides of the AntiLebanon , swiftly creates a paradise as it runs , and then disappears absolutely in a wide marsh on the edge of the desert . The point about Damascus is that she flourishes on a secluded plain , the Ghutah , seventy miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with no hinterland and no sustaining provinces , no political leadership , and no special religious sanctity , with nothing , in fact , to account for her distinction , her splendor , her populous vitality , her selfsufficient charm , except her mysterious and enduring quality as a mere city , a hive of men . She is the oldest living city in the world ; no one knows her birthday or her founder 's name . She has survived the empires and kingdoms which conquered her , ? Nineveh , Babylon , Samaria , Greece , Egypt ? their capitals are dust , but Damascus still blooms " like a tree planted by the rivers of water . " She has given her name to the reddest of roses , the sweetest of plums , the richest of metal-work , and the most lustrous of silks ; her streets have bubbled and eddied with the currents of the multitudinous folk That do inhabit her and make her great . She is the typical city , pure and simple , of the Orient , as New York or San Francisco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edge of the desert , the tradingbooth at the foot of the mountains , the pavilion in the heart of the blossoming bower ? the wonderful offspring of a little river and an immemorial spirit of place . Every time we went into the city ( whether from our tents on the terrace above an ancient and dilapidated pleasure- garden , or from our red-tiled rooms in the good Hotel d'Orient , to which we had been driven by a plague of sand-flies in the camp ) we stepped at once into a chapter of the Arabian Nights ' Entertainments . It is true , there were electric lights , and there was a trolley-car crawling around the city ; but they no more made it Western and modern than a bead necklace would change the character of the Venus of Milo . The driver of the trolley-car looked like one of " The Three Calenders , " and a gayly dressed little boy beside him blew loudly on an instrument of discord as the machine tranquilly advanced through the crowd . ( A man was run over a few months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the next day , pulled the driver from his perch , and stuck a number of long knives through him in a truly Oriental manner . ) The crowd itself was of the most indescribable and engaging variety and vivacity . The Turkish soldiers in blue uniform and red fez ; the cheerful , grinning water-carriers with their dripping , bulbous goatskins on their shoulders ; the white - turbaned Druses with their bold , clean-cut faces ; the bronzed , impassive sons of the desert , with their flowing mantles and bright head-cloths held on by thick dark rolls of camel'shair ; the rich merchants in their silken robes of many colors ; the picturesquely ragged beggars ; the Muslim pilgrims washing their heads and feet , with much splashing , at the pools in the marble courtyards of the mosques ; the merry children , running on errands or playing with the water that gushed from many a spout at the corner of-6. street or on the well of a house ; the veiled Muslim women slipping silently through the throng , or bending over the trinkets or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment to show an olive-tinted cheek and a pair of long , liquid brown eyes ; the bearded Greek priests in their black robes and cylinder hats ; the Christian women wrapped in their long white sheets , but with their pretty faces uncovered , and a red rose or a white jasmine stuck among their smooth , shining black tresses ; the seller of lemonade with his gayly decorated glass vessel on his back and his clinking brass cups in his hand , shouting , " A remedy for the heat , " ? " Cheer up your hearts , " ? " Take care of your teeth " ; the boy peddling bread , with an immense tray of thin , flat loaves on his head , crying continually to Allah to send him customers ; the seller of turnip-pickle with a huge pink globe upon his shoulder looking like the inside of a pale watermelon ; the donkeys pattering along between fat burdens of grass or charcoal ; a much-bedizened horseman with embroidered saddle-cloth and glittering bridle , riding silent and haughty through the crowd as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street at a trot , with whip cracking like a pack of firecrackers , and shouts of , " 0 boy ! Look out for your back ! your foot ! your side ! " ? all these figures mingled in a passing show of which we never grew weary . The long bazaars , covered with a round wooden roof rising from the second story of the houses , were filled with a rich brown hue like a well-colored meerschaum pipe ; and through this mellow , brumous atmosphere beams of golden sunlight slanted vividly from holes in the roof . An immense number of shops , small and great , sheltered themselves in these bazaars , for the most part opening , without any reserve of a front wall or a door , in frank invitation to the street . On the earthen pavement , beaten hard as cement , camels were kneeling , while the merchants let down their corded bales and displayed their Persian carpets or striped silks . The cook-shops showed their wares and their processes , and sent up an appetizing smell of lamb hibiibs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ okra , and many other dainties preparing on diminutive charcoal grills . In the larger and richer shops , arranged in semi-European fashion , there were splendid rugs , and embroideries old and new , and delicately chiselled brasswork , and furniture of strange patterns lavishly inlaid with mother-of-pearl ; and there I went with the Lady to study the art of bargaining as practised between the trained skill of the Levant and the native genius of Walla Walla , Washington . In the smaller and poorer bazaars the high , arched roofs gave place to tattered awnings , and sometimes to branches of trees ; the brown air changed to an atmosphere  | of brilliant stripes and patches ; the tiny shops ( hardly more than open booths ) were packed and festooned with all kinds of goods , garments and ornaments : the chatterers conducted their negotiations from the street ( sidewalk there was none ) or squatted beside the proprietor on the little platform of his stall . The custom of massing the various trades and manufactures added to the picturesque joy of shopping or dawdling in Damascus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of strange fruits . There was a region of dangling slippers , red and yellow , like cherries ; a little farther on we came to a long trellis of clothes , limp and pendulous , like bunches of grapes ; then we passed through a patch of saddles , plain and colored , decorated with all sorts of beads and tinsel , velvet and morocco , lying on the ground or hung  | on wooden supports , like big , fantastic melons . In the coppersmiths ' bazaar there was an incessant clattering of little hammers upon hollow metal . The goldsmiths sat silent in their pens within a vast , dim building , or bent over their miniature furnaces making gold or silver filigree . Here were the carpenters using their bare feet in their work almost as deftly as their fingers ; and yonder the Yet we felt , or imagined that we felt , the hidden presence of passions and possibilities that belong to the tragic side of life underneath this laughing mask of comely . No longer ago than 1860 , in the great massacre , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in two days ; the streets ran with blood ; the churches were piled with corpses ; hundreds of Christian women were dyers festooning their long strips of blue cotton from their windows and balconies ; and down there , on the way to the Great Mosque , the booksellers held together : a dwindling tribe , apparently , for of the thirty or forty shops which were formerly theirs not more than half a dozen remained true to literature , the rest were full of red and yellow slippers . Damascus is more inclined to loafing or to dancing than to reading . It seems to belong to the gay , smiling , easy-going East of Scheherazade and Aladdin , not to the sombre and reserved Orient of fierce mystics and fanatical fatalists. dragged away to Muslim harems ; only the brave AA-el-Nader , with his bodyguard of dauntless Algerine veterans , was able to stay the butchery by flinging himself between the blood-drunken mob and their helpless victims . This was the last wholesale assassination of modern times , and prosperous , pleasure-loving , insouciant Damascus seems to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kurdish shepherds , and fierce Bedouins of the desert , and riffraff of cameldrivers and herdsmen and sturdy beggars and homeless men , among her three hundred thousand people , to make dangerous  | material if the tiger - madness should break loose again . A gay city is not always a safe city . The Lady and I saw a man stabbed to death at noon , not fifty feet away from us , in a street beside the Ottoman Bank . Nothing is safe until justice and benevolence and tolerance and mutual respect are diffused in the hearts of men . How far this inward change has gone in Damascus no one can tell . But that some advance has been made , by real reforms in the Turkish government , by the spread of intelligence and the enlightenment of self-interest , by the sense of newt-doorness to Paris and Berlin and London which telegraphs , railways , and steamships have produced , above all by the useful work of missionary hospitals and schools , and by the humanizing process which has been going on inside of all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that men will still continue to kill each other , for various causes , privately and publicly . But thank God it is not likely to be done often , if ever again , in the name of Religion . The medley of things seen and half understood has left patterns damascened upon my memory with intricate clearness : immense droves of camels coming up from the wilderness to be sold in the market ; factories of inlaid woodwork and wrought brasswork in which hundreds of young children , with beautiful and seeming-merry faces , were hammering and filing and cutting out the designs traced by the draughtsmen who sat at their desks like schoolmasters ; vast mosques with rows of marble columns , and floors covered with bright-colored rugs , and files of men , sometimes two hundred in a line , with a leader in front of them , making their concerted genuflections towards Mecca ; costly interiors of private houses which out- wardly showed bare whitewashed walls , but within welcomed the stranger to hospitality of fruits , coffee , and sweetmeats , in stately rooms ornamented with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fragrant with blossoming orange-trees and musical with tinkling fountains ; tombs of Muslim warriors and saints ? Saladin , the Sultan Beibars , the Sheikh Arslan , the philosopher Ibn-elArabi , great fighters quiet , and restless thinkers satisfied ; public gardens full of rose - bushes , traversed by clear , swift streams , where groups of women sat gossiping in the shade of the trees or in little kiosques , the Mohammedans with their light veils not altogether hiding their olive faces and languid eyes , the Christians and Jewesses with bare heads , heavy necklaces of amber , flowers behind  | their ears , silken dresses of soft and varied shades ; cafes by the river , where grave and important Turks posed for hours on red velvet divans , smoking the successive cigarette or the continuous nargileh ? out of these memory-pictures of Damascus I choose three . The Lady and I are climbing up from the great Mosque of the Ommayyades into the Minaret of the Bride , at the hour of ' Asr , or afternoon prayer . As we tread the worn spiral steps in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the choir of muezzins , high - pitched , longdrawn , infinitely melancholy , calling the faithful to their devotions : " Allah alcbar ! Allah alcbar ! Allah is great ! I testify there is no God but Allah , and Mohammed is the prophet of Allah ! Come to prayer ! " The plaintive notes float away over the city towards all four quarters of the sky and quaver into silence . We come out from the gloom of the staircase into the dazzling light of the balcony which runs around the top of the minaret . For a few moments we can see little ; but when the first bewilderment passes , we are conscious that all the charm and wonder of Damascus are spread at our feet . The oval mass of the city lies like a carving of old ivory , faintly tinged with pink , on a huge table of malachite . The setting of groves and gardens , luxuriant , interminable , deeply and beautifully green , covers a circuit of sixty miles . Beyond it , in sharpest contrast , rise the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; away to the west the snow-crowned bulk of Hermon ; away to the east the low-rolling hills and slumberous haze of the desert . Under these flat roofs and white domes and long black archways of bazaars three hundred thousand folk are swarming ; and there , half emerging from the huddle of decrepit modern buildings and partly hidden by the rounded shed of a bazaar , is the ruined top of a Roman arch of triumph , battered , proud , and indomitable . An hour later we are scrambling up a long , shaky ladder to the flat roofs of the joiners ' bazaar , built close against the southern wall of the Mosque . We walk across the roofs and find the ancient south door of the Mosque now filled up with masonry , and almost completely concealed by the shops above which we are standing . Only the entablature is visible , richly carved with garlands . Kneeling clown , we read upon the lintel the Greek inscription in uncial letters , cut when the Mosque was a Christian church . The Muslims who are bowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the marble pillars below know nothing of this inscription . Few , even of the Christian visitors to Damascus , have ever seen it with their own eyes , for it is difficult to find and reach . But there it still endures and waits , the bravest inscription in the world : " Thy kingdom , 0 Christ , is a kingdom of all ages , and Thy dominion lasts throughout all generations . " From this memorial and forgotten stone my memory turns to the Hospital of the Edinburgh Medical Mission . I see the lovely garden full of roses , columbines , lilies , pansies , sweet peas , strawberries just in bloom . I see the poor people coming in a steady stream to the neat , orderly dispensary ; the sweet , clean wards with their spotless beds ; the merciful candor and completeness of the operating - room ; the patient , cheerful , vigorous , healing ways of the great Scotch doctor , who limps around on his broken leg to minister to the needs of other folk . I see the little group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor 's parlor for an hour of serious , friendly talk , hopeful and happy . And there , amid the murmur of Abana 's rills , and close to the confused and glittering mystery of the Orient , I hear the music of a simple hymn : Dear Lord and Father of us all , Forgive our foolish ways ! Reclothe us in our rightful mind . In purer lives thy service find . In deeper reverence , praise . That is my last memory of Damascus .  |
