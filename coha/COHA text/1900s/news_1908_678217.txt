txt The Arizona " Sidewinder . " A gentle Eastern friend sends me your editorial of Aug. 23 touching the " Sidewinder , " my ancient verses about him . and the modem article in The Metropolitan Magazine by Mr. Coolidge . It may be that since my activities in Arizona they have introduced lath houses for the comfort of- the rattlesnakes. and that Mr. Coolidge has photographed them ' there . I can think of no more distressing ' sight to a humane person than a desert rattlesnake " dropping his jaw and beginning to froth at the mouth . " There used to be in the East a Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals . What is it doing ? t should either palliate the Arizona sun or remove the suffering rattlesnakes to . the cloudier climes east of the Mississippi . But I would like a Coroner 's verdict duly certified as to any Arizona rattlesnake dying of sunstroke . Likewise any lizard , horned toad . Gila monster . " or any other desert reptile for that matter . "   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
