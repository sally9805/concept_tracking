THE friends of America abroad are watching with a good deal of interest the course offer apprenticeship in the government of subject aliens . In England , where the interest is naturally keenest , there is , . to be quite candid , a shade of anxiety mingling with it . After reading and studying the reports of the Philippine Commissions , Englishmen are not yet wholly convinced that Americans are altogether on the right tack , or that their prevision of what lies ahead of them in the archipelago is in all respects complete . Is it necessary to add , considering the difficulty Englishmen find in distinguishing between British practices and the universal laws of nature , that the right tack in this business of - empire-building is , for them , the English tack ? Their claim to be the model imperialists of the age is one , perhaps , that might at certain points be disputed . It is not , for instance , by any means certain that the Russians have not a sounder perception of the lines along which the government of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It may quite conceivably happen that the Russian Empire , when time brings it the administrative perfection of British rule in India , will , by virtue of its strong instinct for autocracy and its freedom from a distorted sentimentality ? its readiness , in a word , to govern the Orient according to Oriental ideas ? really surpass in beneficence and grandeur its British rival . Still , whatever their shortcomings , the claim of Englishmen to speak with some authority on the constructive matters of empire is one that can hardly be gainsaid , nor will an American be likely to dispute it . It  | happens that in the Malay Peninsula , Englishmen have met and solved problems of striking resemblance to those that now confront the Americans in the Philippines ; and while , of course , any one who speaks English must have a constitutional preference for his own mistakes oven other people 's successes , still it may possibly be of some service to point the moral of British rule in Malaya . Englishmen , of course , have no sort of doubt that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that Americans desire . Their confidence in the final capacity of any section of the race for that sort of work is not to . be shaken . But they realize that Americans have some special difficulties to contend with ; that many blunders are inevitable ; and that much time and lab will be wasted unless the accumulated experience of other nations is made use of to guide or warn . Already they see reason for anxiety in the excessive spirit of altruism with which Americans appear to be setting about the business . They suspect American sentimentality and that passion for political proselytizing which is the note of modern democracy as it was of the old absolutism . They suspect , too , the American political system , and note with surprise and almost consternation that , though more than the years have gone by since the close of the war with Spain , nothing in the nature of a stable civil service for the administration of the new possessions is yet apparent . They are not absolutely confident that Congress , when it has got the control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the mistakes that marked the Reconstruction Period in the Southern States and the not wholly creditable tale of American dealings with the Indians ; and they find it hard to believe that the senatorial privilege of passing upon appointments to all Federal offices will prove compatible with an efficient and non-political government of the American Empire . It is not yet thirty years since England began to concern herself at all actively with the . internal affairs of the Malay Peninsula . This is the more remarkable inasmuch as her holdings on the coast date back over a hundred and twenty years . It was in 1786 that Captain Light , an officer in the employ of the East India Company , procured the cession of the island of Penang , off the northwestern coast of the Peninsula . Nine years later the town and territory of Malacca , situated half-way down the western coast , were wrested from the Dutch ; and in 1819 Sir Stamford Raffles , perhaps the most strenuous and prescient empire-builder that England has ever produced and forgotten , acquired the island of Singapore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Company from Calcutta as trading stations and ports  | of call for Indian commerce with China . The Company , already sufficiently preoccupied with India proper , made no effort to carry its authority into the interior . Treaties of trade were from time to time made with the native sultans and rajahs ; but , except for a strip of territory eight miles wide and forty-five long opposite the island of Penang , there was no attempt , either private or official , to add to the Company 's dominions . So careful was the directorate to limit its responsibilities that even piracy event on unchecked , while to the state of affairs in the hinterland of its three possessions the Company paid no heed . This , too , was the policy of the British Government when it took over the Company 's undertaking after the Indian Mutiny and gave to its holdings on and around the Malay Peninsula the cumbrous title of the Straits Settlements . The Downing Street of 1867 had no touch of land-hunger in its composition , and the modern sense of imperialism was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject who ventured into the interior of the Malay Peninsula , for trade or exploration or sport , did so at his own risk and with the foreknowledge that no appeal to the home Government for protection would be listened to ; and to this attitude it steadfastly adhered for the next seven years . In 1874 events proved too strong for official immobility , and showed , as Africa has shown time and again , that a nation which has once begun to expand can not automatically stop . The British settlements on the coast bordered on native states that were always more or less in process of eruption . The year 1874 proved a particularly explosive one . In Perak , in the northwest of the Peninsula , three Malay chiefs were fighting for the sultanate ; and the Chinese immigrants , who worked the tin mines , had got completely out of hand and were plunged into a war of secret societies over the possession of certain mining areas . To any one who has seen or read or can imagine the Asiatic completeness with which such disputes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ description . The entire state was reduced not only to anarchy but almost to starvation . Many of the Chinese took to piracy , and in an encounter two British naval officers were wounded . Lastly , the legitimate ruler of Perak appealed to the Governor of the Straits Settlements at Singapore not only for assistance to assert his position , but for the advice of a British administrator in the future government of his state . The Governor was new and fresh at his work ; and , without troubling to refer the matter home , he promptly called a meeting of the chiefs , recognized the legitimate ruler , and appointed a British Resident to his court , " whose advice , " it was agreed by treaty , " must be asked and  | acted upon in all questions other than those . touching Malay religion and customs . " So the British came to Perak . In Selangor , another native state oz the west coast a little lower down , the same conditions prevailed , but it a milder form . Here , too , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the following year came the turn of Sungei Ujong a small state to the south of Selangor . In 1883 similar relations wen established with a number of diminutive native states that clustered round the borders of Malacca . These states were in 1889 confederates under the name of Negri Sembilan ? the Nine States and six year , later Sungei Ujong was added to them . In 1888 Pahang , on the eas coast , was placed in charge of a Resident ; and in 1895 all territories it the Peninsula acknowledging British protection ? that is to say , Perak Selangor , Negri Sembilan , and Pahang ? were amalgamated for admin. istrative purposes under the title of the Federated Malay States . The Sultan of Johor is now the only independent native ruler in the Penin. sula south of Perak ; and even his independence is of a qualified kind the foreign relations of the state having since 1887 been placed in Brit . ish hands . It is worth noting that though the English have thus s practically complete control of the Peninsula , the Federated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They are not British , but only " under British protection . " It is necessary to reconstruct the states as they were under native rule before we can appreciate the fulness of the change which a handful of Englishmen have brought about . The Peninsula , when they first entered it , was , to begin with , an all but trackless jungle . " Villages which did not lie upon the banks of the same river , though separated from one another by only a few miles of jungle , were so remote that it was a journey of several days ' duration to pass from one to the other . Vast tracts of stanniferous land were rendered inaccessible through lack of facilities for transport . The natural wealth of the country was thus hermetically sealed . " The states were administered on a system of Oriental feudalism . The hereditary Sultan owned all the territory over which his rule extended . He was not only the richest man , the greatest trader , banker , and capitalist of the state , but the supreme judge and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in cruelty and sensuality ; his power over life and death was absolute and unquestioned . Under him were the Orang Besar , the great barons who held districts in fief . Then came a Council of Eight in charge of a subdistrict , and on a still lower grade were the village headmen .  | The basis of the pyramid was the peasant . He was free to hold land , to redeem and cultivate any portion of the jungle that took his fancy ; but he was granted no title to his clearing , and an envious chief might at any moment dispossess him . He paid no rent , but was obliged to pay taxes , to follow his chieftain to battle , to work for him without payment , and to attend in his train when he went to Court . The greatest misfortune that could befall him was a piece of good luck . A plentiful crop , a comely wife or daughter , the finding of a nugget in the river bed ? such things marked him out as a man worth spoiling , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liable for service in the field ; for the Sultan , professionally jealous of the great barons , took infinite pains and pleasure in stirring up strife among them . Justice , of course , went to the highest bidder ; the prisons and the tortures were entirely Asiatic ; and the Sultan 's bodyguard , composed of youths drawn from the families of the higher chiefs , took upon themselves all the privileges of an army in a conquered territory . The regular taxes were a polltax of two dollars ( Mexican ) for every adult male , and import and export duties of ten per cent , either in money or kind , on everything that came in or went out of the state . In addition the were what were known as Sultan 's " gifts " ? silks and cloths sent from the Palace to the great barons with a price fixed upon each article . No sooner was a chieftain in receipt of one of these dubious presents than he at once fell upon the villagers for the price of it . Many of the necessaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil , were royal monopolies . Outside of these official exactions the local nobility and the Sultan 's police plundered with microscopic zeal . This is the mere outline of a : picture which any one familiar with the inner workings of a Mohammedan state can fill in for himself . To Western eyes it seems gruesome enough ; but it would be rash to infer from it that the Malays were unhappy or felt themselves abused . They were hardly civilized enough to have such thoughts . The system , for one thing , was of immemorial antiquity , and the Malay is a Tory of the Tories . He had known nothing else ; he could conceive of nothing else . His fatalism , his utter faith in the thing that was simply because it was the thing that had been , and his climatic inertia kept him quiescent . His needs were of the simplest , and he could always refer to Allah some more than usually wanton act of pillage by the Sultan or his chiefs . Moreover , he was doubtless yet further reconciled to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the low . He had the privilege of racial contempt for the Chinese immigrants and for the aborigines of the  | soil ; and he was at least a free man , and so long as he could keep out of debt would remain so . Slavery existed in all the native states of the Peninsula ; the slaves being either imported negroes purchased from Arabian merchants by those who had made the pilgrimage to the Holy City , or aborigines captured in war , or Malays who had sold themselves into slavery to extinguish a debt . So , roughly , the thing stood , a true type of Oriental despotism ? the Sultan and the dominant chiefs bent only on personal indulgences , clad in fine raiment and absorbed in Palace intrigues , and at the other end of the scale the peasantry whose sole function it was to supply the necessary funds . When the British went to Perak in 1874 they knew little of the interior of the Peninsula as Americans in 1897 knew of the Philippines . There were no maps of the country and no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the coast the Peninsula figured as a place where fighting was always going on , and as little else . Even the names of the different states and the titles of their rulers were barely known . Add to this that the new administrators were white men going where , except for an occasional sportsman or explorer , white men had never been before ; that they were Christians dumped down among a Mohammedan populace ; that they came to alter and pull down in the midst of a people whose favorite proverb is , " Let our children rather than our customs die " ; that they represented all the horror of the new and unknown in a country whose inhabitants had a detestation of change bred into their very bones ; and , finally , that they went unarmed and with no visible support in the background into territories ablaze with anarchy , where the poorest native habitually carried from three to five weapons . From the peasantry , who looked upon them as a , fresh scourge rather than as deliverers , the newcomers received no support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to supervise , openly and sincerely thwarted them . The first British Resident appointed to Perak was murdered within a year , and a " punitive expedition " was despatched to avenge him . No attempt was made to occupy the entire state . The main rivers only were held , and the natives were incessantly assured that the occupation would last only until the murderers and the men behind them were surrendered . In eighteen months justice had been done , every British soldier had left the state , and the Malays had learned two things : first , that there was a force in the background ; and second , that the English officers could be trusted to keep their word . It is something in dealing with Asiatics to have taught either lesson , but for final and comprehensive success both are needed . The Dutch , after  | nearly thirty years of struggle , have impressed neither upon the Acheenese . The Americans , it is to be feared , have so far only partially succeeded in impressing the first upon the Filipinos ; the second , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What happened in Perak happened more or less in the other native states that came under British protection . There were no more outrages to exact punishment for and no more actual hostilities ; but everywhere the state of mind was the same ? the same suspiciousness , the same anxious and resentful forebodings . Then , slowly , came a hard-won confidence , and , on the heels of it , a few cautious reforms , laying the foundations of better things . And here it seems right to summarize rapidly the bloodless revolution wrought by this handful of Englishmen in the Peninsula , reserving to a later paragraph some examination of their methods . In 1875 the total revenue of Perak was estimated at $113,116 ; it is now almost $4,000,000 . In 1875 that of Selangot was $57,825 ; it is now nearly $3,500,000 . The combined revenue of the four states in 1889 , when Pahang came under British protection , was , roughly , $2,500,000 ; at this moment it is slightly over $8,000,000 . The first year for which trustworthy figures of trade values @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is 1882 . The imports and exports of these three states amounted then to $5,600,000 ; in 1900 they were valued ' at over $48,000,000 . These figures may be more conveniently summarized thus : under British protection the revenue of the states has multiplied forty times over , and the value of their import and export trade has within the last twenty years risen 900 per cent . In 1875 there was not a single mile of cart road ; there are now 1,500 miles , and over 1,000 miles of bridle paths . In 1875 there were no railroads ; before the present year is out there will be 364 miles in working order . Education under native rule was confined to learning to read the Koran by rote , and a Malay who could read or write was a curiosity . There are now 193 vernacular and state-aided schools , with 8,092 scholars . Hospitals were formerly unknown institutions , and cholera and smallpox ran their course unchecked . There are to-day government free hospitals throughout the states , exclusive of jail hospitals and lunatic asylums ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population has increased over 60 per cent in the last ten years ; the Malays alone having risen from 230,090 in 1891 to 313,763 in 1901 . A regular police force nearly 2,000 strong , officered by about 40 Europeans , has taken the place of the predatory bodyguard of the old days ; and a highly efficient regiment of Malay State  | Guides , consisting of 12 European officers and 632 natives , is in constant training . As there are still many Americans who do not understand the principles on which the British Empire is run , it may be as well to remark , in passing , that Great Britain derives from these results no benefit that may not be shared in by any other nation on equal terms ; that English traders have no preferential advantages over German or American traders in entering Malay ports ; that all the revenue derived from the Peninsula is spent on the Peninsula ; that no " tribute " of any kind is exacted ; and that the cost of the Civil Establishment ? that is to say , of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than fourteen per cent of the total revenue . But the results indicated above in no way exhaust the list , which might be extended to cover almost all the material necessities of a well-regulated state ? wharves , harbors , drainage , irrigation works , government offices , prisons , and so on . It is not , however , by such things that the British protectorate is solely to be judged . What has been its effect on the people , from the peasant to the Sultan ? The reply is that it has brought to the rulers an entirely new sense of their duties ; that they are no longer cruel and selfish voluptuaries , but recognize that they owe something to their subjects ? a something that can be best discharged by showing a personal interest in their lot and furthering the good works promoted by their British advisers . And to the peasant , the raiat , " the real Malay , " British rule has given a security of life and property of which in the old days he knew nothing . It has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road and rail it has opened up undreamed-of markets for his labor and his produce . It offers him free education for his children , free hospital treatment and medicines in illness , and banks where he may deposit at interest his small earnings . It has abolished slavery and piracy . It has practically put an end to the scourges of smallpox and cholera ; it has established the reign of law and equity throughout the land ; it has made the raiat the equal of his rajah in the eyes of the court . It helps him to drain and irrigate his paddy fields ; it contributes to the cost of erecting his mosque ; it has opened to him offices in the government service with fixed salaries and pensions attached ; and it has freed him from arbitrary taxation , forced levies , and compulsory labor . In return , the peasant contributes merely- an annual quit-rent of about twenty-five cents an acre . If he is not a landowner , and regards the Law of the Prophet to the extent of abstaining from opium and spirits , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , clothes , ma- chinery , and so forth , reach him duty free , and no duty is levied on his exportation of paddy . In short , the only complaint he can in fairness bring against his British rulers is that they have not made him work ; and that is a complaint no Malay would bring against any one . And how has it all been done ? The secret is not wholly communicable , for largely it is a matter of individuals and of individual characters . System at first had very little to do with the redemption of the Malay Peninsula . The foundations were laid by the good sense , tact , and patience of perhaps half a dozen Englishmen who were set down on the Peninsula as one might throw a dog into the sea , and left to sink or swim . They knew nothing of the country , and had only a vague idea of the work before them . Herein they had no advantage over American administrators in the Philippines ; but they had learned , what Americans have had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were versed in Asiatic lore , and in other posts they had proved themselves the men for rulership . Moreover , without exception these men were gentlemen , both in the right and in the conventional sense . It is said that the Malays are all gentlemen ; certainly no one who is not a gentleman need try to win their confidence . The British Residents were one and all men of refinement and good manners , who would no more think of swaggering before Malays than in an English drawing-room ; who had that power of dramatic sympathy which enables its possessor to enter into the feelings and thoughts of all with whom he has to deal ; who went among the people they were to lead out of the darkness not despising them or their customs , but with all prejudices of blood and race laid aside , just treating them as human beings who , given the chance , would gradually respond like any others to firmness , tact , and a friendly hand . These men lived for their work ; not a few died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and made their ways and beliefs . and idiosyncrasies their first study . They lived among them alone , seeing no white faces except those of their subordinates , and putting all the recreations and pleasures of civilized life far from them . They threw themselves into the task of making Malaya as a business man throws himself into making money ; and they trained the officers under them to do likewise . They were given a free hand ; and while , of course , they knew that , except for proved incapacity , their position was secure and that they might look forward to a pension at the end of their career , and possibly a knighthood and a G.C.M.G. , what really braced them up and  | carried them through was sheer love of the work and determination to make it a success . Men of this kind are not to be manufactured off-hand ; and Americans , no doubt , will make many experiments and many changes before they get ' the right men for the responsible posts in the Philippines . When they are found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to go for anything ? except for fully proved offences . They should be allowed to solve the problems before them in their own way , with as little interference as possible from Manila , and none at all from Washington ; and they should be assured of the certainty of an adequate pension . There should be at the same time set up in the United States a stable , competitive , high-salaried , absolutely non-political colonial service that would attract the best men from Harvard , Yale , and other universities , and send across the Pacific successive batches of recruits to learn their business at the feet of their superiors . But it is not enough to get the best men ; they must work along sound lines . Their policy , in other words , as well as their personality must commend itself to the native mind if success is to be the result ; and under this heading there is not a little worth the study of Americans in British rule in Malaya . Long experience in the Orient had taught the English Residents that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , perhaps , is the first and most difficult lesson that Americans will have to learn . They were in no hurry to reform ; and if they had any notions about " educating the Malayans in self-government , " they wisely kept them to themselves . Instead they began , very quietly and without fuss , to deal out an even-handed and inflexible justice . This is the greatest novelty that can be offered to an Oriental , but it is one he quickly appreciates . Crime of every serious kind , whether committed by a peasant or a village headman or a baron or at the instigation of the Sultan , was rigorously punished ; and the peasantry slowly came to realize that , thanks to the white men , they could no longer be plundered . That brought the bulk of the people over to the side of the Resident . At the same time the dignity of the Sultan and his officers was most carefully consulted ; and the peasant quickly learned that , even under the new regime , the usual ceremonies of respect had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ native potentates were confirmed in their positions , and a liberal income was allowed them . The fiction that the Englishmen were only there to " advise " has never to this day been torn aside . All orders , proclamations , and laws are still issued in the Sultan 's name ; and no chief has had reason to complain of being ignored or slighted ,  | or of having his importance diminished . The Sultan presides over the State Council , on which sit the more important native rulers and some Chinese ; and there he deals with all legislation , appoints native headmen , and settles their allowances . So far as is possible , all the lower grades of the civil service are filled by Malays . In fact , the detailed work of administration is almost entirely performed by them ; and even on the bench there are not a few native judges who have learned from the British how to deal fairly between man and man . There was one sphere of Malay life in which the British Residents pledged themselves by treaty not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observances were left untouched . For the rest , habits and manners and customs were changed , when they were changed at all , only with infinite caution : - Much that was opposed to Western instincts was allowed to remain as it was ; public gambling house even to-day being under government protection . There was no cataclysmal stroke of reform ; but from time to time the better way was pointed out , and the Malays were urged gently along it . Civilization advanced evenly and almost imperceptibly , and the ground was patiently prepared beforehand . The English realized that the limits within which it is wise , or even possible , to Occidentalize the Orient are of disappointing rigidity . It will certainly be necessary , though perhaps a little painful , for Americans also to realize it . You may have a good deal too much of " the principles of 1776 " in the government of Asiatics , and the results in such cases are not satisfactory . There is a terrible temptation in the notion of " spreading the American idea , " and bestowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest of the paraphernalia on the benighted Filipinos . The English have felt the same sort of temptation in India ; and wherever they have succumbed , both they and their subjects have been the worse for it . The Malay Peninsula , is a golden object-lesson in the value of " going slow . " Gladstonianism in the tropics is altogether as out of place and as harmful as " Jeffersonian doctrines . " The English in Malaya took the better course when , dropping all prejudices in favor of this political theory or of that , they looked the facts squarely in the face and considered how they might be bettered . And the defective altruism that would explode " democracy " upon the Orient is , as it seems to onlookers , one of the gravest dangers that lies ahead of the American venture in the Philippines . In this as in other matters the English rulers of the Peninsula have shown an admirable dispassionateness . The wealth of the Peninsula ,  | for instance , lies in its deposits of tin , which the Malays are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once made it their business to attract the Chinese and Indian coolies , through whose labor and capital it has come about that five-sixths of the world 's supply of tin is shipped from the Peninsula , and that a small export duty on the mineral raises threequarters of the state 's revenue . Americans , perhaps , have acted similarly , but it is to be noticed that they have already restricted Chinese immigration into Hawaii , for no other reason than that they object to Chinamen at San Francisco ; and there would seem to be a chance that their prejudices may before long stretch across the remainder of the Pacific to the Philippine Archipelago . It is not , therefore , inappropriate to point out how ably British rule in the Malay Peninsula has exemplified the two pivotal principles that should regulate the government of an Eastern dependency by a Western people . The one principle recognizes that , after all , the East is the East and requires a large dose of Eastern treatment ; while the other lays it down that a dependency should be administered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than of those who own it .  |
