txt That a murderer whose mind is perfectly sound , if he possesses a talent for acting and a few assistants to help him make-up the part , can deceive the most expert alienists into pronouncing him insane was shown in General Sessions yesterday , when Martin J. Tighe was tried for the murder of his wife on June 13 , 1901 . Tighe has been confined in the Matteawan Asylum for the Criminal Insane for the last five years , but when a witness for the prosecution told how the murderer had successfully fooled the Lunacy Commission into send him there , the prisoner at once threw up the sponge and pleaded guilty to manslaughter in the first degree . Recorder Goff immediately sentenced him to nineteen years and ten months in State prison . This is only two months short of the maximum sentence . The testimony which caused this sensational climax to the trial came as a surprise to the defense , which was entirely unprepared for it . It was furnished by an Italian named Andrea Cuoco , who was Tighe 's cellmate while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself le serving a life term in Sing Sing , having been sentenced soon after Tighe was committed to the asylum . A month ago he wrote to Assistant District Attorney Garvan , who had charge of Tighe 's case , revealing to him the startling facts which he could disclose on the witness stand. , When called to the stand yesterday by Mr. Garvan he told the whole story in full . Story of Tighe 's Ceilmate . " Tighe was in the same cell with ins all the time he was in the Tombs , and made me his confidant in all he did , " said Cuoco . " From the very first day of his arrival he seemed to have a plan of campaign ready to hoodwink the experts , and all along he was confident of success . " He must have got instructions from some one how to act , because he was per fectly sure he was doing the right thing to make people think he was crazy . When alone with me he was just as sensible as any one else , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playing his tricks . " One of his favorite stunts when the doctors had their eyes on him was to walk into a wall as if it were not there , and then , when they told him what the matter was he would laugh fit to kiLi . In the courtroom he would sit still , and then all of a sudden grab hold of his shoes and try to taker them off . la they stopped this in time he would wait a minute and then do his best to pull off his trousers . " In conversation with any one who was not a confederate he would tell a lot of foolish stories , of the ' pipe dream ' kind . ' Wait till you see my new racing stable , ' he 'd cry . And ' Maybe I wo n't have a swell stud farm I Come and see me same day , and I 'll take you over it . ' " After telling a few such tales he would come back to the cell and laugh at the people he had taken in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declared insane by a commission appointed at the request of James W. , now a Municipal Justice , who was then Tighe 's counsel . Judge Newburger appointed the commission . It was composed of James F. Ahearn , now Borough President ; Lawyer Abraham Stern , and Dr. J. M. Lieberman . The experts summoned to pass upon the man 's mental condition included these distinguished alienists : Dr. Charles L. Dana , who has been retained by the defense in the Thaw case ; Dr. George W. Jacoby , Dr. M. P. Byrne , Superintendent of the City Insane Asylum , and Dr. Emmet C. Dent , Superintendent of the Manhattan State Hospital for the Insane . Dr. Dana was regarded as the . representative of the District Attorney 's office , and he was supposed to be particularly watchful for ady trickery on the part of the prisoner . That an authority on nervous diseases and insanity of Dr. Dana 's standing should have fallen a victim to Tighe 's artifices was the subject of eager comment Ina the Criminal Courts Building yesterday , and the tenor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on expert testimony of tide character was not favorable . Before this commission , with its array of medical talent , the prisoner was forced to appear at frequent intervals . It appears , however , that he was always " tipped off " a few days ahead , so that he had a chance to make his rather elaborate preparations . His cellmate , Cuoco , told yesterday of some of the things he did . Recipe for Feigning Insanity . " During all his stay in prison Tighe lived on nothing but lemons and honey , " said Cuoco . " Once in a while he ate a little of my own food , but mostly It was lemon and honey . This diet was supposed to make him like an insane man . His skin got irritable , so that when any one touched it , even with a fingernail , a red welt appeared . He told me that other desirable symptoms were produced by the diet . " Then , when an examination was expected , I used to rub him down with a liniment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scaly . We would do this together , rubbing carefully over his neck , chest , and arms . Also , to increase his nervousness , he forced himself to go without sleep for two or three nights. - " After the doctors had looked him over , and applied their tests , which included sticking his skin with a needle , he 'd come back to the cell and tell me how easy it was . " ' This thing is a cinch. ' he 'd say . ' I 'll fool the whole lot of these fellows . ' And he 'd slap me on the back at the fun of it . " Cuoco testified that the lemons and honey were brought to the prison by Tighe 's mother . She denied this on the stand . Who were the others that helped to perpetrate the swindle is not known , nor how the man got the advance information of the commission 's intentions . Tighe often boasted to Cuoco of his great " pull . " Th% Warden of the Tombs at that time was James J. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Assembly District . Unanimous Vote on the Case . Tighe was committed to Matteawan by unanimous vote of the commissioners who investigated his case . He remained there until a few weeks ago when he was declared cured . The extent to which he deceived the men who originally sent him to the asylum maybe seen from this passage in the report of the commission to Judge Newburger : The experts nave testified that while some of the symptoms displayed by Tighe might be shammed singly , the conditions of the pupils of the eyes and of the skin and the reflex action could not be feigned . All these symptoms taken together could not be shammed unless the prisoner were one of the most remarkable actors that ever lived . " Louis Stuyvesant Chanler. counsel for Tighe , tried to show that Cuoco 's testimony was actuated by a desire for a reward , but the witness declared with apparent sincerity that his conscience had stricken him so at the thought of concealing what he knew that he had felt compelled to come forward . Mr. Chanler said that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guilty finally made by Tighe. but despite his statement , Cuoco 's surprising disclosures are generally regarded as having been the sole cause of the trial 's sudden termination . " Emotional Insanity " Useless . It was pointed out at the office of Lewis Stuyvesant Chanler after the prisoner had been sentenced and was in the Tombs that the evidence of Tighe 's simulation of insanity left the defense in a hopeless position . It had been testified by the experts that if the prisoner was insane at the time of the crime he would be insane now , and if he was sane now he was sane when he murdered his wife . His counsel could n't even plead " emotional insanity " for him . So all Mr. Chanler could do v as to advise him to plead guilty of manslaughter in the first degree . Experts Stick to Their Verdict . Of the alienists cc.ncerned in recent important murder cases only Dr. Dana , Dr. Allen Hamilton , and Dr. Carlos F. could be found to elicit their opinions on the testimony . Dr. Dana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he examined Tighe the man was suffering from primary dementia . I examined Tighe three times , " said Dr. Dana , " and I noticed about - drn certain signs , which I do not think he could possibly have simulated . There was a dilation of one pupil of the eye and a twitching of the muscles of the eyes , which are characteristic of insanity . The muscles of the whole of his body also twitched , and a rash came out on his body , Our opinion was based upon these pliycal symptoms and upon the bearing end physiognomy of the man . Ca n't Be , Dr. Dana Avers. ' ? -4 have not at hand the report I made to the District Attorney 's office and so I can not say now , after several years , how strongly it Worded my opinion , but I have no doubt that Tighe was insane at the time . zt would have been very remarkable if he bad succeeded in imposing on the other physicians and myself , but it would be still more extraordinary If he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under close surveillance for years . " Dr. Dana admitted that a man accused of a serious crime like murder might be suffering more severely from primary dementia after he had been locked up in jail for a time than at the actual moment of the crime . " In cases where a man goes through much mental and physical stress , " he said . " such as would be induced by the circinnstanoes surrounding a murder , and his arrest and imprisonment afterward , he may suffer from such great bodily and mental exhaustion as to prod-ace what we call primary dementia . " " Then , considering the mental strain caused by the arrest and preparations for trial , it might well happen that the dementia might be greater at the time of the examination than at the moment of the murder , might It not ? " was suggested . Certainly it might , " replied Dr. Dana . ' Recovered Since , Dr. Hamilton Says . Dr. Hamilton , who , like Dr. Dana , is one of the principal experts retained by the defense in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain number of cases primary dementia was curable . He presumed that in the years Tighe had spent in Matteawan he had recovered his reason . ? ' I do not put much faith , " he said , " in the evidence of Cuoco . It Is the word of an ignorant Italian convict , who no doubt has his own ends to serve , against the professional opinion of several competent men . " " In severe cases dementia involves complete dulling of all feelings and faculties . A little while ago in Brooklyn there was an Instance in which the patient could be burned with red-hot irons without showing any signs of feeling . If a man Ina any sense of sensation , he can not restrain himself from jumping if ho , has a pin run into him suddenly , and there are other reflex actions of the muscles quite beyond control I do not see how Tighe could have simulated lack of response to these involuntary impulses if he did not really possess ' t As for the diet of lemons and honey , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that seems to me to be the sort of yarn which an uneducated Italian would invent . " But Dr. Is Convinced . Dr. , who was not one of the alienists who examined Tighe , had this to say : " In my opinion . Tighe was never insane . I believe lie was shamming at al : stages . The records show that Tighe passed the physical examination for admission into the army in 1 .. 418 at the outbreak of the Spanish-American war . That test is esp , clally rigid relative to possible insa atty . Tighe got through . The report of the physicians examining him after the murder held that he had primary dementia , and had had for a long time . I do not see how that could be possible in view of the successful examination passed by Tighe before the United States Army surgeons . " This man Tighe , it seems , has been a fakir for a long time . Even when in the army he resorted to deception , At one time he overstayed a leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than he over it . Tighe said never mind , he could find some excuse . He produced a doctor 's certificate that he had had cholera morbus . " Of course , the certificate was forged , but it passed muster for a time . Some of the other soldiers told him he might be put in the guardhouse . Tighe replied that he would soon get out of there . " ' What will you do ? ' the soldiers asked . What will I do ? ' said Tighe . " ' I 'll bite the iron bars and put a stick out between them and pretend I 'm fishing . ' " A letter afterward found bore Tighe 's testimony that his ruses were successfuL " I have learned that Cuoco provided Tighe with food in the Tombs when all was quiet , and the prisoners had been locked up for the night . " Tighe told this prison companion that after killing his wife his first thought was of the electric chair . Therefore he hacked his throat slightly . He also carried out his sham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to purchase . " Tighe had been in Matteawan only a very few days before he showed a lively interest in the entertainments , especially those of a musical character . He learned stenography while there . That was certainly unusual for a. man who was supposed to be insane . " But Is Silent About Thaw . Dr. would not discuss the Tighe case revelations in relation to the Thaw case or to the general subject of expert testimony as to insanity . It is not easy to fool physicians who are accustomed to examine criminals , " was all he would say about that . ARRESTED AS A HOTEL CROOK , Hotel Detective Gathers In a Feeble Old Man as " John Scott . " John Mulholland , house detective at the Fifth Avenue Hotel , took to the Tenderloin Station last night an old man on the suspicion that he was a crook . He had flowing white hair and beard and leaned heavily on r cane . " This man . I believe , " said Mulholland , " is John Scott , the famous hotel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotel , said that just after 6 o'clock the old man asked him for the key to Room 2L Newton asked him his name , and the man said it was Peck . The clerk knew that the suite was occupied by G. W. White , a Baltimore man , who put up at the hotel a few days ago . Newton questioned the man and he became embarrassed and attempted to leave the hotel . At the station the man said he was John Peck , 63 years old , of Connecticut . Mulholland handed the Sergeant a picture of Scott , the hotel crook . Only a slight resemblance was noticed between the old man and the picture . Scott 's height was given as 5 feet 7 inches , while the old man was 8 inches taller . The police believe that Mulholland is mistaken . Peck was held on suspicion and will be taken to Police Headquarters this morning .
