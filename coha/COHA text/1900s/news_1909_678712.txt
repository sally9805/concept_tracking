txt Dr. Frederick A. Cook , the explorer , according to a report last night , is to sail this morning under an assumed name for a sojourn in Southern Europe to recover his health after the strain of his lecture tour and the preparation of his records for the University of Copenhagen . This report followed a declaration by H. Wellington Wad : , counsel to the explorer . that a diabolical conspiracy discovered by Dr. Cook and his friends to steal the data of the explorer 's polar trip had been frustrated by shipping them to Copenhagen on another steamer than that previously announced . A TIMES reporter was informed last night that the doctor had made all plans to leave town to-day , and that he was going to Naples for an indefinite stay . The explorer 's baggage was removed en Thursday from the Hotel Gramatana in Bronxville , where he went immediately after returning from his trip westward , which ended in his being confronted at ' Hamilton , Mon. , by Edward N. Barrill , the Mount guide . The baggage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Line pier and put aboard the Caronia . On Wednesday Dr. Cook took out a foreign letter of credit for $15,000 through the Carnegie Trust Company . He has had an account with this company since his return from his arctic trip . He will use this letter during his trip abroad . His friends explain the present trip by saying that Dr. Cook is in a highly nervous condition . , There was some indication of overwrought nerves in the conspiracy story as presented yesterday by his counsel , Mr. Wach . His friend , Charles Wake of 16 East Sixtieth Street , said that Cook had worked so hard on the data for Copenhagen that rest was imperative . When asked the reason for all the secrecy about Dr. Cook 's plans Mr. Wake said , he could n't talk about that . Mrs. Cook will accompany the doctor . their two children remaining here , attending a private school . Mrs. Cook , it is said , has been eager to get her husband out of the city and away from all care . Only Part of Records @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a statement by Lawyer Wach , that the records sent to Copenhagen with 30,000 words of explanatory comment comprise only the data of the trip to the pole . The records of the trip back were left with the instruments in care of Harry Whitney at E tah . To this was added last night the information that In addition to the records and explanatory matter Dr. Cook sent to Copenhagen fifteen or more affidavits about the Mount climb . Agents of the explorer obtained these affidavits. last October in Montana . One of them is from a resident of Tacoma , who swore that Barrill , the guide , offered on Oct. 1 to make affidavit that he and Dr. Cook had been to the top of Mount . Two days after this Barrill made his affidavit stating that Cook did not climb to ' the top of . There is another affidavit found . A lawyer of Tacoma stated that a bank clerk of that city told him that Barrill had spoken of getting $1,500 to make the affidavit against Cook . This bank clerk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such an affidavit . Other affidavits that Dr. Cook has sent to the Copenhagen savants are from old neighbors of Barrill 's in Darby , Mont. , who say that Barrill often told them that he and Cook had scaled Mount . Dr. Cook was not asked by the Danish scientists to send any proof of the Mount climb . It was explained last night that he was so deeply concerned over the attacks on his veracity that he had decided to ship the batch of affidavits anyway . Wack Tels of the Plot . ? t Almost any minute , H. Wellington : Wack , lawyer , of 40 Broadway , expects so he said yesterday , to get a wireless ; message from ' Walter Lounsdale . Dr. , Cook 's secretary , who Is aboard the United States of the Scandinavian-Ameret : loan Line , on his way to Copenhagen , ' saying that an attempt has been made to drug Lounsdale in a plot to rob him of Dr. Cook 's observations on his trip to . Ward the north pole . Mr. Week asserted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a conspiracy to steal the explorer 's proofs , which are to go to the scientists of the University of Denmark , at Copenhagen , for analysis . It tickled Mr. ' Wank , he declared yesterday , to know that the plot would fail , for the records are not in Lounsdaie 's possession at all . The public ' was permitted to think they were , because Mr. Week , as Dr. Cook 's counsel , wanted to throw the conspirators off the track , As a matter of fact , so Mr. Wack eiplained , the records were sent off , quietly and under special guard , several days before Mr. Lounsdale sailed . They will ' be , secretly conveyed to the scientists at Copenhagen as soon as the steamer lands there . To prevent any possible upset m this plan , Mr. Week yesterday positively ' refused to reveal the name of the steamer which is carrying them . " To tell you what steamer it is would only mean that the conspirators would be on the alert when the ship landed at Copenhagen , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely , an effort would be made fci rob the messengers who have them as they stepped from the steamer . No , n:e are guarding this matter carefully , mid do n't intend that there shall be any slip-up . " Details of Diabolism . Mr. Week unfolded to Tile TIMES reporter some details of the " plot " to rob Lounsdale , as they had reached him . He insisted that this information came from " absolutely reliable sources " and that there was " really in existence " one of , the most diabolical plots that had even been hatched against an explorer or any other man . " According to Mr. Week 's information , two women and a man have been hired by agents of some persons hostile to Dr. Cook actually to poison young Lounsdale . He has it that they boarded the United States when it sailed on Thursday , and that they were loaded . down with drugs that would do the despicable work for which they were engaged . The plan was . so Mr ' Week explained , for the women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young man  --  a former secretary to Minister Maurice Francis Egan at Copenhagen . Well , they were to flirt with Lounsdale , as the plot goes , and get him interested in champagne . ' Then , at a propitious moment , the wine was to be drugged and as Lounsdale lay oblivious to everything , his stateroom was to be ransacked in the plot to steal the records . But they will be fooled , badly fooled , " went on Mr. Wack . " When Lounsdale went to the ship he had with him a package that was only a dummy . It was fixed up to look as though it held records and the joke is that there were no records in it . " " Did Mr. Lounsdale know of this plot ? " ' was as ' : ed Ah , yes . he knew of it , " replied Mr. , Wack . " He knew all about it , for I told him and he went on the ship prepared for the worst . " " Will he drink the poisoned champagne ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , decidedly not , " he replied . " He is n't going to let them drug him . He 's too smart for that . " " You have not heard from him since the sailed ? " " Not a word yet , " replied Mr. Wack , " but I am expecting a wireless any time that the plot has been attempted and failed . " Strange Eyes Watched Cook . Mr. Wack told the reporter that three ; private detectives watched Dr. Cook dur'big his recent stay at the Hotel Gramsten , in Bronxvilte . They were spies hired by " the opposition , " Mr. Wack explained , : and their business was to sit around seeJag what the explorer did If they had bad a chance , Mr. Wack intimated , they would probably have stolen the arctic data . Who engaged them ? " the reporter ' asked . Mr. Wack gave a knowing wink . " Who ? " he repeated . ' You ask me who ? I 'm not mentioning any names , but I could if I wanted to . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cook 's records ? " The reporter admitted that he could n't guess . Well , we have the evidence of the plot . ' all right , and we 'll expose it at the proper time , " declared Mr. Wack . " What would be the object In stealing the records ? " asked the reporter . Mr. Wack looked disgusted . " The object ? " he cried . " Why that is perfectly plain . Suppose Dr. Cools an ' nounced that the data that would prove he had discovered the north pole  --  the ? original data  --  had been stolen on its way . to Copenhagen . What would the people say ? They would say that Dr. Cook was , faking , would n't they ? They would say he had fixed up a story because he did n't really have the data . They would be ant ' to call his integrity in question . Dr. Cook saw all that . We all saw it . We talked it over and decided on this scheme of ours ? to circumvent the plot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked the reporter . Mr. Wack smiled amiably . Ca n't Catch a Wack- Napping . " Maybe they thought we were fools , " he said . ' " Maybe they thought we would be caught asleep . But we did some work of our own . We hired detectives to watch their detectives . Our detectives came across evidence of the plot . Not alone that , but we received a letter from a prominent scientist telling of the plot . We got a lot more letters bearing on it . Oh . we have plenty of evidence . " Asked if he would reveal the name of the scientist who had given warning of the plot , Mr. Wack replied : " Not at this time . It will all come out in its turn . I want to see what happens in the next few days . If Lounsdale sends a wireless saying they have tried to drug him then it will bear out what I have told you , and I will consider making the whole plot public . " Mr. Wack insisted that he wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and resented a suggestion that maybe there was no plot after all . He told the reporter that Dr. Cook left the Hotel Gramatan last Wednesday because of worry over the plot and general breakdown incident to the hard work he had put in getting his data ready for the scrutiny of the Copenhagen scientists . The doctor is now at the home of a friend , where , Mr. Wack said , he is trying to get his shattered nerves into shape again . " You know , Dr. Cook has n't had any rest since he came out of the North , " said Mr. Wack . " He was feted at Copenhagen and lost a lot of sleep . When he came here he found that arrangements had been made for dinners and a lecture tour . He had to receive hundreds of callers , and all that , with his other obligtions , wore out his strength . The doctor had fed on nothing but pemmican for two years or more , and he was n't used to the rich food they gave him at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add to his troubles . Cook Not a Business Man . " When the storm of criticism broxe Dr. Cook was in the midst of his lecture engagements , most of which had been arranged for when he landed in Copenhagen . He was not a business man and did n't know that he was tying himseif up with contracts . Well , when things got so bad , all the criticism and everything going on , Iadvised Dr. Cook to stop his lecture tour at once and go at his data . On my advice he cut out contracts that called for $104,000 in lectures . " Mr. Wack was asked how much Dr. Cook had made out of the lectures he had give before he stonped to start at his proofs . He did not care to tell that . but he did say that Dr. Cook now is " just about even . " " When Dr. Cook arrived in Copenhagen he did not know that he was without means , " said Mr. Wack . " While he was away the Knickerbocker Trust Com , pang failed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was gone . The , mortgage on their house in Brooklyn had been foreclosed and the Cook family was in straits . Dr. Cook set to work at once , as soon as money began coming in from the lectures , to straighten out the debts that existed . It was not long before he settled up all he owed . How much he has ahead I do n't know . I do n't think it 's very much . " Mr. Wack drifted back to the data of Dr. Cook 's observations on the trip toward the pole , and , the reporter asked why the explorer did not leave them at Copenhagen when he reached there . " Yes , he might have done that . " as- I sented Mr. Wack , " but , as I have said , he is a bad business man . Probably he did n't think that it would have been a good thing to do . " Only Halt the Data Available . The explorer 's counsel informed the re . porter that Dr. Cook had sent to Coven- I hagen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the north pole . These I he took on his way back , he said , are in the cache at Etah , where they were left by Harry Whitney . the New Haven sportsman . Asked if he thought the Danish scientists would be satisfied with half the data Mr. Wack replied : " That I can not prophesy . It may be that the scientists wilt say : ' These records are all right as tar as they go , but we want to see those you took on the way back from the pole . ' If they take that attitude then there will be only one thing for Dr. Cook to do . He must hurry up to Etah and get the data of his return trip . They , together with the instruments left there by Harry Whitney , he proposes to get next Spring , anyhow . He will send a special expedition after them . If the scientists decide to hold up their approval of his records until they get his data complete , of course it will be very aggravating , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can produce what is missing . " " In the meantime will he go back to the lecture stage ? " was asked . " I can not say , but I do n't believe he will , " was the reply . " I think Dr. Cook prefers remaining in seclusion until the University of Denmark has pronounced his data sufficient . Along with the original observations Dr. Cook sent voluminous explanatory notes . These have to do with conditions as he found them , his field observations . He made them out with great care and as complete as he possibly could , so that the scientists would not need to have him go before them and explain any points that may come up as to his original data , Of course , it may be that he will have to go anyhow , but he hopes the data will be sufficient , with the explanatory matter accompanying them . " Mr. Wack wanted to give the assurance , he said , that Dr. Cook 's condition is not serious . What he needs , his counsel said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him for these many weeks . I-Te will feel better , Mr. Wack thought , when he hears that his records are safely deposited in the hands of the Danish savants and that the deep-laid plot to rob him of fame has been foiled . MUST SEE ORIGINAL RECORDS . Prof. Moore Explains Geographic Society 's Attitude Toward Cook . Prof. Willis Moore , Chief of the United States Meteorological Service , who is President of the National Geographic Society , explained yesterday while on a short visit to town that society 's position in regard to the proposal which was made to the University of Copenhagen that a committee representing the American body be present when the arctic records of Dr. Frederick A. Cook are first examined , which proposal was refused by the consistory of the university . " The reports concerning this message , " said Prof Moore , " have been somewhat misleading . We cabled to the University of Copenhagen because Dr. Cook informed us in his letter to the society that his original records would be examined by the university , and that after this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scientific societies and universities . Now our regulations and by-laws provide we can not honor an explorer , even though he be a member of our society , as Dr. Cook is , without seeing his original records . We could not , therefore , honor Dr. Cook unless we got these original records , and we could not get access to them without asking to see them at Copenhagen , where they were to be filed . " We did not intend to impeach the university , nor did we intend to convey the impression that the committee wished to interfere during the first inspection . What the society wished was to have a committee at Copenhagen at the time of the inspection , which could examine the ' original records after the university had finished its examination . " The National Geographic Society must get access to the original records , or we can not honor the man . Dr. Cook stated in his letter that the only time we could see these original records would be at the time they were presented to the university . Copies of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulations and by-laws. "
