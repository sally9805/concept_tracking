It was not only sane and statesmanlike in its argument , but , I think , pre-eminently Christian in its sentiment . It would have been so easy tor the American press to fan the unhappy Jamaica incident into a flame of fierce and explosive antagonism between kindred people that the calm and judicial manner with which it has been regarded by nearly all of our leading newspapers is worthy of high praise . But surely THE TIMES would not limit the era of good-feeling to England alone ! Why not allow the noble spirit of fraternity to embrace all the nations of the earth ?
