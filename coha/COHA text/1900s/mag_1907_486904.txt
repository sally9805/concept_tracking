With full realization of the gravity of the crisis which has inspired the action of the Treasury , we are still of opinion that the course adopted over Sunday is a serious mistake . That it will help the markets for the moment , and hasten through indirect means the restoration of bank reserves , is highly probable . But a precisely similar argument could have been invoked for the issue of $100,000,000 in irredeemable legal tender notes , supposing that recourse to have fallen within the power of the Administration ; and to dismiss the action of the government with the easy assertion that the end justifies the means is to surrender all right to judge of the country 's financial policy in the longer future . A $50,000,000 issue of Panama Canal bonds , already authorized by law and available as a legal basis to new banknote issues , was doubtless open to objection as a drain on capital when no capital could be spared ; but otherwise much might be said in favor of it . The expedient of short-term notes , on the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is fraught with evil . The extent to which it commits the Treasury for the future to the paternalism which reached such excesses under Secretary Shaw is perhaps the least of possible unhappy consequences , yet this of itself is unfortunate enough . The use of government credit by President Cleveland and Secretary Carlisle after the panic of 1893 bears no analogy to the present case . In that famous instance , the government sold bonds to make good the depleted gold reserve against its own outstanding notes and to enable the Treasury to maintain the public faith . No trouble of that sort exists to-day . Nor does this new operation stand on a footing even with Secretary Cortelyou 's use of the public surplus to relieve the recent panic through deposits with the banks . The Treasury then did nothing more than throw back on the money market what in a normal system of finance ought never to have been taken from it . No similar principle can be invoked in behalf of the present action . It has , we are all aware , the defence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stupendous quantities ; bank reserves have been heavily cut down ; and credit has been paralyzed . Taking into full account these formidable difficulties , we nevertheless can not blink the fact that the issue of credit notes on the present plan and scale is undeniable inflation . To all intents and purposes , the expedient is like that which an excited Congress voted under closely parallel conditions after the panic of 1873 , and which Grant blocked by his courageous veto . In the one case as in the other the government has created a heavy floating debt to raise money which it does not need , and which it proposes to throw into the country 's circulation . We do not see how any one can for a moment contend that this is a safe precedent . People may ask whether the existing emergency was not grave enough to warrant recourse to any shift , however objectionable at an ordinary time , which would avert overwhelming disaster . Oar answer is , that the situation did net call for such methods of relief . We believe that the financial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was showing distinct signs of relaxation . The successive steps of this 1907 panic had followed exactly those noted when confidence returned after the crisis of 1893 . Then , as now , actual currency was hoarded by the tens of millions ; then , as now , a heavy deficit in bank reserves existed ; the channels of daily settlement between banks were choked with Clearing House certificates ; " pay-roll money " in many cases could not be provided ; a premium in the form of checks was bid and paid tor currency ; the hoarding of cash was thereby temporarily increased ; at various inland cities " clearing-house checks " and employers ' credit notes were in hand-to-hand circulation . Then , as now , we indulged in a " raid " on London 's gold ; forty millions were taken for New York , mostly from the banks of England and mostly through payment of a premium . There was not , in short , one phenomenon of the present panic which did not appear in the same order fourteen years ago . Yet the outcome , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York bank statement indicated that an inflow of foreign gold had stopped the depletion of cash reserves , the currency premium declined , the hoarding ceased , and the hidden money began pouring back into the banks . That stage of recovery had , we believe , been reached with the publication of the bank statement of last Saturday . If , any real difference can be discovered between conditions in 1893 and those of to-day , so far as concerns the international pos:ition , it is such as to indicate far greater elements of strength and recuperative power in 1907 . During a fortnight past , we have been buying gold abroad as we might have bought pork or iron  --  by bidding until we found a seller , and by pledging our credit for the payment . But with the subsequent arrival at the seaboard of the enormous quantities of grain and cotton bought by European merchants in our first collapse of credit , we are rapidly- paying for the gold in real commodities . Our power to do this has been immensely greater than in the agricultural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in reserve than we had then for further payments . The inference should be plain that the problem of the markets was as sure of solution in the normal course of affairs this year as in 1893 . That use of the government 's credit will go far towards rectifying the situation without further tnroads upon Europe 's stock of gold , is entirely probable . The question still remains , however , whether we are not paying too clearly for this result  --  gratifying as it may be for the moment . THE WAR ON THE SALOON . So absorbed has this country been for the last few years in the attempt to regulate corporations , check monopolies , and deal with the unprincipled rich , that a veritable rev olution in the sentiment of the people upon a great social question has taken place practically unnoticed . Only when the Georgia Legislature voted almost unanimously for prohibition did the general public begin to learn that there is a great anti-saloon movement under way . It is , however , by no means confined to the South , as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 160 out of 180 Chicago precincts voted against license at the last election , thus closing 199 saloons . The Chicago City Council voted last week to establish prohibition in a southwestern section nearly a square mile in extent . More than one-half of that city will thus have abolished the saloon . Here in our own neighborhood , White Plains and ' other Westchester County towns " went dry . " In New Jersey , Judge Fort 's defence of the Bishops ' Law contributed largely to his election as Governor . The movement can not be explained in the South by racial problems , or in the North by any popular zeal for total abstinence , or by any sudden , emotional , semi-religious outburst against the drink . evil . The Southerner does not turn total abstainer merely that the negro may thereby profit physically and spiritually . The Northerners who are going to the polls in such large numbers and silently voting away the " poor man 's club " are not all teetotalers . Nor is their action influenced by a narrow belief that men can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as brought about the prohibition laws in Maine , Vermont , New Hampshire , and other States half a century ago . The strength of this movement lies in the votes of localities . When the prohibition laws were repealed in New Hampshire and Vermont , many-towns and cities voted for license . Gradually these are swinging back into the prohibition column , just as in North Carolina 62 out of 97 counties are " dry , " and all but thirty towns and cities , as a result of local initiative and decision . Naturally , the liquor-dealers are every- where in great alarm , and are seeking to counteract the movement by supporting extreme anti-saloon measures . Conditions in Alabama show how little likelihood they have of succeeding . In spite of concessions on the part of the liquor interests , the Prohibitionists , by means of the local-option law , have driven them out of county atter county Three counties were earned at the end of October by such large anti-saloon majorities that It is evident that six others in which elections are Pending will go the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dry " Naturally , the Legislature will not long stand out against public sentiment of this kind , and a State prohibition law may be looked for within the near future Mississippi will adopt pi ohibition just as soon as its Legislature assembles in January this even the liquor-sellers admit Tennessee is practically lost to them , for only three towns and three cities and 5 out of 96 counties still tolerate the sale of liquor , in Kentucky , the recent anti saloon victory speaks for itself Indeed , if Mr Roosevelt had stopped to analyze the Republican victory in that State , for which he officially expressed his gratitude , he would have found that it was not a Republican , but a temperance triumph Louisville itself did a noble day 's work in defeating the political coiruptionists , and in closing the shops of their chiet supporters , the rum-sellers Altogether , in the South the liquor-sellers have been driven out of 981 counties , and ale allowed to operate only in 275 ? and the latter figure deer eases week by week Even in Louisiana , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ license , rather than by prohibition , there are indications that the nineteen dry parishes w ill soon be reinforced by some of the forty which now permit the sale of li-quor That the West is in sympathy with the movement appeals from the inclusion within the Oklahoma Constitution of a Prohibition clause In Illinois , so the Chicago E ? ening Post reports Victories too many to enumerate were won by the anti-saloon forces , and not in the " country " alone , but in towns and cities of size and importance Jackson-ville went " dry " by a majority of nearly SOO votes , and it is only here and there that the saloons escaped the rising flood The Post adds that prohibition as an election issue is now out of the Prohibition party s hands , and has become the " popular cause of many thousands of voters " who are still Republicans and Democrats It attributes this change largely to the new methods of the anti-saloon leagues They appeal to reason rather than to emotion , and make use of modern advertising methods to bring home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from business men of means and standing Thus in Indianapolis the Kokomo Steel and Iron Company estimates that the saloons near its plant cost it $75,000 a year It asks for a law prohibiting saloons in factory districts " Kokomo , " it says , " has thirty saloons that pay $7,500 a year into the city treasury The manulecturing interests are damaged more tl an ten times that amount by the saloons " Will it last ? Can the laws be entorced ? Is the vicious Maine experience to be repeated ? These are the questions even y one must ask who ponders on this ext ao , rdinary level sal of public sentiment , which , as Bon fort s Wine and Spint Cm Oar puts it , makes the liquor-dealer confront the practical question whether he is not to be wholly legislated out of business Any liquor law can be enforced behind which there is Publ , c opinion , and at present the feeling against the saloon is so spontaneous , : s such a natural rising of the people , that theie is greater hope for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " there will be , of course , and officials who w ill connive at an illegitimate traffic But in Birmingham , Ala , to cite one case , since Mayor Ward has come into office , prohibition in that city does prohibit , and the anti-saloon leagues have learned to stand by him and other executives with their " law-enforcement departments " What the situation in the rural districts of the South , hei e practically eveiv farmer can brew some hind of intoxicating drink for himself , will be five years hence , no man can foretell But the prospects are excellent for a rigorous restriction of a business that is the costliest , the most demoralizing , and most injurious of any the State permits OMNISCIENT 1 ? 1ILERS AND KIT-CHEX-CAB E T s Not the least interesting feature of the reaelations made in the Harden trial is their light on the essential limitations of the human mind , even when that mind belongs to the head of a great nation William It ' s amazing versatility has been the subject of more eulogistic comment than has fallen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one exception The War Lord of Europe has repeatedly laid aside his helmet and has sword to strike the poet 's lyre , or grasp the wheel of his lacing yacht , of to join debate with theologians and Assynologists , and always with heaven-stirring success What w as there this strenuous young man did not know thoroughly , or could not do with uniivailed perfection ?
