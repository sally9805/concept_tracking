txt The nearest approach to an official statement from the American Government on the cause of the Hill-Tower controversy was made to , day on the floor of the House by Representative Nicholas Longworth , son-in-law of the . President . Speaking on the general diplomatic appropriation bill , he pleaded for the passage of his bill appropriating 83,000,000 for the purchase of embassies in the chief European capitals . This bill is still in Committee . " The objection to Dr. Hill as Ambassador to Berlin , " said Mr. Longworth , " was simploy and solely that his private fortune would not enable him to represent properly the dignity of the American Nation . " He referred to the press dispatches stat-e ing that the German Emperor had refused to accept Dr. Hill and to the official denial of them , **Nevertheless , " he continued , " there is no doubt that there was a foundation for these stories beyond mere rumor , and It is undoubtedly true that persons high in authority in Germany for some time have been saying that Dr. Hill was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he declared , could not be because Dr. 13111 was not experienced in diplomacy , nor sufficiently learned in international law , nor that he was not sufficiently able and a representative American . They were due entirely to the fact that " because he was not sufficiently well off to pay the difference between the amount paid him as salary and ' the amount necessary to maintain his position as Ambassador , he would not only not be able to keep up such an establishment as that of the present American Ambassador , but would not be able to keep ! up any establishment at all . " Without going into the question whether Mr. Tower had maintained too luxurious an establishment , he said that everybody would concede that the American Ambassador to Germany should at least have a house to live in and not be compelled to live in a hotel or , a flat . " It is no excuse , " he declared , " that we do not act because financial conditions do not warrant the  --  eictiense . An of fleeholding aristocracy is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and blood , but when based on wealth it is infinitely worse , and worse than all 1n a republic . I would say that any amount of money was well spent for uprooting such a system from this country . " Tho Tower-Hill controversy and the general matter of our representatives abroad was discussed for two hours . Francis Burton Harrison of New York made satirical reference to the attempt of American diplomats nowadays " to fill like butterflies through the gilded halls of European nobility . " First Secretary Carter of the London Embassy he named as a good example of the dinner table or " dietetic diplomat , " and Ambassador White he described as another . " The First Secretary . " he said , " reminds one of nothing more than the white rabbit in ' Alice in Wonderland . ' As one sees him scurrying through the drawing rooms of London , one can imagine him muttering to himself , ' 0 the Duchess ! 0 my furs and whiskers ! I shall be late : ' And so the Ambassador to France . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to evening functions in Court dress , silk knickerbockers , gold lace , and maybe a gold-hilted sword . " I know full well that many of our richest diplomats have been our best , but the shirt-sleeve diplomats of an earlier generation were of a kind we can not at ? ford to lose . " Representatives Hitchcock and Bennet defended the Ambassadors . Mr. Hitchcock said he had found Mr. White living in a rented house in a style not exceeding that of the ordinary American gentleman . Mr. Bennet said that during business hours Mr. White had always been very businesslike . While maintaining that as a rule American diplomats were competent and efficient , Mr. Williams , the Democratic lead , er , characterized some of them as rich and some of them as snobbish . He saw no reason why Ambassador Reid should rent Dorchester House and set a social standard for subsequent Ambassadors . The Diplomatic and Consular bill , appropriating $3,720,283 , was passed under suspension of the rules . " BANDIT TAYLOR " SHOT DEAD .
