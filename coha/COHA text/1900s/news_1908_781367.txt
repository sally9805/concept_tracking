txt Some 400 Italians employed in the sand pits near here went on strike this morning because they wanted their average Pay of $1.50 a day raised to $1.75 . They had heard that American sand workers ge ' all the way from $L75 to $2.50 a day for the same work . The principal companies affected by the strike are Gallagher Brothers , the J. B. King Company , Goodwin Brothers , the Murray &; Ried Company , and the Phoenix Company . A sharp watch is ken on the strikers , tor trouble has been brewing for two or three days , and an Epworth League convention was in session here to-day , most of whose members are women and children . When many of the employes of the Phoenix Company threw down their shovels , near Roslyn , their example was followed all along the line of sand workers . Sheriff Joseph Foster was notified by telephone that the strike had begun , and that the foreign maledictions of the strikers were mixing with the hymns of the Epworth Leaguers , so close together were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mineola , East Williston , Hempstead , and all the other near-by towns and villages . The firemen formed ' the backbone of the company of 200 defenders . Arms were rushed to the scene from Mineola in automobiles . It had been feared that strikers would do some damage to the sand works , in which there is much valuable machinery , and that , possibly , having once got a start , they might break up the Epworth League convention . With the appearance of armed defenders , both against fire and strikers , the Italians subsided , but did not go back to work . The defenders are on guard to-night . CUT IN ELECTRIC LIGHT COST .
