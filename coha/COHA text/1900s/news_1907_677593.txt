txt Pittman , Not Brittman . A recruiting Sergeant once solicited a young man to enlist in the United States Army . The young man said he would do so if three conditions were guaranteed . First , that he would not be hit in battle ; second , if he was hit that he should not be killed , and if he should be killed that some reporter would not spell his name wrong . Last Sunday I had the honor of making one of the principal addresses at Palm Garden at the Greek meeting presided over by Bishop Potter . On Monday morning I read the excellent report of the meeting in THE TIMES , but imagine my feelings when I found my name was printed as ex-judge Thomas W. Brittman . Now , " Brittman " may be the Greek way of spelling my name ; if so , it is all Greek to me , but in plain English , my name is simply THOMAS W. PITTMAN .                 @ @ @ @
