 | WHEN Henry VIII became king , he was only eighteen years of age . No more truly royal figure ever graced a throne . Handsome , with golden hair and beard and blue eyes , his face was ruddy with vigorous health . His frame was athletic , and he had been trained to martial exercises as well as to every form of sport , so that he bore himself with both the gallantry of a soldier and the graceful e a s e of a courtier . Tireless , active and energetic , his mental gifts matched fully his physical advantages . He had wit , and eloquence at command . He was versed in the new learning . He loved letters and the converse of scholars . In character he was generous , highspirited and impulsive , impatient of restraint , and with the hot temper of a Welshman which came to him with his Tudor blood . His ardent nature made him masterful and a born lover , and these traits belonged to all the rest of his kingly race . Henry married , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catherine , daughter of the two powerful Spanish sovereigns , Ferdinand and Isabella . It was a match upon which the young king had set his heart . Catherine was the widow of Henry 's consumptive brother , Arthur , to whom she had been married at sixteen , and from whom she was released by death a few months after marriage . She was in her own fashion a handsome girl , short of stature , full in figure , with regular though rather heavy features , and with a forehead much too high even when it was partly covered by her thick reddish hair . When Henry married her , she was six years his senior ? a fact which may account in part for his infatuation ; since at eighteen a youth is very apt to fall in love with worn - en who are older than himself , especially when they are tem-peramentally unlike . Catherine was , in fact . the antithesis of her husband . Lacking the Spanish fire , she had in full measure the Spanish pride , the Spanish dignity , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at this time she had already lived in England for nine years , she had learned but little of the language , she still dressed like a Spaniard . and she observed a state and ceremony which contrasted strongly with the somewhat boisterous manners of the  | English court . Henry was as fond of revels and tournaments and masques and dances as any other fullblooded young Englishman of his day . Catherine 's maturer years and more developed character made these things seen childish ; and so , from the beginning , the two were not in absolute accord . Yet she never really vexed her husband except when she refused to witness the bull-baiting which he liked so much , and there is no evidence that there was any serious unhappiness between them throughout the first years of their life together . It is quite certain that Henry was faithful to her ; and , indeed , he never spoke of her either then or thereafter in anything but terms of profound respect . These facts alone would suffice to show that Henry was far from being a mere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a frankly amorous disposition , and married to a woman older than himself , foreign in her ways and speech , devoid of temperament , and out of sympathy with his amusements , he was still an affectionate and faithful husband , and he showed his trust in her by leaving her as regent of the kingdom during his absence in the wars with France . It was not until fourteen years had passed that anything like a breach between the two became apparent . During that time three children had been born , of whom two were boys and one a girl ? the Princess Mary . In all the centuries of its existence England had never yet been governed by a queen . Henry felt all an Englishman 's desire to have sons , and something of an Englishman 's half-unconscious contempt for daughters . Moreover , his ambition to perpetuate a line of kings was very strong within his heart . The death of his two sons at first depressed him , and then worked upon a certain vein of superstition in his nature . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divine displeasure . He began to brood over the circumstances of his marriage . His wife had been his brother 's widow , and marriage with a brother 's widow was unlawful by the canons of the church . To be sure , the pope had granted a dispensation for the marriage ; yet to the gloomy king there came a dread lest Heaven had been offended . Still , this dread was at first a subject of meditation rather than a fixed idea . At last , however , when Catherine had reached her fortieth year , she was smitten with a lingering illness which robbed her of her beauty and , after it had passed away , left her in face and form an old and withered woman . Henry  | himself was still in the prime of manhood , and in this illness he saw another evidence of the hand of God . It was certain that Catherine would bear no more children . She had become sickly and morose . The gravity of her manner now verged upon haughtiness and harshness . At the same time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old Catholic nobility ? had vowed that Catherine 's daughter should be queen . These circumstances all combined to bring out traits in Henry 's character which had hitherto been undeveloped . It is most likely that in the end he would have put away his wife and would have married a second time , even had he not become entangled in a loveaffair . Such ambition as his , combined with a power that was absolute , could not have been held back forever . The fascination which Anne Boleyn exercised upon him merely hastened the inevitable . Henry had met this girl at court in 1522 , after he had been married to Catherine for nearly thirteen years . Anne Boleyn was of Irish ancestry and had all the vivacity of the Celtic type . She was tall and slender , with an exquisite figure , graceful , and with the bearing , not of a princess , to be sure , but of a well-bred woman of the world . She had been educated in France in the household of Marguerite , Duchesse d'Alencon , amid surroundings little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was steeped in sentiment and romance . Her traditions were those of the most immoral court in Europe . Herself not evil , she nevertheless viewed the sins of others with amusement . Morality had no meaning for her and she lived in an atmosphere of lovemaking and light gallantry . With her , Anne Boleyn had grown up to womanhood fond of adventure , defiant of convention , free of speech and manner , and loose in thought . Before she was twenty years of age , many stories had been circulated which if true were detrimental to her reputation , But whether they were true or not , it is certain that she was something worse than frivolous , and that if she had not gone all the lengths ,  | this was only because her nature underneath the surface was hard and calculating . But when Henry met her , he saw only a witty , merry , sprightly girl whose beauty was enhanced even by the few slight blemishes upon it , such as a projecting tooth , a mole upon the neck and a curious deformity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the first , yet it must be remembered that not until eleven years after they had met , did he divorce Catherine and marry Anne Boleyn . In part , of course , the delay was due to the difficulties in the way . Yet it is only fair to think that the reasons of state which have already been enumerated were as potent as the charms of Anne . It should be noticed , too , that Henry did not seek to make of her his mistress . In his own way he was honorable . It was marriage that he sought ; and the fact that he waited all through that long and trying time is proof that physical passion alone was far from dominating him . When he finally married Anne , she was thirty-two years of age , as beautiful as ever , and as bad at heart . Her real nature Henry soon discovered . No sooner was she queen than she gave way to every mood and every possible caprice . Vain , impatient , frivolous and shameless , she made enemies on every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her husband . That freedom of manner which may have attracted him at first , now startled him . She flirted without restraint and without dignity ; she allowed her casual admirers to take extraordinary liberties with her ; and at last , when these things had gone on even in Henry 's presence , his jealous temper flamed out fiercely . In his household and in his family no such woman as this had hitherto been seen . He could not make allowance for Anne Boleyn 's bringing up , but put the worst construction on her levity . Already his own health was undermined . He had grown huge of body , corpulent and unwieldy . The agonies of gout had lamed hint so that his field-sports were at an end . His physical suffering and the sight of Anne 's frivolities drove him to a frenzy . An accusation of  | unfaithfulness was made against the queen . Just what the evidence presented may have been is now unknown , for the testimony given before the council was afterward destroyed . Whether innocent or not , she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was condemned to death , as guilty of high treason . She had borne two children to the king ; but the first of these , a son , died in a single day , and King Henry may have felt that this union , like the other , was illomened and unblessed . When Anne died , the king at once sought out another wife . This has been made a serious charge against him , as though it proved his heartlessness . But he had loved Anne ; and when she proved unfaithful , as he thought , he turned to another with something of that despair which often leads a rejected lover to offer himself to the first woman whom he meets . Jane Seymour , who accepted him almost without a wooing , was thirtyseven years of age , and she died in the year which followed on her wedding . She was everything which Anne Boleyn had not been ? a serene and quiet figure , with little beauty , reserved in manner , gentle , awkward and obedient . For her , as for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and made his court mourn with him ; for Jane Seymour had given him a son whose birth had cost her life . For three years Henry remained unmarried ; and when he took a wife again , it was surely not for love , since he had never seen the lady , but at the earnest urging of his powerful minister , Thomas Cromwell . It was , in fact , a marriage of state , intended to ally England with the Protestant princes of North Germany . The Princess Anne of Cleves , whose marriage with the king was thus arranged , furnished the one touch of comedy in the narrative of Henry 's matrimonial career . The bride was just half Henry 's age , and had been brought up at a petty German court at a time when even a court , in Germany , remained untouched by the graces and refinements of civilization . Anne of Cleves would to-day , no doubt , be taken for a German Hausfrau of a tradesman 's family . She could read and write and she could sew ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her accomplishments . Dull-witted , sluggish , ignorant and awkward , no such queen had ever shared the English throne . She was tall and stout , without the semblance of a figure ; her nose was broad , her lips loose , her complexion muddy , and she was badly pitted with smallpox . She plastered her coal-black hair in long flat bands about her face , and over it she  | wore a yellow wig in a contrast which was startling . Worse than all , she had a strong dislike to the use of soap and water , and both at table and in her own apartments her habits were such as to sicken her attendants . She spoke no English and the king knew little German . A more ridiculous match for a proud and splendid king could not have been imagined . Scarcely had Henry seen her when he burst into a rage at having been deceived . She is a great Flemish mare : " cried the furious king ; " I have been ill-handled . " But the matter had already gone too far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , he set about the task of effecting a release . Meanwhile , he shunned her presence . She was married in January , and in June there came to her a royal commission to tell her that she must agree to the annulling of the marriage . At sight of the royal officers , Anne fell into a fit of terror ; but when she found that she was not to be beheaded or to suffer bodily harm , and when her dull wits discovered what was really wanted , she was perfectly contented . She signed anything and everything that was given her to sigh . She wrote letters at dictation to her relatives in Germany . She gave up everything ; and in six days she was divorced . It was all the same to her , and , in fact , in the end she was delighted , for she found herself in possession of a handsome income and a large estate , on which she lived thereafter with much apparent satisfaction , sewing , eating four or five greasy meals a day , and increasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cleves , which was in reality not matrimonial at all but partly political and partly farcical , left Henry in a mood with which one can scarcely fail to sympathize . He was now nearly fifty years of age ; but disappointment ; physical suffering , and that tense excitement of the stormy years in which he lived , made him older than his age . He longed for repose at home and for companionship . Like many men who are crossing the line of middle life , he dreamed of a love that should be pure and true , and that should be given to himself for the first time . The sweetness and trust of maidenhood were his ideal ; and he believed that he had found them in Catherine Howard , a slip of a girl whom he chanced to observe at a banquet given to the king by Bishop Gardiner . Henry 's admiration for her was instantaneous , and in a way it was justified . Catherine Howard was petite and delicate in appearance , vivacious in manner and with a fresh girlish laugh which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful brown hair made her pass for a beauty ; while her pert little nose , just a trifle retrousse , gave her an air of archness that went well with her years . She was , in fact , what in modern phrase would be described as " fetching . " Her family , moreover , was one of the noblest in all England , her uncle being the Duke of Norfolk , first among British peers . To Henry she appeared to be all that he had dreamed of ? innocent with an innocence almost childish , merry , companionable and sincere . He married her within a few weeks after making her acquaintance , and for a short time was completely happy , in having at last fulfilled the aspiration of long years of waiting . It seemed to him as though his life was now to be a life of peace , with a lovely and devoted girl whose affection he might  | win and hold by his concern for her happiness . Not the faintest suspicion of the black reality had ever entered his mind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bitter diisillusion that was at hand . Catherine Howard , noble though she was , and a mere girl of eighteen , had already two secrets in her life . Even at the moment when she was giving her little hand in marriage to the king , her heart was sick and faint with the dread of an exposure . As a child she had lived in the home of her adopted grandmother , the dowagerDuchess of Norfolk . Here she had been much neglect , and had been left to the company and example of the waitingwomen and maids . The manners of these persons were not merely evil ; they were in-describably depraved . It delighted Catherine 's companions I to teach her all of the vices which they knew and practised ; and when she was but twelve years of age , they had given her over to a dissolute musician named Maddox , who became her lover . This was with Catherine a sin of ignorance , but a little later , she was seriously fascinated by a handsome , loose-living gentleman , a distant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infatuation went very far . She entered into a private contract of marriage , which in those days was as binding as a marriage and which gave the same privileges as marriage . When the old duchess at last discovered how matters stood , she was excessively indignant . Derham fled to escape the vengeance of Catherine 's near relatives , yet he and the girl kept up a clandestine correspondence . Catherine was so illiterate as to be unable to do more than sign her name ; and her letters to Derham had to be written for her by an evil old woman , a Mrs. Bulmer , who thus got possession of a secret destined to be fatal . When Catherine had won the favor of the king , she broke with Derham , who was really fond of her . She tried to obliterate her past . Had she confessed it to her royal lover , she might still have been queen of England , or at least have saved herself from persecution . But she was only a young girl , rather vulgar at heart , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fearful lest she might lose everything . Therefore , with the cunning instinct of a servant , she sought to cover up her secrets . She let the hag Bulmer blackmail her . She got places about the court for the different persons who knew her story . She even committed the supreme folly of sending  | for Derham and making him her private secretary ? an act which , in view of their previous relations , was little short of criminal . But the girl had become distracted . One after another person learned the truth about her , and she was preyed upon by the basest wretches , who threatened her and extorted from her money , offices and promises of help . The miserable girl-queen lived in a constant thrill of terror . A frightful pit yawned at her feet , and those around her seemed to be pushing her down into its depths . The king alone knew nothing , but grew more and more devoted and content . He spoke to those about him of his perfect happiness , and declared that never before had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ears of Catherine these words must have sounded like the accents of approaching doom . At last the inevitable crash occurred . At Hampton Court , the king , receiving the sacrament with Catherine , publicly thanked God for giving him a wife so absolutely suited to his mind ? " a loving , dutiful and virtuous queen . " A few hours later and the Archbishop of Canterbury placed in Henry 's hands a statement of certain facts which had been laid before hint , and begged him to consider them in private . The king was startled , but , after a moment , utterly incredulous . But when Derham and others had been searchingly examined , unbelief gave way to conviction . Henry burst into a passion of tears . His dream of happiness was shattered . His " dutiful and virtuous " queen was shown to have deceived him , to have been unchaste in life , and to have come to him while still affianced to another man . When Catherine heard of the accusation , she tried to see the king . Her attendants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the door of the room where Henry was , but she was forced back and carried , shrieking and sobbing piteously , to her own apartments , which @# were now her prison . She never saw the king again ; but two months afterward , having been sentenced by the House of Lords , she was taken in the dusk to Tower Hill , where she met her death . As she passed under London Bridge , she may have looked up and seen the blackened head of Derham , her former lover and the cause of her unhappy end . When she died she was twenty years of age and a bride of eighteen months . Henry 's last choice of a wife , in Catherine Parr , was perhaps his wisest . He married a woman who had been twice a widow and who therefore possessed the art of managing a husband . She was a little over thirty , and though her contemporaries were not enthusiastic over her beauty , the portraits of her seem to modern eyes to show a face far more attractive than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Howard there exists , so far as I can find , no authentic likeness . The last of the six queens is the one of whom a good deal has been written ; but her life with Henry is not very interesting . By this time the king was verging on his end ? a curious figure , gigantic in frame , bloated by disease , scarcely able to walk , irascible , fierce , suspicious and resentful . He had governed badly and like a tyrant , even though out of his reign came infinite good to England . But his faults were more truly the faults of the monarch than the faults of the man . The matches which he made and by which he is remembered best , are surely not to be explained unfavorably . Through them we see the strivings of a restless temperament seeking for repose . Reasons of state made his first marriage and his fourth quite unsuccessful . The second and the fifth were wrecked through no fault of the king himself . But to the wife whom he survived and to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband ? bent upon having his own way , not overnice in his sensibilities , but none the less faithful , generous and kind .
