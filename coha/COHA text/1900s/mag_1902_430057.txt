THE little vivacious French maid in Rose o ' Plymouth Town is Miss Minnie Dupree , a new star of the present theatrical season . " I doubt if I could be pure Pilgrim , " she confessed . " I suppose there is a certain innate sprightliness about my nature which would have to be subdued if I undertook to portray a maid demure enough to have been born and bred in o l d Plymouth . " The plot of the story was constructed by Beulah Marie Dix , who during the past few years has made for herself a name in historical romance . " Few writers , " says Miss Dupree , " are so thoroughly well informed about the pioneer and colonial history of America as Miss Dix , and I think she has evolved a charming story about the little ward in the household of Miles Standish . Historically , she had no facts for the character . Rose de la Noye was simply a creation , a dash of French coquetry , a strange bit of foreign gayety against the severity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dally with my wardrobe in the part I took the Pilgrim costume and brightened it with a frisky bow here and they or a jaunty bit of color . " Oddly enough , by mere coincidence there crept into our drama of pioneer days a truthful incident . Purely from her - imagination Miss Dix constructed a scene when the little French maid makes a flying trip in the face o f besieging Indians to the blockhouse for ammunition . The play was written and in course of rehearsal , when we discovered that such an incident h a d really happened in pioneer days . The name of the real heroine was Elizabeth Vane , and the story is almost the same as that Miss Dix has told . To go back to the subject of clothes , I made an entire departure from custom this season ; I had all my wardrobe made in America instead of bringing it from Paris . If any worker deserves a rest it is an actress after a hard season .  | So many of us turn our vacations into toil in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adjective fits famously this particular kind of toil . The first place one rushes for as soon as A. steamer can carry her across the Atlantic is Paris . One has no time to think of Paris historically , picturesquely , or socially ; all one has on her mind , morning , noon or night , is clothes . The weather is sure to be hot , the hotels are full to overflowing , and the shops are crowded , for every woman who goes to Europe is bent on the same errand ? clothes . There is the bewildering task of choosing gowns and coats and hats , from ? I was going to say from millions of styles . Before one has studied the subject for a few days it swells to billions . Then there are materials , trimmings , colors to consider , and before one really gets into the hands of the modiste ? of course there are no dressmakers in Paris ? she begins to feel as if she were a wax figure in a store window being whirled around and having clothes thrust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mirror-gazing ! I tell you what it is , before the poor wax figure reaches this stage she requires a splendid command of her temper and a good knowledge of French . There are two more acts in the tragedy ? the first glimpse of your bill and the ordeal of the custom house . " This year , when my season ended , I ordered my entire wardrobe for the fall season of a first-class New York house . I went to Europe with the matter off my mind entirely , and what a good time I did have ! When I came back there was a spell of fitting , which was accomplished on a cool day . My clothes came home as exquisite in finish , quite as stylish as anything I could have found in Paris , and accompanied by a bill no larger than I would have paid in Paris , plus a goodly sum taxed by the revenue . Then there is the comfort , fully appreciated by a woman who loves daintiness , of having escaped the ordeal of having her delicate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course , too , being  | an American , I suppose I ought to feel satisfaction at contributing my mite to American industry . Seriously , I think we American players , who earn our salaries from the American public , ought to consider this question . " In her own dainty style of dressing , Miss Dupree is original . I noticed this season especially two odd , useful , pretty ideas . One was the initials , " M. D. , " embroidered in red upon the right sleeve of her white linen shirt waist . She affects almost wholly waists of snowy linen , and the three-inch letters are apt to correspond in color with the tie or any small detail of her ' wardrobe . It is a pretty fashion , and wherever Miss Dupree appeared the summer girls copied the idea and then ? turned it broadcast , as generally occurs with pretty ideas . Another odd fashion which is original with the little actress is the way she wears her watch , knotted into the end of a strong double chain , firmly hooked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the satisfaction of knowing , " said Miss Dupree , " that my watch can not get lost . I can not even have it stolen , for the thief would have to take me along . Watches are such elusive things and they are worn in such absurd ways one is constantly losing them . Here is something hung on the same chain I would lose even less willingly than the watch . It is a good luck charm . We stage people , you know , are almost as superstitious as the Scotch or darkies . It is my birthstone , a beautiful garnet set close to the rim in an old copper penny . The date does not reach quite back to the days of old Plymouth , but it came to wish luck to the little maid of Plymouth . " p 300
