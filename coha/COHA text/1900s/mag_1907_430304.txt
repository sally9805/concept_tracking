SINCE the days at least when Ruskin , in " Sesame and Lilies , " and Arnold , in various treatises , of which " Culture and Anarchy " is the chief , laid down directions for reading and stated a high aim for all intellectual and spiritual endeavor , there has been wanting neither theoretical dis cussion nor practical counsel on the momentous question as to the best ways of making books minister to the higher interests of mankind . In a general sense , everything that teaches or stimulates man to set a value on any kind of life other than the material or the sensational or the . hysterically emotional may be called an instrument of culture . Hence . the term in this sense is hard to fix . And since , on the other hand , the sages and prophets of the world have been in substantial agreement that the life is more than meat and the body more than raiment , it is only the wisest of mortals who can add a jot to our general knowledge of the precepts that should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and teaching culture are as numerous as ever ; indeed , the day that saw their ceasing would be sad . It may not be amiss , therefore , to take from the present time a number of books falling under that description , to see what counsel they have to offer , what significance and value is theirs , and of what kind of writing they are typical . " Culture , " said Arnold in the preface to " Literature and Dogma , " " is indispensably necessary , and culture is reading ; but reading with a purpose to guide it , and with system . He does a good work who does anything to help this ; indeed , it is the one essential service now to be rendered to education . " The remark , whether it be the cause or not , may stand for the type of motive underlying many a modern treatise on the subject . There have been famous lists of the one hundred " best books , " now depreciated by a more catholic taste ; we all know of numer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the literary counsel " featured " in popular periodicals for domestic consumption is beyond analysis : they all tell us what books , both classical and contem porary , it is best for us to taste , to chew , or to digest . In such trains of advice one may be reasonably certain , before opening any given treatise , to find stock ideas : books are our priceless posses sion ; you should , in Lowell 's words , " read what will make you think rather than dream ; " newspapers are a public menace and should be read swiftly , merely for the sake of the important news ; excessive novelreading is deleterious to the moral fibre ; the Bible is the best of all books for culture . Indeed , these ideas can not too often be repeated , for we do not hear a tithe as much about them as we do about passing politics , the stock market , theatres , and athletics ; but the specific interest in the present guides to culture lies in the variations from such worthy remarks anddthe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Character " ' an assembly of a number of detached and somewhat generalizing addresses with a central purpose , not too exactly connoted by the title , Mr. Larned warmly decries the universal reading of newspapers . As an exponent of culture , he says : " I speak soberly when I say that the greatest antagonism to be met and overcome is that of the vulgarized part of the newspaper press ; " the problem is " how to win readers of the general mass front unwholesome newspapers to wholesome books , or how to change the spirit of the common newspapers of the day from flippancy to sobriety . " So , too , he deprecates the vulgarity of common novels , though amply recognizing the value of the better representatives of fiction . These are , however , details . The remedy lies in the public library , of which he is the earnest advocate . His aim , a broad popular culture , is expressed in these sentences : It is better for the majority of people that they should be readers in a general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leisure nor the freedom of mind for large subjects of study , and it is ill for the mind to focus it on small themes too exclusively . . . . I feel no doubt in the least that breadth of culture is more important , on the whole , than its depth , to the generality of mankind ; that their character and capability as members of society are affected more by the area of their knowledge and by the diversity of their acquaintance with good literature than by the minuteness of either . As an aid in the determining of excellence , Mr. Larned has a wholesome test , which indeed has been much used ever since Coleridge expressed it in another form : The conclusive test for a book which offers pleasure rather than knowledge is the question , " Does it leave any kind of wholesome and fine feeling in the mind of one who reads it ? " More particularly , Mr. Larned is an earnest believer in the wide reading of history and whatever books transmit to us the treasures of the past ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and in the poetry that kindles the imagination and stimulates the life of true emotion . I n general , the book is an able presentation of a sound point of view . Mr. Larned is an enthusiast and an idealist , and therefore rat her inclines to content himself with a statement of the ideal than to luisv himself with the question of ways and means . Furthermore , iii pursu ing his ideal he perhaps loses sight of one or two minor points of some practical value . It is an open question , for example , whether the l Dui i n library , for which he is so winning an advocate , does not do its share in fostering a taste for the cheap novels that he decries . Doubtless the public library opens the doors of a not very profound knowledge to willingeekers , but its hospitable portal is also open to the inrush of desul tory novel-readers ; nor do we know many libraries which do not rather cater torthe public taste than guide and restrict it . Nor , again , is such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideal , capable of being analyzed in terms of actual fact ; for if t1n " discipline of thoroughness " be an admirable thing , it is valuable in its applications , and hence carries a condemnation of discursiveness and superficiality : At the same time , I would urge , as I say , the specializing of some object in the intellectual pursuits of every man and woman ; not to the exclusion of other subjects and objects , but to their subordination . Let there be one thing for each of us that we try to know somewhere nearly to the bottom , with certainty , precision , exact ness ; not so much for the value of the knowledge itself , as for the value of the dis cipline of thoroughness . If it is something in the line of our daily occupations , ? something bearing upon our particular work in the world , mechanical , commercial , professional it may be , ? so much the better . Then , around that one centre of positive study , turning on it as on a pivot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading . Nor is it captious to say that Mr. Larned 's dictum on Boswell 's " Johnson " is visionary rather than reasonable : Who can read it without wishing that some figure more impressive in human history stood where a strange fortune has put the sturdy old Tory , in the wonderful light that reveals him so immortally ? It lacks reason because whether or not the " figure more impres sive in human history " would , if presented by a Boswell , have been more momentous than the actual picture is mere guess-work . I dare say that Johnson was a great deal more interesting as a person ality ( that is Boswell 's point ) than Caesar , or Shakespeare , or Napoleon ; but , of course , I do n't know , and , being ignorant , must accept Johnson as he stands . There is nothing to do except to take the material that Boswell has given us . To wish otherwise would be to ask for a recasting of history . Such random remarks as that of Mr. Lamed 's mar sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such trifling defects in a stimulating book , but it is in the interest of sound culture that they be noticed . Mr. Larned 's book to some degree shows the limitation under which many good treatises suffer . They deal with what ought to be to the exclusion of what is ; whereas no right-thinking and efficient reformer can hope to move very far without a knowledge of actual conditions . Otherwise he fights as one that beateth the air or must content himself with addressing an audience with whom he is already substantially in accord . Prof. Brandes 's short sketch on reading ' is in this respect an improvement over Mr. Larned 's essays . No less enthusiastic in tone than the latter , it would seem to have a better grasp of the general fact . This is stated in these words : The simplest experience of the world proves that a work of great excellence may deeply move one person , while it leaves another untouched ; and that a book which has influenced one strongly in one 's youth may lose such influence over one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man can read at every time . This fact is not particularly evident , of course , for the simple reason that nowadays very few people can be said to read at all , or to enjoy reading , or get any good out of it . Out of a hundred persons able to read , ninety generally read nothing but newspapers ? a species of reading which demands no exertion . Most people , for that matter , read without any particular attentiveness . . . . And many people , after all , are not accustomed to understand fully . They are like young people reading books in foreign languages , who neglect to refer to the dictionary for words they do not understand ; they infer them from the sense , so they say ; that is , they understood half , and are content with that . In the case of works the nature of which is not intended to be grasped by the intellect , as , for example , in lyric poetry , readers generally relinquish beforehand all idea of understanding exactly what the author @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ladies , once tried the experiment of reading aloud Goethe 's " The God and the Bayadere , " beginning each verse with the last line , and reading upward . The rhymes fell without intermission , all the melody of the verses was retained ? and every one was charmed . With such facts in view , Prof. Brandes sets himself three questions for answer ? Why should we read ? What should we read ? and How should we read ? The answer to the first is somewhat unconventional . Instead of claiming for books the all-important place , he regards them as in many ways inferior to pictures and sculpture as instruments of culture , and he adds : " Books can at best present only a theory . " Hence they are , with intelligent people , merely a supplement to knowledge derived from observation . On the other hand , they have great value in that they " set thoughts in motion , " and it is to their credit that " they are seldom so inane as people " ; moreover they make us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entertaining ; and , if not palpably moral , are excellent spiritual guides . His chief advice in answer to the second question is an adjuration to shun general surveys and miscellaneous reading in favor.of deep and intensive study of what interests us . In calling this the only safe road to culture , he steps out of the broad and primrose path of 1lr . Lamed , and is more in accord with Stevenson 's dictum that " culture is not measured by the greatness of the field which is covered by our knowledge , but by the nicety with which we can perceive relations in that field , whether great or small . " Dangerous books , " which speculate in the youthful reader 's sensual impulses , or appeal to his idleness or frivolity . .. that represent base and low things as admirable , or disseminate prejudices , and throw a hateful light on liberal-mindedness , or the pursuit , , of freedom , " and wearisome books , like dry-as-dust history , are to be eschewed . Most important of all is the object of reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of relationships , to preserve the moral essence of things , and to strengthen moral fibre . In one even more interesting respect Prof. Brandes is at some variance with a popular dictum ? that which proclaims the Bible to be the best of all books . The Bible usually heads the list of the " hundred best , " and he who would plead for discrimination in his praise would occupy an uncommon position . Prof. Brandes 's words on this question are so characteristic of his point of view and his manner that they are worth quoting : There is one Book of Books that is generally regarded as the most suitable of all for general and constant reading , the very best book , ? the Bible . Few books , however , prove so conclusively as this that the bulk of m:x din ! can not read at all . The so-called Old Testament comprises , as is well known , a .. that is left to us of the ancient Hebrew literature of a period of eight hundred years , together with some few books in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the most various origin , which have come down to us with texts comparatively recently edited , often corrupt and further marred by endless copyings ; ? writings ascribed , as a rule to men who never wrote them , nearly all of them difficult to understand , and demanding extensive knowledge in order to be read with the smallest degree of profit . Certain of the books of the Old Testament , like the collection which bears the name of Isaiah , contain some of the sublimest extant poetry of antiquity ? a witness to the purest craving for righteousness , the highest religious development to be found on earth at that time , seven hundred and fifty or five hundred years before our era . Others , as for example the Chronicles , are of less value , and are not strictly accurate in their historical recitals . There is much evidence that such reading confuses men 's minds . Yet if the acknowledged " best " book can not be called good for every one , then how much less the classics ! Here Prof. Brandes undoubtedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in modern culture ? the Bible , since it has ceased to be of tremendous moment to the eternal welfare of mankind , is not pop- - ularly read ? as has been the case with the classics since Greek and Latin have ceased to be of moment as required subjects for entrance to college . Incidentally , this change of attitude is suggestive of our evaluation of literature as opposed to information : so long as the Bible was thought to contain the most important of all facts , it was read , but when degraded from the dignity of science to the level of literature it ceased to be interesting . The truth of the matter is that people care much more for information than for the finer sorts of pleasure . That the fact of the present neglect of the Bible is true can be heard in the constant cry against the modern indifference , and the ignorance of the rising and the risen generations in regard to the Scriptures . But if one would reform this deplorable state of affairs , one must go deeper , must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this respect , Prof. Brandes 's suggestion ? that the book is incomprehensible to the moderh reader ? is valuable , even if not wholly true . To say that it is incomprehensible is but another way of saying that it is not interesting , to people of to-day , in comparison with more modern ways of thought , feeling , and expression . Since , however , its place as an invaluable work of literature is unquestioned , and since , as a matter of fact , it seems to have ceased , for the present generation , to be the only sufficient rule for faith and practice , any one who would tell us why it ought to be read , and would succeed in making us read it , would , in the highest sense , be furnishing us with a guide to culture of especial importance . Such in part is the arduous and pleasing task which Prof. Gardiner has set himself in his able and interesting study of the Bible as literature . ' Let it be understood that there are , ideally , in treatises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and value of the Bible as literature ? which would of itself be sufficient to stimulate the inquiring spirit ? and the means to be used in arousing the uninterested , the dull , and the perverse young barbarian from his play to a consideration of this book as a means of enriching his intellectual and spiritual life . It is to the first of these that Prof. Gardiner confines himself : " My object has been , " he says in the preface , " to make students as familiar as possible with the English Bible , and to throw light on its literary forms by bringing together facts from the history of the translation into English . " It is unnecessary to describe Prof. Gardiner 's book in detail . A good general idea of it may he had from a short examination of the subjects with which it deals and the points of excellence which are brought out . Aside from the historical introduction , there are three subjects : a descriptive account of the chief forms of writing in the Bible  --  that is , the narrative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the New Testament , the prophecy , and the apocalypse , each of which is treated in a separate chapter ; the history of the translation into English ; and a final chapter on the place and influence of the translation on the course of EIIlglish literature . In dealing with the first of these subjects , Prof. Gardiner 's way is usually to show the different types of writing under each head , not so much as examples of different literary and rhetorical forms ? such as the short story , the epistle , the address , the lyric , etc. ? as a more human analysis of each kind of writing in terms of spiritual values and intensity of experience . He appropriately , therefore , discusses the style of each class of writing with a view to showing , how its characteristics ? its simplicity , its directness , its concreteness ? are part and parcel of the quality of thought . This difference is well emphasized by a comparison with the more abstract style of modern writing . The chapter on the history of the translation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to those who wish a simple statement of the facts . Even more impressive is the closing chapter . Prof. Gardiner makes out a most interesting case for the great influence that the translation has had on English style ; and , though he perhaps exaggerates the debt that all succeeding writers owe to the great translator , Tisdale , his treatment is in the interest of giving'or to whom honor is due . In general , it would be difficult to find in any semi-popular treatise on the subject of the Bible as literature a more interesting impression of the book ? of the quality of its thought , the dignity of its manner , and the range of its influence . Prof. Gardiner 's treatment will be seen from the preceding account to consist in a well-judged exposition of the good , the great , and the impressive things in the Bible as a work of literature . That is the most necessary of all aims to-day in such study of the book as Prof. Gardiner has in view . Yet it is the task of criticism to point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in aim . A young reader , turning to the Bible for the first time , might open to such a book as , say , the Chronicles , named by Prof. Brandes , and , as would probably be the case , not finding them interesting , might turn to Prof. Gardiner for guidance . Of such inferior parts Prof. Gardiner makes no mention ; indeed , his book contemplates a wholly appreciative study of time nobler passages . Yet no study of any piece of literature of any author , of any body of writings , can pretend to completeness which does not take into account all the facts . To be sure , in final estimates , we sift the good from the bad , and a popular reading of any of the great masters of literature contents itself with what is best . We remember Wordsworth , Lamb , and Browning , for example , by their most original and significant work , and are right in not troubling ourselves with their inferior writings . The selective process is , humanly , inevitable . But a professed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not merely dwell on the greatness of its theme . As a matter of fact , those of us who read the Bible , even with the most devout spirit , are conscious of the fact that the Bible is , as a whole , an extremely uneven book . There are many parts which children ought not to read . Guiding is to some degree moral discrimination , and though one would wish inferior work to be passed over as summarily as possible , it is perhaps a mistake for Prof. Gardiner to dwell so exclusively on excellencies . The only shortcoming in the Bible as literature that one finds in his treatment lies in the fact that , unlike modern literature , the Bible contains little abstract thought , and even this limitation is turned into praise for the greater simplicity and vividness of the Scriptures . The attitude is in general like that of Coleridge , Lamb , Hazlitt , and Cowden Clarke toward Shakespeare , in whom they were content to see no variableness , neither shadow of turning . The trouble , if trouble it be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preface : In all my discussion I have assumed the fact of inspiration , but without attempting to define it or to distinguish between religious and literary inspiration . The two come together in a broad region where every one who cares for a delimitation must run his line for himself . Setting aside the fact that , except as regards so-called verbal inspiration , not even psychologists are competent to tell us what inspiration is , much less to delimit the various forms of inspiration , the assumption seems to me to be both an unnecessary and an embarrassing one . It is unnecessary in dealing with a literary subject , because the student is to do simply with the body of facts as he has them presented to him ? in their variety , their impressiveness , their vitality ? to get what enjoyment and stimulus he may from them . These facts would be the same , Prof. Gardiner 's analysis of them would be the same , so long as he is the scrupulous and reverent critic that he is , whether the facts were inspired or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not of divine origins . Why complicate the question in this wise ? We do not assume inspiration of any sort in our ordinary literary studies , in dealing with Shakespeare or Shelley , for example ; but , if we use the t erne , it is as an after-thought , to express our admiration for the extrenu ' 01 ' 1'osite of what we find dull . The assumption is embarrassing in 1 hat it compels one even to force himself to pronounce everything good , and t0 eschew its opposite or to deny the existence of inferiority . In consequence of this , possibly , Prof. Gardiner is occasionally led to press his conclusions further than his facts will warrant . For cxa'mple , it is indisputable that the English translation has had an extraordinary effect on the history of English style ; and it is not too much , iii vie ; of that , to call Tindale , as Prof. Gardiner did in a former article , " the Father of English prose . " But it is somewhat extravagant to say " that if any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the English Bible it is not good English writing . " ' Regularity , precision , balance , cadence , and , indeed , many other virtues of prose existed in languages written by men who walked in darkness , and to some of these Greeks and Romans the debt of many English writers is as great as to the Bible . One can not see , without more evidence than Prof. Gardiner gives , how the Bible has materially affected the writing of , say , Swift , or Johnson , or Arnold , all professed believers in the excellence of the Book , to say nothing of such professed scoffers as Gibbon . And it is rather uncritical to say that " Lincoln , not only among Americans , but among all English-speaking people of the nineteenth century , is the man who most surely attained the grand style , and we all know how naturally in his most solemn moments his " style became infused with the , phrases and the virtues of the English Bible . " The main idea is a sofa l one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The second purpose of such books ? how to make readers interested in literature of the highest moment ? is not touched by Prof. Gardiner ; indeed , it was not his purpose to do so . That is the burden of Prof. Bates 's latest book ' on education . How to read the classics , the English classics , those books that Prof. Brandes found not " good for every one , " is really the complicated question that he , tries to answer . Originally delivered as a series of lectures at the summer school of the University of Illinois , his talks inevitably retain some of the unction and repetitiousness of popular discourse ; but the gist of the matter is not , hard to get at , and it is illuminated by a rich and thoughtful experience . The desideratum is the inculcation in the youthful mind of a real liking for literature . The means , in the last analysis , is the teacher who can make literature appear of vital rather than detached interest to the reader . The teacher must feel his subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many of the subjects frequently exploited at great length in teaching do not contribute to the end . Biographical matter is usually too copious ? for the reason that it is the easiest thing to talk about ; ? teachers do not make pupils think for themselves , but often do the work for them ; preaching palpable morals , a tempting and easy thing to do , is bad ; the pupil should not be warned to find excellence , lest he learn to cant ; lie should not be given questionable books , such as Macaulay- 's essay on Milton , for the reason that his mind becomes obsessed with Macaulay 's untenable dogmas ; juvenile literature is usually bad ; ? such are some of the drawbacks that Prof. Bates finds in the modern methods , and his remarks surely appeal to one 's reason . The wise course , on the contrary , is first to make the pupil understand what he is reading , ? to which end a special study of vocabulary and reading aloud are excellent means ? and then to lead him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not wholly new ; it agrees , for example , with that of Prof , Brandes already cited ; but the virtue of Prof. Bates is that his remarks and experiences are always copious and illuminating . As such the book should be read by every teacher , if for no other reason than the fresh and invigorating common-sense with which Prof. Bates approaches his subject . It is not an easy book , however ; he who runs , as many teachers are forced to do , may not always read . If anything , there is an embarras de richesses ; Prof. Bates has so much to say that he occasionally is under the necessity of making factitious categories in order to compass material for which there was no room in the more real divisions of his subject . For example , it is hard to dis tinguish , either in definition or illustration , the difference between such classes ( which name separate chapters ) as " The Problem " and " The Conditions , " or " The Inspirational Use of Literature " and " Educational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fall into a mild fremescence of style not good for clearness . But mainly the book is excellent , and its quality may to some degree be judged from such valuable advice as is contained in the following isolated passages . A sensitiveness to word-values is with a child the beginning of wisdom . Chil dren too often acquire , and adults follow , the habit of accepting words instead of ideas Children need to learn that the sentence is after all only the envel ope , only the vehicle , for the thought . Everybody agrees to this theoretically but practically the fact is ignored . The child is father to the man in nothing else more surely than in the trait of accepting in perfect good faith empty words as complete and satisfactory in themselves ( p. 14 ) . What should be done in the lower grades , and usually all that can with profit be attempted in the secondary schools anywhere , is to cultivate in the children a love of literature and some appreciation of it : appreciation intelligent , I mean , but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the history of authors , less with the criticism of style , and have no more explanation of difficulties of language and of structure than is necessary for the student 's enjoyment ( p. 30 ) . By way of making things worse , scholars are drilled in Macaulay 's " NI Mon . " The inclusion of this essay , the product of the author 's ' prentice hand , is most lamentable . The philistinism of Macaulay is here rampart ; and the one thing ivhielt students are sure to get from the essay is the conception that poetry is the product of barbarism , to be outgrown and cast aside when civilization is sufficient ly advanced ( p. 35 ) . I am far from being so modem as to think that pupils should not be asked to do anything which they do not wish to do ; but I am radical enough to believe that no other good which may be accomplished by the study of literature in any other way can coirp sate for making good books wearisome ( p. 53 ) . The taodency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is widespread ( p. 72 ) . Not one teacher in a score had succeeded a fact is related in impressing upon his pupils the fundamental truth that the only excuse that poetry can have for existing is that it fulfils an office impossible for prose . Yet nothing which can properly be called the study of poetry can be done till this prime fact is recognized with entire clearness ( p. 214 ) . Prof. Bates 's book is addressed to those with beginners in their charge , and it concerns itself largely with the aims and methods of such instruction . The aims of the higher study of English rather than the methods is the purport of Prof. Cook 's recent treatise , ' and it addresses itself rather to the advanced and eager studt than to the established teacher . The main thesis is somewhat difficult to state ? for two reasons : Prof. Cook 's book consists of four separate essays or addresses ? " The Province of English Philology , " " The Teaching of English , " " The Relations of Words to Literature , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written at different times during the last decade and delivered or published on various occasions ; and , in the second place , Prof. ( ' ook is so enthusiastic a believer in the ideals of his profession that to reduce his messages to cut and dried exactness is to lose the great persuasiveness of manner which is at least half their value . Presented as a single train of thought , the idea is , however , something as follows : Since the abdication of clergymen from their high office of leading the way to what is permanently good , and in view of the failure of poets nowadays to appeal vitally to man , the teacher has become the most important of guides in the conflict of spirit with matter . He must be in the highest degree human and scholarly , if he is to use present forces of modern life for the most ideal ends . English literature is the best : 02 SOME RECENT GUIDES TO CULTURE . means now at his disposal for accomplishing his mission , and he must be a philologist in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to relive the life of the past ; to enter by the imagination into the spiritual experiences of all the historic protagonists of civilization in a given period and era of culture ; to think the thoughts , to feel the emotions , to partake the aspirations , recorded in literature ; to become one with humanity in the struggles of a given nation or race to perceive and attain the ideal of existence ; and then to judge rightly these various disclosures of the human spirit , and to reveal to the world their true significance and relative importance . " His study , as Prof. Cook illustrates the matter in his address on the relation of words to literature , should be characterized by fulness as well as by intensity . There is good reason , Prof. Cook says in his essay on the teaching of English , for believing that the ideal may come to pass ; for out of the past chaos in English studies and the present tendency to lay stress on quantity rather than quality , there are signs that " scholarship in English , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deepening as well as widening , is growing more refined and less mechanical . There is hope that the quantitative test will be gradually supplanted by the qualitative ? that we shall forget to ask , How much ? ' and begin to ask , How well ? ' " Were it not for such hope and such ideals as this , a reader might wish that Prof. Cook had dealt more extensively with actual conditions as the best means of approach to his ideals . His high enthusiasm occasionally leads him to take a less strict account of what is than the most helpful attitude would call for . For example , in the last piece , he raises the qualifications of the well-equipped teacher to an impossible height , and , though he admits that the ideal is never attained , he would be more helpful if he gave some relative standing to the twelve attributes which no well-equipped teacher can be without . Is it more important , for example , that he teacher must " speak and write the language with propriety , " or that " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a good fellow , in the better sense of that term " ? Again , Prof. Cook does not squarely answer Prof. ( now President ) Wilson 's urbane strictures on the methods of much modern investigation , but says , in essence , that philology is the beautiful thing described in the foregoing paragraphs ; whereas Prof. Wilson 's quarrel was not with the ideal denotation of the term philology , but with its practical applications and the sins committed in its name . It is , of course , no answer to Prof. Wilson to say that certain great poets and orators have also studied the etymology and grammar , or have written treatises on those subjects . But as the presentation of an ideal the book could scarcely be surpassed . SOME RECENT GUIDES TO CULTURE . 393 The books which I have mentioned represent . three fairly distinct types : Mr. Larned , Prof. Brandes , and Prof. Cook , stand for more or Ies4 general points of view , not always in mutual agreement ; Prof. Gardiner presents special material , and Prof. Bates considers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these books are for the most part based on a broad corhmon-sense and a keen observation , the ultimate sanct ions of t hens all are personal rather than objective and scientific . Still : mother type , therefore , of guides to culture would comprise treatises which deal i 11 the matter in terms of actual science , such as anthropology and psy chology , in that they tell us how far natural limitations embarrass the inculcation of wisdom . Examples among very recent books are those of Prof. Horne ' and Prof. O'Shea . ' Again , that culture is more than reading is the implication of several books on art and music , which tell us how to see and to hear . Nor can more general books be neglected , which try to make us think rightly on momentous subjects . Such are President Eliot 's sober and substantial exposition of the value of wealth , ' a book at once sensible and moral ? though disfigured by an occasional impossible comparison , like that between the relative happi ness of the millionaire of fifty and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 and Prof. Wendell 's 6 generous analyses of the American character . All these and more might properly be brought under this head of cultural books . The books which I have chosen from recent announcements as those which best come under the subjec " have one thing in common . Almost without exception ? the fact was not noted until the moment of writing ? they have sprung from the universities . The fact is probably merely accidental ; ' but it suggests that the universities are still the chief popular guides to culture .
