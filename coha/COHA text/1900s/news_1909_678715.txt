txt HEAD TAX ON ALIENS. , Reading of tho arrivals of immigrants at Ellis Island brings to my mind fresh as if it were but yesterday , when in company with my parents and one young sister I landed ' in New York City after a thirty days ' voyage from England . On the packet ship Rochus of the Tapscot Line we left England on Sept. 13. reaching Now York on Oct. 13 , 1848 , and what has always been to me a grateful recollection was when our feet touched the shore we were met by a gentleman whose business soma to have been to welcome strangers from the Old World . A hearty welcome it was . I can almost feel that warm hand shake and the words of " Welcome ! God bless you , my boy ! God bless you ! " I often wonder whether the immigrant receives so hearty a greeting at Ellis Island at this day .
