 |p1177  SHORTLY before leaving for Europe Mr. Carnegie made a speech at Northampton , Mass. , in which he expressed his unqualified approval of dancing , on the grounds that we should make this life as happy as we can , and that it does much for children in improving their manners and bearing . At about the same time there was a convention of physical culture experts at the Teachers ' College , Columbia University , at which Dr. Sargent , of Harvard , spoke on " Useful Dancing from the Physical Training Standpoint , " and Elizabeth Burchenal explained how grace of carriage and posture are acquired by training in dancing . In his recent erudite volumes on " Adolescence " President G. Stanley Hall , of Clark University , makes a strong plea for the dance : We have in the dance of the modern ballroom only a degenerate relict , with at best but a very insignificant culture value , and too often stained with bad associations . This is most unfortunate for youth , and for their sake a work of rescue and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not excepting even music , the completest language of the emotions and can be made one of the best schools of sentiment and even will , inoculating good states of mind and exorcising bad ones as few other agencies have power to do . " Evidently a tendency in favor of a renaissance of the art of dancing is in the air . What are its chances of success ? Has dancing a future ? It can not be denied that at social functions it does not play as important a role as it used to . Girls still seem to be eager to dance , but dancing men ( striplings excepted ) are becoming more and more scarce . Yet it does not follow from this that the situation is hopeless . In all probability the tide might be turned if dances were held before midnight instead of after midnight . Most American men are hard workers , who can not afford to burn the candle at both ends . The words " Dancing from nine to twelve " on cards of invitation would doubtless bring many desirable men back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be wished , for diverse reasons . Undoubtedly women and men , girls and boys , in American cities do not get enough exercise . Time is short and transportation facilities are so abundant and cheap that very few do as much walking as consideration for their health demands . Nearly every afternoon I walk in Central Park , and every time I wonder at the lamentably small number of persons who frequent this beautiful patch of country in the midst of Manhattan for exercise and refreshment . Early dances , rendered attractive by beautiful women , bright lights , good music , simple suppers , opportunities for conversation and parlor games for variety , would doubtless attract many men who , in addition to all these things , would , like their partners , enjoy the hygienic advantages of one of the most efficient forms of muscular exercise . Another consideration in favor of a revival of the social dance is that it affords the best opportunities for courtship . Doubtless the increase in the number of bachelors and old maids is partly a result of the decline of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily made . The fact that at certain dancing schools and balls undesirable acquaintances may be made has caused many worthy parents to taboo dancing entirely , which is unnecessary , for if these parents will give the matter the supervision it calls for mistakes are no more likely to occur in the ballroom than at other social gatherings . If dancing is to have a future it must be made suitable for others besides the very young , to whom it now appeals almost exclusively . Before the nineteenth century most dances were slow and stately . The young folks not being allowed to meet in the days of strict chaperonage , the art of dancing was in/ trusted to the matured and married folk , to whose needs the stately gavottes , minuets , sarabandes , etc. , were well adapted . For those under thirty the rapid modern waltz , polka and gallop are no doubt best suited ; but why not restore the dances of the time of Bach , so that the middle-aged might have something appropriate as well as the young ? In the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to revive the medieval dance forms , which exist in great variety of rhythm and tempo , and perhaps these will sooner or later invade the ballroom too . This would break what is one of the chief drawbacks of the modern saltatorial art ? its monotony ? and make the dance of the future entertainingly varied . Some of our schools are already teaching national dances ( at the Teachers ' College Convention referred to above illustrations were given of a " weaving dance " performed in Sweden at harvesting time and of a quadrille from the Island of Gothland ) . Here is a fascinating field of possibilities for the ballroom of the future ! Every country has its national dances ; the variety is simply endless . Think of the dances of Bohemia , of Poland , of Hungary , of France , of Spain , of Russia , of Japan and a hundred other countries ! Think of the admirable use made of national , dances by Bach , Schubert , Chopin , Liszt , Grieg , Dvorak , Tchaikovsky and many others , and imagine the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , transplanted to our balls ! What a transformation there would be ! What a gain on the artistic side ! The future of ( lancing could thus be made as interesting as the present of music ? and this music would of course be adopted with the diverse national dances . It is only in this way that dancing can be saved . For some time it has seemed as if it would soon be a lost art ; it has languished in the home as in the public halls ( even the annual charity and masked balls have ceased to attract ) , and we seemed in a fair way of following the example of the indolent Orientals , who have all their dancing done by proxy . " In the eyes of the Chinese , " says Letourneau , " dancing is a ridiculous amusement by which a man compromises his dignity . " International dancing , with its fascinating rhythms and varied local color , would raise the amateur art to the level of private theatricals and of domestic music . It would thus receive a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elderly could be accommodated , for the national dances vary all the way from the melancholy Hungarian lassu to the wild friska , from the graceful Polish mazurka to the lively Spanish bolero or fandango with castanets . The future of professional dancing also lies partly in this direction . The oldfashioned tiptoe dancing on the operatic stage has almost entirely disappeared , thank goodness ! It was the most ungraceful thing imaginable ; the dancers , in their scant and grotesque attire , whirling about on the tips of their stiffened toes , had a movement as awkward as if they were going about on stilts . We are less easily amused than our ancestors ; the spectacular , pantomimic ballet alone can sustain our interest in stage dancing . In this branch of the art there are possibilities which our managers have not yet seized . They have withheld from us in particular the delightful ballets set to music by some of the greatest modern composers . Rubinstein wrote one , " The Vine , " and he introduced charming ballet music into " Feramors " and his other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ halls . Modest Tchaikovsky relates how his brother , Russia 's greatest composer , and Saint-Saens , the chief of French composers , were enamored of this form of their art . During a visit which Saint-Saens paid to Moscow he discovered that his tastes tallied in many respects with those of his Russian colleague : " Both , for example , were in their youth very enthusiastic over the ballet and often tried to imitate the dancers ' art . That suggested the idea to them of dancing for each other , and so they performed on the conservatory stage a short ballet , Galathea and Pygmaleon . ' The forty-year-old Saint-Saens took the part of Galathea and played the role of the statue with great devotion , while the thirty-five-year-old Tchaikovsky impersonated Pygmaleon . Rubinstein , at the piano , served as the orchestra . "  |p1179  Tchaikovsky preserved his interest in the ballet to the end of his life . Practically his last work was the " Nut Cracker , " a most entertaining composition , the music of which has become very popular in concert halls , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persuade Mr. Conried to produce this ballet at the Metropolitan Opera House . It would surely be a success and would show us the great Russian symphonist from a new point of view . As long as great men of genius are thus interested in the terpsichorean art we need not despair of its future . The new Hippodrome gives astounding proof of what can be done in this line with the aid of plenty of cash . Its ballet surpasses in splendor anything ever done even at the Metropolitan . With Mr. Stanley Hall 's intimation that the dance " is perhaps , not even excepting music , the completest language of the emotions , " I can not agree . It was so among savages , who not only exhibited all their feelings in dances , but believed that the buffalo dance , for instance , would act at a distance and bring the herds within their range . Such an exalted place the dance will never hold again , but that it has a future is , I think , indubitable .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
