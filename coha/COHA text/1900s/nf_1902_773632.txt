txt // by the air renders them entirely invisible to vision , even with the telescope , except when , during total eclipses of the sun , the glare is cut off by the intervention of the noon . They may then be seen , even with the naked eye , rising up as if from the black disk of the moon . The prominences seem to he of two forms , the eruptive and the cloud like . The first . rise from the sun like immense sheets of flank ; the latter seem to be at rest above it , like clouds floating in the air . But there is no air around the sun for these objects to float in , and we cannot. certainly say what supports them . Very likely , however , it is a repulsive force of the sun 's rays , which will be mentioned in a later chapter . Spectrum analysis shows that these prominences are composed mostly of hydrogen gas , mixed with the vapours of calcium and magnesium . It is to the hydrogen that they owe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to be connected with a thin layer of gases which surrounds and rests upon the photosphere . This layer is called the chromosphere , from its deep red colour , similar to that of the prominences . As in the case of the latter , most of its light seems to be that of hydrogen ; but it contains many other substances in seemingly varying proportions . The last appendage of the sun to be considered is the corona . This is seen only during total eclipses as a soft effulgence surrounding the sun , and extending from it in long rays , sometimes exceeding the diameter of the sun in length . Its exact nature is still in doubt . It will be described in the chapter on eclipses. // Hove the Sun is Made Up Let us now recapitulate what makes up the sun as we see and know it . We have first the vast interior of the globe which , of course , we can never see . What we see when we look at the sun is the shining surface of this globe , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more likely a gaseous layer several hundred miles deep which we cannot. distinguish from a surface . This layer is variegated by spots , and in or over it rise the faculae . On the top of the photosphere rests the layer of gases called the chromosphere , which can be observed at any time with a powerful spectroscope , but can be seen by direct vision only during total eclipses . Through or from the red chromosphere are thrown up the equally red flames called the prominences . Surrounding the whole is the coron .. Such is the sun as we see it . What can we say about what it really is ? First , is it solid , liquid , or gaseous ? That it is not solid we have already shown by the law of rotation . It can not be a liquid like molten metal , because it sends off from its surface such a flood of heat as would cool off and solidify molten metal in a very short time . For more than thirty years it . has been understood that the interior of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the density of a liquid by the enormous pressure of its superincumbent port ions . But it was still supposed that the photosphere might be in the nature of 4 // crust and the whole sun like an immense bubble . This view , however , seems no longer tenable . It does not seem likely that there is any solid matter on the sun . Attempts have sometimes been made to learn the temperature of the photosphere . It probably exceeds any that . we can produce on earth , even that of the electric furnace , else how could calcium , the metallic base of lime , one of the most . refractory of substances , exist there in a state of vapour ? We all know that the air around us becomes cooler and rarer as we ascend above the surface of the earth , owing to the action of gravity and the consequent weight of the atmosphere , which gives rise to a constantly increasing pressure as we descend . Now , gravity at the sun is twenty-seven times as powerful as on the earth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a far more rapid rate on the sun than on the earth . Even in the photosphere the temperature is such that " the elements melt with fervent heat . " And , as we go below the surface , the heat must increase by hundreds of degrees for every mile that we descend . The result is that in the interior the gases of the sun are subjected to two opposing forces which grow more and more intense . These are the expansive force of the heat and the compressing force of the gases above , produced by t he enormous force of gravity of the sun . The forces thus set in play merely in the outer portions of the sun 's globe are simply inconceivable . Perhaps the explosion of the powder when a thirteen-inch cannon is fired is as striking an example of the force of ignited gases as we are familiar with . Now suppose every foot // of space in a whole county covered with such cannon , all pointed upward and all being discharged at once . The result would compare with what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popgun compares with the cannon . The Source of the Sun 's Heat Perhaps , from a practical point of view , the most comprehensive and important problem of science is : How is the sun 's heat kept up ? Before the laws of heat were fully apprehended this quest ion IL as not . supposed to offer any difficulties . Even to this ( lay it is supposed by those not acquainted with the subject , that . the heat which we receive from the sun may arise in some way from the passage of its rays through our atmosphere , and that , as a matter of fact , the sun may not . radiate any actual heat at all ? may not be an extremely hot body . Bert , modern science shows that heat cannot. be produced except by the expenditure of some form of energy . The energy of the sun is necessarily limited in quantity and is continually being lost through radiation . It is very easy to imagine the sun as being something like a white-hot cannon ball , which is cooling off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n , ball does . ' We know by actual observation bow much heat the sun sends to us . It may be expressed in the following way : Imagine a shallow basin with a flat bottom , and a depth of one centimetre , that . is , about four tenths of an inch . Let the basin be filled ? it 11 water , the latter then being one centimetre deep . Expose such a basin to the // rays of the vertical sun . The heat which the sun will radiate to them will be sufficient to warm the water about three and a half or four degrees Centigrade , or not very far from seven degrees Fahrenheit , in one minute . It follows that if we suppose it thin spherical shell of water , one centimetre thick , of the stone radius as the earth 's orbit , and having the sun in its centre , that , shell of water will he heated with the rapidity just . mentioned . The heat which it receives will be the total amount radiated by the sun . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every minute , day and year . A very simple calculation will show that if the sun were of the nature of a white-hot ball it would cool off so rapidly that its heat could not last more than a few centuries . But it has in all probability lasted millions of years . Whence , then , comes the supply ? The answer of modern science to this question is that the heat radiated from the sun is supplied by the contraction of size as heat is lost . We all know that in many cases when motion is destroyed heat is produced . When a cannon shot is fired at the armour plate of a ship of war , the mere stroke of the shot makes both plate and shot hot . The blacksmith can make iron hot by hammering it . These facts have been generalized into the statement that . whenever a body falls and is stopped in its fall by , friction , or by a stroke of any sort , heat is produced . From the law governing the case , we know that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the falls , must be about one quarter of a degree warmer than it was during the fall . We also know that a hot body contracts // in volume when cooled . The contraction of a gaseous body , such as we believe the sun to be , is greater than that of a solid or liquid . Tile heat of the sun is radiated from streams of matter constantly rising from the interior , which radiate their heat when they reach the surface . Being cooled they fall back again , and the heat caused by this fall is what keeps the sun hot . It may seem almost impossible that heat sufficient to last for millions of years could be generated in this way ; but the known force of gravity at the surface of the sun enables us to make exact computations on the subject . It is thus found that in order to keep up the supply of heat it is only necessary that the diameter of the sun should contract about a mile in twenty-five years ? or four miles in a century . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yet the process of contraction must come to an end some time . Therefore , if this view is correct , the life of the sun must have a limit . What its limit may he we can not say with exactness , we only know that it is several millions of years , but not many millions . The same theory implies that the sun was larger in former times than it is now , and must have been larger and larger every year that we go hack into its history . There was a time when it must have been as large as the whole solar system . In this case it could have been nothing but a nebula . We thus have the theory that the sun and solar system have resulted from the contraction of a nebula ? through millions of years . This view is familiarly known as the nebular hypothesis . // The question whether the nebular hypothesis is to be accepted as a proved result of science is one on which opinions differ . There are many facts which support it ? such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rotation of the planets all in the stone direction . But caul ilium aural conservative minds will want some further proof ' of the theory before they regard it as absolutely established . 1 ' . ven if ' we accept it , we still have open the question : How did the nebula itself originate , and how did it begin to contract ? This brings us to the boundary where science can propound a question but can not answer it . III THE EARTH THE globe on which we live , being one of the planets , would be entitled to a place among the heavenly bodies even if it had no other claims on our attention . Insignificant though it is in size when compared with the great bodies of the universe , or even with the four giant planets of our system , it is the largest of the group to which it belongs . Of the rank which it might claim as the abode of man we need not speak . What is the earth ? We may describe it in the most comprehensive way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in diameter , bound together by the mutual gravitation of its parts . We all know that . it , is not exactly spherical , but bulges out very slightly at the equator . The problem of , determining its exact shape and size is an extremely difficult one , and we can not say that an entirely satisfactory result . is yet reached . The difficulty is obvious enough . There is no way of measuring distances across the great oceans . The measurements are necessarily limited to such islands as are visible from the coasts of the continents or from each other . Of course , the measures can not be extended to either pole . The size and shape must therefore be inferred from the measures across or along the continents . Owing to the importance of such work , the leading nations have from i // time to time entered into it . Quite recently our Coast and Geodetic Survey has completed the measurement of a line of triangles extending from the Atlantic to the Pacific Oceans . North and south measurements both on the Atlantic and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The English have from time to time made measures of the same sort . in Africa , and the Russians and Germans on their respective territories . Nearly all these measures are now being combined in a work carried on by the International Geodetic Association , of which the geodetic authorities of the principal countries are members . The latest conclusions on the subject may be summed up thus . We remark in the first place that by the figure of the earth geodetists do not mean the figure of the continents , but of the ocean level as it would be if canals admitting the water of the oceans were dug through the continents . The earth thus defined is approximately an ellipsoid , of which the smaller diameter is that through the poles , and which has about the following dimensions : Polar diameter , 7,899.6 miles , or 12,713.0 kilometres . Equatorial " 7,926.6 miles , or 12,756.5 kilometres . It will be seen that the equatorial diameter is twentyseven miles or forty-three kilometres greater than the polar . The Earth 's Interior What we know of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surface . The greatest depth t o which man has ever been able to penetrate cornTHE // pares with the size of the globe only as the skin of an apple does to the body of the fruit itself . I shall first invite the reader 's attention to some facts about weight , pressure , and gravity in the earth . Let us consider a cubic foot . of soil forming part of the outer surface of the earth . This upper cubic foot presses upon its bottom with its own weight , perhaps one hundred and fifty pounds . The cubic foot below it weighs an equal amount , and therefore presses on its bottom with a force equal to its own weight w the weight of the other foot added to it . This continual increase of pressure goes on as we descend . Every square foot in the earth 's interior sustains a pressure equal to I he weight of a column of the earth a foot square extending to the surface . Not many yards below the surface this pressure will 1w measured in tons ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty or forty tons ; at the depth of one hundred miles , thousands of tons ; continually increasing to the centre . Under this enormous pressure the matter composing the inner portion of the earth is compressed to the density of a metal . By a process which we will hereafter describe , the mean density of the earth is know n to he five and one half times that of water , while the superficial density is only two or three times that of water . One of the most remarkable facts about the earth is that the temperature continually increases as we penetrate below the surface in deep mines . The rate of increase is different in different Latitudes and regions . The general average is one degree Fahrenheit in fifty or sixty feet . // The first question to suggest itself is , how far toward the earth 's centre does this increase of temperature extend ? The most that we can say is that it can not be merely superficial , because , in that case , the exterior portions would have cooled off long ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of heat as we went down . The fact , that the heat . has been kept . up ( luring the whole of the earth 's existence shows that it must still be very intense toward the centre , and that the rate of increase near the surface must go on for many miles into the interior . At this rate the material of the earth would be red hot at a depth of ten or fifteen miles , while at one or two hundred miles the heat would be sufficient to melt all the substances which form the earth 's crust . This fact suggested to geologists the idea that our globe is really a molten mass , like a mass of melted iron , covered by a cool crust a few miles thick , on which we dwell . The existence of volcanoes and the occurrence of earthquakes gave additional weight to this view , as did also other geological evidence , showing changes in the earth 's surface which appeared to be the result of a liquid interior . But in recent years the astronomer and physicist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence can be , t hat the earth is solid from centre to surface , and even more rigid than a similar mass of steel . The subject was first developed most fully by Lord Kelvin , who showed that , if the earth were a fluid , surrounded by a crust , the action of the moon would not cause tides in the // ocean , but would merely tend to stretch out the entire earth in the direction of the moon , leaving the relative positions of the crust and the water unchanged . Equally conclusive is the curious phenomenon which we shall describe presently of the variation of latitudes on the earth 's surface . Not only a globe of which the interior is soft , but even a globe no more rigid than steel could not rotate as the earth does . How , then , are we to reconcile the enormous temperature and the solidity ? There seems to be only one solution possible . The matter of the interior of the earth is kept solid by the enormous pressure . It is found experimentally that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are raised to the melting point , and then subjected to heavy pressure , the effect of the pressure is to make them solid again . Thus , as we increase the temperature we have only to increase the pressure also to keep the material of the earth solid . And thus it is that , as we descend into the earth , the increase of pressure more than keeps pace with the rise of temperature , and thus keeps the whole mass solid . Gravity and Density of the Earth Another interesting question connected with the earth is that of its density , or specific gravity . We all know that a lump of lead is heavier than an equal lump of iron , and the latter heavier than an equal lump of wood . Is there any way of determining what a cubic foot of earth would weigh if taken out from a great depth of its vast interior ? If there is , then we can determine what the // actual weight of the whole earth is . The solution depends on the gravitation of matter . Every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to walk , but the profoundest philosopher knows nothing of its cause , and science has not discovered anything respecting it except a few general facts . The widest and most general of these facts , which may be said to include the whole subject , is Sir Isaac Newton 's theory of gravitation . According to this theory , the mysterious force by which all bodies on the surface of the earth tend to fall toward its centre does not reside merely in the centre of the earth , but is due to an attraction exerted by every particle of matter composing our globe . Whether this was the case was at first an open question . Even so great a philosopher and physicist as Huyghens believed that the power resided in the earth 's centre , and not in every particle , as Newton supposed . But the latter extended his theory yet farther by showing that every particle of matter in the universe , so far as we have yet ascertained , attracts every other particle with a force that diminishes as the square of the distance increases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be divided by four ; at three times by nine ; at four times by sixteen , and so on . Granting this , it follows that all objects around us have their own gravitating power , and the question arises : Can we show this power by experiment , and measure its amount ? The mathematical theory shows that globes should attract small bodies at their surfaces with a force proportioned to their diameter . A globe two // feet in diameter , of the same specific gravity as the earth , should attract with a force one twenty-millionth of the earth 's gravity . In recent times several physicists have succeeded in measuring the attraction of globes of lead having a diameter of a foot , more or less . This measurement is the most delicate and difficult that has ever been made , and the accuracy which seems to have been reached would have been incredible a few years ago . The apparatus used is , in its principle , of the simplest kind . A very - light horizontal rod is suspended at its centre by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be obtained . This rod is balanced by having a small ball attached to each end . What . is measured is the attraction of the globes of lead upon these two halls . ' 1'lae former are placed in such a position as to unite their attraction in giving the rod a slight twisting motion in the horizontal plane . To appreciate the difficulties of the case , we must call to mind that the attraction may not amount to the ten-millionth part of the weight of the little balls . It would be difficult to find any object so light that its weight would not exceed this force . To compare the weight of a fly with it would be like comparing the weight of an ox with that of a dose of medicine . Not only the weight of a mosquito but even of its finest limb might exceed the quantity to be measured . If a mosquito were placed under a microscope an expert operator could cut off ' from one antenna a piece small enough to express the force measured . Yet the determination of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results of the two latest investigators do not differ by a thousandth part . These were Professor Boys , F.R.S. , of Oxford , England , and Dr. Karl Braun , S .. 1. , of Maricnschein , in Bohemia . They worked independently at the problem , meeting and overcoming innumerable difficulties one after another , getting greater and greater delicacy and precision in their apparatus , and finally published their results almost . at the same time , the one in England , the other in Austria . The outcome of their experiments is that the mean density of the earth is slightly more than five and a half times that of water . This is a little less than the density of iron , but much more than that of any ordinary stone . As the mean density of the materials ' which compose the earth 's crust is scarcely more than one half of this amount , it follows that near the centre the matter composing the earth must be compressed to a density not only far exceeding that of iron , but probably that of lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a hundred years . It was first demonstrated by Maskelyne about 1775 in the case of Mount Schehallion , in Scotland . In all mountain regions where very accurate surveys are made the attraction of mountains upon the plumb line is very evident . Variations of Latitude We know that the earth rotates on an axis passing through the centre and intersecting the earth 's surface at either pole . If we imagine ourselves standing exactly // on a pole of the earth , with a flagstaff fastened in the ground , we should be carried round the flagstaff by the earth 's rotation once in twenty-four hours . We should become aware of the motion by seeing the sun and stars apparently moving in the opposite direction in horizontal circles by virtue of the diurnal motion . Now , the great discovery of the variation of latitude is this : The point in which the axis of rotation intersects the surface is not fixed , but moves around in a somewhat variable and irregular curve , contained within a circle nearly sixty feet in diameter . That is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observe its posit ion day by day , we should find it moving one , two , or three inches every day , describing in the course of time a curve annuli ! one central point , from which it would sometime ? be fart her away and sometimes nearer . It would make a complete revolution in this irregular way in about . fourteen months . Since we have never been at the pole , the quest ion may arise : How is this known ? The answer is that by astronomical observations we can , on any night , determine the exact angle between the plumb line nL the place where we stand and the axis on which the earth is rotating on that particular day . Four or five stations for making these observations were established around the earth in 1900 by the Internal Tonal Geodetic Association . One of these stations is near Gaithersburg , Md. , another is on the Pacific coast , a third is in Japan , and a fourth in Italy . Before these were established observations having the same object were made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most important stations // in the latter region were those of Professor Rees of Columbia University , New York , and of Professor Doolittle , first at . Lehigh , and later at the Flower Observatory , near Philadelphia . The variation which we have described was originally demonstrated by S. C. Chandler , of Cambridge , in 1890 by menus of a great mess of astronomical observations not made for this special purpose . Since then investigation has been going on with the view of determining the exact curve described . What has been shown thus far is that the variation is much wider some years than others , being quite considerable in 1891 , and very small in 1894 . It appears that in the course of seven years there will be one in which the pole describes the greater part of a comparatively wide circle , while three or four years later it will for several months scarcely move from its central position . If the earth were composed of a fluid , or even of a substance which would bend no more than the hardest steel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impossible . Our globe must therefore , in the general average , be more rigid than steel . d The Atmosphere The atmosphere is astronomically , as well as physically , a most important appendage of the earth . Necessary though it is to our life it constitutes one of the greatest obstructions with which the astronomer has to deal . It absorbs more or less of all the light that passes through it , and thus slightly changes the colour of the // heavenly objects as we see them , and renders them somewhat dimmer , even in the clearest sky . It also refracts the light passing through it , causing it to describe a slightly curved line , concave toward the earth , instead of passing straight to the astronomer 's eye . The result of this is that the stars appear slightly higher above the horizon than they actually are . The light coming directly down from a star in the zenith suffers no refraction . The latter increases as the star is farther from the zenith , but even forty-five degrees away it is only one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unaided eye can plainly perceive ; yet this is a very important quantity to the astronomer . The nearer the object is to the horizon the greater the rate at which the refraction increases ; twenty-eight degrees above the horizon it is about twice as great as at forty-five degrees ; at the horizon it is more than one half a degree , that is more than the whole diameter of the sun or moon . The result is that when we see the sun just about to touch the horizon at sunset or sunrise its whole body is in reality below the horizon . We see it only in consequence of the refraction of its light . Another result of the rapid increase near the horizon is that , in this position , the sun looks decidedly flattened to the eye , its vertical diameter being shorter than the horizontal one . Anyone may notice this who has an opportunity to look at the sun as it is setting in the ocean . It arises from the fact that the lower edge of the sun is refracted more than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the clear air of the // tropics a beautiful effect may be noticed , which can rarely or never be seen in the thicker air of our latitudes . It arises from the unequal refraction of the rays of light by the atmosphere . Like a prism of glass the atmosphere refracts the red rays the least and the successive spectral colours , yellow , green , blue , and violet , more and more . The result is that , as the edge of the sun is disappearing in the ocean , these successive rays are lost sight of in the same order . Two or three seconds before the sun has disappeared , the little spark of its limb which still remains visible is seen to change colour and rapidly grow paler . This tint changes to green and blue , and finally the last glimpse which we see is that of a disappearing flash of blue or violet light . iv THE Moos ABOUT one hundred years ago there was an unpopular professor in the Government Polytechnique School of Paris , still the great school of mathematics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his students into difficulties . One morning he addressed one of them the question : " Monsieur , have you ever seen the moon ? " " No , sir , " replied the student , suspecting a trap . The professor was nonplussed . " Gentlemen , " said he , " see Mr. - , who professes never to have seen the moon ! " The class all smiled . " I admit that I have heard it spoken of , " said the student , " but I have never seen it . " I take it for granted that the reader has been more observant than the French student professed to be , and that he has not only seen the moon , but knows the phases through which it goes and is familiar with the fact that it describes a monthly course around the earth . I also suppose that he knows the moon to be a globe , although , to the naked eye , it seems like a flat disk . The globular form is , however , very evident when we look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of measurement all agree // in placing the moon at an average distance of a little less than two hundred and forty thousand miles . This distance is obtained by direct measure of the parallax , as will be explained hereafter , and also by calculating how far oft the moon must be in order that , being projected into space , it may describe an orbit around the earth in the time that it actually does perform its round . The orbit is elliptic , so that the actual distance varies . Sometimes it is ten or fifteen thousand miles less , at other times as much more , than the average . The diameter of the moon 's globe is a little more than one fourth that of the earth ; more exactly , it is two thousand one hundred and sixty miles . The most careful measures show no deviation from the globular form except that the surface is very irregular . Revolution and Phases of the Moon The moon accompanies the earth in its revolution round the sun . To some the combination of the two motions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any real difficulty . Imagine a chair standing in the centre of a railway car in rapid motion , while a person is walking around it at a distance of three feet . He can go round and round without varying his distance from the chair and without any difficulty arising from the motion of the car . Thus the earth moves forward in its orbit , and the moon continually revolves around it without greatly varying its distance from us . The actual time of the moon 's revolution around the earth is twenty-seven days eight hours ; but the time // from one new moon to another is twenty-nine days thirteen hours . The difference arises from the earth 's motion around the sun ; or , which amounts to the same thing , the apparent motion of the sun along the ecliptic . To show this , let AC be a small arc of the earth 's orbit around the sun . Suppose that at a certain time the earth is at the point E , and the moon at the point M , between the earth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours the earth will have moved from E to F. 12 2 THE SUN , EARTH , AND MOON While the earth is making this motion the moon will have moved around the orbit in the direction of the arrows , so as to have reached the point N. At the moment when the lines EM and FN are parallel to each other , the moon will have completed her actual revolution , and will seem to be in the same place among the stars as before . But the sun is now in the direction FS . The moon therefore has to continue its motion before it catches up to the sun . This requires a little more than two days , and makes the whole time between two new moons twenty-nine and a half days . The varying phases of the moon depend upon its position with respect to the sun . Being an opaque globe , without light of its own , we see it only as the light of the sun illuminates it . When it is between us and the sun its dark hemisphere is turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time of this position in the almanacs is called " new moon , " but we can not commonly see the moon for nearly two days after this time , because it is lost in the bright twilight of evening . On the second and third day , however , we see a small portion of the illuminated globe , having the familiar form of a thin crescent . This crescent we commonly call the new moon , although the time given in the almanac is several days earlier . In this position , and for several days longer , we may , if the sky is clear , see the entire face of the moon , the dark parts shining with a faint gray light . This light is that which is reflected from the earth to the moon . An inhabitant of the moon , if there were such , would // then see the earth in the sky like a full moon , looking much larger than the moon looks to us . As the moon advances in its orbit day after day , this light diminishes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sight owing to the brightness of the illuminated portion of the moon . Seven or eight days after the almanac time of new moon , the moon reaches its first quarter . We then see half of the illuminated disk . During the week following , the moon has the form called gibbous . After the end of the second week the moon is opposite Ilse sun , and we see its entire hemisphere like a round disk . This we call full moon . During the remainder of its course the phases recur in reverse order , as ate all know . We might regard all these recurrences as too well known to need description , yet , in the Ancient Mariner , a star is described as seen between the two horns of the moon as though there were no dark body there to intercept our view of the star . Probably more than one poet has described the new moon as seen in the eastern sky , or the evening full moon as seen in the west . The Surface of the Moon We can see with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bright and dark regions . The latter are sometimes conceived to have a vague resemblance to the human face , the nose and eyes being especially prominent . Hence the " man in the moon . " Through even the smallest telescopes we see that the surface has an immense variety of detail ; and the more powerful the teleSURFACE // scope the more details we see . The first thing to strike us on a telescopic examination will be the elevations , or mountains as they are commonly called . These are best seen about the time of the first quarter , because they then cast shadows . At full moon they can not be so well made out , because we are looking straight down and see everything illuminated . Although these elevations and depressions are called mountains they are different in form from the ordinary mountains of the earth . There is , however , an almost exact resemblance between them and the craters of our great volcanoes . A very common form is that of a circular fort , one or more miles in diameter , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside of this fort may be saucer shaped , a large portion of the surface being flat . At first quarter we can see the shadow of the walls cast upon the interior flat surface . In the centre a little cone is frequently seen . The interior surface is by no means perfectly flat and smooth . The higher power the more details we shall see . Just what these consist of it is impossible to say ; they may be solid rock or they may be piles of loose stone . As we can see no object on the moon , even with the most powerful telescope , unless it is more than a hundred feet in diameter , we can not say what the exact nature of the surface is in its minutest portions . The early observers with the telescope supposed that the dark portions were seas and the brighter portions continents . This notion was founded on the fact that the darker portions looked smoother than the others . Names were therefore given to these supposed oceans , such // as Mare Procellarum , the Sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , etc . These names , fanciful though they be , are still retained to designate the large dark regions on the moon . A very slight improvement in the telescope , however , showed that the idea of these dark regions being oceans was an illusion . They are all covered with inequalities , proving that they must be composed of solid nutter . The difference of aspect arises from the lighter or darker shade of the materials which compose the lunar surface . These are distributed over the surface of the moon in a very curious way . One of the most remarkable features is the long bright lines which radiate from certain points on the moon . A very low telescopic power will show the most remarkable of these ; a good eye might even perceive it without a telescope . On the southern part of the moon 's hemisphere , as we see it , is a large spot or region known as Tycho , and from this radiate a number of these bright streaks . The appearance is as if the moon had been cracked and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we accept this view or not , it is impossible to examine the surface of the moon without the conviction that in some former age it was the scat of great volcanic activity . In the centre of all the great circular mountains we have described are craters which , it would seem , musthave been those of volcanoes . Indeed , a hundred years ago it was supposed by Sir William Herschel that there was an active volcano on the moon , but it is now known that this appearance is due to the light of the earth reflected from a very bright spot . on the moon 's // surface . It can be easily seen about the time of the new moon with a telescope of moderate size . Is there Air or Water on the Moon ? One of the most important questions connected with the moon is whether there is any air or water on its surface . To these the answer of science up to the present time is in the negative . Of course this does not mean that there can absolutely not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atmosphere on our satellite ; all we can say is that if any atmosphere surrounds the moon it is so rare that we have never been able to get any evidence of its existence . If the latter had such an appendage of even one hundredth of the density of the earth 's atmosphere , its existence would be made known to us by refraction of the light from a star seen alongside the moon . But not the slightest trace of any such refraction can be discovered . If there is any such liquid as water , it must be concealed in invisible crevices , or diffused through the interior . Were there any large sheets of water in the equatorial regions they would reflect the light of the sun day by day , and would thus become clearly visible . The water would also evaporate and form more or less of an atmosphere of watery vapour . All this seems to settle another important question ; namely , that of the habitability of the moon . Life , in the form in which it exists on our earth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all its higher forms air also . We can hardly conceive of a living thing made of mere sand or other dry matter such as forms the lunar // surface . If we supposed animals to walk about on the moon , it is difficult . to imagine what they could eat . Our general conclusion must be that there is no life on the moon subject . to the laws which govern life on the surface of this earth . The total absence of air and water results in a state of things on the moon such as we never experience on the earth . So far as can be ascertained by the most careful examination , not the slightest change ever takes place on its surface . A stone lying on the surface of the earth is continually attacked by the weather and in the course of years is gradually disintegrated or washed away by the wind and water . But there is no weather on the moon , and a stone lying on its surface might rest there for unknown ages undisturbed by any cause whatever . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and it cools off when the sun has set . Except for these changes of temperature there is absolutely nothing going on over the whole surface of the moon , so far as we can see . A world which has no weather and on which nothing ever happens ? such is the moon . Rotation of the Moon The rotation of the moon on its axis is a subject on which some are frequently so perplexed that we shall explain it . Anyone who has carefully examined this body knows that it always presents the same face to us . This shows that it rotates on its axis in the same time that . it . revolves around the earth . An idea frequently entertained is that this shows that it does not rotate at all , // and many chapters have been written on this subject . The whole difficulty arises from the different ideas which people have of motion . In physics we say that a body does not rotate when , if a rod were passed through it , that rod always maintained the same direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a rod passed through the moon ; then , if the latter did not rotate on its axis the rod would maintain its same direction while the moon , revolving around the earth , would appear at different points in its orbit as we see it in A very little study of this figure will show that as the moon went around we should successively see every part of its surface in succession if it did not rotate on its axis . How the Moon Produces the Tides All of us who live on the seashore know that there is a rise and fall of the ocean which in the general average occurs about three quarters of an hour later every day , and which keeps pace with the apparent diurnal motion of the moon . That is to say , if it is high tide to-day when // the moon is in a certain position in the heavens , it will be high tide when t he moon is in or near that position day after day , month after month , and year after year . We lime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attraction on the ocean . We readily understand that when the moon is above any region its attraction tends to o raise the waters in that region ; but the circumstance that most perplexes those who are not expert in the subject is that there are two tides a day , high tide occurring not only under the moon , but on the side of the earth opposite the moon . The explanation of this is that the moon really attracts the earth itself as well as it does the water . It continually draws the entire earth and everything upon it toward itself . As it goes round the earth in its monthly course , it thus keeps up a continual motion of the latter . If it attracted every part of the earth equally , the ocean included , there would then be no tides , and everything would go on on the earth 's surface as if there were no attraction at all . But as the attraction is as the inverse square of the distance , the moon attracts the regions of the earth and oceans which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those that are farthest from it less than the average . To show the effect of these changes let A , C , and H be the three points on the earth attracted by the moon . Since the moon attracts C more than A , it tends to pull C away from A and increase the distance between A and C. At the same time pulling H more than C it tends to increase the distance between H and C. If the whole earth wax n fluid , the attraction of the moon would be simply to // draw this fluid out into the form of an ellipsoid , of which the long diameter would be turned toward the moon . But the earth itself , being solid , can not be drawn out into this shape , while the ocean , being fluid , is thus drawn out . The result is that we have high tides at the two ends of the ellipse into which the ocean is drawn , and low tides in the mid-region . The complete explanation of the subject requires a statement of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will , however , remark that if the attraction of the moon on the earth were always in the same direction , the two bodies would be drawn together in a few days . But owing to the revolution of the moon round the earth the direction of the pull is always changing , so that the earth is , in the course of a month , only drawn about three thousand miles from its mean position by the moon 's pull . It might be supposed that if the moon produces the tides in this way we should always have high tide when the moon is on the meridian and low tide when the moon is in the horizon . But such is not the case , for two reasons . In the first place it takes time for the moon to draw // the waters out into the form of an ellipsoid , and when it once gives them the motion necessary to keep this form , that motion keeps up after the moon has passed the meridian , just as a stone continues to rise after it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the momentum of the water . The other cause is found in the interruption of the motion by the great continents . The tidal wave , as it is called , meeting a continent , spreads out in one direction or the other , according to the lay of the land , and may be a long time in passing from one point to another . Thus arise all sorts of irregularities in the tides when we compare those in different places . The sun produces a tide as well as the moon , but a smaller one . At the times of new and full moon the two bodies unite their forces and cause the highest and lowest tides . These are familiar to all dwellers on the seacoast and are called spring tides . About the time of the first and last quarters the attraction of the sun opposes that of the moon and the tides do not rise so high or fall so low , and these are called neap tides . V ECLIPSES OF THE MOON THE reader is doubtless aware that an eclipse of the moon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth , and that an eclipse of the sun is caused by the moon passing between us and the sun . Taking this knowledge for granted , we shall explain the more interesting features of these phenomena and the laws of their recurrence . The first question to be considered is : Why is there not an eclipse of the moon at every full moon , since the earth 's shadow must always be in its place opposite the sun ? The answer is that the moon commonly passes either above or below the shadow of the earth , and so fails to be eclipsed . This , again , arises from the fact that the orbit of the moon has a small inclination , about five degrees , to the plane of the ecliptic , in which the earth moves , and in which the centre of the shadow always lies . Returning to our former thought of the ecliptic being // marked out on the celestial sphere , let us suppose that we also mark out , the orbit of the moon during the course of its monthly period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noon crossing that of the sun in two opposite points , at . the very small angle of five degrees . These points of crossing are called nodes . At one node the moon passes from below , or south of the ecliptic , to the north of it . This is called the ascending node . At the other the ! noon passes from north to south of the ecliptic . This is called the descending node . The terms ascending and descending are applied to the node , because to us in the northern hemisphere , the north side of the ecliptic and equator seem to be above the south side . At the points halfway between the nodes the centre of the moon is above the ecliptic by about one twelfth its distance from us , that is , by about twenty thousand miles . The sun being larger than the earth , the shadow of the latter gradually grows smaller away from the earth . At the distance of the moon its diameter is about three fourths that of the earth , that is about six thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ecliptic , it extends only about three thousand miles abov e and below that plane . Hence it is that the moon will pass through it only when near the nodes . Eclipse Seasons The line joining the sun and moon of course turns round as the earth moves around the sun . It therefore crosses the moon 's nodes twice in the course of a year . That is to say if we suppose the nodes to be marked in the // sky , the ascending node at one point , and the descending nude at the opposite point , then the sun will appear to us to pass each of these points in the course of a year . While the sun is passing one node the shadow of the earth will seem to be passing the other . It is only near these two times of the year that an eclipse of the sun or moon can occur . We may therefore call them eclipse seasons . They commonly last about a month ; that is to say it is generally about a month from the time when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an eclipse until the time when it is too far past for an eclipse to occur . In 1901 the seasons were May and November . If the moon 's node stayed in the same place in the sky , eclipses would occur only some time during these two months . But , owing to the attraction of the sun on the earth and moon , the position of the nodes is continually changing in a direction opposite that of the motion of the two bodies . Each node makes a complete revolution around the celestial sphere in eighteen years and seven months . Hence in this same period the eclipse seasons will course all through the year . On an average they , occur about nineteen days earlier every year than they I did the year before . Thus it happens that in 1903 one season occurs in March and April and the other season in September and October . The change will keep going on tint il , in the year 1910 , the season which in 1901 was in May will have gotten back to November , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , each having passed through all the intermediate months , and the two // having changed places . By . 1919 each will have made an entire revolution through the year . Let us imagine ourselves to be looking at the sun and earth from the moon when the latter is about to enter the earth 's shadow . The earth , looking much larger than the sun , will be seen to approach it , and at length will begin to impinge on its disk and cut off a part of its light . The region within which this will occur is called the penumbra , and it is shown outside the shadow in the figure . So long as the moon is only in this region , an ordinary observer would not notice any diminution in its light , although such a diminution could be detected by exact photometric measurements . The moon is not said to be eclipsed until it begins to enter into the actual shadow , where the whole direct light of the sun is cut off . How an Eclipse of the Moon Looks If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin , we shall see a small portion of her eastern edge gradually grow dim and finally disappear . As the moon advances in her orbit , more and more of her face thus disappears from view by entering into the shadow . If , however , we look very carefully , we shall see that the part HOW AN ECLIPSE OF MOON LOOKS 13T immersed in the shadow has not entirely disappeared , but shines with a very faint light . If the whole body of the moon enters into the shadow , the eclipse is said to be total ; if only a portion of her body dips into the shadow , it is called partial . If the eclipse is total , the light which illuminates the eclipsed moon will be very plainly seen , because it is not drowned out by the dazzling light of the uneclipsed portion . This light is of a dingy red colour , and arises from the refraction of the earth 's atmosphere , which was described in a former chapter . In consequence of this , those rays of the sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short distance of its surface , are bent out of their course and thrown into the shadow by refraction . Thus they fill the shadow and fall on the moon . The red colour is due to the same cause that makes the sun appear red at sunset , namely , the absorption of the green and blue rays by the atmosphere , which lets the red rays pass . Two or three eclipses of the moon occur every year , of which one , at least , is nearly always total . But , of course , the eclipse will be visible only in that hemisphere of the earth on which the moon is shining at the time . When the moon is eclipsed an observer on that body would see an eclipse of the sun by the earth . The cause of the phenomenon we have described would then be plain enough to him . The apparent size of the earth would be much larger than that of the moon as we see it . Its diameter would be between three and four times that of the sun . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approached the sun . What the observer would see would be the cutting off of the light of the sun by the // advancing but invisible earth . When the latter had nearly covered the sun , its whole outline would be shown to him by a red light surrounding it , caused by the refraction of the earth 's atmosphere . Finally , when the last truce of true sunlight had disappeared , nothing would be visible but this ring of bright red light having inside of it the black but otherwise invisible body of tho earth . The circumstances of an eclipse of the moon are quite different from those of a solar eclipse , to be described in the next chapter . It can aways be seen at the same instant over the whole hemisphere of the earth on which the moon is shining at the time . A curious phenomenon occurs when the moon rises totally eclipsed . Then we may see it on one horizon , say the eastern one , while the sun is still visible on the western horizon . The explanation of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horizon , but are so elevated by refraction that we can see them at the same time . VI ECLIPSES OF THE SUN IF the moon moved exactly in the plane of the ecliptic she would pass over the face of the sun at every new moon . But , owing to the inclination of her orbit , as described in the preceding chapter , she will actually do so only when the direction of the sun happens to be near one of the moon 's nodes . When this is the case we may see an eclipse of the sun if we are only on the right part of the earth . Supposing the moon to pass over the sun , the first question is whether it can wholly hide the sun from our eyes . This depends not on the actual size of the two bodies but on their apparent size . We know that the sun has about four hundred times the diameter of the moon . But it is also four hundred times as far from us as the moon . The curious result of this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to our eyes . Sometimes // the moon appears a little the larger , and sometimes the sun . Li the former case the moon may entirely hide the sun ; in the hatter case she can not do so . One important difference between an eclipse of the moon and of the sun is that the former is always the same wherever it is visible , while an eclipse of the sun depends upon the position of the observer . The most interesting eclipses are those in which the centre of the moon passes exactly over that of the sun . These are called central eclipses . To see one , the observer must station himself at a point through which the line joining the centres shall pass . Then if the apparent size of the moon exceeds that of the sun , the former will completely hide the sun from view . The eclipse is then said to be total . If the sun appears the larger , a ring of its light will surround the dark body of the moon at the moment of central eclipse . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ring ) . The line of centres of the two bodies sweeps along the surface of the earth , and its course may be shown by a line marked on a map . Such maps , showing the regional // and lines of eclipses are published in the astronomical ephemerides . An eclipse may be total or annular in a region a few miles north or south of this central line , but never for so far as one hundred miles . Outside this limit an observer will see only a partial eclipse , that is , one in which the moon partly covers the sun . In yet more distant regions of the earth there will be no eclipse at all . Beauty of a Total Eclipse A total eclipse is one of the most impressive sights that nature offers to the eye of man . To see it to the best advantage one should be in an elevated position commanding the widest possible view of the surrounding country , especially in the direct ion from which the shadow of the moon is to come . The first indication of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth or in the air , but on the disk of the sun . At the predicted moment a little notch will be seen to form somewhere on the western edge of the sun 's outline . It increases minute by minute , gradually eating away , as it were , the visible sun . No wonder that imperfectly civilised people , when they saw the great luminary thus diminishing in size , fancied that a dragon was devouring its substance . For some time , perhaps an hour , nothing will be noticed but the continued progress of the advancing moon . It will be interesting if , during this time , the observer is in the neighbourhood of a tree that will permit the sun 's rays to reach the ground through the small openings in its foliage . The little images of the sun which form here and there on the ground will then have // the form of the partially eclipsed sun . Soon the latter appears as the new moon , only instead of increasing , the crescent . form grows thinner minute by minute . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the diminishing light. , there may be little noticeable darkness until the crescent has grown very thin . If the observer has a telescope with a dark glass for viewing the sun , he will now have an excellent opportunity of seeing the mountains on the moon . The unbroken limb of the sun will keep its usual soft and uniform outline . But the inside of the crescent , the edge of which is formed by the surface of the moon , will be rough and jagged in outline . As the crescent is about to disappear the advancing mountains on the rugged surface of the moon will reach the sun 's edge , leaving nothing of the latter but a row of broken fragments or points of light , shining between the hollows on the lunar surface . They last but a second or two and then vanish . Now is seen the glory of the spectacle . The sky is clear and the sun in mid-heaven , and yet no sun is visible . Where the latter ought to be the densely black globe of the moon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is surrounded by an effulgence radiating a saintly glory . This is the sun 's corona , already mentioned in our chapter on the sun . Though bright enough to the unaided vision , it is seen to the best advantage with a telescope of very low magnifying power . Even a common opera glass may suffice . With a telescope of high power only a portion of the corona is visible , and thus the finest part of the // effect is lost . A common spy-glass , magnifying ten or twelve times , is better , so far as effect is concerned , than the largest telescope . Such an instrument will show not only the corona itself but the so-called " prominences " ? fantastic cloud-like forms of rosy colour rising here and there , seemingly from the dark body of the moon . Ancient Eclipses It is remarkable that though the ancients were familiar with the fact of eclipses , and the more enlightened of them perfectly understood their causes , some even the laws of their recurrence , there are very few actual accounts of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old Chinese annals now and then record the fact that an eclipse of the sun occurred at a certain time in some province or near some city of the empire . But no particulars are given . Quite recently the Assyriologists have deciphered from ancient tablets a statement that an eclipse of the sun was seen at Nineveh , B. C. 763 , June 15 . Our astronomical tables show that there actually was a total eclipse of the sun on this day , during which the shadow passed a hundred miles or so north of Nineveh . Perhaps the most celebrated of the ancient eclipses , and the one that has given rise to most discussion , is that known as the eclipse of Thales . Its principal historical basis is a statement of Herodotus that in a battle between the Lydians and the Medes the day was suddenly turned into night . The armies thereupon ceased battle and were more eager to come to terms of peace with each other . It // is added that ' Hades , the Milesian , had predicted to the Ionians this change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should occur . Our astronomical tables show that there actually was a total eclipse of the sun in the year B. C. 585 , which was near enough to the time of the battle to he the one alluded to , but it is now known that the path of the shallow did not quite reach the seat of hostilities tilt after sunset . Some doubt therefore still rests on the subject . Prediction of Eclipses There is a curious law of the recurrence of eclipses which has been known from ancient times . It is based on the fact that the sun and moon return to nearly the same positions , relative to the node and perigee of the moon 's orbit , after a period of six thousand five hundred and eighty-five days eight hours , or eighteen years and twelve days . This period is called the Saros . Eclipses of every sort repeat themselves at the end of a Saros . For example , the eclipse of May , 1900 , may be regarded as a repetition of those which occurred in the years 1846 , 1864 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is not visible in the same part of the earth , because of the excess of eight hours in the period . During this eight hours the earth performs one third of a rotation on its axis , which brings a different region under the sun . Each eclipse is visible in a region about one third of the way round the world , or one hundred and twenty degrees of longitude , west of where it occurred before . Only after three periods will the recurrence be near the same region . But in the meantime the moon 's line of motion will have // changed so that the path of its shadow will pass farther north or south than before . There are two series of eclipses remarkable for the long duration of the total phase . To one of these the eclipse of 1868 , hereafter mentioned , belongs . This recurred in 1886 , and will recur again in 1904 . Unfortunately , at the first recurrence , the shadow was cast almost entirely on the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans , so that it was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ September 9 , will be yet more unfortunate for , us , because the shadow will pass only over the Pacific Ocean . Possibly , however , it may touch some island where observations may be made . The recurrence of 1922 , September 1 , will be visible in northern Australia , where the duration of totality will be about four minutes . To the other and yet more remarkable series belonged the eclipse of May 7 , 1883 , and that of May 11 , 190L At the successive recurrences of this eclipse the duration of totality will be longer and longer through the twentieth century . In 1937 , 1955 , and 1973 it will exceed seven minutes , so that so far as duration is concerned , our successors will see eclipses more remarkable than any their ancestors have enjoyed for many centuries . The Sun 's Appendages About 1863-64 the spectroscope began to be applied to researches on the heavenly bodies . Mr. ( now Sir , William ) Huggins , of London , was a pioneer in observing the spectra of the stars and nebulae @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to be learned in this // way about the sun . The year 1868 at length arrived . On August . eighteenth there was to be a remarkable total eclipse of the sun , visible in India . The shadow was one hundred and forty miles broad ; the duration of the total phase was more than six minutes . The French sent Mr. . Janssen , one of their leading spectroscopists , to observe the eclipse in India and see what he could find out . Wonderful was his report . The red prominences which had perplexed scientists for two centuries were found to be immense masses of glowing hydrogen , rising here and there from various parts of the sun , of a size compared with which our earth was a mere speck . This was not all . After the sunlight reappeared , Janssen began to watch these objects in his spectroscope . He followed them as more and more of the sun came out , and continued to see them until after the eclipse was over . They could be observed at any time when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sky . By a singular coincidence this same discovery was made independently in London without any eclipse . Mr. J. Norman Lockyer was then rising into prominence as an enthusiastic worker with the spectroscope . It occurred independently to him and to Mr. Huggins that the heat in the neighbourhood of the sun was so intense that any matter that existed there would probably take the form of a gas shining by its own light . Both of these investigators endeavoured to get a sight of the prominences in this way ; but it was not until October twentieth , two months after the Indian eclipse , that Mr. Lockyer succeeded in having an instrument of sufficient // power completed . Then , at the first opportunity , he found that he could see the prominences without an eclipse ! At that time communication with India was by mail , so that for the news of Mr. Janssen 's discovery astronomers had to wait until a ship arrived . By a singular coincidence his report and Mr. Lockyer 's communication announcing his own discovery reached the French Academy of Sciences at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enthusiasm , caused a medal to be struck in commemoration of the new met hod of research , in which the profiles of Lockyer and Janssen appeared together as co-discoverers . Since that time the prominences are regularly mapped out from day to day by ' spectroscopic observers in various parts of the world . The greatest beauty of a total eclipse is due to the sun 's corona . The exact nature of this appendage is still in doubt . Indeed , until photography was called to the aid of the astronomer its structure was unknown . It was described by observers simply as a soft light surrounding the sun ; but when it is photographed and carefully examined it is found to be of a radial , hairy structure which the reader can easily see from the frontispiece of the book . It extends out farthest in the direction of the sun 's equator and least at the poles . The rays which chance to be exactly at the poles go straight out from the sun . But those on each side are found to curve toward the equator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more powerful effulgence going out from the region of the solar spots . Near the . poles the // forms are remarkably like those which iron filings assume when scattered on paper above a magnet . It is therefore a question whether there is not here something in the nature of a magnetic force . But in the region called the sun 's equator this analogy ceases to hold . In describing the sun we mentioned the much greater activity in the regions of greater spottedness than elsewhere . It now seems as if the forces which throw out the corona are also greatest where the sun 's activity is greatest . The probability now seems to be that the corona is composed of matter thrown up from the sun , and kept from falling back again by the repulsion of the solar rays , and that it bears a certain resemblance to the tail of a comet . A very important question is whether the corona shines mostly by reflected light , or by its own light , due to the high temperature which it must have so near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sources , but it is not yet known in what proportion . The fact is that its spectrum shows some bright lines . These can be due only to the light of the matter itself . Some observers have supposed that they also saw dark lines in the spectrum . This , however , has not been proved . On the whole the probability seems to be that the corona shines mostly by its own light . ORBITS AND ASPECTS OF THE PLANETS THE orbits in which the planets revolve around their central luminary are in strictness ellipses , or slightly flattened circles . But the flattening is so slight that the eye would not notice it without , measurement . The sun is not in the centre of the ellipse but in a focus , which in some cases is displaced from the rent re by an amount that the eye can readily perceive . This displacement measures the eccentricity of the ellipse , which is much greater than the flattening . For example , in the case ( . f Mercury , which moves in a very eccentric orbit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , if , we represent the greatest diameter of the orbit by fifty , the least diameter will be forty-nine . But . the distance of the sun from the centre of the orbit is ten on the same scale . To show this we give a diagram of the orbits of the inner group of planets showing quite nearly their forms and respective locations . A simple glance will show that the orbits are much nearer together at some points than at others . In explaining the various aspects and motions , real and apparent , of the planets a number of technical expressions are used which we shall explain . Inferior planets are those whose orbits lie within the // orbit of the earth . This class comprises only Mercury and Venus . Superior planets are those whose orbits lie without that of the earth . These comprise Mars , the minor planets or asteroids , and all four of the outer group of major planets . When a planet seems to us to pass by the sun , and so is seen as if alongside of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun . An inferior conjunction is one in which the planet is between us and the sun . A superior conjunction is one in which the planet is beyond the sun . ORBITS AND ASPECTS OF PLANETS 153 " A little consideration will show that a superior planet can never be in inferior conjuction , but an inferior planet has both kinds of conjunction . A planet is said to be in opposition when it is in the opposite direction from the sun . It then rises at sunset , and vice versa . Of course , an inferior planet can never be in opposition . The perihelion of an orbit , is that point of it which is nearest the sun ; the aphelion its most distant point from the sun . As the inferior planets , Mercury and Venus , perform their revolutions , they seem to us to swing from one side of the sun to the other . Their apparent distance from the sun at any time is called their elongation . The greatest elongation of Mercury is generally about twenty-five degrees , being sometimes more and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orbit of this planet . The greatest elongation of Venus is almost forty-five degrees . When the elongation of one of these planets is east from the sun we may see it in the west after sunset ; when west we may see it in the east in the morning sky . As neither of them ever wanders from the sun farther than the distances we have stated , it follows that a planet seen in the east in the evening , or in the west in the morning , can not be either Mercury or Venus . No two orbits of the planets lie exactly in the same plane . That is , if we regard any one orbit as horizontal , all the others will be tipped by small amounts toward one aide or the other . Astronomers find it convenient to take r I // the orbit . of the earth , or the ecliptic , as the horizontal or standard one . As each orbit is centred on the sun it will have two opposite points which lie on the same horizontal plane as the earth 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the orbit intersects the plane of the ecliptic . They are called nodes . The angle by which an orbit is tipped from the plane of the ecliptic is called its inclination . The orbit of Mercury has the greatest inclination , more than 6 ? . The orbit of Venus is inclined 3 ? 24 ' ; those of all the superior planets less , ranging from 0 ? 46 ' in the case of Uranus to 2 ? 30 ' in the case of Saturn . Distances of the Planets Leaving out Neptune , the distances of the planets follow very closely a rule known as Bode 's Law , after the astronomer who first pointed it out . It is this : Take the numbers 0 , 3 , 6 , 12 , etc. , doubling each as we go along . Then add 4 to each number , and we shall hit very nearly on the scale of distances of all the planets except Neptune , thus : On these actual distances we remark that astronomers do // not use miles or other terrestrial measures to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the first place , they are too short ; to use them would be like stating the distance between two cities in centimetres . In the next place , distances in the heavens can not be fixed with the necessary exactness in our measures , whereas , if we take the sun 's distance from the earth as the unit of measure , we can determine other distances between the planets with great precision in terms of this measure . So , to get the distances of the planets from the sun in astronomical measure , we have to divide the last numbers of the preceding table by ten , or insert a decimal point before the last figure of each . We have not in this table distracted the attention of the reader by using unnecessary decimals . Actually , the distance of Mercury is 0.387 , etc. ; we have simply called it 0.4 and multiplied it by 10 to get the proportion for comparing with Bode 's Law . Kepler 's Laws The motions of the planets in their orbits take place In accordance with certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kepler 's laws . The first of these has already been mentioned ; the orbits of the planets are ellipses , of which the sun is in one focus . The second law is that the nearer the planet is to the sun the faster it moves . With more mathematical exactness , the areas swept over by the line joining the planet and sun in equal times are all equal . The third law is that the cubes of the mean distances // of the planets from the sun are proportional to the squares of their times of revolution . This law requires some illust ration . Suppose one planet to be four times as far from the sun as another . It will then be eight times as long going around it . This number is reached by taking the cube of four , which is sixty-four , and then extracting the square root , which is eight . The unit of measure which the astronomer uses to express distances in the solar system being the mean distance of the earth from the sun , it follows that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as we have just shown , while those of the outer ones will vary from 1.5 in the case of Mars to 30 in the case of Neptune . If we take the cubes of all , these distances and extract their square roots we shall have the times of the revolution of the planets , expressed in years . It will be seen that the outer planets are longer in getting around their orbits , not only because they have farther to go , but because they actually move more slowly . If , as in the case first supposed , the outer planet is four times as far from the sun , it will move only half as fast . This is why it takes eight times as long to get around . The speed of the earth in its orbit is about 18.6 miles per second . But that of Neptune is only about 3.5 miles per second , although it has thirty times as far to go . This is why it takes more than one hundred and sixty years to complete a revolution . II @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the major planets we shall take them up in the order of their distance from the sun . The first planet reached will then be Mercury . It is not only the nearest planet to the sun , but much the smallest of the eight ; so small , indeed , that , but for its situation , it would hardly be called a major planet . Its diameter is about two fifths greater than that of the moon , but , the volumes of bodies being proportional to the cubes of their diameters , it has about three times the volume of the moon . It has far the most eccentric orbit of 1111 the major planets , though , in this respect , it is exceeded by some of the minor planets to be hereafter described . In consequence , its distance from the sun varies between wide limits . At perihelion it is less than twenty-nine millions of miles from the sun ; at aphelion it goes out to a distance of more than forty-three millions of miles . It performs its revolution around the sun in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in eighty-eight days . I11 therefore makes more than four revolutions in a year . Performing more than four revolutions around the sun while the earth is performing one , we readily see that it must pass conjunction with the sun at certain regular though somewhat , unequal intervals . To show IMr arm // the exact nature of its apparent motion let the inner circle of ' the diagram represent the orbit of Mercury and the outer one that of the earth . When the earth is at E , and Mercury at M , the latter is in inferior conjunction with the sun . At the end of three months it will have returned to the point M , but it will not yet be in conjunction , because , in the meantime , the earth has moved forward in its orbit . When the earth reaches a certain point 1 , ' , Mercury will have reached the point N and will again be in inferior conjunction . This revolution from one inferior conjunction to another is called the synodic revolution of the planet . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than the time of actual // revolution ; that is to say , the arc MN is a little less than one third of the circle . Now suppose that when the earth is at E , Mercury , instead of being at M is near the highest point A of the orbit as represented in the figure . It will then be at its greatest apparent distance from the sun as we see it from the earth ; or , in technical language , at its greatest east elongation . Being east of the sun it will then set after the sun , by a time generally between an hour and a quarter and an hour and a half . This is the most convenient time for seeing it . If the sky is clear , it will readily be seen in the twilight from half an hour to an hour after sunset . At the opposite elongation , near C , it is west of the sun ; then it rises before the sun and may be seen in the morning twilight . The Surface and Rotation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mercury is late in the afternoon , when it is near east elongation , // or shortly after sunrise , if it rises before the sun . Sup'posing it east of the sun , it will probably be visible in the telescope at any time after noon , but the air is generally disturbed by the sun 's rays so that it is hardly possible to make a good observation at that time . Late in the afternoon the air grows steadier , so that the planet can be better observed . But , after sunset , the planet is seen through a continually increasing extent of atmosphere , so that the seeming disturbance again begins to increase . Owing to these circumstances it is the most difficult of all the planets to study in a satisfactory way , and observers differ very much as to what can be seen on its surface . The first observer who thought he could see any features on the surface of this planet was Schroter , a German . When Mercury presented the form of a crescent he fancied that its south horn seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a lofty mountain ; and by observing the intervals between the blunted appearance he concluded that the planet revolved on its axis in twenty-four hours and five minutes . But Sir William Herschel , who observed at the same time with much more powerful instruments , could not see anything of the kind . Until quite recently nearly all observers agreed with Herschel that no time of rotation could be certainly determined . But a few years since , Schiaparelli , observing with a fine telescope in the beautiful sky of northern Italy , noticed that the aspect of the planet seemed unchanged day after day . He was thus led to the concluTHE // lion that it always presents the same face to the sun , as the moon presents the same face to the earth . This view was shared by Mr. Lowell , observing at the Flagstaff Observatory . But the observation is too difficult to permit us to regard the fact as established . All that a conservative astronomer would be willing to say is that as yet we know nothing of the revolution of Mercury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been made by several astronomers . As it is seen under all ordinary conditions no special features are well marked . Very different is the case at the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff , Ariz . The most singular feature of its surface in the latter picture consists in the ( lark lines which cross it . These have not been seen by other observers , and , until they are established by independent evidence , astronomers will be sceptical as to their reality . The reason of this will be stated later in connection with the planet Mars . Owing to the various positions of Mercury relative to the sun it presents phases like those of the moon . These depend upon the relation of the dark and the illuminated hemispheres relative to the direction in which we see the planet . The hemisphere which is turned away from the bun , being in darkness , is always invisible to us . At superior conjunction the illuminated hemisphere is turned toward us and the planet seems round , like a full moon . As it moves from east elongation to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is turned toward us , and less and less of the illuminated one . But this // disadvantage is counterbalanced by the fact that the planet , continually comes nearer during the interval , so that we get a better view of whatever portion of the illuminated ( hemisphere may be visible to us . Its apparent . form and size at different times during its synodic T ( volut on go through a series of changes similar to those shown in the next chapter in the case of Venus . The question whether Mercury has an atmosphere is also one on which opinions differ , the prevailing opinion being in the negative . It seems quite certain that , if it has one , it is too rare to reflect the light of the sun . Transits of Mercury It will be readily seen that , if an inferior planet revolved around the sun in the same plane as the earth , we should see it pass over the sun 's disk at every inferior conjunction . But no two planets revolve in the same plane . Of all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that of the earth . In consequence , when in inferior conjunction , it commonly passes a greater or less distance to the north or to the south of the sun . If , however , it chances to be near one of its nodes at the time in question , we shall see it as a black spot passing across the sun 's disk . This phenomenon is called a transit of Mercury . Such transits occur at intervals ranging between three and thirteen years . They are observed with much interest by astronomers because it is possible to determine with great precision the time at which the planet enters upon the solar disk , and leaves it again . Knowing these times , // valuable information is afforded respecting the exact law of motion of the planet . The first observation of a transit of Mercury was made by Gassendi on November 7 , 1631 . His observation is not , however , of any scientific value at the present time , owing to the imperfection of his instruments . A somewhat better but not good observation was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during a visit to the island of St. Helena . Since that time the transits have been observed with a fair degree of regularity . The following table shows the transits that will be visible during the next fifty years , with the regions of the earth in which each may be seen : 1907 , November 14 , visible in Europe and eastern United States . 1914 , November 7 , visible in the same regions . 1924 , May 7 , the beginning will be visible on the Pacific coast , but the whole transit only on the Pacific Ocean and in eastern Asia . 19527 , November 9 , visible in Asia and eastern Europe . 1937 , May 11 , Mercury will graze the south limb of the sun . The phenomenon will be visible in Europe , but will occur before the sun rises in America . 1940 , November 10 , visible in the Western and Pacific States . 1953 , November 14 , visible throughout the United States . Observations of transits of Mercury since 1677 have brought out one of the most perplexing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orbit of this planet is found to be slowly changing its position , its perihelion moving forward by about , forty-three seconds per century farther than it ought . to move in consequence of the attraction of all the known planets . This deviation was discovered in 1845 by he Ferrier , celebrated as having computed the position of Neptune before it had ever been recognised in the telescope . He attributed it to the attraction of a planet , or group of planets , between Mercury and the sun . His announcement set people to looking for the supposed planet . About 1860 , a Dr. Lescarbault , a country physician of France , who possessed a small telescope , thought he had seen this planet passing over the disk of the sun . But it was soon proved that he must have been mistaken . Another more experienced astronomer , who was looking at the sun on the same day , failed to see anything except an ordinary spot . It was probably this which misled the physician-astronomer . Now , for forty years , the sun has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stations without anything of the sort being seen . Still , it is possible that little planets so minute as to escape detection in passing over the sun 's disk may revolve in the region in question . If so , their light would be completely obscured by that of the sky , so that they might not ordinarily be visible . But there is still a chance that , during a total eclipse of the sun , when the light is cut off from the sky , they could be seen . Observers have , from time to time , looked for them during total eclipses . In one instance something of the sort was // supposed to be found . During the eclipse of 1878 , Professor Watson , of Ann Arbor , and Professor Lewis Swift , both able and experienced observers , thought that they had detected some such bodies . But critical examination left no doubt that what Watson saw was a pair of fixed stars which had always been in that place . How it was with the observations of Professor Swift has never been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the position with such certainty that positive conclusions could be drawn . Notwithstanding such failures , observers have repeated the search during several of the principal total eclipses . The writer did so during the eclipse of 1869 , and again during that of 1878 , the search lacing male with a small telescope . In recent times the powerful agency of photography has been invoked by Professors Pickering and Campbell during the eclipses of 1900 and 1901 . Campbell 's results during the latter eclipse were the most decisive yet reached . With his photographic telescope some fifty stars were photographed , some as faint as the eighth magnitude , but they were all found to be known objects . It therefore seems certain that there can be no intramercurial much brighter than the eighth magnitude . It would take hundreds of thousands of such planets as this to produce the observed motion of Mercury . So great a number of these bodies would produce a far brighter illumination of the sky than any that we see . The result therefore seems to be conclusive against the view that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by intramercurial planets . In addition to all these difficul. // ties in supposing the planet to exist we have the difficulty that , if it did exist , it would produce a similar though smaller change in the position of the nodes of either Mercury or Venus , or both . Altogether , the evidence seems conclusive against the reality of any bodies whose attraction could produce the Awned deviation , which still remains unexplained . The most recent supposition on the subject is that the force of gravitation deviates slightly from the law of the inverse square . But this requires farther investigation . t III THE PLANET VENUS OF all the star-like objects in the heavens the planet Venus is the most brilliant . The sun and moon are the only heavenly bodies outshining it . In a clear and moonless evening it may be seen to cast a shadow . If an observer knows exactly where to look for it , and has a well-focused eye , it can be seen in the daytime when near the meridian , provided that the sun is not in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it may be seen in the west , faintly before sunset and growing continually brighter as the light diminishes . When west of the sun it rises in the morning before the sun , and may then be seen in the east . Under these circumstances it has been called the evening and morning star respectively . The ancients called it Hesperus when an evening star , and Phosphorus when a morning star . It is said that , in the early history of our race , Hesperus and Phosphorus were not known to be the same body . If Venus is examined with the telescope , even one of low power , it will be seen to exhibit phases like those of the moon . This fact was ascertained by Galileo when he first directed his telescope toward the planet , and afforded him strong evidence of the truth of the Copernican System . In accordance with a custom of the time he published this discovery in the form of an anagram  --  a // collection of letters which , when subsequently put together would state the discovery . Translated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the loves emulates the phases of Cynthia . " W hat we have said of the synodic motion of Mercury applies in principle to Venus , and need not therefore be repeated . In the following cut the apparent size of the planet is shown in various parts of its synodic orbit . As the planet passes from superior to inferior conjunction its globe continually grows larger in apparent size , though we can not see its entire outline . But the fraction of the disk illuminated continually becomes smaller , first having the shape of a half moon , and then the shape of a crescent , which grows thinner and thinner up to the time of inferior conjunction . In the latter position the ark hemisphere is turned toward us and the planet is invisible . Venus is at its greatest brightness about halfay between inferior conjunction and greatest elongation . It then sets about two hours after the sun , if east of it , and rises about two hours before the sun , if west of it . // Rotation of Venus The question of the rotation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time of Galileo . But the difficulty of learning anything certain on the subject is very great , owing to the peculiar glare of the planet . When seen through a telescope no sharp and well-defined markings are visible . Instead of this there is a glare on the surface , varying by gentle gradations from one region to another , as if we were looking upon a globe of polished but slightly tarnished metal . Nevertheless , various observers have supposed that they could distinguish bright or dark spots . As far back as 1667 Cassini concluded from these seeming spots that the planet revolved on its axis in a little less than twentyfour hours . During the next century Blanchini , an Italian observer , published an extensive treatise on the subject , illustrated with many drawings of the planet . His conclusion was that Venus required more than twentyfour days to revolve on its axis . Cassini , the son , defended his father 's conclusion by claiming that the planet had always made one revolution and a little more between the times of Blanchini 's observations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the spots on successive evenings a little farther advanced , and estimated the motion by this advance , not being aware that a whole revolution had been made during the interval . At the end of twenty-four days the same hemisphere of the planet would be presented to the earth as before , the number of revolutions in the meantime being twenty-five . // Schriiter tried to decide the question for Venus in the same way that lie supposed himself to have decided it for Mercury . I le directed his attention especially to the fine sharp horns of the crescent , when the planet was nearly bet ' % cell t he earth and the sun . At certain intervals he supposed one of them to be a little blunted . Ascribing this appearance to the shadow of a high mountain , he concluded that the time of rotation was twenty-three hours twenty-one minutes . From the time of Schroter no one professed to throw any more light on the question until 1832 . Then De Vico , of Rome , announced that he had rediscovered the markings found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty-three hours twenty-one minutes , in agreement with Schroter 's result . This close agreement between the results of observations by four distinguished observers led to the very general acceptance of twenty-three hours twenty-one minutes as the time of rotation of the planet . But there was much to be said on the other side . The great Herschel , with the most powerful telescopes that had ever been made , was never able to make out any permanent markings on Venus . If anything like a spot appeared , it varied and disappeared again so rapidly that no evidence of rotation could be afforded by it . This negative result has always been reached by the large majority of observers . But a new and surprising theory has been recently put forth by Schiaparelli , and maintained by Lowell . This is that Venus rotates on its axis in the same period that it revolves around the sun ; in other words both Mercury // and Venus always present the same face to the sun , as the moon presents the same face to the earth . Schiaparelli reached this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be seen on the southern hemisphere of Venus for several days in succession in the ' same position day after day . He could observe the planet ' through several hours on each day , and the constancy of the spots precluded the idea that the planet made one rotation and a little more in the course of a day . Lowell was led to the same conclusion by careful study of the planet at his Arizona observatory . The latest conclusion has been reached by the spectroscope . We have already explained how , with this instrument , it can be determined whether a heavenly body is moving toward us or from us . The principle applies to a planet which we see by the reflected light of the sun as well as to a star . Hence , if Venus rotates , one part of its disk will be moving toward us , and the other from us . By comparing the dark lines of the spectrum shown by the two edges of the disk of Venus it can then be determined how various points of the disk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus found by Belopolsky that the planet was affected by a quite rapid rotation . The observation is so difficult , and the displacement of the lines so small , that it was not possible to state a very certain result , although the general fact was made very probable . On the whole we must regard this conclusion as the most likely that has yet been reached , although it is at variance with the observations of Schiaparelli , as well as those of the Lowell Observatory . But the spectro172 PLANETS AND THEIR SATELLITES scopic observations have not yet been made with sufficient precision to teach us the exact time of revolution . Recent . discoveries as to the nature of the atmosphere of Venus make it almost certain that all the observers who supposed that they saw markings on the planet were mistaken . Atmosphere of Venus It is now well established that Venus is surrounded by an atmosphere which is probably denser than that of the earth . This was shown in a remarkable and interest- ing way during the transit of Venus over the sun 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Cape of Good Hope . When the planet was a little more than hal f way on the disk , its outer edge appeared illuminated , as shown on the figure . This illumination , however , did not commence at the middle point of the arc , as it // should have done had it been caused by regular refraction , but commenced at a point quite near one end of the arc . This appearance was explained by Russell , of Princeton , who showed that the atmosphere is so full of vapour that we can not see the light of the sun by direct refraction through it . What we see is an illuminated stratum of clouds or vapour floating in an atmosphere . Such being the case , it is not at all likely that astronomers on the earth can ever see the solid body of the planet through these clouds . Hence the . supposed spots could only have been temporary clouds , continually , changing . To illustrate the illusions to which the sight of even good observers may be subject , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t he whole hemisphere of Venus to be visible when the planet was near inferior conjunction . It then had the appearance familiarly known as " the new moon in the old moon 's arms , " with which everyone who observes our satellite when a narrow crescent is familiar . In the case of the moon it is well known that we thus see the dark hemisphere by the light reflected from the earth . But in the case of Venus there is no possibility of a sufficient reflection of light from the earth , or any other body . The appearance has sometimes been explained by a possible phosphorescence covering the whole hemisphere of Venus . But it is more likely due to an optical illusion . It has generally been seen in the daytime , when the sky is brightly illuminated , and when any faint light like that of phosphorescence would be completely in , . // visible . To whatever we might attribute the light , it ought to : ) e seen far better after the end of twilight in the evening than ( luring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then seems to be conclusive against its reality . The appearance illustrates a well-known psychological law , that the imagination is apt to put in what it is accustomed to see , even when the object is not there . We are so accustomed to the appearance on the moon that when we look at Venus the similarity of the general phenomena leads us to make this supposed familiar addition to it . Has Venus a Satellite ? During the past two centuries several observers have from time to time thought that they saw a satellite of " , Venus . Countless observers , with good telescopes , have seen nothing of the sort . We may safely say that Venus has no satellite visible in the most powerful telescopes of our time . Quite likely these supposed satellites were Seeming objects quite familiar to astronomers under the name of " ghosts . " These are sometimes seen when a telescope is pointed at a bright object , and are due to a double reflection of light in the lenses either of the objectglass or the eyepiece . A few years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very large telescope in England stating that , by great care , he could see a very faint , round , and welldefined aureole of light around the planet Mars . He desired to know whether the object could be real , or how the appearance was to be explained . In reply , he wa4 informed that such an appearance would be produced // by the double reflection of light between the two inner lenses of the object-glass , provided their curvatures were nearly , but not exactly the same . It was suggested that he point the telescope at Sirius and see if a similar apearance did not surround the star . He probably found that such was the case . Transits of Venus The transits of Venus across the sun 's disk are among the rarest phenomena of astronomy , as they occur , on the average , only once in sixty years . For many centuries past and to come there will be a regular cycle , bringing about four transits in two hundred and forty  - -  three years . The intervals between the transits are one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one hundred and twenty-one and a half years , eight , years ; then one hundred and five and a half years again , and so on . The dates of the last six transits and the two next to come are as follows : Table It will be seen that no person now living is likely to see this phenomenon , as the next transit does not occur until 2004 . Yet , the time when Venus will appear upon the disk on June 8 of that year can now be predicted for any point on the earth 's surface , within a minute or two . // The interest which has attached to these transits during the past century arose from the fact that they were supposed to afford the best method of determining the distance of the sun from the earth . This fact and the rarity of the phenomenon led to the last four transits being observed on a large scale . In 1761 , and again in 1769 , t he leading maritime nations sent observers to various parts of the world to note the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun 's disk . In 1874 and 1882 , expeditions were fitted up on a large scale by the United States , Great Britain , France , and Germany . On the first of these occasions American parties occupied stations in China , Japan , and eastern Siberia on the north , and in Australia , New Zealand , Chatham Island , and Kerguelen Island in the south . In 1882 it was not necessary to send out so many expeditions , because the transit was visible in this country . In the southern hemisphere stations were occupied at the Cape of Good Hope and other points . The observations made by these expeditions proved of great value in determining the future motions of Venus , but it was found that other methods of determining the distance of the sun would lead to a more certain result . IV THE PLANET MARS More public interest has in recent years been concentrated on the planet Mars than on any other . Its . resemblance to our earth , its supposed canals , oceans , climate , snowfall , etc. , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inhabitants . At the risk of disappointing those readers who would like to see certain proof that our neighbouring world is peopled with rational beings , I shall endeavour to set forth what is actually known on the subject , distinguishing it from the great mass of illusion and baseless speculation which has crept , into popular journals during the past twenty years . We begin with some particulars which will be useful in recognising the planet . Its period of revolution is six hundred and eighty-seven days , or forty-three days less than two years . If the period were exactly two years , it would make one revolution while the earth made two , and we should see the planet in opposition at regular intervals of two years . But , as it moves a little faster than this , it takes the earth from one to two months to catch up with it , so that the oppositions occur at intervals of two years and one or two months . This excess of one or two months makes up a whole year after eight oppositions ; consequently , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again be in opposition at the same time of the . // year , and near the sauce point of its orbit , as before . In this period t Ile earth will have made seventeen revolutions and Mars dine . The difference of a month or so in the interval between oppositions is due to the great eccentricity of the orbit. , which is larger than that of any other major planet except Mercury . Its value is 0.093 , or nearly one tenth . Hence , when in perihelion , it is nearly one tenth nearer the sun than its mean distance , and when in aphelion nearly one tenth farther . Its distance from the earth at opposition will be different by the same amount , measured in miles , and hence in a much larger proportion to the distance itself . If opposition occurs when the planet is near perihelion , the distance from earth is about forty-three million miles ; but if near the aphelion , about sixty million miles . The result of this is that , at a perihelion opposition , which can occur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three times as bright as at an aphelion opposition , occuring in February or March . An opposition occurred near the end of March , 1903 ; the next following early in May , 1905 . We shall then have oppositions near the end of June , 1907 , and in August , 1909 , which will be quite near to perihelion . Mars , when near opposition , is easily recognised by its brilliancy , and by the reddish colour of its light , which is very different from that of most of the stars . It is curious that a telescopic view of the planet does not give so strong an impression of red light as does the naked eye view . // The Surface and Rotation of Mars The great Huygens , who flourished between 1650 and 1700 , studying Mars with the telescope , was the first one to recognise the variegated character of its surface , and to make a drawing of the appearance which it presented . The features delineated by Huygens can be recognised and identified to this day . By watching them it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ axis in a little more ' , than one of our days C2411. 37m . ) . This time of rotation is the only definite and certain one among all the planets besides the earth . For two hundred years Mars has rotated at exactly this rate , and there is no reason to suppose that the time will change appreciably any more than the length of our day will . The close approach to one of our days , the excess being only thirty-seven minutes , leads to the result that , on successive nights , Mars will , at the same hour , present nearly the same face to the earth . But , owing to the excess in question , it will always be a little farther behind on any one night than on the night before , so that , at the end of forty days , we shall have seen every part of the planet that is presented to the earth . All that was known of Mars up to a quite recent period could be embodied in a map of the planet , showing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that a white cap would be generally seen to surround each of its poles . When a pole was inclined toward us , and therefore toward the sun , this cap gradually grew smaller , enlarging again when the pole was turned from // the sun . In the latter case it would be invisible from the earth , so that , t h e growth would be recognised only by its larger size when it again came into sight . These caps were naturally supposed to be snow and ice which formed around the poles during the Martian winter , and partly , , or wholly melted away during the summer . The Canals of Mars In 1877 commenced Schiaparelli 's celebrated observations on the surface of Mars , and his announcement of the so-called canals . The latter consisted of streaks passing from point to point on the planet , and slightly darker than the general surface . Seldom has more misapprehension been caused by a mistranslation than in the present case . Schiaparelli called these streaks canale , an Italian word meaning channels . He called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regions of the surface were oceans , and the streams connecting the oceans were therefore supposed to be water , and so were called channels . But the translation " canals " led to a widespread notion that these streaks were the works of inhabitants , as canals on the earth are the works of men . Up to the present time there is some disagreement between observers and astronomical authorities on the subject of these channels . This arises from the fact that they are not well-defined features on an otherwise uniform surface . Everywhere on the planet are found variations of shade ? light and dark patches , so faint and ill defined that it is generally difficult to assign exact 182 PLANETS AND TIIEIlt form and outline to them , running into each of her by insensible gradations . The extreme difficulty of necking them out id all , and the variety of aspects they present tinder different illuminations and in different stiles of our atmosphere , has resulted in a great variety of inconsistent , delineations of these objects . At one extreme we have the drawings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Flagstaff , Ariz . These show the channels as fine dark lines , so numerous as to form a network covering the greater part of the surface of the planet . In Schiaparelli 's map they are rather broad faint bands , not nearly so well defined as in Lowell 's drawings . Lowell 's channels are much more numerous than those seen by Schiaparelli . We might therefore suppose that all marked by the latter could be identified on Lowell 's map . But such is far from being the case ; there is only a general resemblance between the features seen at the two stations . One of the most curious features of Lowell 's drawings is that the points where the channels cross each other are marked by dark round spots like circular lakes . No such spots as these are shown on Schiaparelli 's map . One of the best marked features of Mars is a large , dark , nearly circular spot , surrounded by white , which is called Lacus Solis , or the Lake of the Sun . All observers agree on this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faint streaks or channels extending front this lake . But when we go farther we find that the do not agree as to the number of these channels , nor is there an exact agreement as to the surrounding THE CANALS OF MARS 18g features . It will be interesting to study two drawings of this region made at the Lick Observatory , probably under the best possible conditions , by Campbell and Hussey , respectively . It is not likely that any observatory is more favoured by its atmosphere for observations on this planet than the Lick on Mount Hamilton . Its telescope is the largest and finest in the world that has ever been especially directed to Mars , and Barnard is one of the most cautious observers . It is therefore very noteworthy that on the face of Mars , as presented to Barnard in the Lick telescope , the features do not quite correspond to the channels of Schiaparelli and Lowell . When the air was exceptionally steady he could see a vast number of minute and- very faint markings , which were not visible in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1'I.ANE'I'ti AND THEIR SATELLITES were so intricate that it was impossible to represent them on a drawing . They were not confined to the brighter regions of the planet , or the supposed continents , but were found to be more numerous on the so-called seas . They showed no such regularity that they could be considered as channels running from one region to another . The eye could indeed trace darker streaks here and there , and sonic of these corresponded to the supposed channels , but they were far more irregular than the features on Schiaparelli 's and Lowell 's maps . The matter was explained by Cerulli , a careful and industrious Italian observer , in a way which seems very plausible . He found that after he had been studying Mars for two years he was able , by looking at the moon through an opera glass , to see , or fancy he saw , lines and markings upon its surface similar to those of Mars . This phenomenon is not to be regarded as a pure illusion on the one hand , or an exact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the spontaneous action of the eye in shaping slight and irregular combinations of light and shade , too minute to be separately made out , into regular forms . Probable Nature of the Channels The probable facts of the case may be summed up as follows : 1 . The surface of Mars is extremely variegated by regions differing in shade , and having no very distinct outlines . 2 . There are numerous dark streaks , generally someTHE ATMOSPHERE OF MARS 18S what indefinite in outline , extending through considerable distances across the planet . 3 . In many cases the ( lark portions appear as if chained together to a greater or less extent , and thus give rise to the appearance of long dark channels . The appearance on which this third phenomenon , which we may regard as identical with that observed by , Cerulli , is based , may be well illustrated by looking , with a magnifying glass , at , a stippled portrait engraved on steel . Nothing will then be seen hut dots , arranged in various lines and curves . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clots into a well-defined collection of features representing the outlines of the human face . As the eye makes an assemblage of dots into a face , so - nay it make the minute markings on the planet Mars into the form of long , unbroken channels . The features which we have hitherto described do not belong to the two polar regions of the planet . Even when the snowcaps have melted away , these regions are seen so obliquely that it would be difficult to trace any welldefined features upon them . The interesting question is whether the caps which cover them are really snow which falls during the Martian winter and melts again when the sun once more shines on the polar regions . To throw light on this question we have to consider some recent results as to the atmosphere of the planet . The Atmosphere of Mart All recent observers are agreed that , if Mars has any atmosphere at all , it is much rarer than our own , and                 @ @ @ @
