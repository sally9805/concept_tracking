txt A proposition has been laid before Secretary Root for the establishment of a transport line from New York to Manila by way of the Suez Canal . The Secretary now has the matter under consideration , and will probalely decide upon it shortly . The plan is , not to supersede the Pacific transport line , but to , have two lines , and the chief argument in its favor is that of economy . It now costs about $65 to get a soldier from New York to Manila , and the transport line saves the Government about $300 , - 000 on each round trip . From New York to San Francisco it costs about $35 , if the War Department arranges things so as to take advantage of the " colony rate . " From San Francisco to Manila it costs about $30 , whereas the private citizen who wants to go from San Francisco to Manila can not do it under $155 , without reckoning the expenses of an enforced stay at Hongkong of several days . A soldier could be taken from San @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The proponents of the Suez Canal plan believe that the expense could be still further reduced by running an eastern transport line . The cost of taking a soldier from New York to Manila by transport through the Suez Canal is only about $26 . At first sight this appears a conclusive argument in favor of the Atlantic plan , but other things enter in . The cost is $26 only if the transport can bring a soldier back in place of the one she takes across ; if she comes back empty the cost will be $52 , for it costs just as much to bring the ship back as it does to send her out . But even $52 a man would be cheaper that the present Pacific route . It is , however , maintained by opponents of the plan that there are incidental expenses which might bring the ' total cost much higher , for example , the cost of maintaining transportation facilities in New York . It is quite impossible to do away with the Pacific transport line , and that it has not been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be established , it would not supersede the Pacific line . A compromise plan favored by some army officials is to run an Atlantic line as an adjunct to the Pacific line . Under this plan there would be no regular transport line with transports making trips at stated intervals . . A transport could , instead , run out from New York at irregular intervals whenever it was thought best to send one from there instead of from San Francisco . This would , in the opinion of these officers who favor it , make the saving in expense certain , for it would enable the Government to send out a transport only when troops were to return , or at other times when the expense could certainly be figured down to the minimum . If a regular line were run , just as the case at San Francisco . the Government would , they argue , be obliged to send out ships whether the expense was $52 or $26 a soldier . The trouble with this compromise plan is that it will not be acceptable to those citizens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on account of its convenience and other advantages . The irregularity of an adjunct line would destroy all its attractiveness to them .
