txt Making Men Out of the Boys . I am much interested in your account of Mr. Jeffery 's " Separate home for his children , " especially as I own a great deal of land at Berkeley Heights . Accordingly , I happen to know that not only are the six boys much interested in their independent home , but they are helping to build it . The " little red school house " gets credit for the education that made so many strong men . As a matter of fact , most of that education was got in spite of the " little red school house . " The boys of two generations ago were brought up on the farm , where , in those days , carpentering , repairing , manufacture of many household implements , and of nearly all the household food were conducted . This was before the days of canned vegetables and breakfast foods and self-raising flours , and the boys necessarily got a manual training which was their real education giving them a resourcefulness and adaptability that can be got in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Berkeley Heights , it is this condition that Mr. Jeffery is anxious to restore by putting the boys on their own resources while under his eye . Your kind reference to my efforts is marred by your reference to my " Socialistic schemes . " I am not a Socialist , but one of the strongest of individualists . Every one who knows me knows that I am a Single Taxer.
