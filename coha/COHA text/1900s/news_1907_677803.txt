txt From official railway returns which have just been issued it appears that railway capital was increased last year by only . f.2,500,000. ( $12,250,000 . ) This is the smallest sum recorded since the construction or railways began in this country . This London telegram happens to be published concurrently with reports of American railways stating their individual expenditures , respectively , to hae been larger than for the aggregate of all the railways of England , although their combined capitalization is ? 1,286 , 000,000 . The contrast is striking , and even portentous , if it can be supposed that like causes will have like results , for in England , as well as in the United States , it is timidity of capital as well as scarcity of capital which is checking construction of public utilities in such a surprising manner . The labor question is assigned as one of the chief causes producing this result in England . While this is prominent among cautionary factors here , the deterrent effect of legislation adds its share . The just published report of the Southern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increased over three millions of dollars , which certainly would seem to indicate a high degree of prosperity , not only for the railway , but for the entire territory served by it . But operating expenses and taxes increased almost five millions , leaving the company with almost two millions of decrease In net earnings . Of a total income of fifty-six millions , only $1,500,000 was saved for dividends , and there remained a surplus of a quarter of a million . This is not a satisfactory margin upon a business of such proportions , yet the company placed $32,000,000 of new capital ahead of its old shares . Judged by the British standard , at least It must be said that the company made every effort which could have been expected to meet its duty to the community whose welfare is dependent upon its services . It can not be said , however , that the community showed any disposition to allow the company to share the prosperity which it promoted . The report of the company is signed by Mr. FINLEY , who succeeded Mr. SPENCER both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the extremists in the anti-railway campaign . This Is especially manifest in the company 's putting into effect the legislation which it might have ignored after decisions in the lower courts . Mr. FINLET 's reason for contesting the legislation is that it is essential , in the interests of the public , that the railroads shall not be deprived of the means of providing the facilities which the public demands by losing the protection which the Constitution extends to all property . That this is no imaginary reason appears from the fact that S60 new industrial plants were established along the company 's lines during the past year . To some the problem how to supply fresh capital seems to be the concern of the railways . To others it seems as though these thousand new industries are concerned equally with the railway , not to mention the other thousands of similar undertakings whose birth will be promoted or retarded by the policy adopted toward railway enterprises . They are eager to do their share upon a scale for which the world can show no parallel , but their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
