txt Punching Commuters ' Tickets . In a recent issue Edwin A. Burorder suggests relief from the crushing at the Barclay Street Ferryhouse in various changes in construction of the building . This might help , but first how much improvement might be made if the company would only abandon that obsolete , annoying , and useless punching of commuters ' tickets at the entrance gates , as the other roads have done long ago ? Incidentally the punching of these tickets on the trains is only a delay to the conductor , a bother to the passenger , and of absolutely no value to the railroad company . I doubt if one commuter in a thousand uses up in a month all the rides he is allowed on his ticket , and if the company thinks by punching it is preventing fraudulent riding on that ticket , it has another guess coming .
