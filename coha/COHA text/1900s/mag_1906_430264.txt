 | IT is the wonder of wonders ! " exclaimed Sir William Thomson ( now Lord Kelvin ) after he had tested the first telephone ? t h e first one ever shown to the public ? at the Centennial Exhibition , held in Philadelphia in 1876 . The instrument which astounded the famous British electrician was , indeed , then a startling novelty . To scientists it was a bewilderment ; to ignorant people , an amazing toy . The excitement it created among physicists was not lessened by knowledge of the extreme simplicity of the instrument 's construction . Bell 's materials had been at the command of every electrical experimenter since Faraday 's time . Bell 's employment of them was the transforming touch of genius . To-day the term telephone suggests dynamos , storage batteries , switchboards , and other complex and costly apparatus . Looking at the original telephone , you would see only a small coil of wire and two short ebonite tubes , closely resembling the receivers used now . Considering how vital a factor is the telephone in to-day 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but thirty years have passed since Bell obtained his first patent . It is only a quarter of a century since his great invention began to revolutionize commercial modes of communication . Thousands of visitors to the Centennial Exhibition saw what was then called the " talking toy . " Few of them predicted its astonishing success . But there are many capitalists that regret their failure to invest in the Bell Company 's stock when it was first placed on the market . Still , it should be said that the telephone had not then proved itself indispensable in business , and it was unparalleled as a practical application of electricity ; hence only unusually keen foresight could have gauged the instrument 's possibilities . Bell himself says , " Even after our company was formed , not one of us fully realized the overwhelming importance of the invention . " Bell is still alive , very much alive , indeed , a vigorous , big-brained man , many-sided in his intellectual and social sympathies , a regent of the Smithsonian Institution , and an ex-president of the National Geographic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devoted considerable time and means to bettering the condition of the poor in his home city , Washington . Several years of his young manhood were given to the training of deaf-mutes , and he still keeps in touch with that unique educational work . Born in Edinburgh , Scotland , in 1847 , Bell studied at Edinburgh and London Universities . His father 's health failing , the family removed , in 1870 , to Canada and settled on a farm . In 1873 the future inventor of the telephone became Professor of Vocal Physiology in Boston University . At that time he was trying to perfect an apparatus intended to make language sounds visible to deaf and dumb persons . The Boston School Committee invited him to test @# iI If ... ; : i , I i 366 The Thirtieth Anniversary of a Great Invention  | the apparatus in the Horace Mann School for Deaf-Mutes . Success did not crown his efforts , but his failure was quickly forgotten in his new-born conviction that articulate speech could be conveyed electrically ? a conviction forced on him by some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two electro-magnets , connected by a wire , and two steel rods fastened to the poles of the magnets . These were the principal parts . It occurred to him that if membranes were drawn tightly across smallsized boxes , and the steel rods were arranged to beat against the membranes , in consonance with voice impulses , the result would be the reproduction at one membrane of the vocal sounds directed against the other membrane . But this theory could not be translated into steel and copper , and Bell turned his attention to multiplex telegraphy . The basement of his house in Boston was fitted up as a laboratory for experimental research . One day a wire , snapping in two , sent a sound through another wire which had attached to each end a thin sheet-iron disk a few inches in circumference . Could that sound be repeated ? Experiment gave an affirmative answer . Then arose the important query , " Could vocal sounds be transmitted thus ? " A parchment diaphragm , with a sheet-iron button in the centre was stretched across the mouth of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glimpse inside that metal tube would have shown us features not unknown in to-day 's perfected receiver ? two magnets with poles wound with wire and , between the magnets , a small strip of soft iron . A precisely similar instrument , with a wire running from its coils , was left in charge of Bell 's assistant , while Bell , with the wire connected with his-tubular iron-cased telephone , ascended to the attic of his house . The assistant , a bright young man , was directed to remain in the laboratory and to keep the receiver at his ear . Bell , holding the diaphragm a few inches from his lips , said in ordinary conversational tones , " Can you hear me ? " In a moment the assistant came bounding up the stairs . " Mr. Bell , " he excitedly called out , " I heard your question plainly ! " The telephone was horn ! It required a year 's hard work , however , to mould the invention into patentable form . Meanwhile the friends of the young inventor turned into Job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toy would never bring him a dollar . Let him stick to his work in multiplex telegraphy . Therein he would be sure to meet with success . Fortunately for the world Bell had inherited a goodly share of Scotch stubbornness and acumen , and he persevered in his endeavors to make electricity convey articulate speech . His reward reached him in the shape of his famous patent of March 7 , 1876 . Probably no other private document has ever caused so much litigation . The highest courts , however , sustained Bell 's claims ; and the owners of the patent were at last permitted to enjoy in peace the fruits of their property . @#  | On May 10 , 1876 , Bell read before the American Academy of Arts and Sciences a paper entitled " Researches in Telephony . " The facts he cited established his right to be known as the earliest investigator into the transmission of vocal language by undulatory currents of electricity . Envy and rancor have since attacked him viciously but vainly , and his claim to the invention of the telephone stands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by means of various devices , but Bell went further when he made an instrument which would actually reproduce spoken words . The name " magic lyre " was given in 1819 to an apparatus designed by Sir Charles Wheatstone , the scientist to whom English historians assign the honor of the invention of telegraphy . A number of connected wooden rods , jointed , were so arranged as to convey from the sounding-boards of musical instruments the music produced . When first shown to the scientific world , the rods extended from the sounding-board of a piano through a wall into an adjoining room . There the other ends were attached to a board shaped like a painter 's easel . When the piano was played the music was reproduced by the easel-like board in the other room . A stronger hint of the coming telephone was given in 1837 . In that year Prof. C. G. Page , of Salem , Mass. , discovered that if a bolt of soft iron be rapidly magnetized and demagnetized , it will emit a musical note . The relations between sound and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Farrar , De la Rive , and Matteucci . The Frenchman , Charles Bourseul , published , in 1854 , a monograph which , but for a fatal misconception , is , in the light of what we now know , strongly suggestive of the speaking telephone . In 186o Johann Philipp Reis , a school-teacher of Friedrichsdorf , Germany , constructed a sound-transmitting apparatus based on the discoveries of Page and Bourseul . Its appearance suggested a mu-@# sic-box ; but , nevertheless , it conveyed sounds to a distance of several hundred feet . The word " sounds " is used advisedly , because , according to the best evidence , Reis 's machine could not transmit spoken words . It operated by making and breaking a circuit . Electric impulses , thus created , can convey noises ? mere sounds ? hut not articulate speech . Such speech demands a continuously varying harmonic wave and can not be transmitted by the short separated wavelets produced by using a makeand-break current . @#  | In June , 1876 , Bell was engaged to be married to the daughter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time Mr. Hubbard was residing temporarily in Philadelphia , having been appointed one of the Massachusetts Commissioners to the Centennial Exhibition . Miss Hubbard and her mother decided to pay him a visit , and invited Bell to accompany them . He , however , felt obliged to remain in Boston , as he was then principal of a school there for deaf-mutes , and examination days were approaching . He had escorted the ladies to their train , and , standing near by , was waiting for it to steam out on its journey to Philadelphia . As the train started Miss Hubbard , overcome by disappointment , burst into tears . Without a moment 's hesitation Bell leaped back on to the train , though he was utterly unprovided for the trip . His trunks were forwarded to him in Philadelphia by his future brother-in-law , William Hubbard . That young gentleman , wise beyond his age , was an enthusiastic believer in the telephone and took care to put the latest model of it in a corner of the strongest trunk . By Mr. Gardiner Hubbard 's advice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electrical exhibits of the Centennial . It was toward the close of a fatiguing day when the judges reached the telephone . Their examination of it was hurried and perfunctory . One of them would not take the trouble of putting the receiver to his ear . Another judge dropped a disparaging remark as he took out his notebook . Bell 's heart sank . At that moment Dom Pedro , Emperor of Brazil , entered the room , followed by his suite . Himself a scientist of no mean ability , the Emperor had examined , with interest and admiration , the telephone in Bell 's school in Boston . He remembered the young inventor , shook hands with him , and requested another trial of the instrument . Bell went to the other end of the wire and spoke into the transmitter Hamlet 's famous soliloquy . Dom Pedro 's commendation changed the minds of the judges . The " toy " was allowed to go on exhibition . Doubtless it would amuse visitors . That it was of no practical value was , after all , only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were mistaken , although they were duly appointed officials and wore badges . The telephone turned out to be the Centennial 's star exhibit , eliciting unmeasured praise from distinguished scientists and , indeed , from all other visitors capable of understanding the theory of its operation . What was the basic principle of the telephone of 1876 ? The principle underlying the construction of the 1966 telephone ? that electrical currents undulating in correspondence with the air motions produced by uttering the original sounds will transmit articulate speech . The word " speech " in this statement should be emphasized . Apparatus that will convey many sounds to a distance , and convey them clearly , will turn spoken words into a jumble of mere noises . Why ? Because such apparatus does not convey the timbre of the human voice . All sounds are produced by vibrations of the air . By a simple sound the gaseous particles of the atmosphere are regularly condensed and expanded . The rate of the vibrations constitutes the pitch of the sound . The faster the rate of vibration , the higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All sound is transmitted in waves , but sound waves take various forms . The increase or decrease in loudness of a sound will vary the amplitude of the wave , but the rate of the wave 's vibrations will remain unchanged . Timbre , or quality of tone , is produced in a far different way . This peculiar feature of all sounds is caused by thousands of tiny wavelets of air ? in other words , timbre adds minute extra vibrations to the main vibration . These numberless additional small vibrations , called overtones , give the human voice its articulation and quality . Timbre makes one voice agreeable ; while a different timbre may make another voice so rasping as to suggest the value of a file to smooth down the roughness . The pitch and loudness of a musical note may be precisely the same on a piano as on a violin . Each instrument , however , has a different timbre , and that quality enables the ear to tell from which instrument a note comes . You recognize a voice by its timbre and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rather , the sounds composing words , are produced by the vibrations of vocal chords . The tension of these chords , and the form of the mouth , as well as the size of the larynx , decide the timbre of the voice uttering the words . The larynx in Adelina Patti 's throat was a quarter of an inch larger than the larynx in your throat . Hence she received $4,000 an evening during several farewell tours . Timbre is , therefore , the most striking characteristic of the human voice . Clearness in speaking through a telephone , for example , depends more on timbre than on loudness or pitch . A whisper of an ideal voice , uttered into a White transmitter , can be heard through a bipolar receiver miles away . Telephony 's peculiar problem was to find means of sending electrical waves identical in form with the waves of vocal sound . As , however , the overtones in ordinary conversation are numerous enough to cause thousands of extra vibrations a second , it is plain that the waves of language sounds must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not reproduced , then the overtones can not be heard , and only noises will echo through the receiver . Ignorance of this fact explains the failure of all telephonic experiments prior to Bell 's memorable discovery of the need of undulatory currents of electricity to transmit articulate speech . Reis might have seen his error had he not , for some inexplicable reason , omitted to equip his instrument with a receiver . The fifth clause of Bell 's patent runs thus : " The method of and apparatus for transmitting vocal sounds telegraphically , as herein described , by causing electric undulations , similar in form to the vibrations of the air accompanying the said vocal or other sounds substantially as set forth . " The " apparatus for transmitting vocal sounds telegraphically " ? that is , by electric currents passing along wires ? Bell found need not be elaborate . Indeed , the extraordinary simplicity of his first telephone was , as has been said , perhaps its most amazing feature . Never before in the history of the world 's remarkable inventions have such great results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table a common straight-bar magnet with a small wire coil around one pole . Toward this pole move a piece of soft iron . When the iron is near enough an induced electric current will pass through the wire . Enclose this magnet in an ebonite tube . tele-lying ne-orre-luced ismit 1 " in Ap-stoa lturn oises. s not awns gase- , u1artte of of the ation , pends ind is s take ase in litude e 's vi-mbre , it difof all wave-adds vibra-small uman imbre differ-rasp-nooth loudly the ch in-mbre , I from u recby its posing ans of ! lords , as the of the Across the mouth of the tube fasten a sheetiron diaphragm one hundredth of an inch thick . Run a wire from the coil to the coil of a precisely similar instrument . You now have a telephone like , in essentials , the one which Bell exhibited at the Philadelphia Centennial . Spoken words , voice impulses , vibrate the diaphragm in front of the magnet 's wire-wound pole and thereby cause undulatory currents in the coil . These , passing along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the receiver diaphragm correspondingly . Thus the vocal sounds , the words , spoken into the transmitter are reproduced by the receiver . In 1877 the telephone appeared as a public utility . At first its progress was slow . Experience soon demonstrated that , while the receiver operated by the magneto-transmitter reproduced words clearly , it was not efficient enough for business needs . But it had been proved that electric currents could be utilized to convey articulate speech , and , when the need of more powerful transmitters and receivers became apparent , the Bell Company turned to battery power . Edison , the wizard of the electrical world , was first in the field , and his carbon transmitter was the only one used for some time . He utilized the discovery of the French physicist , Count du Moncel , that , when two ends of a severed circuit are brought into contact , the resistance of the contact is variable with and proportionate to the pressure between them . This battery transmitter permitted the current to be varied by the resistance changes in the transmitter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a long stride in advance in telephony . Edison and Berliner , practically at the same time , made a contribution of still greater value , however , when it occurred separately to them to combine the induction coil with the transmitter . The true nature of the carbon transmitter 's mode of operation was made known in 1878 by Professor Hughes , of London . His " microphone " proved that , to obtain the best results with resistance changes , due to changes in pressure , it is necessary to have a light contact . Since then all transmitters have been constructed on the light-contact plan . In 1877 the first long-distance line was built . It connected Boston and Salem and  | was sixteen miles long . In these days , when lines run from Portland , Me. , to Omaha , Neb. ? cities 1,700 miles apart ? it sounds like cheap sarcasm to style sixteen miles of wire a long-distance line . Yet the BostonSalem telephone line was so denominated in sober earnest ? in 1877 . It is interesting to learn that it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two years passed away before a longer line was demanded by increasing use of the telephone , Boston and Lowell being brought into communication with each other then . In the light of to-day 's marvellous telephonic achievements , the following excerpt from the Bell Company 's first prospectus reads like a jest : " The proprietors of the Bell patents are now prepared to furnish telephones for the transmission of articulate speech between instruments not more than twenty miles apart . " Twenty miles ? Verily , the days of small things have passed ! The proprietors of the same patents are now prepared to furnish telephones for the transmission of articulate speech half-way across the continent . We should remember , however , that telephony was a new art when our republic was only a hundred and one years old . The United States was a year older before the first telephone exchange was started . " Hello , Central ! " was first heard in 1878 . To-day the exchanges are numbered by the thousand , the telephones by the million . Various industries , unknown thirty years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of workers , depend entirely on the telephone for support . Numerous factories making lead sheathing , dynamos , motors , generators , batteries , office equipments , cables , and many other appliances , would have to close down and thus throw their operatives into idleness and misery if the telephone bell should cease to ring . The Bell Companies employ over 87,000 persons and , it may be added , pay them well . Many of these employees have families to maintain ; others support their parents , or aid younger brothers and sisters . It is safe to say that 200,000 people look to the telephone for their daily bread . These figures may be supplemented by the number of telephones in use , ( 5,698,000 ) , by the number of miles of wire ( 6,043,000 ) , in the Bell lines , and by the number of conversations ( 4479,500,000 ) , electrically conveyed in 1905 . The network of wire connects more than 33,000 cities , towns , villages , and hamlets . Such tremendous growth as these statistics show would imply not only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggest improved instruments , more skilled operators , and better service . There would be no flattery in such suggestion . Electrical science has undergone radical reformation since 1876 . Telephony has raised the utilization of electricity to the height of a profession . Of course such advances have not been won without cost . Fortunes were spent in experiment and investigation before a dollar came back . Communication by the first telephone was limited to a few thousand feet . Now , conversation can be carried on by persons ' , boo miles apart . To-morrow long-distance lines will span the continent ; and the day after oceanic telephony will be a commonplace of mercantile routine . But science and money had to collaborate for years before they could work the miracle of enabling Boston and Omaha to talk together . In the early eighties the limit of long-distance talking was about one hundred miles . Pacific coast enterprise , spurred by imperative need , had constructed a line longer than any one in the East . A line between Boston and New York , built in 1884 for experimental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A little earlier the New York-Albany-Buffalo circuit , four hundred miles in length , had been established . For some time it was the longest one east of the Rocky Mountains . Then the lines began to extend until engineering skill made direct communication between New York and Chicago a reality . A line between the two cities was completed only after innumerable obstacles had been overcome . On October 18 , 1892 , Bell , having been called ( by telephone ) from his Washington home , sent the first message from New York to Chicago . The wonder of such a feat is concealed by its familiarity now . A man , seated at ease in his New York office , carries on a conversation with a friend in Chicago , nearly a thousand miles away ! What greater marvel is recorded in " The Arabian Nights " ? The New York-Chicago line was not declared ready for business till 1893 , the year of the Chicago World 's Fair . Sev-@#  | enteen years before , at the Centennial , the telephone seemed to most people to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had become an indispensable public utility . The believers in the telephone might well have felt proud of their faith . In their case Wisdom was most certainly justified of her children . In 1905 there were sent by telephone in the United States forty-one times more messages than were sent by telegraph , although the latter mode of communication antedates the former by nearly forty years . To pass so swift a rival as the telegraph , however , the telephone had to prove its superior merit by trial . When there was but one way of conveying information quickly ? telegraphy ? business was its slave . But the greater speed , accuracy , and directness of telephony appealed irresistibly to the American mind . In Europe only ten times more communications go by telephone than by telegraph . To the European merchant the telephone is a convenience ; to the American , it is a necessity . Its wires are the motor nerves of our intenser commercial life . Not only has the instrument adapted itself to our needs , but our world 's vast round of daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Business men preassume the telephone 's existence just as they preassume regular mail deliveries or the fulfilment of written contracts . Twenty years ago the city telephone systems having each over 25,000 subscribers could be counted on the fingers of one hand . To day that number would not be accounted large even in a city of the third class . New York had , on July 1 , 1905 , nearly 170,000 listed patrons of the telephone . Yet any two of that large number can , in five seconds , be placed in communication with each other , so well has engineering science kept pace with public needs . No dream of old romance is stranger than this prosaic fact of the twentieth century . Nature had , however , to be paid her price . Her secrets are never to be obtained free . Difficulties pronounced insuperable by high authorities in the theory of electricity are now but milestones in the path of progress cut by skilled electricians . These unknown , unassuming workers turned the hopes of one day into the accomplished facts of the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the apparatus to be improved was bearing the burden of constantly growing service . Up to December 31 , 1905 , the United States Patent Office had issued 7,154 patents relating to the telephone and telephone apparatus . Of these over eight hundred were for transmitters and about five hundred for receivers . The essential parts of today 's receiver consist of magnet , air-chamber , diaphragm , ear-piece , and case . The air-chamber is introduced to give increased distinctness to sounds , or , if you prefer the phrase , to the words reproduced by the diaphragm . You have noticed the difference in tonal quality between a sermon preached in church , in August , to an audience made up of yourself and the sexton , and a sermon from the same source , delivered in the same church , on the Sunday preceding Christmas . Perhaps you thought that the difference in tones could be explained by referring to the contribution plate . Acoustics , however , insists that an empty church is a large resonator and , therefore , strengthens the voice . Early receivers had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at present . Distortion of vocal sounds resulted . Speak into an empty dry-goods case and note the distortion of tone . At first the diaphragms of transmitters and receivers were made of parchment . A thin disk of iron occupied the central portion of each diaphragm . Experiment showed that much better results could be obtained by making the diaphragm of soft iron . The diameter is about two inches , and the metal is one hundredth of an inch thick . Thinner iron would render the reproduced words unpleasantly shrill , while , if diaphragms were made thicker , they would absorb some of the overtones , and would thereby render conversation indistinct . With the increase in power furnished by batteries , there arose an imperative public demand for longer-distance talking . Edison 's transmitter was not sensitive enough . The Blake transmitter came into use . It was made on the light-contact principle , illustrated by Professor Hughes 's microphone . The Blake instrument shows great sensitiveness when employed for short circuits . It , however , gets out of order easily and becomes useless when high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , experienced mechanicians , strove  | to win the fortune awaiting the inventor of a more efficient transmitter . It was reserved for a man that had never spent a day in the telephone business , a minister , to wrest away the prize . The Rev. Henry Hunnings produced the transmitter which is known by his name . Its distinctive feature was the use of granulated carbon . This instrument gave clear talking on long-distance lines and could stand high battery power . Practical use , however , developed in the Hunnings invention a singular defect . The carbon granules would " pack " ? that is , would cohere , forming a solid mass , which blocked the passage of sound . Experts advanced various theories in explanation , but none seemed quite satisfactory . Finally the Bell Company instituted a thorough investigation into the causes of packing in the various granular-carbon transmitters then in the market . It was conclusively proved that the carbon grains packed or massed together because the transmitter became heated by the electric current . More space for them remedied that defect . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took the place of the Hunnings and the various other carbon-granulated transmitters . In the White the packing has been avoided by inserting a mica disk , the carbon grains occupying but a part of the space between the electrodes . As the granules of carbon are of so much importance , great care is taken to make them as hard as possible . In fact , they might easily be mistaken for particles of black glass or flint . The preparation of this granulated carbon is one of the numerous industries dependent on the telephone for their existence . One of the earliest signals adopted was a bell attached to a spring . Later on , when private batteries were installed at subscribers ' stations , buzzer bells were introduced . When you called " Central " in those days , you turned a crank three or four times . A danger that telephone engineers have always had to combat is attenuation of the electric current . Few people realize how very slight are the electric streams which carry so many million messages a day . The energy required to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five million times as great as the energy needed to send a message from New York to Chicago . Electric power enough to lift a weight of one ounce one foot high could operate a telephone for fifteen thousand years . Remarkably sensitive as are our present transmitters and receivers , it is plain that they can not afford to lose much of a current so small . Resistance , leakage , defective insulation ? these are some of the causes of attenuation . Any diminution of the current means diminished loudness , a serious defect , for we all like to hear without straining our auditory nerves . Were attenuation unknown , there would be , theoretically , no limit to telephoning . Washington and Manila could talk together then as readily as Washington and Baltimore talk together now . Heavier wires were found useful in checking attenuation . When it became commercially impossible to increase further the size of the wires , science was asked to supply other safeguards . An English electrician named Heaviside , and Vaschy , a French physicist , appear to have been the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to arrest attenuation . Some years after the appearance of their monographs Prof. Silvanus Thompson read before the International Electrical Congress , held in Paris , in 1893 , a paper in which he advocated , as an attenuation remedy , the use of inductance shunts across the circuit . Final proofs of the value of inductance were presented by Professor Pupin , of Columbia University . He demonstrated , both mathematically and mechanically , that inductances distributed at certain intervals along a telephone wire would strengthen the current greatly . The means used are simple enough . Slight coils of wire , ten inches in diameter , are fastened , four miles apart , to the line . These coils receive the electric current and send it on undiminished . Thus we are enabled to telephone to points that could not be reached directly before the Pupin coils were known . These also make talking much more loud and distinct , and allow the employment of longer cables . To the unscientific mind it seems absurd to assert that a series of wire rings should treble the carrying capacity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coils , do re-enforce lines to that extent , and as much as a tenfold increase has been obtained in Germany on underground cables . The talking over @#  | thirty miles of loaded cable is as clear as it is over ten miles of unloaded . Although loaded aerial lines do not exhibit results so favorable , yet at the terminus of 1,400 miles of wire equipped with Pupin induction coils , conversation is heard just as distinctly as it is heard at the end of an unloaded wire seven hundred miles long . During business hours in New York City sixty miles of loaded cable furnish service superior to the service rendered by unloaded wires only one-sixth of that length . These wonder-working coils are made of copper wire having an iron core . Perhaps the help they give in long-distance telephony can be fully appreciated only by experts in line working . For example , thirtymile cables , unloaded , to be used in connection with long-distance aerial lines , could not be installed , except at a prohibitive cost . Cables of that length , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pupin coils . These coils represent , in material form , the most striking advance in telephony since batteries were substituted for magnets as sources of energy . Professor Pupin 's patents were acquired in 1901 by the American Telegraph and Telephone Company , which thereby secured control of the sole means of rendering long-distance telephoning commercially practicable in this country . Twenty years ago interference , or induction , was the telephone engineer 's worst enemy . Interference arises from the action of foreign currents . These may pass from the wires of trolley-car systems , or from electric-light wires , or from telegraph wires , or , of course , from other telephone wires . To avoid this evil of induction , both sides of a circuit must be kept equal in capacity , insulation , and resisting power . Professor Bell was the first to prove that if the two wires of a circuit be wound about each other induction ( interference ) can not occur . Outside currents , passing into the twisted wires , are neutralized . Hence interference , or cross-talking , is then impossible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everywhere . With parallel circuits , not wound together , crosstalking can not be prevented , if the wires are carried on the same supports . In Europe the twist system is used . In America transposing of the wires is preferred . Each wire changes its position regularly at each pole in the twisted circuits . The transposition method shifts the circuits at different intervals , the number of the transpositions being decided by the line 's length . Iron wire was employed for early telephone lines . Its disadvantages soon became apparent . Its conductivity is low ? that is , a given electric current through it requires a larger electric pressure than through wire made of certain other metals , silver and copper , for examples . Iron wire has therefore fallen into almost total disuse . Copper wire was commercially possible , but it was too soft . When drawn taut between poles it snapped . Strung loosely enough to nullify danger of breaking it sagged down so wearily as to suggest chronic invalidism , and then it also invited attack from small boys and junk thieves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new art of telephony . Hereupon the truth of the law of supply and demand was vindicated by Thomas B. Doolittle 's invention of harddrawn copper wire . By his process of manufacture copper loses none of its conductive power and is rendered strong enough to bear nearly as much strain as iron wire of the same diameter . This toughened copper wire makes an ideal conductor for telephone purposes . Indeed , long-distance circuits might still be unknown if Doolittle , who as an agent of the Bell Company , established a telephone exchange at Bridgeport , Conn. , had not turned his attention to the problem of hardening copper wire . The first telephone poles were absurdly high . A pole , eighty feet in height , with six cross-arms , represented perfection in its class in 1877 . Of course , such supports promptly threw themselves and their burdens down when attacked by a full-grown storm . Nowadays telephone poles range from thirty feet to thirty-five feet in height . They are set usually 132 feet apart , forty poles to the mile . Chestnut , cedar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ About a million poles a year are used by the Bell Companies . Telephone poles are carefully selected , as the weight they bear is likely to grow heavier . We have seen that , in order to check attenuation of the current , telephone engineers have been compelled to increase the size of the wire used . Aerial lines often employ wire weighing 435 pounds to the mile ,  | or 870 pounds for each circuit . Hence the man who talks by telephone from Boston to Chicago , a distance of about a thousand miles , has the exclusive use of over four hundred tons of copper . In Europe , the practice is to use somewhat lighter wire . Thus the line between London and Glasgow contains eight hundred pounds of copper per circuit for every mile it passes over . In the United States there is a decided tendencv to employ heavier wire in all new lines . In a line now being run through some of the Western States the two wires in each circuit weigh a thousand pounds per mile . This line will , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telephone purposes . In the construction of aerial lines experience had to be bought , but its lessons were well conned , and for many years past such lines have been so carefully and thoroughly built that breakdowns seldom occur . As far back as 1888 the care and honesty of telephone-line building was shown in the most stril-:ng manner . The terrible blizzard of that year prostrated miles of the telegraph line between New York and Boston . But not an inch of telephone wire gave way . A telegraphic despatch between the two cities had to go via Atlantic cable to Ireland and be forwarded from there to its address on this side of the ocean . Telephonic communication continued without interruption . It is not unusual for a central exchange to control 25,000 wires . These enter the building in cables . Clearly no roof could support a superstructure bearing so great a weight of copper . With the expansion of telephony , underground cables became necessary . The first ones were insulated by a rubber covering . That was soon discarded as useless . Then wires were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled with oil . The oil leaked out . Later cotton-covered wires were placed in lead pipes into which melted paraffine , heavily charged with globules of carbonic-acid gas , was forced . The first true cable ? one composed of twisting wires ? was thus formed . It contained fifty pairs of wires , laid in a pipe two inches in diameter Accident exposed the weakness of this mode of insulation . Some underground steam-supply pipes next to a cable beneath a New York street let steam enough escape to melt the paraffine . The cable went out of business . After that accident ? it happened in 1887  - -  dry- core cables were tried . Wires were covered with paper , the air between paper and wire acting as an insulator , and were sheathed with lead . The experiment was a complete success . More cables being then demanded , the manufacturers began to turn out better ones . In the early nineties two-hundred-pair cables , two and onehalf inches in diameter , appeared in the market . By that time the electrostatic capacity of the conductor had been lowered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first cable , the rubber-covered one , had to work under the heavy burden of thirtythree hundredths of a microfarad . As , to-day , twelve hundred wires may be placed in a cable only two and onehalf inches in diameter , it is plain that the cable manufacturers are entitled to no small share of credit for the perfection of telephony in this year of 1906 , the thirtieth one since the art came into being . Had they not been able to make twenty wires work where only one worked before , it is evident that telephone service could never have been brought down to its present low rate . One of the early forms of conduit would look pathetically funny to-day . It was simply a series of wooden troughs , half filled with pitch in which a cable was buried . Of course , the pitch soon solidified , the cable could not be reached to make needed repairs , and the conduit was emphatically voted a failure . Then followed experiments with various other conduits , some made of creosoted wood , others of earthenware pipes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usage seems to have settled on terra-cotta or earthenware as the best material for underground-wire conduits . Great care is needed in joining underground wires , for each and every pair of the hundreds of wires in a cable must be joined in right order . The telephone-wire plumber must attend strictly to business , unlike his more fortunate fellow-craftsman of the comic papers . Telephony , in its infant days , imitated telegraphy 's practice of using overhead iron wires , with earth returns and single-line conductors . Such wiring could not , of course , prove satisfactory when the new art started on its swift race to its vast proportions of to-day . Part-metallic circuits marked a  | decided advance . Lastly came the underground cable and the wholly metallic circuit ( no earth returns ) . Naturally , in thinly populated districts , where conduits would be too expensive , aerial cables are still used . Distribution of wires to subscribers is accomplished by employing ring supports or by open wiring . Before any attempt could be made to introduce the telephone as a public utility , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engineers remodelled for telephonic use the existing telegraph switchboard . By means of the new apparatus any two wires out of a group could be connected , and the subscribers could then talk together . Of course , the unexpected happened . Defects appeared . Telephony is much more complex than telegraphy . Various improvements had to be made . As early as 1878 , however , the " exchange " ( the switchboard ) worked fairly well . But its power of accommodation was very limited , and to operate the board 's connecting mechanism entailed much labor . Signalling was especially troublesome . A New York concern , the Law Telegraphy Company , had in use a calling system employing two wires ? one for transmitting orders from the subscribers to the operator , and the other , leading from the subscribers ' station to the switchboard , for connection with the wires of other subscribers . This system was tried by some of the Bell Companies and was found wanting . Then electric indicators and magnetic generators were adopted for signalling . The early switchboard connected subscribers ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grounded the wires ; but , by inserting a metal plug , the operator cut off the ground connection and completed the circuit for the subscribers to converse together . In many cases two operators were necessary to answer each call , as it was not possible to connect any two lines by a single operation , and two or more switchboards had to be used . An operator at one switchboard , receiving a call , would notify another operator at another switchboard where the line of the call number ended . This transference of calls required two or three seconds , but seconds may be precious to the telephone user . The Bell Company urged its engineers to improve the method of calling . The result was the advent of the wonder-working multiple switchboard . It provides a connecting point , known as a jack , for every line before each operator . Hence any two lines may now be connected by one operation . A multiple switchboard is made up of sections , each one being , as the name of the apparatus suggests , a duplicate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York City switchboard controlling five thousand wires was the largest in the United States . Now there are numerous switchboards accommodating , each , ten thousand lines . New York 's latest switchboard cost over $300 , - 000 . It comprises nearly two million parts and four thousand miles of wire and has about fifteen thousand electric signal-lamps . Of course , all switchboards nowadays presuppose metallic circuits , as these have been shown by experience to be necessary , if leakage or induction is to be prevented . Those evils often interrupted communication in the days of single-wire circuits connected with the earth . Batteries at subscribers ' stations steadily became more burdensome . They needed repairs often ; they cost too much for inspection ; the expense of changing them was heavy , and they frequently failed to work . It was long ago perceived that a central exchange battery would form the best source of power for the operation of all the exchange 's lines . To make all signals automatic was another desideratum . Capital and skill finally evolved the wonderful apparatus of to-day . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a central exchange building , operates all the telephones and signals used in the exchange 's district . This improved method was first tried by the Bell Company in 1894 . Experience perfected the various parts of the apparatus , and each distinct part is now standardized and is manufactured in large quantities . To-day , instead of working a crank to get " Central 's " attention , you simply put the receiver to your ear . Lifting the receiver off the hook lights a tiny electric lamp in the exchange . The light goes out when the switchboard operator thrusts into your line 's answering jack a metal plug , the tip of the answering cord , one of a pair of thread-covered wire cords associated with your line . The calling cord 's tip , plugged into the multiple jack of the number you give to " Cen- tral , " lights another small lamp , termed a supervisory lamp . Pressing a key rings the bell of the given number ? that is , of the subscriber with whom you desire to talk . When he takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hence there is no lamp alight while the conversation is in progress . The return of your receiver to its hook lights your supervisory lamp . When the other subscriber hangs up his receiver , his supervisory lamp lights again . Both lamps aglow apprise the operator that the conversation is closed . She pulls the cords out of the jacks , thus extinguishing the amps and disconnecting the lines . Not a word of your conversation has been overheard , not a second of time has been wasted . What a change from the telephoning of pioneer days ? the days of Edison 's battery , crank ringing , helloing for " Central , " bad language , and the twenty-mile limit ! American hurry and nervousness have influenced the telephone 's line of advance . In the old days people would forget to ring off , and then " Central " had no means of determining when conversation was closed and the line was released , except by sending questions along the wires of the telephone users . Now , if , after you have put down your receiver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his little supervisory lamp tells that fact to " Central . " Comparison of the complicated and expensive apparatus in use now with the apparatus of twenty years ago would prove that telephone engineers have spared no pains to minimize the work required of the subscriber . Today he does absolutely nothing , unless lifting the receiver to his ear is accounted something . It is not assumed that machinery can take the place of human intelligence . Automatism has , however , been applied in all cases where it would save time and secure accuracy . For example , an operator receives a call for a certain number . Is the called line engaged ? Into its jack is thrust lightly , by way of query , the metal plug , or tip , of the proper calling cord . Click-click , is the response . The line wanted is busy . No words are needed . Other special signals are employed for various questions between different exchanges , and there are signals for operators in even the same txchange . Some future philosophic historian of the nineteenth century may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demand for a quick-communication medium , usable by all persons . Bell was merely the unconscious agent of the Power which guides progress . Certainly the telephone has within one generation achieved a bewildering success . The instrument has not only conquered all civilized countries , but it has also invaded lands that we , in our conceit , stigamatize as heathen , or barbarous , because their ideals are not ours . Perhaps it may excite no surprise to learn that " Central " ? under another name ? flourishes in various Japanese cities . The Japs have recently vindicated their claim to be classed among the world powers . There seems nothing strange in the information that the telephone is used in the great cities of China . Commerce has drawn many white merchants into those centres of trade . But not every American is aware that Bangkok , the populous capital of Siam , the Land of the White Elephant , maintains a busy exchange . In Burmah , Siam 's neighbor , you may telephone " from Rangoon to Mandalay . " Every large city in Hindustan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poorer Hindus are given to fashioning jewelry out of copper , but an unusually high voltage helps them to keep the eighth commandment . Omar Khayyam might have felt inspired to add a few optimistic quatrains to his Rubaiyat were he living in this century , for he could hear the telephone bell ringing in the despised bazaars of Ispahan , Persia 's largest city . Abyssinia has about two hundred miles of telephone wire already working , and will soon have eight hundred miles more . Life in that African kingdom must be a burden to the telephone company 's trouble force . Elephants treat the poles as scratching posts ? with results disastrous to both poles and wires . Monkeys regard the aerial cables as swings put up for the special benefit of monkeykind ; hence cable repairers in King Menelik 's realm seldom die of inaction . The telephone bell 's ring mingles with the roar of Victoria Falls , the African rival of Niagara ; for the Cape-toCairo Railroad has already crossed the Zambesi , and in the little depot , close to the great cataract , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hatred of Christian innovations could not bar out the telephone from Constantinople ; though it is interesting to note that no typewriters are @# @#  | allowed to enter Turkey . They would render letter-writing unidentifiable , the Sultan 's spies assert . Of Europe 's family of nations Germany has the most telephones , France comes second , and England third . But the ratio of telephone calls to the population is highest in Sweden . The United States , however , is pre-eminently the land of the " ' phone . " In Berlin there is one telephone to every seventeen families ; in Paris , one to every twenty-two families ; in London , one to every fiftyeight families . American figures show a much higher ratio of intelligence and business enterprise . New York has one telephone to every twelve families ; Boston , one to every six families ; San Francisco had , on January r , 1906 , one telephone to every four families . Since 188o the Bell Companies alone have increased their mileage of wire about five hundred per cent . Yet the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , increased at only one-tenth of that rate . The rural districts should not be left unnoticed . They had 260,000 miles of single wire and 267,000 telephones in use during 1905 . All Europe had last year only 2,044,200 miles of wire . Yet that grand division contains about five times as many inhabitants as the United States . But Europe is unprogressive compared with us . Outside its cities , the telephone is little used . Here its imperious call is heard everywhere ? in the huge department store , thronged with city crowds ; in lonely lumber camps , buried in the depths of primeval forests ; in the rice swamps of our Gulf States ; on the vast wheat ranches of the West ; in the mines of Pennsylvania or Colorado ? in short , wherever American energy is turning raw material into wealth . The most urgent need of trade or commerce ? of wealth production or wealth distribution ? is quick communication . Hence it is a truism nowadays that expansion of business means increased telephonage . But , if business aids the telephone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creates it , indeed , under certain circumstances . Spread a network of telephone wires over a backward rural community and note the surprising improvement visible in a few years . The people have been awakened , stirred into activity , educated up to higher standards . If public demand has made the Bell Companies supreme in the field of telephony , be it remembered that the telephone has made itself indispensable in business . This benefit is a direct benefit . Incidentally the companies , by employing labor and paying good wages , help every city wherein they maintain an exchange . Telephony is a new art and has opened new avenues of employment , especially to women . The manager of the New York exchange , in 1878 , found himself hurriedly compelled to augment his force of employees , owing to rapid increase in the use of the telephone . It was impossible to obtain competent men enough . By accident he learned that a young woman had charge of the switchboard in the exchange in Bridgeport , Conn . Her success gave him a hint ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his switchboard operator chairs . The Bridgeport young lady was the first telephone operator of her sex in the United States . To-day the Companies have more than twenty thousand women operators in their employ . Telephony enables them all to earn larger wages than they would receive in any other occupation . Thirty years ago every noted physicist in the world would have scoffed and scorned a proposition to convey speech by wire . Bell says of himself , " Had I known more about electricity and less about sound , I should never have invented the telephone . " So simple was its mechanism that the first telephone was characterized as the very hardihood of invention . It bears no resemblance to the complicated apparatus to be seen in any central exchange in this year of grace , 1906 . Marvellous , indeed , is the progress which has been made since the war-stirring patent of 1876 was issued . Hundreds of keen minds have co-operated to produce the perfected telephone of to-day . Nevertheless , in science , as in reform , it is the first step that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inventor of the original telephone . Two countries have the right to be especially proud of him ? Scotland , the land of his birth , and the United States , the land of his adoption . Each country has a splendid bead-roll of names illustrious in applied science . Yet it is safe to say that posterity will honor none of them more highly than the name of Alexander Graham Bell .
