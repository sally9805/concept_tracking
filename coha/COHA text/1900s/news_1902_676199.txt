txt Higher Ideals of Honesty " was the subject of a sermon preached at the Walnut Street Presbyterian Church to-day by the Rev. Dr. S. W. Dana , who in the course of his remarks criticised recent utterances of the Rev. Dr. Parkhurst of New York . He said in part : " ' Thou shalt not steal , ' has placed upon it many an interpretation according to one 's personal wish or conduct . Some are honest in spots , but not at the very roots of their being . They will deal fairly with their brother man and rob the Government if they have a chance . As a member of a political party , or a Legislature , or a corporation , they will connive at that which they would blush to do gs a private citizen . " Then where , too , there is so much wild talk in these days about municipal , State , or National ownership of all land , with the rich products beneath the surface and abundant harvests of the surface , some imbibe the idea that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a right to their neighbor 's possessions . " The newspapers of last Monday gave some extracts from a sermon by the Rev. Dr. C. H. Parkhurst of New York . He is quoted as saying : Some may not think it quite prudent to preach this doctrine . If I were dying of starvation and had no means of buying a piece of bread , and were to go by a baker 's shop , I should help myself to it . The way I should reason would be : " That bread belongs to the baker , but it is more God 's bread . I am one of God 's little boys , and , therefore , look upai this loaf as an answer to the prayer I offered my Fattier this morning . ' Give me this day my daily bread . ' " ' This sounds plausible , and we have often heard such decisions from communistic preachers and from the mouths of the poor , who in their distress have justified their conduct in taking that which belonged to their neighbor . But we hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man is justified in stealing bread when hungry , by the same process of reasoning he will steal clothing to protect his body , and coal and wood to cook his food . According to this theory , is there any right of personal property ? The fallacy of all reasoning of this kind is the assumption that life Is the first necessity , and that it must be preserved at all hazards , even if every law is violated . " In a bread famine our municipal government  --  might  --  be - justified hr -- taltiifgpossession of the bakeries of the city and managing them in the interests of the whole , but ' God 's little hungry boys ' had better not take their law into their own hands and break into a baker 's shop or they will not be counted honest in the sight of God or man . " NEGRO MOBBED BY WHITES . Wheelman Who Ran a Woman Down Roughly Handled  --  Crowd Knocked Him Down and Kicked Him . White persons in the neighborhood of Thirty-sixth Street and Eighth Avenue mobbed a negro , Moses Mimms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down Mrs. Elizabeth Klicks of 306 West Thirty-first Street , as he was riding a bicycle . He was knocked down again and again , struck a number of times and kicked as he lay in the street . Men and women hit him , while many women shouted in glee or rage as they saw the man being maltreated . Two policemen saved him by charging through the mob and leading him to the station house . He was bruised and cut , but not dangerously hurt , and he was locked up without being sent to a hospital . Mr. and Mrs. Klicks were walking up Eighth Avenue during the evening . Mimms was riding through Thirty-sixth Street . He lives at 444 West Thirty-fifth Street and is thirty years old . He wore the uniform of the Calumet Wheelmen . As he was about to cross the avenue Mimms noticed he was in line with Klicks and would run him down if he kept on , turned his wheel and dodged as Mr. Klicks , seeing his danger , dodged also . Mrs. Klicks tried to dodge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking for a chance to get by , he ran into her , knocking her off her feet . She rolled into the gutter . Mimms fell off his bicycle . Klicks helped his wife to her feet . The surrounding crowd of white people who had seen the accident immediately seemed to conclude that the negro was a clumsy man and altogether to . blame , and they went at him like madmen . As he arose to his feet , he was sent spinning again by a man who struck him in the neck . " Now , do him up , " shouted another man , rushing up , while the crown which quickly gathered tried to hem in the negro . But he saw his desperate situation , and with a wild dive jammed himself through the crowd and ran like a frightened deer up the avenue . But the crowd had no intention of losing him . The colored man only got a few rods away when he was knocked over again . He got up but went down , and then a man kicked him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a look of fear on his face that with the shouts he made many people fell back . But others pressed forward and hit the negro as he got up again , and then a number joined in the kicking . Women stood by and shouted to the men encouragingly while the mob surrounded the negro and the men beating him all the time increasing until nearly 1,000 persons were at that point . It was all happening quickly , and as the human ring was being formed Policemen and Flynn of the West Thirtyseventh Street Station had run up . They tried to push through the crowd , but failed until they drew their clubs and stepping back a few steps shouted to the crowd to make way , and then they ran at the mob and deliberately forced their way through by their own impetus , both being large men . Some hard characters were close to Mimms and seemed to be beating him more for their own amusement and because the man was colored than through any indignation over the accident . and Flynn no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men saw them , and at once dashed back , through the crowd and across the street . The policemen did not pursue , but seized Mimms and stood for a few seconds to show the crowd that they were going to protect him . No further molestation was offered the negro , who sat breathing hard with several cuts in his head , his body bruised , and his clothing in a ragged and dirty , condition . He recovered rapidly when he found he was safe . The policemen gave him some time to get " strength to walk to the station , and with a policeman on each side of him he went to the station house . Mrs. Klicks was found to be badly hurt . She had a gash in her-head , concussion of the brain , and what the physicians feared might be a fracture of the skull . She was unconscious , and a surgeon took her hastily to Roosevelt Hospital in an ambulance , from a drug store at Thirty-fifth Street , to which she had been carried by several men .
