I HAVE had placed in my hands , by the executors , twenty of Sir Arthur 's diaries , containing a full record of the events of his life from 1880 downwards . A critic says : " If they contain anything like a ' full record , ' they promise to be lively reading . I , however , venture to doubt those diaries . A man who keeps a diary of the events of his life is a fool for his pains , and Sir Arthur certainly was no fool . Although , when he had to complete a composition , Sir Arthur worked like a nigger ? day and night , if necessary ? Sir Arthur , as a rule , was by no means an energetic man . . . If Sir Arthur , in short , had ever attempted to keep a diary , I am convinced that most of its leaves would have been blank . " It is not for me to interpret the phrase " lively reading . " If it is intended as a reflection upon the life or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so absurd , and so discreditable to its author , that one must be content to say that the innuendo is without the slightest justification . The quotation which I have given , however , serves my purpose as enabling me to promptly introduce the public ( including perhaps the critic in question ) to the facts , which are , briefly , that as Sullivan was a man of exceptional energy , the diaries resemble his life in being singularly destitute of " blank " pages . The marvel , indeed , is that he found time to do so much . The word " thorough " may he said to describe everything that he did . Opinions will vary as to his merit as a composer . It is yet early to allocate his niche in the temple of music , and , as a rule , the stock of contemporary criticism , whether it be at the extremes , or somewhere between the extremes , of enthusiasm or deprecation , is , with slender exception , utterly valueless . Even the best of biographers , Boswell , attached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notconceded to-day , whilst others , and , not least , musicians , have been decried by their contemporaries in terms which would sound oddly in the ears of a posterity which has learned to more justly appreciate them . That Sullivan worked hard is hardly open to question . He was unsurpassed amongst his compatriots as a conductor , and was also what is not necessarily associated with the aptitude for composition ? he was a first - rate executant . Yet he found time to acquire a fairly close acquaintance with two or three languages , and his business affairs were conducted with an orderliness and a punctuality often alien to the artistic temperament . With all this , however , he never seemed to be lacking in the readiest response to all who had any claim on his friendship , his help , or his charity . Last of all , and perhaps least important , his social activities would have provided sufficient scope for an average plenipotentiary . Thackeray has declared that the aupremest joy and the utmost conception of human ambition has been reached when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each side of him . This precise condition of things may have applied to Sullivan on many occasions , and , pace a censorious world , I am not sure that he was any the worse for it . The notion that there was any accompanying harm in what , snobs and anti-snobs notwithstanding , I will venture to call social attainment would never have occurred , to me , had it not been that the late Sims Reeves , for one , was especially concerned with the suggestion that Society ( with the capital 5 ) had spoiled Sullivan . Since the death of the composer , critics have questioned whether Sullivan would not have dune more , and more especially in the direction of what is fallaciously known as serious music , if he had led with sufficient severity the life of a recluse . This psychological all talked to me a great deal , and said they admired my songs , which they heard so often in England . We an left at 8.15 , and drove to the Tivoli Gardens ? the best I have ever seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fat woman and other attractions ? a tremendous crowd , but all respectable and orderly . Then home to the hotel , having spent a most interesting and enjoyable day . Saturday , June 25 . ? Went on board the Lively to lunch with H.R.H. L'Estrange capital host . Left the Lively at 4 to go on board the Hercules . Had one of the Admiral 's spare cabins . Weighed anchor and got away at 5.30 . Dinner at 7. 11.8.11 and Clay* played violin duets after dinner .

Entertainment at 7.30 on the mess-deck . Very successful . Audience enthusiastic . To finish with , Fred and I played selection from H. M. S. Pinafore , concluding with the " Englishman , " which I sang , and , to my astonishment , all the crew joined in the chorus . Very well , too . Encored with rapture . July 2 . ? Anchored off Cronstadt at 2 P.M. Several officials came on board to salute the Duke . Guns firing , boats flying about , everything in life and motion . H. R.

Then dressed in court dress to await the Emperor and Empress , who came with a large suite at 2.30 . A very fine day , but it rained when the Imperial party came on board , which rather spoilt the effect . Otherwise it was a magnificent sight , . Each ship fired twenty-one guns as the Imperial yacht steamed up . The yards were all manned , and every ship covered with flags . The Emperor and Empress came on board in a boat from their yacht , and were taken round the ship by H. II. , accompanied by a lot of officers , the staff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left about 4 , and we all accompanied them to the gangway . The Emperor kissed the Duke on leaving , the crews gave them three cheers , and they returned to their yacht , the Czareena , which steamed out to sea . The fleet then weighed anchor , followed the yacht in two lines , whilst another salute was fired from all the ships as a farewell . It was a splendid and most interesting sight . July 11 . ? Fog came round us ? anxious time ? guns firing , fog-horns blowing , etc. , all night . July 13 . ? Rehearsed during the day for the " Penny Reading , " which took place in the evening . I sang Clay 's new sung , " The Ironclads of England " ? great success . I sang also the " Captain 's Song , " and the " Englishman , " from Pinafore . July ni. ? Sir W.

When I got into the carriage Prince William bowed to me and sang , " He polished up the handle of the big front door . " I burst out laughing , and so did every one . It was too funny . , lab , ' 17 . ? Breakfasted with Prince William and Prince Henry at 9 . Both the young princes are very nice and agreeable , simple and unaffected . We told each other good stories , and had a very cheery evening ? no Prussian stiffness . At the end of 1881 and the beginning of 1882 Sullivan was staying at Cairo in the company of Mr. Edward Dicey , the well-known litterateur and an old friend of his . Sir Arthur Sullivan usually spent part of the winter abroad , and , apart from his other experiences , the following extracts will be found particularly interesting , as giving us a picture of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In regard to his failure with one of the instruments , the incident is emphasized by the fact that in his boyhood Sullivan had learned to play all the instruments in his father 's band . January 14 . ? To Tigrane Bey 's house ( Nubar Pasha ) with Osman Pasha , Edward Dicey , etc. , to hear the Arab music . Six musicians were in waiting for us , and Osman said they were the best in Cairo , that there were none so good anywhere . . One only ? the chief singer ? was in Arab dress . They all sat cross-legged on a divan . Four played and two sang . Occasionally they all joined in the chorus . The instruments were the " Out , " a kind of large mandolin , six bichord strings , tuned and played with a quill ; the " Kanoun , " a kind of trichord zither , with a scale of three octaves , quills on both hands ; and the " Nei , " or " Ni , " a perpendicular flute , from which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't understand how it is blown , although I watched and tried frequently . There was also a tambourine , which was only tapped very gently , to help the rhythm . The music is impossible to describe and impossible to note down . The different kinds of pieces they played and sang were called " Peschereff , " " Sabbach , " " D'Osman Bey , " and " Tao. sim . " The chief , who played the " Out " ( pronounced " Oot " ) , was a very fine player , with really remarkable execution . The " Kanounist " was scarcely inferior . We had three hours and a half of it ? refreshments and smoking all the time . I came away dead beat , having listened with all my ears and all my intelligence . January 31 . ? Drove out to the Abbasiyeh to see the grand procession of different sects defile before the Khedive , who arrived with his escort at 12 noon . We stood in the next tent to his , and saw the whole thing . I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , carrying banners , playing instruments , and clouding ; some stopped before the Khedive and shouted , others only passed by . The principal drum rhythm was : also a carious harmony of three drums : one sect went by singing furiously : The notion that he was not energetic is one which he seemed to have harbored himself , but it will be admitted that the so-called " idlers " are frequently the busiest of men . For example , to hark back to ' 81 , in the only " summary , " written by himself , of any one of his diaries , he writes : The year 1881 opens when I am still at Nice with Edward Hall . Having brought with me some numbers of the new opera ( Patience ) Gilbert and I intend doing , 1 occasionally try to find a few ideas amongst them . I sketched lianthorne 's song , " The particularly good young man . " But my natural indolence , aided by the sunshine , prevents my doing any real work . I enjoy myself in the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carlo , where I frequently see ( Laura ) Countess of Wilton , who lives in Sir Fred Johnstone 's villa , Le Nid . One or two further detached sentences may serve to give a more definite indication as to the nature of his social activities than any summary , although it would be more complete , of my own : Was elected a member of the Marlborough Club , proposed by Duke of Edinburgh , seconded by Prince Christian . Supped sometimes at the Fielding Club , a sort of junior Beefsteak , in King Street , Covent Garden ? it had a short life only . It was founded by a few discontented ( and would-be ) Beefsteakers after the row between and outside the Beefsteak Club ? at that time in King William Street , over Toole 's Theatre . . . . After dinner at the Marlborough one night had a very long and delightful talk with Andrew Cockerel ' and Fred Burnaby ( latter especially is very accomplished , and with varied experience ) . . . . Took Princess Louise and Prince Leopold to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Opera Comique ? a most extram , dinary and beautiful performance . Gave all the children a box of sweets afterwards . .. . Went to a bazaar and fancy fair held at Bagshot Park ( Duke of Connaught 's ) for some local charity . Towards the end the Duke of Albany held an auction of unsold goods , and I bid for three little oil paintings by the Princess Louise . The Prince of Wales bid against me , and ran me up to ? 19 , at which sum they were knocked down to me .... I ran down to Cowes for a night to stay with the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh at Osborne Cottage , to discuss the question of knighthood . I firmly and strongly declined it ? or , rather , would decline it if it , were offered me . I do n't want ' to be one of a batch , nor do I care for a knighthood at all . From which it will be seen that , in this instance , Sir Arthur exercised the feminine privilege of changing his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wintering at Nice , the foregoing fragments cover a period of not more than a couple of months , and may therefore be taken as some slight indication of the time which he found himself able to give to the many clubs of which he was a member , to dinners , various other functions , and the like . The truth is that in regard to his social as well as his business engagements Sir Arthur was one ? of the most energetic of men . He never lost time by being =-punctual ; and however pleasant the engagement might be , he departed with not less punctuality . With all his gcni ality he had a sharp and short way with bores , busybodies , and nuisances generally . He travelled much , and read widely . It must be remembered also that neither the sanctum nor musical instruments are necessary to the composer . He is as free for his work as the poet . When the hard manual labor of composition became necessary , and he wished to work on uninterruptedly , it was his habit to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country . It was at one of these recreative working - resorts that I first met him . In this instance he had purchased the house , the lawn of which ran down to the river , and , as first impressions are sometimes the deepest , my recollection is particularly keen of this , our first conversation , as , in the interval of his work , he entertained me with tea on the lawn , and recounted some of his experiences , snore especially in regard to the visits he had paid to America . Although his life had been anything but free from sharp physical pails and bereavement , his was essentially a happy and sunshiny disposition . The day of his birth ? November 13th ? is " the old May day " of the calendar , and it is pleasant to think of him as I first saw him , dressed in cool gray flannels , enjoying the inevitable cigarette , talking animatedly of things musical , the while his dark bright hazel eyes followed the flight of birds or drank in the beauty of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
