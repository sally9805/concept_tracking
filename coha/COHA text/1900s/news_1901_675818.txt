txt Buckenhoff will be taken before Magistrate Bennett to-morrow morning , and on Chief Foley 's request will be committed , pending the inquest to be begun on Wednesday . It is thought that Scott and he had some angry words , but the police refused to give out any information they had about the relations of the two men . The bodies of Scott and Stevens are being , 41 .. embalmed , and Mr. Hunt , who is attending to the burial arrangements , said that he hoped to send Scott 's body to Baltimore to-morrow night and to ship Stevens 's body " Two to his old home in Petersburg , Va . A story in circulation around the clubhouse this afternoon had it that one of the neighbor 's servants heard sounds of an altercation in the clubhouse early Sunday morning . The story was said to have been told by a servant at the adjoining residence of Martin L. Sykes , but Mr. Sykes 's coachmen , who knew of the story , said he thought it came from William Carson , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up early Sunday morning to get out on his milk route , that he heard no altercation , and was sure that no dog barked in the clubhouse at that time . He said that he had been wakened by very slight noises ever since four of his cows got out of the pasture and were put in the pound . The police also had heard of the story of a quarrel early that morning , but had no confirmation to give . A butcher 's knife , similar to the bloodstained knife found near Scott 's body , was discovered by Chief Foley to-day at the foot of the stairs . It was clean , however , and was not thought to give any further clue to the case . Before Scott became the steward at the club , last July , he , with a man named ' Winston , ran the restaurant in Columbia Hall , off Sixth Avenue , near First Street . There was some difference between them , and Scott , Mr. Hunt says , sold his interest to Winston at Winston ' s price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Winston then associated himself with Aiken , who bought Winston out and runs the restaurant alone now . Detective in New York After Waiters ? Burglar Theory Scouted ? Views of the Rev. Mr. Hunt . Special to The New York Times . MOUNT VERNON , N. Y. , Sept. 2 . ? The efforts to solve the murder of David Scott .. ? and - John Stevens , the negro steward and the head waiter of the Siwanoy Country Club , in the Chester Hill section of this city , led to the arrest to-day in Yonkers of Peter Buckenhoff , a colored caterer , and the departure of Detective Lynch to-night for New York , where it is thought he will search for two colored waiters . These men. , with Buckenhoff , were employed at the club as extra help on the occasion of a stag party eight days before the murder . Wana Simms , the cook who first reported the murder to the police , and who was placed under arrest yesterday morning , was arraigned before Magistrate Bennettt this morning and remanded in the custody of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detained as a witness yesterday , was allowed to go free to-day , after telling a straight story of his whereabouts Saturday night and Sunday morning . Drs . Weiss , Fleming . Van Patten , ' and Fowler , who performed the autopsies on the murdered men , reached the opinion that they were killed while sleeping , but would not discuss their conclusions until their report had been made to the Coroner . Chief of Police Foley , after thirty-six hours ' work on the case , said that the the : ory advanced by Simms , the cook , that the 1 men had been killed by burglars who entered the clubhouse by forcing three rear doors , did not appear to be worth anything . I " I do n't think , " he said , " that these men were murdered by burglars . They were done to death by some one in that clubhouse . The evidences of burglars were fixed up by the murderer or murderers to cover up their tracks . The broken doors and the broken window through which.the burglars were supposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced open from the inside . " Buckenhoff gave us his address as 11 Engine Place , Yonkers , where he said he slept Saturday night . The landlady of the lodging house stated , however , that he was not there on that night , and that she had not seen him since Friday night . We know that he was in Mount Vernon at 11 o'clock on Saturday night , because some one whom we know saw him at the trolley station then . Buckenhoff told this person that he was going up the road , that he was going to Yonkers , but he was not seen to board a car . " The Siwanoy Country Club is housed in the old Corcoran mansion , an old-fashioned frame dwelling , which pas been refitted for the club 's purposes . Its arrangement of rooms and its crooked , winding stairways , therefore , led many of the club members to say to-day that the murders ' could hardly be the work of persons unfamiliar with the interior of the house . The burglar theory was scouted . Treasurer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the back door was not bent , as it would seem likely if the door had been forced . Then a back window on the ground floor was open all night . He also said that while late Saturday night there was a heavy rainfall . no evidence of the mud tracks of any entering persons was found . He said that the club dealt with Scott , the steward , and the latter employed his own assistants , so that the club members knew little of its . servants , except that there was no apparent quarrel . In the early part of July a German named Bungartz was steward for a few days . His services were dispensed with as unsatisfactory , and colored help was decided upon . Scott was then employed . Scott 's brother-in-law , the Rev. Granville Hunt of the Grace Chapel ( colored ) Baptist Church of this city , said to-night that he believed Simms innocent of the crime . " One week ago last Wednesday . " Mr. Hunt said , " Scott told Simms that he could get three extra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saturday . Simms went to New York and engaged one man . who was to bring two of his friends . I do n't know the names of these men . One of them was ' kept over Sunday , and it was understood that he should go to the club again last Friday ; but he disappointed Scott . A man was obtained for Saturday . who I do n't know . I do n't know that there was any difference of any kind . The - men first wanted $3 a day and car fare , but Dave ( Scott ) did not let Simms offer them that . " Scott was here Saturday night to see his sister , whom I married , and his mother , who is very ill here . Just after he left Stevens telephoned from the club . I told him Scott had just left . He said he would be here just the same to see his wife , who stays with us , and he asked me to wait up for him . I sat here until 12:30 and then went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all right and that he decided not to come . " When I saw Simms to-day he told me that the blood on his feet and his nightshirt came from the blood on the floor and the beds in the room where he found Scott and Stevens . I was Simms 's pastor six years , and have confidence in him . Far from being a rough man . he was gentle , and wept so easily that he was sometimes called ' Jer'miah , the weepin ' prophet . ' I ca n't think of him doing anything of that kind . Scott praised him to me only a short time ago . He said Simms always dide his work right . " When Denaington. who was detained on suspicion , was arraigned in court , he told Magistrate Bennett that he had been occasionally employed by the golf club . Scott would put him to work when there were many golf players or members at the club . He was so employed on Saturday afternoon , and remained at the clubhouse until 11 o'clock , helping Scott . Stevens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he went to his home , and was asleep before midnight . On the way to the club the next morning he heard of the murder . He said that when he left the clubhouse the three men were in the best of humor , and were laughing together , and that there had been no difference between them . Simms , when arraigned , told the story as he has told it from the start . He claimed to have been awakened by the growling and barking of his skye terrier , chained to his bedpost , and hearing a scream and Stevens crying out , " Oh , Dave ! " He told again how he had hurried into the room occupied by the others to find one dead and the other expiring . As for the blood stains , he wore a night shirt reaching to his ankles , and when he leaned over Scott 's body theihem of the shirt touched the floor and was thus stained . He said that he was ordinarily a sound sleeper , and that after he had put in a hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerable to awaken him .. He thus accounted for having slept through any noise that occurred in the room close to his own . preceding the outcry which finally brought him out of bed to investigate . No trace has been found yet of the cash box of the club , which was in Scott 's custody , and is thought to have contained about $180 . Scott was undoubtedly hit with the iron of the bloodstained putter , found near his body , and the blow rightly delivered would , in the opinion of the physicians who Performed the autopsy . have felled him . Thus , if the blow preceded the stabbing . there might have been but little noise attendant upon the deed , except the falling of Scott . who was a very heavy man . Stevens received a Similar blow , which fractured his skull . The stab wounds insured the death of the men , and some of the cuts were ATTITUDE OF MR . SHEPARD .
