txt FRANCE AND TURKEY . The belief that the thing to do for a man or a nation behindhand in his or its accounts is to " save face " has been brought up to account for many things otherwise unaccountable in the politics of the Far East . But it is equally efficacious in the politics of the Near East . The unspeakable Turk is as much addicted to it as the Empress Dowager of China herself . It is all the more gratifying that the unspeakable " dead beat " first in question has been made to pay his debts under the threat of a French bombardment of Mitylene . There Is ho shuffle or equivocation possible in this situation . The Sultan has not " saved his face . " In our case he succeeded in doing so . He owed some of our " nationals " some money which there seemed to be no way of getting out of him , in spite of the intelligent efforts of several successive Ministers- to Constantinople . His objection was apparently not so much to paying as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a man-of-war constructed in an American private yard something by way of installment on the indemnity Turkey owes us is the pretense with which we have connived . This is not very satisfactory . The " short way with unbelievers " adopted by France is without question more consoling to the feelings of a self-respecting and a justly indignant national creditor . And France has set an excellent precedent for foreign creditors in dealing with Turkey . The difficulty in applying the French method has heretofore lain , not at all in the potential powers of resist . ance of Turkey , but in the mutual jealousies and fears of " the Powers " which compose what is rather absurdly called the " concert of Europe . " It must have taken a high degree of diplomatic skill , as well as a considerable degree of exasperation all around with the unspealable Turk himself , to enable France to get a free hand in this matter and to treat the Turk like any other solvent but dishonest debtor . It is a distinct advance upon the past history of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparently been raised against the French proposal to force Turkey , by " supplementary proceedings , " to pay her honest debts . It seems that the cordiality of our own reply to the French proposal is " much appreciated " in Paris . And it may or may not be gratifying to us that , for the first time , we were consulted , and to that extent recognized as a Nation with interests beyond its - own borders . But our answer seems to have saved the situation in this respect , as well as in others . For it is reported to have been that France might do what she liked , since it was no affair of ours . Nevertheless , the value of the French precedent is great to us , as well as to other Powers . It will be very difficult for any Power which has acceded to the French proposal to go back upon its adhesion . There is now a precedent established to the effect that any nation which has a good claim against Turkey may enforce the collection of it by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " face " of the unspeakable Turk himself .
