txt The army of invasion under Gen. Bliss is within ten miles of Kingston Bay in the war game to-night , and the Blue Army under Gen. William A. Pew , Jr. , of the Massachusetts volunteer militia is demoralized , scattered and retreating before the onward rush of the victorious Reds . That Gen. Pew has been signally defeated and that Gen. Bliss has put through all his plans is admitted even by the Blue partisans to-night . The impression is that the war will be officially declared off to-morrow afternoon , and the invaders ordered back to New Bedford , where they will embark for their homes . While Gen , Leonard Wood , the chief observer of the manoeuvres , has not officially made such statement , off ! ? cers in close touch with him say that there is little reason to doubt the report . Color is given this rumor by the fact that the sending of supplies to the front from the ' t uartermastA 's depot at New Bedford ceased this afternoon , and several heavily laden wagon ti aim from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to New IBedf ( ) rd . The Blue Army has been completely routed , and to-day wancl'ains ? detachments of its soldiers were ro oe seen everywhere within the scene of . the war , the men wet and bedraggled appar-. ently not caring whether they found their commands or not . One of Gen. Bliss 's staff said to-night that the gap in the Blue line was so complete and commands so widely scattered that any effort on Gen. Pew 's part to reconcentrate his forces would be vain , even if he had a month instead of only a few hours at his disposal . Red Army in Fine Condition . In striking contrast to conditions in the Blue Army is the situation in the Red army . it is still ready ' to move forward in excellent shape , its regiments are splendidly disciplined , and every ? : . nan is accounted for . To-night the Reds are encamped around Stetson 's Pend , near leryantvile , ten miles from Kingston , ready to begin at sunrise the march that it Is believed will end the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the centre of his men , who are massed about him in a solia square with the exception of the cavalrymen , who are reconnoitring some miles in his advance . There is reason to believe that to-morrow afternoon Bliss 's land forces and the Red Navy under Capt . Gulick will join forces at Kingston , and then there will be left no opposition to the Reds on their advance toward Boston That the ending of the war will be welcomed by both the Blues and Reds , regardless of rank , there is absolutely no doubt , for volunteers never faced worse conditions than those which have overwhelmed the little armies in the last two days . The storm to-day did not compare with that which raged all day yesterday , but there fell a drizzling , cold rain that kept the ground soggy , the tired soldiers wet and uncomfortable , and zho military surgeons apprehensive . More Sickness Follows Exposure . The army transport Kilpatrick , which yesterday had on board twelve incapacitated Reds , to-night is accommodating sixty-six , and more are expected in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be mentioned that none are from the Seventh Regiment , the New York batteries or Squadron A. The Twenty-second Regiment of Engineers and the signal corps from Manhattan , and the Fourteenth Regiment from Brooklyn , however , are not so lucky . Among the New Yorkers in the Kilpatrick hospital are Privates Joseph Leonard , T. K. Fell , R. Johnson , and Hugh J. Andrews of the Twenty-second ; Privates Arthur W , Brown and Charles Hoffman of the Four . teenth ; Private Arthur Moeller of the signal corps , and Private O'Neill of the lhospital corps . One of the worst cases in the hospital is that of Private Cromley of Company L , First Connecticut Regiment . Creme ley is paralyzed from the waist down , and the surgeons are trying to find out the cause , as the young man was never afflicted that way before . His condition is said to be serious . Private Gottchaw of Company C of the Twenty-second Regiment was shot in the foot this morning in an engagement east of Middleboro , and was taken to the Kilpatrick . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind him fell . The hammer of his gun was up , and something discharged the gun . The wadding and powder struck Gottchaw 's big toe on the right foot , and shot it off at the first joint . Surgeon Miller , U. S. A. , who is in charge of the hospital , said to-night that he had only one case of possible pneumonia . He was greatly surprised , he added , when he found out that one of his patients was suffering from tuberculosis in an early stage , while another young soldier had long been subject to epileptic fits . He said he could not understand how either of these men had been permitted to enlist , much less to go to the front in these exercises . There are also a number of patients in the division field positions , but only one case is serious . Lieut . Bean of the District of Columbia was found unconscious beside the road about two miles north of Bryantville this afternoon . He was hurried to the field hospital in Col. Littell 's automobile . Lieut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fell from his horse . Many of the patients are suffering from sore feet . Much sickness is also reported from the Blue camps . Hard Match on Muddy Roads . The fighting to-day began as soon as the Red Army got on the move this morning . The call to arms was sounded at 5 A. M. , and after a hurried breakfast of salt pork , hard tack , and coffee , the long column , with the cavalry commands under Major Bridgman leading , got under way . The orders were to move straight forward in a northeasterly direction 04 : rthe Kingston road , the ultimate destIr* htioli being the port of Kingston , about itwenty-three miles distant from Cemetery ; RIM near which place the Bliss forces ' had encamped over night . The line of march was over roads that ' so far as the depth of the mud was con  --  cerned turned oat to be the worst yet ' encountered by the Red Army , and it must be remembered that the fine State roads ' have been tabooed by Gen. Bliss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was very hilly an some of the big army wagons were stalled for hours at a time before the combined efforts of men and mules could get . them over the inclines . Added to the troubles of the teamsters was that of the men who had ' been detailed to accompany the supply trains . Many of these were suffering from sore feet and exposure , and all along the line of advane were to be seen little squads of exhausted ones , who had been compelled to fall out for recuperative purposes . In the rear of the column all was peace and rain , but it was different in front , where the cavalry was busy widening the gap that had been opened through Pew 's main line of defense . The horsemen began fighting within half an hour after the advance began and they kept It up for nearly eight hours . The Blues , which were in retreat , had left numerous small detachments to harass the victorious Reds , and it was the routing of these trouble-makers that kept Bridgman 's men on the jump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near which place was fought the battle of Cemetery Hill yesterday , The*Tenth Cavalry figured most in this Sight , and when it was all over the two Massachusetts companies of infantry , " which had made the stand for the Blues , : were ruled out as dead , wounded or captured . Three miles further on Squadron A came upon another batch of harassers , and after a spirited engagement , repeated the performance of the Tenth troopers , and took the surviving Blues captives . Blue Rear Guard Successful . Skirmish after skirmish followed , with the Reds victorious in every instance , until 12:30 P. M. , when the advancing . horsemen came upon a strong force of rBlue infantry that had been massed upon a hill near Grovers Corner , a settlement a few miles south of Pembroke , on the Kingston road . . The Eighth Massachussetts Regiment had this hill and were supported by two one-poun 1 quick-firing guns mounted on automol the gun carriages . A cornfield several acres in extent was at the base of the hill , and the Red cavalry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and capture the Cheering and firing their pistols as 43hey ran , Bridgman 's men , who had been reinforced by the negro troopers of the - Tenth Cavalry , started across the field . Gen. Pew , it was afterward stated , was In personal command of the Blue forces that opposed the Red horsemen . He was retreating at the time , and sent hurried orders forward for the Fifth Massachusetts Regiment and the Cadet Corps of Boston to turn back and help the Eighth defend the hill . The Eighth is the ' regiment that did such fine work on Cemetery Hill yesterday . Before - Gen . Bliss could get reinforcements to Bridgman the cadets and the Ninth Massachusetts commands reached the hill , and because of the cross fire of the onepounders the Reds , who were outnum'bered three to one , had to fail back and take up a position at the head of the on-coming Red main column . As soon as the ifted cavalrymen turned back the Blues - continued their retreat , and were not again overhauled by the Bliss forces . Two Governors Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Governors of Massachusetts and Connecticut . Gov . Draper of Massarchusetts was with the Blue troops , while Gov . Weeks of Connecticut was accdmpanying the Reds , Troop B of the Nutmeg State being one of the horse commands that was turned back by Pew 's soldiers . There was no more serious fighting after this , and an hour later the head of Bliss 's " column reached Stetson 's Pond , where Gen. Bliss established his headquarters for the night . It was said this afternoon that Gen. Pew 's headquarters were on the Kingston Road , less than half a mile distant from those of the victorious Red commander . In one of the smaller engagements the ' negro troopers came back with Company G , two supply wagons , and the regimental band of the Fifth Massachusetts . The negroes were greatly elated over the discomforture of the Massachusetts musicians . Another interesting capture was that of two Blue spies near Gen. Bliss 's headquarters late this afternoon . The men were hiding in the brushwood in the rear of Bliss 's tent when Corporal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the men had two revolvers in addition to his rifle . Both prisoners refused to give their names , and were held overnight . When Gen. Bliss asked the reason of their actions they replied that they were obeying orders . Gen. Bliss told THE NEW YORE Trams correspondent this afternoon that he had received no confirmation of the report that President Taft would review the combined armies within the next two days . He also said that he had not been informed that hostilities would end at noon to-morrow , although he admitted that be had heard such a rumor . Gen. Bliss said that the understanding was that New York troops must be back in New York by Saturday . This would necessitate their departure by Friday at the latest . The Rea navy , it is said , before morning will be on the way back to New Bedford , where the transports will embark the Red soldiers for their home ports . The impression prevails that Capt . Gulick will capture the water approach to Boston to-night before starting south to join the Bliss forces . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Boston , so far as the Blue army is concerned absolutely clear . A chase for the runaway war balloon Greylock. which escaped from Brockton yesterday . was without result to-day . After being notified that it had been sighted over the town of Stoughton . Capt . F. S. Wilson . in command of the Third Company , Coast Artillery , stationed here , went with a detachment to Stoughton in an automobile . They saw the balloon and followed its course , but it did not come hear enough to the ground for them to capture it , and when it floated out over a swamp they abandoned the chase .
