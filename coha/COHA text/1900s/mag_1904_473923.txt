MAN is adapted by nature to move upon the earth 's surface . Yet , in fancy , he has always been an aeronaut . Like the Psalmist , he has sighed , " Oh that I had wings like a dove ! for then would I fly away . " The writer of this article never gave a serious practical thought to aeronautics , but the one dream of sleep that has persisted for many years is that he could fly ! This is a common experience . Such visions of the night have typified the waking dreams of the race . Montgolfier with his balloon made the first practical step towards their fulfilment . Since his day men have puzzled over and planned a dirigible balloon or air-ship . It is interesting and curious to find a lowly arthropod a close fellow with ourselves in the above experience . The spider , like man , is a terragrade . Like man , she can overstep nature 's bounds and move over or through the water . Like man , she has invaded the air and essays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falls short of directing her mimic air-ship and , in chief at least , drifts before the wind . Moreover , like man , in rare divergence from the habit of lower animals , she does these things , as she gets her food , by the aid of a manufactured implement , and not by direct use of her natural locomotoria . These facts give zest to our study of " ballooning " ? or , as they are popularly called , " flying " ? spiders . That an animal which has none of the natural gifts of winged creatures for progress through the air should nevertheless be able to overcome gravity , mount aloft , and make long aerial journeys , is well suited to excite imagination , awaken curiosity , and stimulate research . Spider ballooning is not limited to any period of the year . But the seasons when it most prevails are spring or early summer , and the autumn after the young have been hatched . The fall is especiallythe time for flying spiders , and October the month most favored . But in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer . Nor is the habit confined to any one group . It is probable that the young of all spiders , and certain that many small species of all the great groups , are more or less given to aeronautics . The infant aranead , when aloof from its fellows and exposed to a puff of air , seems instinctively to throw out its spinnerets and send forth jets of silken filament , just as a human . baby sets in motion its hands and feet . As the jets are soon of sufficient buoyancy to counterbalance the spider 's weight , the creature becomes an aeronaut , nolens volens . One can see how from this involuntary act the habit of ballooning could have been formed , and fixed by heredity . Let one walk in the fields on a warm October day , when a soft breeze is blowing . If he will stoop low and glance along the meadow , his eyes will catch the sheen of myriads of fine silken filaments . They float from every elevated spot . They fringe fence-posts and hedges . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foliage of bushes with delicate meshes , or flutter like ribbons from their tops . These are the ropes and netting of ballooning spiders . If , now , one will glance upward , he will be apt to see long white sinuous filaments drifting through the air , over tree-tops , across streams , far aloft , or perhaps low enough to be within reach . If he will grasp one of these threads he may End in his hand a small spider ; but not always , for many drifting filaments are simply trial threads , or loose bits of the drag-lines which spiders are apt to throw out as anchors when they walk . His captive will be a flying spider , arrested in aeronautic flight , arid the silken filament is in fact her balloon . The story of a baby spider 's life is most interesting , from its silken cocoon cradle to the final flitting and setting up for one 's self on an independent web . In all stages thereof the ballooning habit has much to do . But let us now suppose that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is on the young aranead , urging it by the instinct of migration to seek a home in the wide world of yonder meadow . It is a Lycosid , a ground-spider , we will say ; yet here we find it on the top of this fence-post , where , with the aid of a pocket-lens , one can watch its movements . Fences are favorite ascension points , and upon these clusters of young Lycosids are gathered . But the bushy heads of tall weeds , the dainty circular platform of the wild carrot 's mosaic bloom , the feathered plumes of the goldenrod , the star-faced blossoms of the field-daisy , are requisitioned for their flight by groups of balloonists . The purpose in choosing these elevated spots is plain , the currents of air being stronger there than close to the surface , thus facilitating flight . A wise volition seems clear in the case of Lycosids , at least , which , being ground-spiders , are not found habitually in higher places . We return to our place of observation , one of the side-posts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fields . These are let down to allow fair opportunity to follow the aeronaut , when it shall ascend , without the stress and delay of getting over the fence . With back to the sun and lens in hand you may see the mode of ascension . Several young-hugs are atop of the post and the upper rail near by . You fix your eye upon one . It leaps upward and is off ! No ; it is back again , like a boy 's return-ball . The buoyancy of the thread exuded is insufficient to sustain the animal 's weight , and it can not rise aloft . Other feints , perhaps , will follow , which soon cover the posts and top rails with streaming trial threads . In the mean time you have noted the spider 's attitude preceding flight . It faces the direction of the wind . The abdomen is elevated about forty-five degrees , and at the same time the eight legs , four on either side , are straightened out , and the body thus raised above the surface . At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , covered with minute spinning - spools , through which jets of liquid silk are forced . from a multitude of glands within the body . These harden at contact with the air , and are held apart or combined at the spider 's will , by closing or outspreading the spinning mammals . Keep the lens directed upon the spinnerets of your little adventurer . A ray of several threads is issuing , which , caught by the breeze , are drawn out and upward six , ten , even twenty or more feet . Meanwhile , the legs incline towards the breeze and the joints stiffen . The foremost pair sink almost to the level of the post . All the legs and the whole attitude show the muscular strain of an animal resisting an uplifting force . Suddenly and simultaneously the eight claws are unloosened , and the spider mounts with a sharp bound into the air , and floats above the meadow at a rate more or less rapid , according to the velocity of the wind . The threads have been drawn out so far that their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and time she is able to keep afloat . What is her manner of flight ? It may be a long time before the observer shall find examples that give satisfactory answer . Some are caught up into the heavens with so sharp a rapture that they are out of sight at once . Others scud along under so swift a wind that they can not be followed . But fortune favors patience . Here at last is one that is off before a light breeze , and is hugging the ground at about the height of a man 's face . And there , too , goes the man , following her across the meadow at a brisk run , his head turned to one side , his eyes fixed on what seems vacancy to yonder ploughmen , who have stopped their teams to gaze in wonder and debate the question of his sanity ! Nevertheless , he has seen something which sane people will be glad to learn . As the spiderling vaults upward , by a swift motion the body is turned back downward , the ray of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the feet , which also by deft and rapid movements weave a tiny cradle or net of delicate lines , to which the claws cling . At the same moment a second AERONAUTIC SPIDERS. silken filament is ejected and floats out behind , leaving the body of the little voyager balanced on its meshy basket between that and the first filament , which now streams up from the front . Thus our aeronaut 's balloon is complete , and she sits or hangs in the middle of it , drifting whither the wind may carry her . She is not wholly at the mercy of the breeze , however , for she has an ingenious mode of bringing herself to earth . When the human aeronaut wishes to descend , he contracts his balloon 's surface and lessens its buoyancy by letting out its gas . The spider acts upon the same principle , by drawing in the filaments that buoy her up and give soilage surface to the wind . Working hand over hand , as one may say , she pulls down the long threads , which , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flossy white ball above her jaws . As the floatage shortens , the aerial vessel loses its buoyancy , and at last the spider sinks by her own weight to the field . Thereupon she throws out a silken rope , after the manner of aeronauts , which anchors to the foliage , and the young voyager abandons her " basket " and begins life in her new - found site . This voluntary descent seems to be a rather exceptional experience . For the most part the balloon is stopped by striking against some elevated object . The above description covers the average manner of the araneal aeronaut . There are variations , of course , one of which may he noted . Some orb-weavers , instead of vaulting into the air from a perch , spin against a filament strdaming from some elevated object a tiny cone-shaped puff or pellet of silken floss , underneath which they hang until it is twisted off by the wind or cut loose by their sharp jaws . This , with streamers floating fore and aft , forms the little creature 's balloon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such swinging and drifting away from shocks of corn , from clumps of thistles and goldenrod , and from russet patches of blackberry-vines . Given a steady breeze and a free course , there is practically no limit to the distance which a ballooning spider may traverse . The writer has taken orb-weavers from their snuggeries under divers sheltering projections at the highest attainable point on the dome of St. Peter 's in Rome , whither they had doubtless been carried by the wind when young-lingo . One may see flecks of gossamer afloat at far greater heights . Seafaring folk often note spider balloons speeding by them at sea or entangled upon various parts of the vessel . Darwin , in his famous voyage of the Beagle , when sixty miles from land saw great numbers of small spiders with their webs . When they first came in contact with the rigging they were seated upon threads , and while hanging to these the slightest breath of air would bear them out of sight . Thus , though so far from land , the wee voyagers were still moving on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American Line steamship Pennsylvania , told the writer , during a voyage in the winter of 1881-2 , of a like observation made by him . While sailing along the eastern coast of South America during the month of March , his ship was covered with innumerable spider-webs . He was then more than two hundred miles from land , about four hundred miles south of the equator . The wind was blowing from the continent . " The spiders seemed like elongated balls , " said the captain , " with a sort of umbrella canopy above them . They settled upon the sails and rigging , and finally disappeared as they came . You know , " he added , " that it is not unusual for birds to be blown out to sea . How much easier for a spider , provided he has the means to keep himself suspended in the air ? " To the ballooning habit of spiders is due so-called " gossamer showers . " On an early autumn morning when the dew upon floating spider filaments betrays their presence , one is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day quantities of this spinning - work will be seen sailing through the air . A great excess of tufts of filaments is known as a gossamer shower . At times it has assumed such proportions as to win record as a natural marvel . Pliny appears to have seen one when he noted that " in the consulate of I. Paulus and C. Marcellus it rained wool about the Castle Carissa . " In later days in England , where gossamer showers seem rather prevalent , they received a stranger explanation than Pliny 's , as voiced by some of the English bards . Thus Spenser wrote : More subtle web Arachne can not spin : Nor the fine nets , which oft we woven see , Of scorched dew , do not in th ' ayre more lightly flee . Even as late as Thomson 's day this curious fancy had utterance in the " Seasons " : How still the breeze ! save what the filmy threads Of dew evaporate brushes from the plain . Such records serve to mark our progress in the knowledge of natural phenomena @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floating cobwebs by such impossible theories as a rain of wool or a descent of autumnal dews scorched by the sun . The writer has never seen in America such notable downfalls of gossamer as described by English authors . The Rev. Mr. Kirby , for example ( Kirby and Spence , introduction to Entomology ) , tells us of gossamers observed by him early in the morning , spread over stubbles and fellows so thickly that they seemed " covered with a gauzy carpet , or rather , overflown by a sea of gauze , presenting , when studded with dewdrops , a most enchanting spectacle . " The Rev. Gilbert White , whose Natural History of Seborne is still a delightful and inspiring book , describes a gossamer shower that occurred in England , September 21 , 1714 . At daybreak the stubble and clover grounds were matted with a thick coat of cobwebs , in the meshes of which a heavy dew hung so plentifully that the whole face of the country seemed covered with fishing set-nets drawn one above the other . The dogs were so blinded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay down and scraped the webs from their faces . As the morning advanced , the sun grew warm and the day became cloudless and serene . About nine o'clock an unusual appearance demanded attention . A shower of cobwebs fell from a great height and continued until evening . These webs were not single filmy threads , but flakes or shreds , some of which were nearly an inch wide and six inches long . The velocity of their fall showed that they were much heavier than the atmosphere . On every side the observer noted a continuous succession of fresh flakes falling into sight from the upper air , and twinkling like stars as they turned their white sides toward the sun . This shower extended over at least eight miles of territory . One of Mr. White 's neighbors met it while riding abroad , and rode to a near-by hill three hundred feet high in order to escape it . When he reached this lofty spot he was astonished to find the gossamers as far above him as before . The flakes , adds Mr. White , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have gathered baskets full . The origin of the gossamer thread has been explained already . It needs only to add an explanation of the shreds and flakes . In Vol. , MIL ? No. 648 , - 113 many , perhaps in most eases , a number of feints are made before ascent . A spider will take clue position and spin out a thread ; but it fails to mount aloft . Other unsuccessful attempts follow , each producing a filament- . These , while waving to and fro in the eddying air , are often tangled together before they arc whipped off . Others again are united in the air after release . If now we think of the myriads of young spiders abroad at this season , all moved by the impulse to flee their present site , and all spinning out gossamer threads , we may imagine the enormous quantity that would be set afloat within a brief time . These masses of gauzy material are carried up by the warm ascending currents of air ; and as the day grows cooler and the currents begin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fibrous meshes minute insects . Closely related to the ballooning habit of spiders is their ability to pass from point to point by means of bridge-lines of varying length . Thus , also , are formed the foundation-lines strung between various objects , upon which the orb-weaver spins her geometric snare , sometimes thereby bridging a brook with her dainty lacelike web . In the same way , some individuals have been known to sail over the surface of water by setting loose several long filaments which , floating above the creature 's back , act as a sail . The wind playing upon these streamers drives the voyager over the water as she stands erect with outspread legs upon the surface . The recent bicentenary of the philosopher and theologian Dr. Jonathan Edwards suggests that the name of this great man is associated with the habits here reviewed . While a boy in his thirteenth year he was led , by his unaided observations , to anticipate in their main features some of the discoveries of our own time . He hit upon a rudely accurate division of the several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is associated with the bridge-lines stretched from tree to tree across roads , between fences and like positions . He appears to have seen that the spider , while engaged in casting out its threads , often swings free in a little basket of gossamer lines held between its bunched feet ? an observation which the writer long supposed original with himself . He even defined accurately the manner in which the spider 's web is formed . He perceived that the balloonist-spider had no direction of its frail aerial vessel after it had once embarked , but went perforce at the will of the wind , and disembarked wherever its air-ship was entangled . And he correctly discerned and explained the theory of equilibrium by which the spider navigates the air . In view of these facts , one may well echo the language of Professor Benjamin Silliman , one of the most eminent of America 's men of science : " The observations recorded by him present a very curious and interesting proof of philosophic attention in a boy of twelve years . Had he devoted himself to physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extraordinary age in which he commenced his career ; for his star was just rising as Newton 's was going down . "
