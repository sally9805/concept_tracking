 | ness did not allow him to do so , and consequently he had a troublous life . The name of Crispi has been written in golden letters in the history of Italian independence , and though two opinions are possible both as to his personal character and his ministerial life , as to his patriotism there is but one opinion . He deeply loved his country , though one may say , with Shakespeare , ' ' He loved not wisely , but too well . " Before he was twenty he was foremost among the members of the Giovine Italia , Mazzini 's organization for the redemption of Italy . The house of Bourbon has never had in Sicily a more determined opponent than this young Albanian ; because Crispi , though a Sicilian by birth , was an Albanian by race , and in his patriotic aspirations often included the deliverance of Albania from the Turkish yoke . He was a born conspirator , and conspiracy was his natural element . So long as there was a Bourbon to conspire against , all his energies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Italian Moderate party and the Italian Republican party , and when in the fullness of time he reached the highest place in the government of the country , he seemed to see everywhere conspirators against him . Events wrought his fortune , but he worked out his own ruin . At the time of the crisis of 1891 , a friend of his regretfully stated that Crispi 's greatest enemy was Crispi himself ; and there was much truth in it , as will be seen later on . W hen the revolution of 1848 broke out , Crispi took a prominent part in the overthrowing of the Bourbon sway in Sicily . Reactionary Europe helped the restoration of the house of Bourbon , whose government , however , was soon afterward denounced by Gladstone as " the negation of God . " Crispi had to flee the country , and he went successively to France , to England , to Malta , and lastly to Turin , then called the Mecca of the Italian National party . The ancient capital of Piedmont was then overcrowded with patriots from every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the influence of Mazzini , was precluded from approaching the Cavourian party . Private means he had none , and as a lawyer he could not find work , as there were a multitude of briefless barristers at the time in Turin ; and therefore he found that place anything but comfortable . In a moment of despair he applied for the post of town clerk of a village district , to which was annexed the handsome salary of $140 per annum . His application was not accepted , and well it was for the nation that it was not . Crispi then turned his attention to his native Sicily . He paid a flying and secret visit to the island , and afterward informed Garibaldi that the ground was fully prepared for an early insurrection ; and Garibaldi , induced by Crispi and Bixio , started , on May 5 , 1860 , for his immortal campaign . Crispi on that occasion performed a magnificent service . He was Garibaldi 's right hand from Genoa to Palermo , where Garibaldi appointed him head of the temporary government under the pro-dictatorate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Moderate party , and in a manner to render the constitutional party hostile to him , and this greatly hindered his political career . If he had acted otherwise , most probably he would have had a much earlier ministerial career ; and I have no doubt whatever that if Crispi had been a member of the Rattazzi administration , Aspromonte and Mentana would have had a different beginning , or a different result . In 1860 , Cavour was at the highest point of his career , Crispi was but beginning his , yet I am almost sure that if Crispi could have been brought under the influence of Cavour , Crispi 's future work would have been much more useful . As a matter of fact , only three years after Cavour 's death , Crispi made his historic declaration , ' The Monarchy unites us , the Republic would divide us , " and thereby he entered the monarchical party . Mazzini did not spare him his thunders , and the friendship between these two old conspirators came to an end . From 1866 to 1876 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the leaders of the opposition . lie was then much inclined to personal attacks , and for a better display of the same he started , in 1867 , his newspaper , La Reforma , in which he accused several members of the ministerial party of corruption . A parliamentary commission was appointed to inquire into Crispi 's indictment , and the verdict went , on the whole , against the accuser . Crispi then gave the nation a bad example , which was followed , twenty years afterward , by Cavallotti , and against Crispi and his friends . Another parliamentary commission was appointed , and the accused this time were censured . Therefore , Crispi was struck by the same weapon he himself had wielded against his own opponents . On March 18 , 1876 , the Moderate party , which had ruled Italy for sixteen years , was defeated in the House , and the King sent for Depretis , the leader of the opposition . Crispi was left out of the ministerial combination , but Depretis appointed him president of the Chamber , an office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Crispi , poor or rich , always loved a life of great splendor , and as soon as he became president of the Chamber of Deputies he assumed a more princely air . During the parliamentary  | holiday of 1877 , he traveled in state through Europe , visiting , among others , Bismarck and Gambetta . This presidential journey ? unprecedented and never to be followed ? attracted , for the first time , the attention of Europe to Italy 's rising statesman . He had only just returned to Italy when Giovanni Nicotera , the home secretary . was defeated in the House . Depretis offered that office to Crispi , who accepted on the 23d of December , and two ( lays after , being Christmas Day , he committed , in Naples , the greatest blunder of all his life . On that day he married secretly the lady who ever since has been known as Signora Crispi . Crispi had another wife , known to all Crispi 's friends . Morally , it was a bigamous marriage , and an ungrateful act toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Queen Margherita who first discovered that Crispi had suddenly changed his wife , and that she spoke about it to Nicotera , who was a favorite of the court and a rival of Crispi . Nicotera inquired into the matter , and a few days after he published in his paper , Il Bersagliere , the full story of Crispi 's secret marriage . Crispi had too many enemies to escape punishment , and was compelled to resign in disgrace . No one arose to defend Crispi ; the only plea of justification put forward was that Crispi married the new wife in order to legitimatize a girl she bore him fifteen years before . The moral sentence was very severe , and it was not lessened by the fact that the legal sentence was in favor of Crispi . He was acquitted by the court on the following reasoning : When Crispi married for the third time , his first wife was dead ; the second marriage was not legal , because contracted during the lifetime of the first wife , and therefore the third marriage was legal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago produced in Italy the greatest commotion possible . Crispi 's best friends heartily deplored this marriage , because by it he repudiated a woman who had been his only comfort , help , and support during the long years of his exile , and because she had been his companion during the campaign of 1860 , for which she received the medal of the Thousand . Lina Crispi soon became a power in the state . She knew how to order her husband about . In the winter of 1887 , she was at Syracuse ; the principal lady there was then the Duchess of Torlonia , wife of the Mayor of Rome . The duchess entirely ignored the wife of the premier , and Donna Lina wired to Crispi asking , so to say , the head of the Duke of Torlonia , Crispi dismissed him under the pretext that he had paid a complimentary visit to the Cardinal-VicarGeneral of Rome . Bismarck 's wife , Gladstone 's wife , Harrison 's wife , have been true helpmeets to their husbands , but Crispi 's wife has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard to have to accuse a woman in order to render the aspect of a man 's life less ugly , yet there is no other way out of this . The late Mr. Stillman had been a great admirer of Crispi ? undoubtedly the most disinterested and enthusiastic of all his admirers ? and what he said in his autobiography can be quoted here as the personal testimony of one who has had many opportunities of forming a judgment of the whole situation : At the reception of the Queen ( wrote Mr. Stillman ) , Signora Crispi , who was really an antipathetic person , had her seat in the royal circle , where she sat as completely ignored by all present as if she were a statue of Aversion . I am convinced that the larger part of animosity shown for Crispi by the better classes in Rome was due to her . On one occasion I heard General ? ( one of the Thousand ) saying to another person , " Poor Crispi , he has not a friend in the world . " " Nonsense , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " No , " returned the general ; " if Crispi had one friend , he would kill that woman . . . . " I shall not be surprised to hear that Crispi has died relatively poor . No one ever expected he would die a rich man , as he always had the reputation of spending much more than his income allowed him to do . Under this aspect , Crispi has given his countrymen a very bad example ; but the Italians may easily forgive him for this , as in the Italian political world the two feelings which prevail over any other are : forgiveness and forgetfulness . However , the consequences of Crispi 's bad example are still noticeable . Crispi 's motto could have been the following one ? " Money no object , " as both in his private life and as a minister he acted upon this principle . Somebody has given to the Italian the following paradoxical axiom : " The more one spends , the more one gets ; " and Crispi believed in it . The financial situation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment 's trouble . His ideal of Italy was a great and powerful country ? a country second to none ? and by stating this he became popular and was much praised ; but I beg leave to say that if the duty of a statesman is to limit the aspirations of the nation to its means and to what is practicable , certainly in the performance of this duty Crispi utterly failed . Again , if the principal characteristic of a statesman is foresight , Crispi has shown himself to be a poor one . He never inquired into the future , he never took counsel from the experience of others , and he attempted things which no other statesman would ever have dreamed of doing ; and he failed to achieve ends which statesmen of much less intellectual caliber and vigor  | than he could have very easily achieved . But if statesmanship consists chiefly in single-mindedness , determination , and daring , undoubtedly Crispi deserves to be reckoned as one of the greatest statesmen of the nineteenth century . It may be said that he misread the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the nation , but no one can say that Crispi did not know his own mind and the full extent of his power . I think it is not possible to judge Crispi fairly without taking into account the special and peculiar conditions at the time when he was intrusted with the administration of the government . He became premier for the first time in 1887 . Italy had just passed through a period of great perplexity . Cairoli was deceived in a very cruel way by France concerning Tunis , and Mancini ? to repair the blunder committed when Italy refused Lord Granville 's invitation to cooperate with England in Egypt ? had embarked in a colonial adventure in the Red Sea . Crispi 's mind was well known as to the Tunis affair , and as to Lord Granville 's invitation . He would have opposed France in Tunis by any means . or taken Tripoli as a compensation , and he would have accepted Lord Granville 's invitation . On these two points the majority of the nation was with him . I was in Rome at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ministry and Crispi was called back from his retirement and appointed home secretary . The return of Crispi to power , after nine years of banishment from ministerial life , was hailed with satisfaction by many , as the need of a strong hand at the helm of the state was then much felt , and because it was generally understood that Crispi was going to be Depretis ' successor . Crispi , before accepting office , had a long interview with Depretis , of the details of which I was informed an hour after the interview . The point chiefly discussed was the African colony . Crispi was in favor of the same , but in the north ? Tripoli ? and not in the east of the African continent . Eventually , Crispi changed his mind as to the Red Sea colony , and in due time became an enthusiast over the same . Depretis died soon after , and Crispi was cornmissioned by the King to form the n e w administration . He went to Turin to make his first speech as premier , and he spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : of southern Italy , he was the natural representative . To show the world that Crispi was Crispi , he introduced , like the director of a dramatic company , to the Assembly his ministers one by one with a personal complimentary remark for each , The remark which mostly impressed me at the time was the following one : ' ' And this is Agostino Magliani , who has placed the finances of t h e country on a granite rock . " Crispi never understood finance , never read in the future , or he would have spoken of a foundation of sand instead of a granite rock . Magliani sacrificed the finances of the country to the love of popularity , and a pretty mess he made of them . The way , however , Crispi spoke of his ministers was not purely incidental . A month afterward , he made the following statement to Parliament : , , Ministers are public functionaries ; they are responsible to me , and I answer for then all before the Parliament . " The novelty of the thing helped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to the credit of Crispi that he remained faithful to his ministers , and the did not sacrifice any of them to  | prolong his lease of office . Both Crispi 's immediate predecessors and successors when in difficulty did not hesitate to throw overboard the minister who happened to have incurred the displeasure of the opposition , and appointed in his stead a minister selected from the opposition bench . Of this mean trick , Crispi remained guiltless . Crispi continued in power for over three years . His majority was chiefly composed of the Moderate part- , but on one occasion he forgot it , and , being attacked by a member of the same party , insulted the lot ; and by losing his temper lie lost his premiership , as the majority turned against him and he was left in a minority . Four years afterward , Crispi formed his second and last administration . It has been stated that his recall was due to Bismarck ? that the King was against it . Nonsense ! Giolitti , Crispi 's predecessor , who is , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the affairs of the country to such a pitch that it seemed as if a general revolt was near at hand . It was the nation which called Crispi back to power as the only man who could save the situation . In fact , the Italian monarchy has never had , since 1876 , a stronger man than Crispi in the defense of public order , and King Humbert always listened to the voice of the nation in choosing a premier . Crispi 's second administration came to an abrupt end in consequence of the Italian defeat in East Africa . Crispi , who was morally , if not materially , responsible for this , resigned without waiting for a vote of Parliament , and ever since ? March , 1896 -- lie has lived a lonely life , speaking in the House very seldom and on very special occasions , and without taking any part whatever in the political combinations of the day . Crispi identified himself with the two principal features of King Humbert 's reign , ? to wit , the Triple Alliance and the Italian colony in Africa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a premier , and did not die with him , yet for a long period of years the Triple Alliance and Crispi seemed to be synonymous . This was because Crispi most unwisely gave to the alliance the character of hostility to France . I happened to be in Rome the day on which Crispi started for his first visit to Bismarck . This visit can be considered as the fundamental mistake of Crispi 's foreign policy . Count Robilant told me in London that Bismarck , in 1886 , wrote to him expressing the desire of a visit , and that he answered back , t ' No , thank you . " Robilant was a diplomat , and he could see what an effect a visit would have had in France . Count Robilant 's successor could not see this , and hence his journey to Friedrichsruhe . I am not judging of this with a posthumous wisdom . On the very evening of Crispi 's departure from Rome , 1 wrote for an Italian paper my impressions thereupon , in the course of which I said : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bismarck with the commercial treaty with France signed , Italy will have to pay very dearly for that visit . " Before Crispi returned from Germany , the ominous news reached Rome that the French Parliament had refused the treaty with Italy . Undoubtedly , Crispi did not expect this ; but surely , if he had wished for such a commercial rupture , he could not have done better than visit France 's most hated enemy . In this way Crispi became France 's second - besthated man , and , be it said to Cripi 's justification . the more France hated Crispi the greater was his popularity in Italy ; and if popular favor may atone for the blunder of the statesman , Crispi 's sins have been entirely blotted out by the approval of the nation . Italy was not wiser than her premier , though for years afterward she ruefully deplored Crispi 's visit , especially when she perceived the relations with France becoming every day more strained , and in both countries the press was talking of a war as if it were not only possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's final retirement did a better feeling begin to prevail in both countries , and ultimately a new Franco-Italian commercial treaty was signed , and the political relations became once more friendly . The military disaster at Adowah happened when Crispi was premier and in favor of the war against Abyssinia . It has been stated in the Italian Parliament that Barattieri was compelled to give battle unprepared because Crispi had wired him that a victory was wanted to save the government . Anyhow , it has not been put in the records that Crispi ever did anything to prevent Barattieri 's folly , and , rightly or wrongly , the nation as a whole charged Crispi with the responsibility of that disaster . On another point Crispi was popular in Italy , ? to wit , in his uncompromising attitude toward the Vatican , though if ever the dream of a reconciliation approached the possibility of realization , it was in 1887 , under Crispi 's first ministry . Now I must bring this paper to a close . When Crispi resigned , in 189G , hardly a voice was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappearance from the world has deeply moved the country and reminded her that her oldest statesman was a man who had taken active part in the insurrection of 1848 , who had been in turn the intimate friend of Mazzini and the right hand of Garibaldi , the faithful minister of King Humbert , and who has loved much and suffered accordingly .
