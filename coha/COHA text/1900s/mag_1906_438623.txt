Any there should be hard-working r men and idle rich men in the same poor is a question which no one has a nswered , and no one can answer , satisfactorily . That is why the opinion is so prevalent that the world , economically considered , is so very much out of joint . lint , although there is so much unanimity in the opinion that wealth ought not to be distributed as it now is , there is still a wide diversity of opinion , where there is any definite opinion at all , as to how it really ought to be distributed . These opinions may , however , be re-limed to three fundamentally distinct theories , which I shall call the aristocratic , the socialistic , and the democratic , or liberalistic , theories . The aristocratic theory is that the good things of the world be- long more particularly to certain groups or classes than to others , by virtue of sonic circumstance commented with their birth or heredity , and independently of their individual achievements . The socialistic theory is that wealth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to some similar plan arra aged beforehand , and independently of the individual 's ability to acquire wealth in Clue rougharid-ready struggle of life . The democratic , or liberalistic , theory is that wealth ought to be distributed according to productivity , usefulness , or worth . Though no one definitely affirms the aristocratic theory , there are many who 728 How Ought Wealth . to be Distributed tacitly assume it , and show by their general attitude that they accept it , in one form or another . Moreover , this theory has always been embodied in the polity of nations , either singly or in combination with one of the others . Its variations range all the way from the caste systems of the Old World , with their hereditary titles and laws of prinnogeniture.up to the idea , somewhat prevalent even in America , that the World belongs to the white man . The laud laws of Moses , under which the land returned at every jubilee to the heirs of the original owners , were aristocratic rather than democratic , because they assumed that these had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for example , such in system would have created a landed aristocracy of the most exclusive kind , because no innnigraid , nor the heir of any immigrant , could ever have heroine a real landowner .

It was a kind of military camp , maintained by a small group of connpwrors ruling over a large subject . population . Even in the most democratic countries of the present , a remnant of the aristocratic theory is found in the form of hereditary rights to property . ' Bilis is aristocratic rather than democratic , in that it assumes that one person , by accident of birth rather than individual achievement , has a better right than another to the accumulations of the past . As with all political and social theories , the justification or condemnation of the aristocratic theory of distribution /mist depend upon its results , viewed in the light of the circumstances of time and place . There arc reasons for believing that this theory , as practiced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factor in promoting the first steps of social progress .

All the higher forms of arist are fundamentally like this pritniti:i despotism , though sometimes religions fear , or is superstitious belief in some torn . of divine right , is combined with bodily fear as a means of class subjugation . Odious as all such things seem in the light of our present civilization , they seem to huce been factors in the development of iv , lain types of civilization , which ne , d ( 1111,1-less , better than no civilization at all . One or two familiar principles will help to snake this clear . It is a well-known fact , for example , that grass tends to grow- as think as the conditions of soil , heat , 11101,4111V @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everywhere intent on preserving some such balance or equilibrium as this , for the same rule applies to all forms of life , including the human species . " Nature , " wrote . Malthus , " has sea ttereil the seeds of life abroad With tine most lavish hand . She has been comparatively sparing of the means of subsistence . " With the human species , at least in its loiter stages of development , as well as with other forms of life , nature aims to preserve an equilibrium between 1 ) 01/111S11101 and subsistence , ? between the demand for nutriment and the supply of it . This equilibrium may be stated in terms as follows : In the absence of disturbing causes , the population tends to become so dense as to require all its energy to procure subsistence enough to sustain that energy . When any community happens to possess energy enough tekprocure more subsistence than is necessary to sustain that energy , it may not inaccurately be said to possess surplus energy . But nature tends to dissipate any such surplus , partly by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of numbers . Whenever any branch of the human nice has achieved something more than its own maintenance , that achievement may be called a storing of surplus energy . for no such achievement is possible ex- // cylit where nature 's process of dissipaI ion is arrested , ? that is , where human , merge can be turned to other purposes than its own sustenance . n a perfectly natural state , and in the , lisence of some means of arresting the dissipation of surplus energy , the life-history of human beings , like that of other forms of life , would be summed up in the wools : ' thee were born to breed and die , : 1,10111i10/1 after generation , in endless and unprofitable repetition . For the vast majority of the human beings who have peopled this pinet , that is all that can be xaidfuroraboutthem . But in a few scattered instances , sections of the race have achieved something more , have left something as a mark of their having lived . I may have been nothing more than a few monumental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gods ; they may have been magnificent temples and royal palaces ; or , higher still , systems of religious philosophy , national literatures , or even bodies of scientific knowledge . ' Ile explanation of these results can never be complete until it accounts for the fact that the universal dissipation of energy was by sonic means arrested , that something was saved from the vital processes in order that human energy might be stored in these products of civilization . One of the most effective , and probably the earliest , of the many agencies for the accomplishment of this result . was the despot . When that primitive bully subjugated his neighbors , and demanded a share of their produce as tribute , he simply reduced the amount of subsistence left for them . If they could not live on what was left , nature had a way of restoring the equilibrium by thinning them out . But the despot himself would have a surplus . The chances were that he would waste this surplus in riotous living , thus himself becoming an agent of dissipation . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for himself a tomb , a temple , or a palace , to maintain priests to save his soul , musicians to sing his praises , or artists to represent him in heroic attitudes . In such cases , through the agency of the despot , the race had done something more than provide for the primary appetites of hunger , thirst , and sex . This is , in essence , the beginning of every ancient civilization . Sometimes it was a priestly class preying upon the fears of the people , sometimes a race of despots ruling over a race of slaves , sometimes all these combined . Without these agencies of exploitation it is highly probable that the mass of the people would have continued living as they had always lived , like the insects of an hour , only to breed and ( lie . Odious as despotism is , it was probably justified by some of these early results . The grandeur of ancient Egypt was the result of the exploitation of the masses , whose energy would otherwise , in all human probability , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The religious philosophy of the Hebrews could hardly have been developed in the absence of a priestly class supported by tithes . The brilliant civilization of Greece was based on slavery , and the magnificence of Rome upon the exploitation of conquered peoples . Possibly none of these were worth what they cost . The cost was despotism , but the results , whatever their cost , were achieved . As between these results and that primitive communism , under which wealth is dissipated , and life kept down at a low level , because it is all at the mercy of the most gluttonous consumers and the most rapid breeders , we should probably all prefer the former . Unattractive as is despotism , it is not so unattractive as a community living a profitless round of animal existence for the sole apparent purpose of reproducing their kind . It was doubtless this aspect of human life which led Thomas Carlyle to his conclusion that the real benefactor of the race is not necessarily the man who frees his fellows from oppression , but the man who masters them ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure , and not by hereditary titles and sham prestige ) , and makes them do what they ought to do . 7:50 How Ought Wealth to be Distributed Vastly more important , however , than the building of magnificent hanks , temples , and palaces , or the development of esoteric philosophies and literatures , is the development of a high standard of living among all the people . This , from the nature of the case , no form of oppression or ChisS dondnation can possibly do . When civilization is based upon oppression , it is necessarily is civilization in which the few- are lifted on the backs of the many into a high plane of living . This is doubtless bettor than no civilization tit all , hot it is far from ideal . The social problem of the future is to work out 11 system under which all the people may live on a high level . without constraint or oppression , each one remaining the master of himself . It is needless to point 011t that such a result has never yet been achieved , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in prospect so pleasing that even socialism looks like a pitiful makeshift in comparison . The effort to maintain a standard above the minimum of subsistence has led to a number of interesting expedients , some of them purporting to be democratic , but all of them departing from the den locrat ic principle . Especially significant is a custom which is said to have prevailed among the Teutonic villages , namely , the enforced migra ( ion of chosen bodies of youth . These youth , selected by lot and sent out into the world to ' flake is place for themselves , or perish in the attempt , were thus sacrificed in order that the remaining population might maintain a standard of living . It was an expedient a little more humane than the still More primitive one of infanticide , and it accomplished the Same purpose . Primogenin ire is still more humane , but no more just or democratic . Under this system the younger sons , and all the daughters , are placed in the position of the chosen youth of the Teutonic village ; they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the eldest son may maintain the standard of the family . In the absence of expedients of this kind , all of which are essentially inequitnia , the so-called French custom of lintitt , g offspring seems to be the only pract i/gt I one for maintaining a standard of and it is probably the most civilized pi . them all . In the same class With the swarming of the Teutonic village , mal the system of primogeniture , belongs he trade union expedient of the closed shun . It is neither more fair nor just than mn , of the others , but it aims to accomplish the same result . Limiting employment t , , union men , and resorting to the primitive law of the bludgeon to enforce their demands , they may succeed in maintaining a standard in certain chosen occupations . But it is at the expense of the nonunion man , who is , like the migrating Teutonic youth , and the younger sons the English nobility , sacrificed in the interest of a standard which others enjoy . In this connection appears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wage . It sounds well to say that no laborer ought to receive less than six loindred dollars it year . Certainly that sum is none too large . But this does not explain what is to be done with those whose services are not Worth six hundred dollars ; 1 year . Enforced colonization , the multiplication of almshouses , or the liberal administration of chloroform , might be necessary in order to dispose of 0 considerable fraction of our population , in order that the remainder might earn the minimum wage . Though it is evident that modern society will adopt none of these heroic measures , yet it is interesting to speculate , academically , upon the results of the principle of the minimum wage if it were strictly enforced . In the first place , it is apparent that such a policy would tend to weed out the least competent members of the community , so that . in the course of time , there would be none left who could not earn at least the minimum wage . In the second place , after this was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present one , because it would be peopled by a , , operior class of individuals , and the : mend quality of the population would be deteriorated by the human dregs v iiich now form the so-called submerged v k ? ownt . Nevertheless , it would be in-Lividly inequitable , because it - would s , ii ? ritiiv one part of the MI1111111 pity in the interest of another , though it might not be 11101V inequitable than nature herself , ho ruthlessly sacrifices the weak in fa-s er of the stmng. ti " From every one according to his a bili , to every one according to his needs , " is , 1 formula Which fairly well summarizes the socialistic theory of distribution . As an ideal this has at least two distinct meri t s . First , if we could get every one to pro-how according to his ability , there would be the maximum of wealth produced . Second , any given amount of wealth would sreld the maximuns amount of satisfaction to the community if it could be distributed in proportion to needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many apples that any one of them is a matter of trifling concern to him , while II is hungry for apples , the existing supply of apples in the hands of this community of two would yield the 111.111111M amount of satisfaction if A would divide with B in such proportion that their wants might be equally well tistied . The socialistic formula is , therefore , is perfectly sound one , in so far as it relates to individual obligation . Each individual ought to produce according to his ability , for production is service , and we ore all under obligation to serve the corn- ity. to the extent of our ability . Again , he ought to consume only according to his needs , for , if he consumes more , he fails to promote , in the highest degree within his power , the welfare of his community . If A , in the foregoing illustration , should gluttonously devour all his apples , be would prevent the attainment of the highest well-being of that community of two . But it is one thing to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and quite II/101110r thing to say that the state ought to make him do it . There are many things which the individual ought or ought not to do , Which it would lie futile for the state to try to regulate . Therefore , the duty of the state can not be determined he simply finding out the duty of the individual . This does not mean that there are two kinds of ethics , or tw-o grounds of obligation , one for the individual and the other for the state . There is only one ground of obligation , and that applies to the state as well its to the individual . If it is the duty of the individual to promote the general interest , it is equally the duty of the state ; but in many cases the state would defeat this N-cry purpose if it should undertake to force the individual to live up to this standard . What con the staleilo to promote the general interest ? The answer to this question is the answer to the question : What ought the state to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public regulation and control , and not a question of voluntary individual conduct . The question is not how much the individual ought to con-Milne , but how much the state ought to allow him to have . These two are so distinct that it is amazing how persistently they are confused by the so-called Christian socialists . The socialistic theory of distribution according to needs is not a mere preachment , 211 appeal to the individual to regard himself as a steward entrusted wills the care of a part of the world 's Wealth ; it is MI appeal rather to the force of law ; it proposes that men shall consume wealth according to their needs , not Ireeause they want to , but because the Ii1W allows it to them in that proportion . Human wants are so largely the product of historical conditions that it would be next to impossible to compare real needs . We arc , for example , accustomed to assuming that the needs of the business and professional classes are larger than those of the laboring classes ; but nothing could be more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assumption . The mere fact that the former have been accustomed to having more titan the latter makes it seem necessary that they should continue to have more , but this seeming necessity would absolutely disappear in a single generation of equal distribution . Another assumption of the same kind is that education and culture increase one 's needs . The simple fact is that education and culture introduce one into a social class Where consumption is more lavish because incomes are larger . If we could divest the question of such complications , we should probably find that the real needs of the cultured man are less than those of the uncultured . What does culture amount to , if it does not give one greater resources within himself , and make him less dependent IlltOtt and therefore expensive , means of gratification ? Taken altogether . the proposal to distribute wealth according to needs would necessarily resolve itself into equality of distribution , on theassumption that needs are equal . This assumption , though obviously untrue , is touch nearer the truth than any other Workable assumption , ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the needs of any one class are , in any definite proportion , greater than those of any other class , for the chances are exactly even that the proportion would have to be reversed . It would be quite as difficult to determine the relative needs of different individuals as it is to determine their relative length of life . Though it is extremely unlikely that two men , A and B , of the same age , class , and general health , will live the same number of years , it is such nearer the truth to assume that , than to assume that A will live longer than B , or B longer than A , by any definite period . The only distinctions which could possibly be made would be certain obvious ones based on age , sex , and the like , : Ind even these would be arbitrary and of uncertain value . Can we safely say that a child 's needs are less than an adult 's , or that a woman 's are less than a lilt The weight of the evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually spend more on the it , ? than on their children , and men : er , than vvonucu , simply because they the power . At any rate , the man whu is COCkS1111 , on these points is not tilt ' to whew fairness and sound judgment tiny of us would care to intrust a /wino , . of such vital concern Is the distrihmon of wealth . Even more difficult than the Hon of the rela live needs of different dividuals is theiletermination of their Hit-five abilities . We seem forced to depend upon the individual himself to demonstrate his own ability , and there seems be no better way of doing this than tit give him an open field for the ever-ei , of his talents , making the normal COI , - quenees of efficiency as agreeable , and of inefficiency as disagreeable , as possible to himself . Ile who will not do his best under these conditions could scarcely he made to do any better , except under the whip of a taskmaster . In view of the utter futility of trying Itt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the relative abilities of different individuals , the formula , " Front every one according to his ability , to every one according to his needs , " must he turned over to the preacher of righteousness , whose appeal is to the individual conscience , rather than to the legislator , whose appeal must be to legal sanctions . In strictness this formula ought to he modified to , " Let every one produce according to his ability arid consume according to his needs . " The individual whose moral development will lead him to respond to such an appeal can be reached as effectually under the present social system as under any other , while he who will not respond voluntarily could not be reached under any system . Those who , as a matter of individual conscience , respond to this appeal , furnish no problem in distributive justice for the legislator . But there is a class , large or small How Ought Wealth to be Distributed 7Th the case may be , who need the stimulus n a prospective advantage to themselves ie ( all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only when their rewards depend nnon the value of their services . How to hell with this class is the problem in dislrilintive justice for the legislator . The belief that this class includes the vs , l majority of men at the present time w no means overlooks the fact that there is a great deal of altruism and public : MO in the world . These altruistic feel-in , call be depended upon only in relatively narrow circles , such as the family , the neighborhood , or the church , and , in times of exceptional national peril , in the larger circle of the nation . In ordinary Ii tics , and outside these narrow circles within which affection develops , the average man 's efforts are normally directed by the hope of some pretty definite advantage to himself . Speaking of the family , it is sometimes regarded as a communistic group . In one sense that is the truth , and in another it is die opposite of the truth . Normally the family property and the family income ore administered in the interest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That looks like communism ; but it is is voluntary communism , such as might exist in society at large , without any change of law , if every one would regard other members of society with that degree of affection with which he now regards the members of his own family , or if each one would regard himself as a steward entrusted with the management of a portion of the wealth of the world . The family is the opposite of communistic , in the sense that the family property is usually owned by one memuer . In reality , therefore , the family is not more truly communistic than the United States would be if all its wealth were owned by one man , a hereditary despot , or a plutocrat of unheard-of proportions . Were he possessed of a strong affection for all his people , the wealth would be administered in the interest of all , otherwise in his own interest . This raises the exceedingly pertinent question , what difference does it make Who owns the wealth , provided it is administered wisely- and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the family , of an absolutely autocratic control of wealth , the very acme of concentration , which are yet so much like communism as to be easily mistaken for it . There could not possibly be a more acute case of congestion of wealth than Zion City , near Chicago , where all the productive wealth was until recently the property of one man , the notorious Dottie . Yet , according to all accounts , it was administered as though it were common property . The only answer to the above question , therefore , is that it makes no difference ; but the proviso is to() large to be safe . Under the cxtremest form of concentration , and under the widest diffusion of ownership , the average citizen would be equally well off , provided the wealth Were equally well administered . It is quite the same with political authority ; monarchy and democracy are equally good , provided they are equally well administered . But the world has learned that monarchy is not likely to be wisely administered , simply and solely because monarchs arc seldom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plutocracy is unsafe for precisely the same reason . Though a wise and benevolent economic autocrat /night administer the wealth of the nation as well as the people themselves could , the chances are very much against his doing anything of the kind . The chances are rather that lie will spend it on himself and his family , which not only wastes the wealth , but , worse still , destroys the usefulness of his family . It is , therefore , quite as important that there should be a wide diffusion of wealth as that there should be a wide diffusion of political power . Now there arc two widely different notions as to what constitutes a wide ( Min-Sion of wealth . One is that the ownership of the productive wealth should be concentrated in the hands of the state , and 73,1 , How Ought freolth to he D is , rihuhq administered by public officials , only the consumable goods being diffused . This is the socialistic ideal . ' rile other is that the ownership of the productive wealth itself should be widely diffused . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would of necessity be widely diffused . This is the democra tic , or liberalistieddeal . It is the belief of the liberal school that this system gives greater plasticity and adaptability to the industrial system than any other . Certain socialistic writerslutve , however , assumed that this ideal is unattainable , and that we sire really between the devil of plutocracyand the sleep sea of socialism . IAet us not thus despair of the republic . once upon a time a man placed a heavy load upon the back of his camel , mud then asked the beast whether he preferred going up hill or slows , to which the camel replied , " Is the level road across the plain closed every one else to accept or reject his vice , stem/sling as they are satisfied dissatisfied with its quality and its prise .

In other words , equality of opportunity does not mean that men are to be relieved id the results of inequality of ability . Nor does it mean , On the other ha/1,1,11rd men are to be left absolutely free and Unrestrained in their pursuit of self-interest . If this were true , it would require that the burglar , the swindler , and the skinflint should be left free to ply their respective callings without legal interference . ' filis principle only requires that such areltit ? s to wealth as are deemed harmful shoal , ' be closed to all alike . Equality of opportunity means liberty , to be SUIT , but it means liberty in performing and seeking the rewards of NCrvice . The ideal of liberty is fully realized when every individual is absolutely free to pursue his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to society , and when he is absolutely debarred from pursuing it by any method which is in itself harmful to society . Therefore , to say that a certain man 's fortune is the result of his superior skill , shrewdness , or industry , is no justification at all , unless it be further shown that these faculties were usefully directed , that by their exercise the community has been made richer , a as ! not poorer . If thiS condition is omitted , the highwayman , the counterfeiter , and the confidence man are all justified , for it takes skill , shrewdness , and industry to succeed in their callings . In short , service , and not industry nor intelligence , is // the touchstone by which to determine sr hat opportunities should be open and id hat closed under the principle of lib- The principle of liberty , thus int . ' rpreted , is a part of the democratic or liberalistic theory of distributive justice . Liberty to pursue one 's own interest in die 's own way , so long as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is known as conits:tition , which can only be defined rivalry in the performance of service . Production is service . Wherever two or more men are seeking their own interii4s in the performance of the same kind of service , or , more accurately , are seeking the reward for the same kind of service , there will normally be rivalry among them . This rivalry sometimes leads the less scrupulous to seek their interests in other ways than through service . In a few glaring eases these predatory metliods beconte the characteristic ones , and attract more attention than the great mass of activities- in which men compete in real wrvice . In reality , however , it is only in the limited field of " high finance " that mere shrewdness rivals serviceableness as it means of livelihood . But these predatory methods are not essential to the competitive system , and the principle of liberty as already defined requires that they he put m the same class with ordinary stealing and swindling .

( 3 ) He will pursue his interest by performing service for others , provided all harmful or non-serviceable methods are effectually closed by law . ( 4 ) Where each is free to pursue his own interest in serviceable ways , and where his well-being depends upon the amount of his service , all will be spurred on to perform as much service as possible , and the community will thus be served in the best possible /sooner , because all its members will be striving with might and main to serve one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ /wither a glorification of self-interest nor an approval of laissez faire .

If this assumption were true , the argument for laissez faire would be irresistible , being somewhat as follows : ( 1 ) Each individual of mature years and sound Mind Will pursue his men interest more energetically and intelligently when left to himself than when directed by any body of public officials . ( 2 ) The interests of each individual harmonize with those of society at large . ( 3 ) Therefore , if each is left to himself , he will work in harmony with the interests of society , and he will work more energetically and intelligently than he could if directed by public officials . This conclusion is contained in the premises , and can not be questioned by any one who accepts them . Though the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he is much less so than any body of officials would be . If we could postulate something like omniscience in public officials , the first proposition of the above argument might be rejected . And here lies the danger . ' Ile natural egotism of all men , and especially of those who thrust themselves forward as candidates for public office , and those who inherit office , leads them to believe in their ability to regulate things in general . They are thus under constant temptation to exercise their superior intelligence in 736 how Ought Wealth to be Distributed the regulation of other people 's affairs . Against this tendency the public needs to be continually on its guard , and government ought not to be allowed to interfere with the affairs of a mature individual of sound mind , for his own good . With the second proposition the case is different .

It has opened our eyes to the stern fact that , in spite of many harmonies , there is still a very real and fundamental conflict of interests . ' the term " struggle for existence " has no meaning unless it implies such a conflict . In the light of this philosophy the primary function of government is to neutralize as far as possible this conflict and mitigate the severities of the struggle . The most enlightened governments of the present perform this function mainly by prohibiting those methods of struggling which are in themselves harmful . We must conclude , therefore , that , while there is no good reason why the state should interfere with a capable individual for his own good , there are abundant reasons why it should interfere with loo for the good of others .

If we can leave every one free to pursue his self-interest in his own way , so long as his way is that of the industry which produces or serves , the active form of adaptation will take care of itself . It is the belief of those who accept the evolutionary philosophy that selection , natural or artificial , is the chief factor in passive adaptation .

It differs from natural selection in that , by virtue of these limits , a standard of li tress is set up . A society which thus ' , sakes service the basis of individual reward , and at the same lime the test of fitness for survival , will inevitably be a progressive society , because it will tend to weed out the useless individuals , ? that is , those who are not capable of promoting the process of adaptation , ? and to produce a race highly capable in this direction . In addition to this it will call out in the fullest degree the capabilities of the individuals by appealing to their self-interest , phis  - -  and not instead of ? whatever altruistic feelings they may possess . This principle of distribution according to service has sometimes been travestied by attempting to define service in terms of effort . This would mean that if two men try equally hard they should receive equal shares in the distribution of wealth . This is distribution according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efforts are not all equally serviceable . Besides , this rule is hopelessly defective in two essential particulars . In the first place , the individual 's value to society , or his effectiveness as an agent of progress , doesnot depend upontheamount of effort which he puts forth . The bungling mechanic or the soulless artist may work as hard as the genius , but they do not contribute as much utility to society . Neither of them is so valuable as an agent of progress . Ins the second place , this rule would fail to exercise the same beneficial selective influence upon the race . The mediocre and the genius would fare equally well . The dull and the stupid would be put on the same footing with , and stand the same chance of survival as , the capable and the talented . Worse still , the man who would persist ins going into an occupation already relatively overcrowded ? where , in other words , the community did not need him ? would fare as well as though he had entered an occupation relatively undererowded , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The well-being of society requires men to fill the gaps , to do the kind of work which is very much needed because the right kind of talent is scarce . The man who can do this kind of work is inure useful than the man who can do only what every one else is able to do . The simple fact is that utility is what society needs , and utility , rather than effort , is the measure of service . Society should , therefore , shape its policy so as to secure the maximum utility . It only remains to decide who shall determine the value of the individual 's service in industry . Shall it be determined by public officials who have no direct interest in the matter , or shall it be left to the judgment of those who receive the service ? As to which is the safer method , there can scarcely be a moment 's doubt . Granting all that may be said about the depravity of popular tastes and the whimsicalities of fashion , of the maltreatment of the genius and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be said about the insolence of office , and the arbitrariness and stupidity of public officials , elective as well as hereditary . Obviously no one is ins so good is position to appraise the value of a service as the one who is to receive it . His judgment or his taste may be perverted , but the same is equally likely in the case of any functionary to whom it may be entrusted . If the 738 How Ought Wealth to he Distributed individual is to be left free to ! missile his own interest in the way of performing service , it seems to follow necessarily that he must also be left free to pursue his own interest in the way of securing the services of others . In other words , freedom of consumption is as essential as freedom of production ; freedom to accept or reject an service is its essential as freedom to serve or refrain from serving . There is only one way by Which this result can be secured , and that is to allow the producer and consumer to come together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as men are self-interested , this will fivimently result in baud bargaining , and sometimes in injustice ; but it is much less likely to result in injustice than ally system of paternalism , or any other arrangement . by which the value of a service is determined by some One else than the person who receives it . Assuming that the parties are of mature age and sound mind , that neither party is allowed to use force or violence or any other form of compulsion , and assuming further ( which may seem revolutionary ) that all liars , or those who practice deception be offering shoddy and adulterated goods , shall be treated like the counterfeiter and the gold-brick man , and that neither party is given a lend or political advantage over the other lei Ihr way of protective ditties or other toitilir discriminations , this system is sah ? r Ihim any other . Under this system , tint ; , e guarded , the tendency will be for c , eri ? one to get about what he is worth . Any analysis of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiers competition in the proper sense of word exists , substantial justice accoriiiiie to the democratic , or liberalistic , theory is secured . It has been the purpose of this paper to show that the full realization ? ? I this theory of distributive justice secure the highest possible well-being of society , so far as that is dependent ripen legal control . It goes without saying IIuil we are very far from a full realisation of this ideal ; but this at least reveals the real work of the social reformer . The reformer who works toward the fuller realization of the principle of distribution according to worth , usefulness , or service will be working in harmony with the laws of social progress , and his labors will , therefore , be effective . Otherwise , he will be attempting to turn society backward , or to shunt it oil on a sidetrack.
