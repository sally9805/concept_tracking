txt // his Saxon translations and his Saxon verses to the common level ; and we have seen that his effort , like that of Charlemagne , was fruitless . There was an impassable wall between the old learned literature and the present chaotic barbarism . I u ( . apable , yet compelled , to fit into the ancient mould , they gave it a twist . Unable to reproduce ideas , they reproduced a metre . They tried to eclipse their rivals in versification by the refinement of their composition , and the prestige of a difficulty overcome . So , in our own colleges , the good scholars imitate the clever divisions and symmetry of Claudian rather than the ease and variety of Virgil . They put their feet in irons , and showed their smartness by running in shackles ; they weighted themselves with rules of modern rhyme and rules of ancient metre ; they added the necessity of beginning each verse with the same letter that began the last . A few , like Adhelm , wrote square acrostics , in which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also to the left and right of the piece . Thus made up of the first and last letters of each verse , it forms a border to the whole piece , and the morsel of verse is like a piece of tapestry . Strange literary tricks , which changed the poet into an artisan . They bear witness to the difficulties which then impeded culture and nature , and spoiled at once the Latin form and the Saxon genius . Beyond this barrier , which drew an impassable line between civilisation and barbarism , there was another , no less impassable , between the Latin and Saxon genius . The strong German imagination , in which glowing and obscure visions suddenly meet and abruptly overflow , was in contrast with the reasoning spirit , in which ideas gather and are developed only in a regular order ; so // that if the barbarian , in his classical attempts , retained any part of his primitive instincts , he succeeded only in producing a grotesque and frightful monster . One of them this very Adhelm , a relative of King Ina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alternately , too much imbued with Saxon poesy , simply to imitate the antique models , adorned his Latin prose and verse with all the " English magnificence. " 1 You might compare him to a barbarian who seizes a flute from the skilled hands of a player of Augustus ' court , in order to blow on it with inflated lungs , as if it were the bellowing horn of an aurochs . The sober speech of the Roman orators and senators becomes in his hands full of exaggerated and incoherent images ; he violently connects words , uniting them in a sudden and extravagant manner ; he heaps up his colours , and utters extraordinary and unintelligible nonsense , like that of the later Skalds ; in short , he is a latinised Skald , dragging into his new tongue the ornaments of Scandinavian poetry , such as alliteration , by dint of which he congregates in one of his epistles fifteen consecutive words , all beginning with the same letter ; and in order to make up his fifteen , he introduces a barbarous Graecism amongst the Latin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legends , you will meet many times with deformation of Latin , distorted by the outburst of a too vivid imagination ; it breaks out even in their scholastic and scientific writing . Here is part of a dialogue between Alcuin and prince Pepin , a son of Charlemagne , // and he uses like formulas the little poetic and bold phrases which abound in the national poetry . " What is winter ? the banishment of summer . What is spring ? the painter of the earth . What is the year ? the world 's chariot . What is the sun ? the splendour of the world , the beauty of heaven , the grace of nature , the honour of day , the distributor of the hours . What is the sea ? the path of audacity , the boundary of the earth , the receptacle of the rivers , the fountain of showers . " More , he ends his instructions with enigmas , in the spirit of the Skalds , such as we still find in the old manuscripts with the barbarian songs . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it labours to understand a matter , neglects dry , clear , consecutive deduction , to employ grotesque , remote , of't repeated imagery , and replaces analysis by intuition . VIII . Such was this race , the last born of the sister races , which , in the decay of the other two , the Latin and the Greek , brings to the world a new civilisation , with a new character and genius . Inferior to these in many respects , it surpasses them in not a few . Amidst the woods and mire and snows , under a sad , inclement sky , gross instincts have gained the day during this long barbarism . The German has not acquired gay humour , unreserved facility , the feeling for harmonious beauty ; his great phlegmatic body continues savage and stiff , greedy and brutal ; his rude and unpliable mind is still inclined to savagery , and restive under culture . Dull and congealed , his ideas can not expand with facility and freedom , with a natural sequence and an instinctive regularity . But this spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is all the more apt for the sentiment of the true . The deep and incisive impression which he receives from contact with objects , and which as yet he can only express by a cry , will afterwards liberate him from the Latin rhetoric , and will vent itself on things rather than on words . Moreover , under the constraint of climate and solitude , by the habit of resistance and effort , his ideal is changed . Manly and moral instincts have gained the empire over him ; and amongst them the need of independence , the disposition for serious and strict manners , the inclination for devotion and veneration , the worship of heroism . Here are the foundations and the elements of a civilisation , slower but sounder , less careful of what is agreeable and elegant , more based on justice and truth ) . Hitherto at least the race is intact , intact in its primitive coarseness ; the Roman cultivation could neither develop nor deform it . If Christianity took root , it was owing to natural affinities , but it produced no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conquest , which is to bring this time men , as well as ideas . The Saxons , meanwhile , after the wont of German races , vigorous and fertile , have within the past six centuries multiplied enormously . They were now about two millions , and the Norman army numbered sixty thousand . ' In vain 94 - THE SOURCE . BOOK I , these Normans become transformed , gallicised ; by their origin , and substantially in themselves they are still the relatives of those whom they conquered . In vain they imported their manners and their poesy , and introduced into the language a third part of its words ; this language continues altogether German in element and in substance . ' Though the grammar changed , it changed integrally , by an internal action , in the same sense as its continental cognates . At the end of three hundred years the conquerors themselves were conquered ; their speech became English ; and owing to frequent intermarriage , the English blood ended by gaining the predominance over the Norman blood in their veins . The race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the Conquest , it is as a river disappears , and flows for a while underground . An five centuries it will emerge once more . ' // CHAPTER II . I. A CENTURY and a half had passed on the Continent since , amid the universal decay and dissolution , a new society had been formed , and new men had risen up . Brave men had at length made a stand against the Norsemen and the robbers . They had planted their feet in the soil , and the moving chaos of the general subsidence had become fixed by the effort of their great hearts and of their arms . At the mouths of the rivers , in the defiles of the mountains , on the margin of the waste borders , at all perilous passes , they had built forts , each for himself , each on his own land , each with his faithful band ; and they had lived like a scattered but watchful army , encamped and confederate in their castles , sword in hand , in front of the enemy . Beneath this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in strong bodies , l intolerant of restraint , // longing for violent deeds , born for constant warfare because steeped in permanent warfare , heroes and robbers , who , as an escape from their solitude , plunged into adventures , and went , that they might conquer a country or win Paradise , to Sicily , to Portugal , to Spain , to Livonia , to Palestine , to England . 11 . On the 27th of September 10 66 , at the mouth of the Somme , there was a great sight to be seen : four hundred large sailing vessels , more than a thousand transports , and sixty thousand men , were on the point of embarking . ' The sun shone splendidly after long rain ; trumpets sounded , the cries of this armed multitude rose to heaven ; as far as the eye could see , on the shore , in the wide-spreading river on the sea which opens out thence broad and shining , masts and sails extended like a forest ; the enormous fleet set out wafted by the south wind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come from Norway , and they might have been taken for kinsmen of the Saxons , with whom they were to fight ; but there were with them a multitude of adventurers , crowding from all quarters , far and near , from north and south , from Maine and Anjou , from Poitou and Brittany , from Ile-de-France and Flanders , from Aquitaine and Burgundy ; 3 and , in short , the expedition itself was French . // How comes it that , having kept its name , it had changed its nature ? and what series of renovations had made a Latin out of a German people ? The reason is that this people , when they came to Neustria , were neither a national body , nor a pure race . They were but a band ; and as such , marrying the women of the country , they introduced foreign blood into their children . They were a Scandinavian band , but swelled by all the bold knaves and all the wretched desperadoes who wandered about the conquered country : 1 and as such they received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nomadic band was mixed , the settled band was much more so ; and peace by its transfusions , like war by its recruits , had changed the character of the primitive blood . When Rollo , having divided the land amongst his followers , hung the thieves and their abettors , people from every country gathered to him . Security , good stern justice , ' were so rare , that they were enough to re-people a land . ' He invited strangers , say the old writers , " and made one people out of so many folk of different natures . " This assemblage of barbarians , refugees , robbers , immigrants , spoke Romance or French so quickly , that the second Duke , wishing to have his son taught Danish , had to send him to Bayeux , where it was still spoken . The great masses always form the race in the end , and generally the genius and language . Thus this people , so transformed , quickly became polished ; the composite race showed itself of a // ready genius , far more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their neighbours of Picardy , Champagne , and Ile-de-France . " The Saxons , " says an old writer , ' " vied with each other in their drinking feats , and wasted their income by day and night in feasting , whilst they lived in wretched hovels ; the French and Normans , on the other hand , living inexpensively in their fine large houses , were besides refined in their food and studiously careful in their dress . " The former , still weighted by the German phlegm , were gluttons and drunkards , now and then aroused by poetical enthusiasm ; the latter , made sprightlier by their transplantation and their alloy , felt the cravings of the mind already making themselves manifest . " You might see amongst them churches in every village , and monasteries iii the cities , towering on high , and built in a style unknown before , " first in Normandy , and later in England. - Taste had come to them at once ? that is , the desire to please the eye , and to express a thought by outward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circular arch was raised on one or on a cluster of columns ; elegant mouldings were placed about the windows ; the rose window made its appearance , simple yet , like the flower which gives it its name " rose des Intissons ; " and the Norman style unfolded itself , original yet proportioned between the Gothic , whose richness it foreshadowed , and the Romance , whose solidity it recalled . With taste , just as natural and just as quickly , was developed the spirit of inquiry . Nations are like // children ; with some the tongue is readily loosened , and they comprehend at once ; with others it is loosened with difficulty , and they are slow of comprehension . The men we are here speaking of had educated themselves nimbly , as Frenchmen do . They were the first in France who unravelled the language , regulating it and writing it so well , that to this day we understand their codes and their poems . In a century and a half they were so far cultivated as to find the Saxons " unlettered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made for banishing them from the abbeys and all valuable ecclesiastical offices . And , in fact , this excuse was rational , for they instinctively hated gross stupidity , Between the Conquest and the death of King John , they established five hundred and fifty-seven schools in England . Henry Beauclerk , son of the Conqueror , was trained in the sciences ; so were Henry IL and his three sons : Richard , the eldest of these , was a poet . Lanfranc , first Norman Archbishop of Canterbury , a subtle logician , ably argued the Real Presence ; Anselm , his successor , the first thinker of the age , thought he had discovered a new proof of the existence of God , and tried to make religion philosophical by adopting as his maxim , " Crede ut intelligas . " The notion was doubtless grand , especially in the eleventh century ; and they could not have gone more promptly to work . Of course the science I speak of was but scholastic , and these terrible folios slay more understandings than they confirm . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even in Latin , even in theology , is yet an exercise of the mind and a proof of the understanding . Among the continental priests who settled in i // England , one established a library ; another , founder of a school , made the scholars perform the play of Saint Catherine ; a third wrote in polished Latin , " epigrams as pointed as those of Martial . " Such were the recreations of an intelligent race , eager for ideas , of ready and flexible genius , whose clear thought was not clouded , like that of the Saxon brain , by drunken hallucinations , and the vapours of a greedy and wellfilled stomach . They loved conversations , tales of adventure . Side by side with their Latin chroniclers , Henry of Huntingdon , William of Malmesbury , thoughtful men already , who could not only relate , but criticise here and there , there were rhyming chronicles in the vulgar tongue , as those of Geoffroy Gaimar , Benoit de Sainte-Maure , Robert Wace . Do not imagine that their verse-writers were sterile of words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , speakers above all , ready of tongue , and never stinted in speech . Not singers by any means ; they speak ? this is their strong point , in their poems as in their chronicles . They were the earliest who wrote the Song of Roland ; upon this they accumulated a multitude of songs concerning Charlemagne and his peers , concerning Arthur and Merlin , the Greeks and Romans , Bing Horn , Guy of Warwick , every prince and every people . Their minstrels ( trouveres ) , like their knights , draw in abundance from Welsh , Franks , and Latins , and descend upon East and West , in the wide field of adventure . They address themselves to a spirit of inquiry , as the Saxons to enthusiasm , and dilute in their long , clear , and flowing narratives the lively colours of German and Breton traditions ; battles , surprises , single combats , embassies , speeches , processions , ceremonies . huntings , // a variety of amusing events , employ their ready and wandering imaginations . At first , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ check ; it walks with long strides , but only walks . Presently its wings have grown ; incidents are multiplied ; giants and monsters abound , the natural disappears , the song of the jonyleur grows a poem under the hands of the trouvere ; he would speak , like Nestor of old , five , even six years running , and not grow tired or stop . Forty thousand verses are not too much to satisfy their gabble ; a facile mind , copious , inquisitive , descriptive , such is the genius of the race . The Gauls , their fathers , used to delay travellers on the road to make them tell their stories , and boasted , like these , " of fighting well and talking with ease . " With chivalric poetry , they are not wanting in chivalry ; principally , it may be , because they are strong , and a strong man loves to prove his strength by knocking down his neighbours ; but also from a desire of fame , and as a point of honour . By this one word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poets painted war as a murderous fury , as a blind madness which shook flesh and blood , and awakened the instincts of the beast of prey ; Norman poets describe it as a tourney . The new passion which they introduce is that of vanity and gallantry ; Guy of Warwick dismounts all the knights in Europe , in order to deserve the hand of the prude and scornful Felice . The tourney itself is but a ceremony , somewhat brutal I admit , since it turns upon the breaking of arms and limbs , but yet brilliant and French . To show skill and courage , display the magnificence of dress and armour , be applauded by and please the ladies , ? such // feelings indicate men of greater sociality , more under the influence of public opinion , less the slaves of their own passions , void both of lyric inspiration and savage enthusiasm , gifted by a different genius , because inclined to other pleasures . Such were the men who at this moment were disembarking in England to introduce their new manners and a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though with special and provincial features ; of all the most matter-of-fact , with an eye to the main chance , calculating , having the nerve and the dash of our own soldiers , but with the tricks and precautions of lawyers , heroic undertakers of profitable enterprises ; having gone to Sicily and Naples , and ready to travel to Constantinople or Antioch , so it be to take a country or bring back money ; subtle politicians , accustomed in Sicily to hire themselves to the highest bidder , and capable of doing a stroke of business in the heat of the Crusade , like Bohemond , who , before Antioch , speculated on the dearth of his Christian allies , and would only open the town to them under condition of their keeping it for himself ; methodical and persevering conquerors , expert in administration , and fond of scribbling on paper , like this very William , who was able to organise such an expedition , and such an army , and kept a written roll of the same , and who proceeded to register the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the disembarkation , the contrast between the two nations was manifested at Hastings by its visible effects . The Saxons " ate and drank the whole night . You might have seen them struggling much , and leaping and // singing , " with shouts of laughter and noisy joy.l In the morning they packed behind their palisades the dense masses of their heavy infantry , and with battle-axe hung round their neck awaited the attack . The wary Normans weighed the chances of heaven and hell , and tried to enlist God upon their side . Robert Wace , their historian and compatriot , is no more troubled by poetical imagination than they were by warlike inspiration ; and on the eve of the battle his mind is as prosaic and clear as theirs . ' The same spirit showed itself in the battle . They were for the most part bowmen and horsemen , wellskilled , nimble , and clever . Taillefer , the jongleur , who asked for the honour of striking the first blow , went singing , like a true French volunteer , performing tricks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he 1 // cast his lance three times in the air , then his sword , and caught them again by the handle ; and Harold 's clumsy foot-soldiers , who only knew how to cleave coats of mail by blows from their battle-axes , " were astonished , saying to one another that it was magic . " As for William , amongst a score of prudent and cunning actions , he per- - formed two well-calculated ones , which , in this sore embarrassment , brought him safe out of his difficulties . He ordered his archers to shoot into the air ; the arrows wounded many of the Saxons in the face , and one of them pierced Harold in the eye , After this he simulated flight ; the Saxons , intoxicated with joy and wrath , quitted their entrenchments , and exposed themselves to the lances of his horsemen . During the remainder of the contest they only make a stand by small companies , fight with fury , and end by being slaughtered . The strong , mettlesome , brutal race threw themselves on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunters wounded them adroitly , knocked them down , and placed them under the yoke . III . What then is this French race , which by arms and letters makes such a splendid entrance upon the world , and is so manifestly destined to rule , that in the East , for example , their name of Franks will be given to all the nations of the West ? Wherein consists this new spirit , this precocious pioneer , this key of all middleage civilisation ? There is in every mind of the kind // a fundamental activity which , when incessantly repeated , moulds its plan , and gives it its direction ; in town or country , cultivated or not , in its infancy and its age , it spends its existence and employs its energy in conceiving an event or an object . This is its original and perpetual process ; and whether it change its region , return , advance , prolong , or alter its course , its whole motion is but a series of consecutive steps ; so that the least alteration in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transforms and regulates the whole course , as in a tree the structure of the first shoot determines the whole foliage , and governs the whole growth . ' When the Frenchman conceives an event or an object , he conceives quickly and distinctly ; there is no internal disturbance , no previous fermentation of confused and violent ideas , which , becoming concentrated and elaborated , end in a noisy outbreak . The movement of his intelligence is nimble and prompt like that of his limbs ; at once and without effort he seizes upon his idea . But he seizes that alone ; he leaves on one side all the long entangling offshoots whereby it is entwined and twisted amongst its neighbouring ideas ; he does not embarrass himself with nor think of them ; he detaches , plucks , touches but slightly , and that is all . He is deprived , or if you prefer it , he is exempt from those sudden half-visions which disturb a man , and open up to him instantaneously vast deeps and far perspectives . Images are excited by internal commotion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He is only moved superficially ; he is without large sympathy ; he does not perceive an object as it is , complex and combined , but in parts , with // a discursive and superficial knowledge . That is why no race in Europe is less poetical . Let us look at their epics ; none are more prosaic . They are not wanting in number : The Song of Roland , Garin is Loherain , Ogier is Danois , ' B'erthe aux grands Pieds . There is a library of them . Though their manners are heroic and their spirit fresh , though they have originality , and deal with grand events , yet , spite of this , the narrative is as dull as that of the babbling Norman chroniclers . Doubtless when Homer relates he is as clear as they are , and he develops as they do : but his magnificent titles of rosy-fingered Morn , the wide-bosomed Air , the divine and nourishing Earth , the earth-shaking Ocean , come in every instant and expand their purple bloom over the speeches and battles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a people more inclined to enjoy beauty than to proceed straight to fact . But here we have facts , always facts , nothing but facts ; the Frenchman wants to know if the hero will kill the traitor , the lover wed the maiden ; he must not be delayed by poetry or painting . He advances nimbly to the end of the story , not lingering for dreams of the heart or wealth of landscape . There is no splendour , no colour , in his narrative ; his style is quite bare , and without figures ; you may read ten thousand verses in these old poems without meeting one . Shall we open the most ancient , the most original , the most eloquent , at the most moving point , the Sony of Roland , when Roland is dying ? The narrator is moved , and yet his language remains the same , smooth , accentless , so penetrated by the prosaic spirit , and so void of the poetic ! He gives an abstract of motives , a summary of events , a series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for consolation . ' Nothing more . These men regard the circumstance or the action by itself , and adhere to this view . Their idea remains exact , clear , and simple , and does not raise up a similar image to be confused with the first , to colour or transform itself . It remains dry ; they conceive // the divisions of the object one by one , without ever collecting them , as the Saxons would , in an abrupt impassioned , glowing semi-vision . Nothing is more opposed to their genius than the genuine songs and profound hymns , such as the English monks were singing beneath the low vaults of their churches . They would be dis-. concerted by the unevenness and obscurity of such language . They are not capable of such an access of enthusiasm and such excess of emotion . They never cry out , they speak , or rather they converse , and that at moments when the soul , overwhelmed by its , trouble might be expected to cease thinking and feeling . Thus Amis , in a mystery-play , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his two sons , in order that their blood may heal hint of his leprosy ; and Amille replies still more calmly , ' I f ever they try to sing , even in heaven , " a roundelay high and clear , " they will produce little rhymed arguments , as dull as the dullest talk.2 // Pursue this literature to its conclusion ; regard it , like that of the Skalds , at the time of its decadence , when its vices , being exaggerated , display , like those of the Skalds , only still more strongly the kind of mind which produced it . The Skalds fall off into nonsense ; it loses itself into babble and platitude . The Saxon could not master his craving for exaltation ; the Frenchman could not restrain the volubility of his tongue . He is too diffuse and too clear ; the Saxon is too obscure and brief . The one was excessively agitated and carried away ; the other explains and develops without measure . From the twelfth century the Gestes spun out degenerate into rhapsodies and psalmodies of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; poetry becomes an interminable , intolerable litany , where the ideas , expounded , developed , and repeated ad infinitum , without one outburst of emotion or one touch of originality , flow like a clear and insipid stream , and send off their reader , by dint of their monotonous rhymes , into a comfortable slumber . What a deplorable abundance of distinct and facile ideas ! We meet with it again in the seventeenth century , in the literary gossip which took place at the feet of men of distinction ; it is the fault and the talent of the race . With this involuntary art of perceiving , and isolating instantaneously and clearly each part of every object , people can speak , even for speaking 's sake , and for ever . Such is the primitive process ; how will it be continued ? Here appears a new trait in the French genius , the most valuable of all . It is necessary to comprehension that the second idea shall be contiguous to the first ; otherwise that genius is thrown out of its course and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // it must walk step by step , on a straight road ; order is innate in it ; without study , and in the first place , it disjoints and decomposes the object or event , however complicated and entangled it may be , and sets the parts one by one in succession to each other , according to their natural connection . True , it is still in a state of barbarism ; yet its intelligence is a reasoning faculty ; which spreads , though unwittingly . Nothing is more clear than the style of the old French narratives and of the earliest poems : we do not perceive that we are following a narrator , so easy is the gait , so even the road he opens to us , so smoothly and gradually every idea glides into the next ; and this is why he narrates so well . The chroniclers Villehardouin , Joinville , Froissart , the fathers of prose , have an ease and clearness approached by none , and beyond all , a charm , a grace , which they had not to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national possession in France , and springs from the native delicacy which has a horror of incongruities ; the instinct of Frenchmen avoids violent shocks in works of taste as well as in works of argument ; they desire that their sentiments and ideas shall harmonise , and not clash . Throughout they have this measured spirit , exquisitely refined . ' They take care , on a sad subject , not to push emotion to its limits ; they avoid big words . Think how Joinville relates in six lines the death of the poor sick priest who wished to finish celebrating the mass , and " never more did sing , and died . " Open a mysteryplay , Theophilus , or that of the Queen of Hungary , for instance : when they are going to burn her and her child , she says two short lines about " this gentle dew which is so pure an innocent , " nothing more . Take a fabliau , . // even a dramatic one : when the penitent knight , who has undertaken to fill a barrel with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asks from him only one last gift : Do but embrace me , and then I 'll die in the arms of my friend . " Could a more touching sentiment be expressed in more sober language ? We must say of their poetry what is said of certain pictures : This is made out of nothing . Is there in the world anything more delicately graceful than the verses of Guillaume de Lorris ? Allegory clothes his ideas so as to dim their too great brightness ; ideal figures , half transparent , float about the lover , luminous , yet in a cloud , and lead him amidst all the gentle and delicate-hued ideas to the rose , whose " sweet odour embalms all the plain . " This refinement goes so far , that in Thibaut of Champagne and in Charles of Orleans it turns to affectation and insipidity . In them all impressions grow more slender ; the perfume is so weak , that one often fails to catch it ; on their knees before their lady they whisper their waggeries and conceits ; they love politely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " painted words , " all the flowers of " fresh and beautiful language ; " they know how to mark fleeting ideas in their flight , soft melancholy , vague reverie ; they are as elegant as talkative , and as charming as the most amiable abbes of the eighteenth century . This lightness of touch is proper to the race , and appears as plainly under the armour and amid the massacres of the middle ages as amid the courtsies and the muskscented , wadded coats of the last court . You will find it in their colouring as in their sentiments . They are not struck by the magnificence of nature , they see only her pretty side ; they paint the beauty of a woman by // a single feature , which is only polite , saying , " She is more gracious than the rose in May . " They do not experience the terrible emotion , ecstasy , sudden oppression of heart which is displayed in the poetry of neighbouring nations ; they say discreetly , " She began to smile , which vastly became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a descriptive humour , " that she had a sweet and perfumed breath , " and a body " white as new-fallen snow on a branch . " They do not aspire higher ; beauty pleases , but does not transport them . They enjoy agreeable emotions , but are not fitted for deep sensations . The full rejuvenescence of being , the warm air of spring which renews and penetrates all existence , suggests but a pleasing couplet ; they remark in passing , " Now is winter gone , the hawthorn blossoms , the rose expands , " and so pass on about their business . I t is a light gladsomeness , soon gone , like that which an April landscape affords . For an instant the author glances at the mist of the streams rising about the willow trees , the pleasant vapour which imprisons the brightness of the morning ; then , humming a burden of a song , he returns to his narrative . He seeks amusement , and herein lies his power . In life , as in literature , it is pleasure he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is lively , not voluptuous ; dainty , not a glutton . He takes love for a pastime , not for an intoxication . It is a pretty fruit which he plucks , tastes , and leaves . And we must remark yet further , that the best of the fruit in his eyes is the fact of its being forbidden . He says to himself that he is duping a husband , that " he deceives a cruel woman , and thinks he ought to obtain a pope 's indulgence for the deed . " i He wishes // to be Merry ? it is the state he prefers , the end and aim of his life ; and especially to laugh at other people . The , short verse of his fabliaux gambols and leaps like a schoolboy released from school , over all things respected or respectable ; criticising the church , women , the great , the monks . Scoffers , banterers , our fathers have abundance both of expression and matter ; and the matter comes to them so naturally , that without culture , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raillery as the most refined . They touch upon ridicule lightly , they mock without emphasis , as it were innocently ; their style is so harmonious , that at first sight we make a mistake , and do not see any harm in it . They seem artless ; they look so very demure ; only a word shows the imperceptible smile : it is the ass , for example , which they call the high priest , by reason of his padded cassock and his serious air , and who gravely begins " to play the organ . " At the close of the history , the delicate sense of comicality has touched you , though you can not say how . They do not call things by their names , especially in love matters ; they let you guess it ; they assume that you are as sharp and knowing as themselves . ' A man might discriminate , embellish at times , perhaps refine upon them , but their first traits are incomparable . When the fox approaches the raven to steal the cheese , he begins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the family . Ile calls the raven his " good father Don Rohart , who sings so well ; " he praises his voice , " so sweet and fine . " " You would be the best singer in the world if you Z // kept clear of nuts . " Reynard is a rogue , an artist in the way of invention , not a mere glutton ; he loves roguery for its own sake ; he rejoices in his superiority , and draws out his mockery . When Tibert , the cat , by his counsel hung himself at the bell rope , wishing to ring it , he uses irony , enjoys and relishes it , pretends . to wax impatient with the poor fool whom he has caught , calls him proud , complains because the other does not answer , and because he wishes to rise to the clouds and visit the saints . And from beginning to end this long epic of Reynard the Fox is the same ; the raillery never ceases , and never fails to be agreeable . Reynard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything . The necessity for laughter is national ? so indigenous to the French , that a stranger can not understand , and is shocked by it . This pleasure does not resemble physical joy in any respect , which is to be despised for its grossness ; on the contrary , it sharpens the intelligence , and brings to light many a delicate or ticklish idea . The fabliaux are full of truths about men , and still more about women , about people of low rank , and still more about those of high rank ; it is a method of philosophising by stealth and boldly , in spite of conventionalism , and in opposition to the powers that be . This taste has nothing in common either with open satire , which is offensive because it is cruel ; on the contrary , it provokes good humour . We soon see that the jester is not ill-disposed , that he does not wish to wound : if he stings , it is as a bee , without venom ; an instant later he is not thinking of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an object of his pleasantry ; all he wishes is to keep up in himself and in us sparkling and pleasing ideas . Do we not see here in advance an abstract of CHAP . 11 THE NORMANS Zia the whole French literature , the incapacity for great poetry , the sudden and durable perfection of prose , the excellence of all the moods of conversation and eloquence , the reign and tyranny of taste and method , the art and theory of development and arrangement , the gift of being measured , clear , amusing , and piquant ? We have taught Europe how ideas fall into order , and which ideas are agreeable ; and this is what our Frenchmen of the eleventh century are about to teach their Saxons during five or six centuries , first with the lance , next with the stick , next with the birch . IV . Consider , then , this Frenchman or Norman , this man from Anjou or Maine , who in his well-knit coat of mail , with sword and lance , came to seek his fortune in England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and settled himself in it with his soldiers and comrades , gave them land , houses , the right of levying taxes , on condition of their fighting under him and for him , as men-at-arms , marshals , standard-bearers ; it was a league in case of danger . In fact , they were in a hostile and conquered country , and they have to maintain themselves . Each one hastened to build for himself a place of refuge , castle or fortress , ' well fortified , of solid stone , with narrow windows , strengthened with battlements , garrisoned by soldiers , pierced with loopholes . Then these men went to Salisbury , to the number of sixty thousand , all holders of land , having at least enough to maintain a man with horse or arms . There , placing their hands in William 's , they promised him fealty and assistance ; and the king 's edict declared that they must be all united and bound // together like brothers in arms , to defend and succour each other . They are an armed colony , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they make laws accordingly . When a Frenchman is found dead in any district , the inhabitants are to give up the murderer , or failing to do so , they must pay forty-seven marks as a. fine ; if the dead man is English , it rests with the people of the place to prove it by the oath of four near relatives of the deceased . They are to beware of killing a stag , boar , or fawn ; for an offence against the forest-laws they will lose their eyes . They have nothing of all their property assured to them except as alms , or on condition of paying tribute , or by taking the oath of allegiance . Here a free Saxon proprietor is made a body-slave on his own estate . ' Here a noble and rich Saxon lady feels on her shoulder the weight of the hand of a Norman valet , who is become by force her husband or her lover . There were Saxons of one sol , or of two sols , according to the sum which they gained for their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them on joint account , like an ox or an ass . One Norman abbot has his Saxon predecessors dug up , and their bones thrown without the gates . Another keeps men-at-arms , who bring his recalcitrant monks to reason by blows of their swords . Imagine , if you can , the pride of these new lords , conquerors , strangers , masters , nourished by habits of violent activity , and by the savagery , ignorance , and passions of feudal life . " They thought they might do whatsoever they pleased , " say the old chroniclers . " They shed blood indiscriminately , snatched the morsel of bread from the mouth of the wretched , and seized upon all the money , the goods , the land . " Thus " all the folk in the low country were // at great pains to seem hmnble before No Taille-bois , and only to address him with one knee on the ground ; but although they made a point of paying him every honour , and giving him all and more than all which they owed him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tormented , tortured , imprisoned them , set his dogs upon their cattle , . . . broke the legs and backbones of their beasts of burden , . . . and sent then to attack their servants on the road with sticks and swords . " ' The Normans would not and could not borrow any idea or custom from such boors ; 2 they despised them as coarse and stupid . They stood amongst them , as the Spaniards amongst the Americans in the sixteenth century , superior in force and culture , more versed in letters , more expert in the arts of luxury . They preserved their manners and their speech . England , to all outward appearance  --   --  the court of the king , the castles of the nobles , the palaces of the bishops , the houses of the wealthy ? was French ; and the Scandinavian people , of whom sixty years ago the Saxon kings used to have poems sung to them , thought that the nation had forgotten its language , and treated it in their laws as though it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literature , then , which was at this time domiciled across the channel , ' and the conquerors tried to make it purely French , purged from all Saxon alloy . They made such a point of this , that the nobles in the reign of Henry II . sent their sons to France , to // preserve them from barbarisms . " For two hundred years , " says Higden , ' " children in stole , agenst the usage and rnanir of all other nations beeth compelled for to leve hire own langage , and for to construe hir lessons and hire thynges in Frensche . " The statutes of the universities obliged the students to converse , either in French or Latin . " Gentilmen children beech taught to speke Frensche from the tyme that they bith rokked in hire cradell ; and uplondissche men will likne himself to gentylmen , and fondeth with greet besynesse for to speke Frensche . " Of course the poetry is French . The Norman brought his minstrel with him ; there was Taillefer , the jongleur , who sang the Song @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adeline , the jon , Iii'nse , who received an estate in the partition which followed the Conquest . The Norman who ridiculed the Saxon kings , who dug up the Saxon saints , and cast there without the walls of the church , loved none but French ideas and verses . It was into French verse that Robert Wace rendered the legendary history of the England which was conquered , and the actual history of the Normandy in which lie continued to live . Enter one of the abbeys where the minstrels come to sing , " where the clerks after dinner and supper read poems , the chronicles of kingdoms , the wonders of the world , you will only find Latin or French verses , Latin or French prose . What becomes // of English ? Obscure , despised , we hear it no more , except in the mouths of degraded franklins , outlaws of the forest , swineherds , peasants , the lowest , orders . It is no longer , or scarcely written ; gradually we find in the Saxon chronicle that the idiom alters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century after the Conquest.l The people who have leisure or security enough to read or write are French ; for them authors devise and compose ; literature always adapts itself to the taste of those who can appreciate and pay for it . Even the English ' endeavour to write in French : thus Robert Grostete , in his allegorical poem on Christ ; Peter Langtoft , in his Chronicle of England , and in his Life of Thomas et Becket ; Hugh de Rotheland , in his poem of Hippomedon ; John Hoveden , and many others . Several write the first half of the verse in English , and the second in French ; a strange sign of the ascendency which is moulding and oppressing them . Even in the fifteenth century , ' many of these poor folk are employed in this task ; French is the language of the court , from it arose all poetry and elegance ; he is but a clodhopper who is inapt at that style . They apply themselves to it as our old scholars did to Latin verses ; they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sort of fear , knowing well that they are but schoolboys and provincials . ( rower , one of their best poets , at the end of his French works , excuses himself humbly for not having " de Francois la faconde . Pardonnez moi , " lie says , " que de ce je forsvoie ; je suis Anglais. " // And yet , after all , neither the race nor the tongue has perished . It is necessary that the Norman should learn English , in order to command his tenants ; his Saxon wife speaks it to him , and his sons receive it from the lips of their nurse ; the contagion is strong , for he is obliged to send them to France , to preserve . them from the jargon which on his domain threatens to overwhelm and spoil them . From generation to generation the contagion spreads ; they breathe it in the air , with the foresters in the chase , the farmers in the field , the sailors on the ships : for these coarse people , shut in by their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign language ; by the simple weight of their dulness they impose their idiom on their conquerors , at all events such words as pertain to living things . Scholarly speech , the language of law , abstract and philosophical expressions , ? in short , all words depending on reflection and culture may be French , since there is nothing to prevent it . This is just what happens ; these kind of ideas and this kind of speech are not understood by the commonalty , who , not being able to touch them , can not change them . This produces a French , a colonial French , doubtless perverted , pronounced with closed mouth , with a contortion of the organs of speech , " after the school of Stratford-atte-Bow ; " yet it is still French . On the other hand , as regards the speech employed about common actions and visible objects , it is the people , the Saxons , who fix it ; these living words are too firmly rooted in his experience to allow of being parted with , and thus the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , we have the Norman who , slowly and constrainedly , speaks and understands English , a deformed , gallicised English , yet English , in sap and root ; // but he has taken his time about it , for it has required two centuries . It was only under Henry III . that the new tongue is complete , with the new constitution ; and that , after the like fashion , by alliance aid intermixture ; the burgesses come to take their seats in Parliament with the nobles , at the same time that Saxon words settle down in the language side by side with French words . v. So was modern English formed , by compromise , and the necessity of being understood . But we can well imagine that these nobles , even while speaking the rising dialect , have their hearts full of French tastes and ideas ; France remains the home of their mind , and the literature which now begins , is but translation . Translators , copyists , imitators ? there is nothing else . England is a distant province , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty years ago , to Europe : she exports her wool , and imports her ideas . Open the Voyage and Travaile of Sir John Maundeville , 1 the oldest prosewriter , the Villehardouin of the country : his book is but the translation of a translation . ' He writes first in Latin , the language of scholars ; then in French , the // language of society ; finally he reflects , and discovers that the barons , his compatriots , by governing the Saxon churls , have ceased to speak their own Norman , and that the rest of the nation never knew it ; he translates his manuscript into English , and , in addition , takes care to make it plain , feeling that he speaks to less ex-. panded understandings . He says in French : ? " I1 advint une fois que Mahomet allait clans une chapelle ou it y avait un saint ermite . I1 entra en la chapelle ou it y avait une petite huisserie et basse , et ? tait bien petite la chapelle ; et alors devint la porte si @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He stops , corrects himself , wishes to explain himself better for his readers across the Channel , and says in English : ? " And at the Desertes of Arabye , he wente into a Chapelle where a Eretnyte duelte . And whan he entred in to the Chapelle that was but a lytille and a low thing , and had but a lytill Dore and a low , than the Entree began to wexe so gret and so large , and so highe , as though it had ben of a gret Myustre , or the Zate of a Paleys. " i You perceive that he amplifies , and thinks himself bound to clinch and drive in three or four times in succession the same idea , in order to get it into an English brain ; his thought is drawn out , dulled , spoiled in the process . Like every copy , the new literature is mediocre , and repeats what it imitates , with fewer merits and greater faults . Let us see , then , what our Norman baron gets translated for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robert Wace , which consist of the fabulous history of England continued up to their day , a dull-rhymed rhapsody , turned into English in a rhapsody no less dull . The first Englishman who attempts it is Layamon , ' a monk of Ernely , still fettered in the old idiom , who sometimes happens to rhyme , sometimes fails , altogether barbarous and childish , unable to develop a continuous idea , babbling in little confused and incomplete phrases , after the fashion of the ancient Saxons ; after him a monk , Robert of Gloucester , ' and a canon , Robert of // Brunne , both as insipid and clear as their French models , having become gallicised , and adopted the significant characteristic of the race , namely , the faculty and habit of easy narration , of seeing moving spectacles without deep emotion , of writing prosaic poetry , of discoursing and developing , of believing that phrases ending in the same sounds form real poetry . Our honest English versifiers , like their preceptors in Normandy and Ile-de-France , garnished with rhymes their dissertations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ epoch , in fact , on the Continent , the whole learning of the schools descends into the street ; and Jean de Meung , in his poem of la Rose , is the most tedious of doctors . So in England , Robert of Brunne transposes into verse the Manuel des FM ices of Bishop Grostete ; Adam Davie , i certain Scripture histories ; Hampole 2 composes the Fricke of Conscience . The titles alone make one yawn : what of the text ? " Mankynde mad ys to do Goddus wylle , And alle Hys byddyngus to fulfille ; For of al Hys makyng more and les , Man most principal creature es . Al that He made for man hit was done , As ye schal here after Bone . " 3 There is a , poem ! You did not think so ; call it a sermon , if you will give it its proper name . It goes on , well divided , well prolonged , flowing , but void of mewing ; the literature which surrounds and resembles it bears witness of its origin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it by other and more agreeable // features . Here and there we find divergences more or less awkward into the domain of genius ; for instance , a ballad full of quips against Richard , King of the Romans , who was taken at the battle of Lewes . Sometimes , charm is not lacking , nor sweetness either . No one has ever spoken so bright and so well to the ladies as the French of the Continent , and they have not quite forgotten this talent while settling in England . You perceive it readily in the manner in which they celebrate the Virgin . Nothing could be more different from the Saxon sentiment , which is altogether biblical , than the chivalric adoration of the sovereign Lady , the fascinating Virgin and Saint , who was the real deity of the middle ages . It breathes in this pleasing hymn : " Blessed beo the , lavedi , Ful of hovene blisse ; Swete flur of parais , Moder of milternisse . . . . I-blessed beo the , Lavedi , So fair and so briht @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bi nicht . . . . Bricht and scene quen of storre , So me liht and lere . In this false fikele world , So me led and steore. " i There is but a short and easy step between this tender worship of the Virgin and the sentiments of the court of love . The English rhymesters take it ; and when they wish to praise their earthly mistresses , they borrow , here as elsewhere , the ideas and the very form of French Its THE SolrllCE . BOOK I. verse . One compares his lady to all kinds of precious stones and flowers ; others sing truly amorous songs , at times sensual : " Bytuene Mershe and Aueril , Wham spray biginneth to springe , The lute find bath hire wyl On hyre lud to synge , Ich libbe in louelonginge For semlokest of alle thynge . Ile may me blysse bringe , Icham iii hire baundoun . An bendy halo ichabbe yhent , Ichot from henene it is me sent . From alle wymmen my love is lent , And lyht on Alisoun. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the , of lone one speche , Whil y lyue in world so wyde other nulle y seche . With thy loue , my suete leof , mi bliss thou mihtes eche A suete cos of thy mouth mihte be my leche. " 2 Is not this the lively and warm imagination of the south ? they speak of springtime and of love , " the fine and lovely weather , " like trouvcres , even like troubadours . The dirty , smoke-grimed cottage , the black feudal castle , where all but the master lie higgledy-piggledy on the straw in the great stone hall , the cold rain , the muddy earth , make the return of the sun and the warm air delicious . " Sumer is i-cumen in , Lhude sing cuccn : Groweth sed , and bloweth med , And springeth the wde nu . // Sing cuccu , cuccu . Awe bleteth after lomb , Llouth after cable cu , Bulluc sterteth , bucke verteth : Murie sing cuccu , Cuccu , cuccu . Wel singes the cuccu ; Ne swik the nailer nu . Sing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glowing pictures , such as Guillaume de ' , orris was writing , at the same time , even richer and more lifelike , perhaps because the poet found here for inspiration t hat love of country life which in England is deep and national . Others , more imitative , attempt pleasantries like those of Rutebeuf and the fabliaux , frank quips , ' and even satirical loose waggeries . Their true aim and end is to hit out at the monks . In every French country or country which imitates France , the most manifest use of convents is to furnish material for sprightly and scandalous stories . One writes , for instance , of the kind of life the monks lead at the abbey of Cocague " There is a wel fair abbei , Of white monkes and of grei . Ther beth bowris and halles : Al of pasteiis beth the wallis , Of fleis , of fisse , and rich met , The likfullist that man may et . Fluren cakes beth the schingles able , Of cherehe , cloister , houre , and halle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and kinges . .. Though paradis be miri and bright Cokaigu is of fairir sight . . . . Another Abel is therbi , Forsoth a gret fair nunnerie . . . . When the someris dai is hote The young nunnes takith a bote . . And cloth ham forth in that river Both with ores and with stere . . . And euch monk him takith on , Aud snellich berrith forth bar prei To the mochil grei abbei , And techith the nunnes an oreisun , With iamblene up and down . " This is the triumph of gluttony and feeding . Moreover many things could be mentioned in the middle ages , which are now unmentionable . But it was the poems of chivalry which represented to him the bright side of his own mode of life , that the baron preferred to have translated . He desired that his trouvere should set before his eyes the magnificence which he displayed , and the luxury and enjoyments which he has introduced from France . Life at that time , without and even during war , was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When Henry II . travelled , he took with him a great number of horsemen , foot-soldiers , baggage-waggons , tents , pack-horses , comedian , courtesans , and their overseers , cooks , confectioners , posturemakers , dancers , barbers , go-betweens , hangers-on . ' In the morning when they start , the assemblage begins to shout , sing , hustle each other , make racket and rout , // " as if hell were let loose . " William Lougchamps , even . in time of peace , would not travel without a thousand horses by way of escort . When Archbishop h Becket came to France , he entered the town with two hundred knights , a number of barons and nobles , and an army of servants , all richly armed and equipped , he himself being provided with four-and-twenty suits ; two hundred and fifty children walked in front , singing national songs ; then dogs , then carriages , then a dozen packhorses , each ridden by an ape and a man ; then equerries with shields and war-horses ; then more equerries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priests ; lastly , the archbishop himself , with his private friends . Imagine these processions , and also these entertainments ; for the Normans , after the Conquest , " borrowed from the Saxons the habit of excess in eating and drinking . " ' At the marriage of Richard Plantagenet , Earl of Cornwall , they provided thirty thousand dishes . ' They also continued to be gallant , and punctiliously performed the great precept of the love courts ; for in the middle age the sense of love was no more idle than the others . Moreover , tournaments were plentiful ; a sort of opera prepared for their own entertainment . So ran their life , full of adventure and adornment , in the open air and in the sunlight , with show of cavalcades and arms ; they act a pageant , and act it with enjoyment . Thus the King of Scots , having come to London with a // hundred knights , at the coronation of Edward I. , they all dismounted , and made over their horses and superb caparisons to the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example . In the midst of war they took their pleasure . Edward III. , in one of his expeditions against the King of France , took with him thirty falconers , and made his campaign alternately hunting and fighting.1 Another time , says Froissart , the knights who joined the army carried a plaster over one eye , having vowed not to remove it until they had performed an exploit worthy of their mistresses . Out of the very exuberancy of spirit they practised the art of poetry ; out of the buoyancy of their imagination they made a sport of life . Edward III . built at Windsor a hall and a round table ; and at one of his tourneys in London , sixty ladies , seated on palfreys , led , as in a fairy tale , each her knight by a golden chain . Was not this the triumph of the gallant and frivolous French fashions ? Edward 's wife Philippa sat as a model to the artists for their Madonnas . She appeared on the field of battle ; listened to Froissart , who provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to listen to . " At once goddess , heroine , and scholar , and all this so agreeably , was she not a true queen of refined chivalry ? Now , as also in France under Louis of Orleans and the Dukes of Burgundy , this most elegant and romanesque civilisation came into full bloom , void of common sense , given up to passion , bent on pleasure , immoral and " brilliant , but , like its neighbours of Italy and Provence , for lack of serious intention , it could not last . Of all these marvels the narrators make display in // their stories . Here is a picture of the vessel which took the mother of King Richard into England ; " Swlk on ne seygh they never non ; All it was whyt of huel-bon , And every nayl with gold begrave : Off pure gold was the stave . Her mast was of yvory ; Off samy to the sayl wytterly . Her ropes wer off tuely sylk , Al so whyt as ony mylk . That noble schyp was al withoute , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her wyndas , Off asure forsothe it was . " ' On such subjects they never run dry . When the King of Hungary wishes to console his afflicted daughter , he proposes to take her to the chase in the following style : " To-morrow ye shall in hunting fare : And ride , my daughter , in a chair ; It shall be covered with velvet red , And cloths of fine gold all about your head , With damask white and azure blue , Well diapered with lilies new . Your pommels shall be ended with gold , Your chains enamelled many a fold , Your mantle of rich degree , Purple pall and ermine free . Jennets of Spain that ben so light , Trapped to the ground with velvet bright . Ye shall have harp , sautry , and song , And other mirths you among . // Ye shall have Romney and Malespine , Both hippocras and Vernage wine ; Montrese and wine of Greek , Both Algrade and despice eke , Antioch and Bastarde , Pyment also and garnarde ; Wine of Greek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , The reed your stomach to defy , And pots of osey set you by . You shall have venison ybake , The best wild fowl that may be take ; A leish of harehound with you to streek , And hart , and hind , and other like . Ye shall be set at such a tryst , That hart and hynd shall come to you fist , Your disease to drive you fro , To hear the bugles there yblow . Homeward thus shall ye ride , On hawking by the river 's side , With gosshawk and with gentle falcon , With bugle-horn and merlion . When you come home your menie among , Ye shall have revel , dance , and song ; Little children , great and small , Shall sing as does the nightingale . Then shall ye go to your evensong , With tenors and trebles among . Threescord of copes of damask bright , Full of pearls they shall be pight . Your censors shall be of gold , Indent with azure many a fold ; Your quire nor organ song shall want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organs playing , With young children full fain singing . // Then shall ye go to your supper , And sit in tents in green arber , With cloth of arras pight to the ground . With sapphires set of diamond . A hundred knights , truly told , Shall play with bowls in alleys cold , Your disease to drive away ; To see the fishes in pools play , To a drawbridge then shall ye , Th ' one half of stone , th ' other of tree ; A barge shall meet you full right , With twenty-four oars full bright , With trumpets and with clarion , The fresh water to row up and down . .. Forty torches burning bright At your bridge to bring you light . Into your chamber they shall you bring , With much mirth and more liking . Your blankets shall be of fustian , Your sheets shall be of cloth of Rennes . Your head sheet shall be of pery pight , With diamonds set and rubies bright . When you are laid in bed so soft , A cage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burning , And cloves that be sweet smelling . Frankincense and olibanum . That when ye sleep the taste may come ; And if ye no rest can take , All night minstrels for you shall wake . " ' Amid such fancies and splendours the poets delight and lose themselves ; and the woof , like the embroideries of their canvas , bears the mark of this love of deco- // ration . They weave it out of adventures , of extraordinary and surprising events . Now it is the life of King Horn , who , thrown into a boat when a lad , is wrecked upon the coast of England , and , becoming a knight , reconquers the kingdom of his father . Now it is the history of Sir Guy , who rescues enchanted knights , cuts down the giant Colbrand , challenges and kills the Sultan in his tent . It is not for Inc to recount these poems , which are not English , but only translations ; still , here as in France , there are many of them ; they fill the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exaggeration , until , falling to the lowest depth of insipidity and improbability , they are buried for ever by Cervantes . What would people say of a society which had no literature but the opera with its unrealities ? Yet it was a literature of this kind which formed the intellectual food of the middle ages . People then did not ask for truth , but entertainment , and that vehement and hollow , full of glare and startling events . They asked for impossible voyages , extravagant challenges , a racket of contests , a confusion of magnificence and entanglement of chances . For introspective history they had no liking , cared nothing for the adventures of the heart , devoted their attention to the outside . They remained children to the last , with eyes glued to a series of exaggerated and coloured images , and , for lack of thinking , did not perceive that they had learnt nothing . What was there beneath this fanciful dream ? Brutal and evil human passions , unchained at first by religious fury , then delivered up to their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as vile as ever . Look at the popular king , Richard Coeur de Lion , and reckon up his butcheries and murders : " King Richard , " // says a poem , " is the best king ever mentioned in song . " 1 I have no objection ; but if he has the heart of a lion , he has also that brute 's appetite . One day , under the walls of Acre , being convalescent , he had a great desire for some pork . There was no pork . They killed a young Saracen , fresh and tender , cooked and salted him , and the king ate him and found him very good ; whereupon he desired to see the head of the pig . The cook brought it in trembling . The king falls a laughing , and says the army has nothing to fear from famine , having provisions ready at hand . He takes the town , and presently Saladin 's ambassadors come to sue for pardon for the prisoners . Richard has thirty of the most noble beheaded , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one to each ambassador , with a ticket hearing the name and family of the dead man . Meanwhile , in their presence , he eats his own with a relish , bids them tell Saladin how the Christians make war , and ask him if it is true that they fear him . Then he orders the sixty thousand prisoners to be led into the plain : " They were led into the place full even . There they heard angels of heaven ; They said : " Seigneures , tuez , tuez Spares hem nought , and beheadeth these I " King Richard heard the angels ' voice , And thanked God and the holy cross . " Thereupon they behead them all . When he took a town , it was his wont to murder every one , even children and women . Such was the devotion of the middle ages , not only in romances , as here , but in history . At the 1 Warton , i. 123 : " In Fraunee these rhymes were wroht , Every Englyshe ne knew it not . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons , were massacred . Thus even in chivalrous stories the fierce and unbridled instincts of the bloodthirsty brute break out . The authentic narratives show it . Henry II . irritated at a page , attempted to tear out his eyes . ' John Lackland let twenty-three hostages die in prison of hunger . Edward II . caused at one time twenty-eight nobles to be hanged and disembowelled , and was himself put to death by the insertion of a red-hot iron into his bowels . Look in Froissart for the debaucheries and murders in France as well as in England , of the Hundred Years ' War , and then for the slaughters of the Wars of the Roses . In both countries feudal independence ended in civil war , and the middle age founders under its vices . Chivalrous courtesy , which cloaked the native ferocity , disappears like some hangings suddenly consumed by the breaking out of a fire ; at that time in England they killed nobles in preference , and prisoners too , even children , with insults , in cold blood . What , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this literature ? How was he humanised ? What precepts of justice , habits of reflection , store of true judgments , did this culture interpose between his desires and his actions , in order to moderate his passion ? He dreamed , he imagined a sort of elegant ceremonial in order the better to address lords and ladies ; he discovered the gallant code of little Jehan de Saintre . But where is the true education ? Wherein has Froissart profited by all his vast experience ? He was a fine specimen of a babbling child ; what they called his poesy , the poesie native , is only a refined gabble , a senile puerility . Some rheto- // ricians , like Christine de Pisan , try to round their periods after an ancient model ; but all their literature amounts to nothing . No one can think . Sir John Maundeville , who travelled all over the world a hundred and fifty years after Villehardouin , is as contracted in his ideas as Villehardouin himself . Extraordinary legends and fables , every sort of credulity and ignorance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why Palestine has passed into the hands of various possessors instead of continuing under one government , he says that it is because God would not that it should continue longer in the hands of traitors and sinners , whether Christians or others . He has seen at Jerusalem , on the steps of the temple , the footmarks of the ass which our lord rode in Palm Sunday . He describes the Ethiopians as a people who have only one foot , but so large that they can make use of it as a parasol . He instances one island " where be people as big as gyants , of 28 feet long , and have no cloathing but beasts ' skins ; " then another island , " where there are many evil and foul women , but have precious stones in their eyes , and have such force that if they behold any man with wrath , they slay him with beholding , as the basilisk ( loth . " The good man relates ; that is all : doubt and common sense scarcely exist in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he piles facts one on top of another , with no further connection ; his book is simply a mirror which reproduces recollections of his eyes and ears . " And all those who will say a Pater and an Ave Maria in my behalf , I give them an interest and a share in all the holy pilgrimages I ever made in my life . " That is his farewell , and accords with all the rest . Neither public morality nor public knowledge // has gained anything from these three centuries of culture . This French culture , copied in vain throughout Europe , has but superficially adorned mankind , and the varnish with which it decked them , is already tarnished everywhere or scales off It was worse in England , where the thing was more superficial and the application worse than in France , where foreign hands laid it on , and where it could only half cover the Saxon crust , where that crust was worn away and rough . That is the reason why , during three centuries , throughout the whole first feudal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made up of imitations , translations , and clumsy copies , ends in nothing . VI . Meantime , what has become of the conquered people ? Has the old stock , on which the brilliant continental flowers were grafted , engendered no literary shoot of its own ? Did it continue barren during all this time under the Norman axe , which stripped it of all its buds ? It grew very feebly , but it grew nevertheless . The subjugated race is not a dismembered nation , dislocated , uprooted , sluggish , like the populations of the Continent , which , after the long Roman oppression , were given up to the unrestrained invasion of barbarians ; it increased , remained fixed in its own soil , full of sap : its members were not displaced ; it was simply lopped in order to receive on its crown a cluster of foreign branches . True , it had suffered , but at last the wound closed , the saps mingled . Even the hard , stiff ligatures with which the Conqueror bound it , henceforth contributed to its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every title veriCHAP. // fled , defined in writing ; 1 every right or tenure valued ; every man registered as to his locality , and also his condition , duties , descent , and resources , so that the whole nation was enveloped in a network of which not a mesh would break . Its future development had to be within these limits . Its constitution was settled , and in this positive and stringent enclosure men were compelled to unfold themselves and to act . Solidarity and strife ; these were the two effects of the great and orderly establishment which shaped and held together , on one side the aristocracy of the conquerors , on the other the conquered people ; even as in Rome the systematic fusing of conquered peoples into the plebs , and the constrained organisation of the patricians in contrast with the plebs , enrolled the private individuals in two orders , whose opposition and union formed the state . Thus , here as in Rome , the national character was moulded and completed by the habit of corporate action , the respect for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of combative and patient energy . It was the Domesday Book which , binding this young society in a rigid discipline , made of the Saxon the Englishman of our own day . Gradually and slowly , amidst the gloomy complainings of the chroniclers , we find the new man fashioned by action , like a child who cries because steel stays , though they improve his figure , give him pain . However reduced and downtrodden the Saxons were , they did not // all sink into the populaoe . Some , ' almost in every county , remained lords of their estates , on the condition of doing homage for them to the king . Many became vassals of Norman barons , and remained proprietors on this condition . A greater number became socagers , that is , free proprietors , burdened with a tax , but possessed of the right of alienating their property ; and the Saxon villeins found patrons in these , as the plebs formerly did in the Italian nobles who were transplanted to Rome . The patronage of the Saxons who preserved their integral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriages from the first united the two races , as it had the patricians and plebeians of Rorne a Norman brother-in-law to a Saxon , defended himself in defending him . In those turbulent times , and in an armed community , relatives and allies were obliged to stand shoulder to shoulder in order to keep their ground . After all , it was necessary for the new-comers to consider their subjects , for these subjects had the heart and courage of men : the Saxons , like the plebeians at Rome , remembered their native rank and their original independence . We can recognise it in the complaints and indignation of the chroniclers , in the growling and menaces of popular revolt , in the long bitterness with which they continually recalled their ancient liberty , in // the favour with which they cherished the daring and rebellion of outlaws . There were Saxon families at the end of the twelfth century , who had bound themselves by a perpetual vow , to wear long beards from father to son in memory of the national custom and of the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition of socagers , even sunk into villeins , had a stiffer neck than the wretched colonists of the Continent , trodden down and moulded by four centuries of Roman taxation . By their feelings as well as by their condition , they were the broken remains , but also the living elements , of a free people . They did not suffer the extremities of oppression . They constituted the body of t he nation , the laborious , courageous body which supplied its energy . The great barons felt that they must rely upon them in their resistance to the king . Very soon , i n stipulating for themselves , they stipulated for all freemen , ' even for merchants and villeins . Thereafter " No merchant shall be dispossessed of his merchandise , no villein of the instruments of his labour ; no freeman , merchant , or villein shall be taxed unreasonably for a small crime ; no freeman shall be arrested , er imprisoned , or disseised of his land , or outlawed , or destroyed in any manner , but by the lawful judgment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land . " Thus protected they raise themselves and act . In each county there was a court , where all freeholders , small or great , came to deliberate about the municipal affairs , administer justice , and appoint tax-assessors . The red-bearded Saxon , with his clear complexion and great white teeth , came and auto by the Norman 's side ; these were franklins like the one whom Chaucer describes : . // " A Frankelein was in this compagnie ; White was his bend , as is the dayesie . Of his complexion he was sanguin , Wel loved he by the morwe a sop in win . To liven in delft was ever his wone , For he was Epicures owen sone , That held opinion that plein delit Was veraily felicite parfite . An housholder , and that a grete was he , Seint Julian he was in his contree . His brede , his ale , was alway after on ; A better envyned man was no wher non . Withouten bake mete never was his hous , Of fish and flesh , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mete and drinke , Of all deintees that men coud of thinke ; After the sondry sesons of the yere , So changed he his mete and his soupere . Fu1 many a fat partrich had he in mewe , And many a breme , and many a lute in stewe . Wo was his coke but if his sauce were Poinant and sharpe , and redy all his gere . His table , dormant in his halle alway Stode redy covered alle the longe day . At sessions ther was he lord and sire . Ful often time he was knight of the shire . An anelace and a gipciere all of silk , Iteng at his girdle , white as morwe milk . A shereve hadde he ben , and a contour . Was no wher swiche a worthy vavasour. " 1 With him occasionally in the assembly , oftenest among the audience , were the yeomen , farmers , foresters , tradesmen , his fellow-countrymen , muscular and resolute // men , not slow in the defence of their property , and in supporting him who would take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and weapons . Is it likely that the discontent of such men to whom the following description applies could be overlooked ? " The Miller was a stout earl for the nones , Ful bigge he was of braun and eke of bones ; That proved wel , for over all ther he came , At wrastling he wold here away the rani . He was short shuldered brode , a thikke guarre , Tlier n'as no Bore , that he n'olde heve of barre , Or breke it at a renning with his hede . His herd as any sowe or fox was rede , And therto brode , as though it were a spade . Upon the cop right of his nose he hade A wert , and thereon stode a tufte of heres , Rede as the bristles of a sowes eres : His nose-thirles blacke were and wide . A swerd and bokeler bare he by his side . His mouth as wide was as a forneis , He was a jangler and a goliardeis , And that was most of sinne , and harlotries .

" ' Those are the athletic forms , the square build , the jolly John Bulls of the period , such as we yet find them , nourished by meat and porter , ' sustained by bodily exercise and boxing . These are the men we must keep before us , if we will understand how political liberty // has been established iii this country . Gradually they find the simple knights , their colleagues in the county court , too poor to be present with the great barons at the royal assemblies , coalescing with them . They become united by community of interests , by similarity of manners , by nearness of condition ; they take them for their representatives , they elect them.l They have now entered upon public life , and the advent of a new reinforcement , gives them a perpetual standing in their changed condition . The towns laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or exact charters ; the townsmen buy themselves out of the arbitrary taxes that were imposed on them ; they get possession of the land on which their houses are built ; they unite themselves under mayors and aldermen . Each town now , within the meshes of the great feudal net , is a power . The Earl of Leicester , rebelling against the king , summons two burgesses from each town to Parliament , ' to authorise and support him . From that time the conquered race , both in country and town , rose to political life . If they were taxed , it was with their consent ; they paid nothing which they did not agree to . Early in the fourteenth century their united deputies composed the House of Commons ; and already , at the close of the preceding century , the Archbishop of Canterbury , speaking in the name of the king , said to the pope , " It is the custom of the kingdom of England , that in all affairs relating to the state of this kingdom , the advice of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " . // VII . If they have acquired liberties , it is because they have obtained them by force ; circumstances have assisted , but character has done more . The protection of the great barons and the affiance of the plain knights have strengthened them ; but it was by their native roughness and energy that they maintained their independence . Look at the contrast they offer at this moment to their neighbours . What occupies the mind of the French people ? The fabliaux , the naughty tricks of Reynard , the art of deceiving Master Isengrin , of stealing his wife , of cheating him out of his dinner , of getting him beaten by a third party without danger to one 's self ; in short , the triumph of poverty and cleverness over power united to folly . The popular hero is already the artful plebeian , chaffing , light-hearted , who , later on , will ripen into Panurge and Figaro , not apt to withstand you to your face , too sharp to care for great victories and habits of strife , inclined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obstacle ; if he but touch a. man with the tip of his finger , that man tumbles into the trap . But here we have other customs : it is Robin Hood , a valiant outlaw , living free and bold in the green forest , waging frank and open war against sheriff and law . ' If ever a man was popular in his country , it was he . " It is he , " says an old historian , " whom the common people love so clearly to celebrate in games and comedies , and whose history , sung by fiddlers. interests them more than any other . " In the sixteenth century he still had his commemoration day , observed by all the people in the small towns and in the country . Bishop Latimer , making his pastoral tour , announced // one , lay that he would preach in a certain place . On the morrow , proceeding to the church , he found the doors closed , and waited more than an hour before they brought hint the key . At last a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thys ys a busye day with us ; we can not heare you : it is Robyn Hoodes Daye . The parishe are gone abrode to gather for Robyn Hoode . . . . I was fayne there to geve place to Robyn Hoode. " l The bishop was obliged to divest himself of his ecclesiastical garments and proceed on his journey , leaving his place to archers dressed in green , who played on a rustic stage the parts of Robin Hood , Little John , and their band . In fact , he was the national hero . Saxon in the first place , and waging war against the men of law , against bishops and archbishops , whose sway was so heavy ; generous , moreover , giving to a poor ruined knight clothes , horse , and money to buy back the land he had pledged to a rapacious abbot ; compassionate too , and kind to the poor , enjoining his men not to injure yeomen and labourers ; but above all rash , bold , proud , who would go and draw his bow before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with blows , whether to give or take . He slew fourteen out of fifteen foresters who came to arrest him ; he slays the sheriff , the judge , the town gatekeeper ; he is ready to slay as many more as like to come ; and all this joyously , jovially , like an honest fellow who eats well , has a hard skin , lives in the open air , and revels in animal life . " In sourer when the shawes be sheyne , And leves be large and long , Hit is fulle mery in feyre foreste To here the foulys sons " // That is how many ballads begin ; and the fine weather . which makes the stags and oxen butt with their horns , inspires them with the thought of exchanging blows with sword or stick . Robin dreamed that two yeomen were thrashing him , and he wants to go and find them , angrily repelling Little John , who offers to go first : " Ah John , by me thou settest noe store , And that I Farley finde : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myselfe behinde ? " It is no cunnin a knave to ken , An a man but heare him speake , An it were not for bursting of my bowe , John , I thy head wold breake. " 1 . . . He goes alone , and meets the robust yeoman , Guy of Gisborne : " He that had neyther beene kythe nor kin , Might have seen a full fayre fight , To see how together these yeomen went With blades both browne and bright , " To see how these yeomen together they fought Two howres of a summer 's day ; Yett neither Robin Hood nor sir Guy Them fettled to flye away . " 2 You see Guy the yeoman is as brave as Robin Hood ; he came to seek him in the wood , and drew the bow almost as well as he . This old popular poetry is not the praise of a single bandit , but of an entire class , the yeomanry . " God haffe mersey on Robin Hodys solle , // and salle all god yemanry . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , inured to blows , a good archer , clever at sword and stick , is the favourite . There were also redoubtable , alined townsfolk , accustomed to make use of their arms .

" He leaned his back fast unto a thorn , And his foot against a stone , And there he fought a long summer 's day , r summer 's day so long . " Till that their swords on their broad bucklers Were broke fast into their hands . " ? Often even Robin does not get the advantage : " I pass not for length , " bold Arthur reply 'd , My staff is of oke so free ; Eight foot and a half , it will knock down a calf , And I hope it will knock down thee . ' " Then Robin could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Quickly and soon the blood came down Before it was ten a clock .

" Then Rubin raged like a wild boar , As soon as he saw his own blood : Then Bland was in bast , he laid on so fast , As though he had been cleaving of wood . " And about and about and about they went , Like two wild bores in a chase , Striving to aim each other to maim , Leg , arm , or any other place . " And knock for knock they lustily dealt , Which held for two hours and more , Till all the wood rang at every bang , They ply 'd their work so sure . " Hold thy hand , hold thy hand , ' said Robin Hood , And let thy quarrel fall ; For here we may thrash our bones all to mesh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the forrest of merry Sherwood , Hereafter thou shalt be free . ' God a mercy for nought , my freedom I bought , I may thank my staff , and not thee . " ' n " Who are you , then ? " says Robin : I am a tanner , ' bold Arthur reply 'd , In Nottingham long I have wrought ; And if thou'lt come there , I vow and swear , I will tan thy hide for nought . ' " " God a mercy , good fellow , ' said jolly Robin , Since thou art so kind and free ; And if thou wilt tan my hide for nought , I will do as much for thee . ' " // With these generous offers , they embrace ; a free exchange of honest blows always prepares the way for friendship . It was so Robin Hood tried Little John , whom he loved all his life after . Little John was seven feet high , and being on a bridge , would not give way . Honest Robin would not use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stick seven feet long ; and they agreed amicably to fight on the bridge until one should fall into the water . They fall to so merrily that " their bones ring . " In the end Robin falls , and he feels only the more respect for Little John . Another time , having a sword with him , he was thrashed by a tinker who had only a stick . Full of admiration , he gives him a hundred pounds . Again he was thrashed by a potter , who refused him toll ; then by a shepherd . They fight to wile away time . Even now-a-days boxers give each other a friendly grip before setting to ; they knock one another about in this country honourably , without malice , fury , or shame . Broken teeth , black eyes , smashed ribs , do not call for murderous vengeance : it would seem that the bones are more solid and the nerves less sensitive in England than elsewhere .

' For three merry men , and three merry men , And three merry men we be . ' " Moreover , these people , in each parish , practised the bow every Sunday , and were the best archers in the world ; from the close of the fourteenth century the general emancipation of the villeins multiplied // their number greatly , and you can now understand how , amidst all the operations and changes of the great central powers , the liberty of the subject survived : After all , the only permanent and unalterable guarantee , in every country and under every constitution , is this unspoken declaration in the heart of the mass of the people , which is well understood on all sides : " If any man touches my property , enters my house , obstructs or molests me , let him beware . I have patience , but I have also strong arms , good comrades , a good blade , and , on occasion , a firm resolve , happen what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his throat . " VIII . Thus thought Sir John Foitescue , Chancellor of England under Henry VI. , exiled in France during the Wars of the Roses , one of the oldest prose-writers , and the first who weighed and explained the constitution of his country ) . He says : " It is cowardise and lack of hartes and corage that kepeth the Frenchmen from rysyng , and not povertye ; 2 which corage no Frenche man bath like to the English man . It hath ben often seen in Englond that iij or iv thefes , for povertie , bath sett upon vij or viij true men , and robbyd them al . But it bath not ben seen in Fraunce , that vij or viij thefes have ben hardy to robbe iij or iv true men . Wherfor it is right seld that Frenchmen be hangyd for robberye , for that they have no hertys to do so terryble an acte . There be therfor mo men // hangyd in Englond , in a yore , for robberye and manslaughter , than ther be hangid in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This throws a startling and terrible light on the violent condition of this armed community , where sudden attacks are an everyday matter , and every one , rich and poor , lives with his hand on his sword . There were great bands of malefactors under Edward I. , who infested the country , and fought with those who came to seize them . The inhabitants of the towns were obliged to gather together with those of the neighbouring towns , with hue and cry , to pursue and capture them . Under Edward III . there were barons who rode about with armed escorts and archers , seizing the manors , carrying off ladies and girls of high degree , mutilating , killing , extorting ransoms from people in their own houses , as if they were in an enemy 's land , and sometimes coming before the judges at the sessions in such guise and in so great force that the judges were afraid and dared not administer justice . ' Read the letters of the Paston family , under Henry VI . and Edward IV. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door , how it was necessary for a man to provide himself with men and arms , to be on the alert for defence of his property , to be self-reliant , to depend on his own strength and courage . It is this excess of vigour and readiness to fight which , after their victories in France , set them against one another in England , in the butcheries of the Wars of // the Roses . The strangers who saw them were astonished at their bodily strength and courage , at the great pieces of beef " which feed their muscles , at their military habits , their fierce obstinacy , as of savage beasts . " They are like their bulldogs , an untameable race , who in their mad courage " cast themselves with shut eyes into the den of a Russian bear , and get their head broken like a rotten apple . " This strange condition of a militant community , so full of danger , and requiring so much effort , does not make them afraid . King Edward having given orders to send @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not to liberate them , on bail or otherwise , the Commons declared the order " horribly vexatious ; " resist it , refuse to be too much protected . Less peace , but more independence . They maintain the guarantees of the subject at the expense of public security , and prefer turbulent liberty to arbitrary order . Better suffer marauders whom they could fight , than magistrates under whom they would have to bend . This proud and persistent notion gives rise to , and fashions Fortescue 's whole work " Ther be two kynds of kyngdomys , of the which that one ys a lordship callid in Latyne Dominium regale , and that other is callid Dominium politician et regale . " The first is established in France , and the second in England . " And they dyversen in that the first may rule his people by such lawys as he makyth hymself , and therefor , he may set upon them talys , and other impositions , such as he wyl hymself , with- // out their assent . The secund may not rule hys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and therfor he may set upon them non impositions without their own assent . " ' In a state like this , the will of the people is the prime element of life . Sir John Fortescue says further : " A king of England can not at his pleasure make any alterations in the laws of the land , for the nature of his government is not only regal , but political . " " In the body politic , the first thing which lives and moves is the intention of the people , having in it the blood , that is , the prudential care and provision for the public good , which it transmits and communicates to the head , as to the principal part , and to all the rest of the members of the said body politic , whereby it subsists and is invigorated . The law under which the people is incorporated may be compared to the nerves or sinews of the body natural . . . . And as the bones and all the other members of the body preserve their functions and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the members of the community by the law . And as the bead of the body natural can not change its nerves or sinews , can not deny to the several parts their proper energy , their due proportion and aliment of blood , neither can a king who is the head of the body politic change the laws thereof , nor take from the people what is theirs by right , against their consents . . . . For he is appointed to protect his subjects in their lives , properties , and laws , for this very end and purpose he has the delegation of power from the people . " Here we have all the ideas of Locke in the fifteenth century ; so powerful is practice to suggest theory ! so quickly does man discover , in the enjoyment of liberty , the nature of liberty ! Fortescue goes further ; he contrasts , step by step , the Roman law , that inheritance of all // Latin peoples , with the English law , that heritage of all Teutonic peoples : one the work of absolute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual ; the other the work of the common will , tending altogether to protect the person . He contrasts the maxims of the imperial jurisconsults , who accord " force of law to all which is determined by the prince , " with the statutes of England , which " are not enacted by the sole will of the prince , . . . but with the concurrent consent of the whole kingdom , by their representatives in Parliament , . . . more than three hundred select persons . " He contrasts the arbitrary nomination of imperial officers with the election of the sheriff , and says : " There is in every county a certain officer , called the king 's sheriff , who , amongst other duties of his office , executes within his county all mandates and judgments of the king 's courts of justice : he is an annual officer ; and it is not lawful for him , after the expiration of his year , to continue to act in his said office , neither shall he be taken in again to execute the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner of his election is thus : Every year , on the morrow of All-Souls , there meet in the King 's Court of Exchequer all the king 's counsellors , as well lords spiritual and temporal , as all other the king 's justices , all the barons of the Exchequer , the Master of the Rolls , and certain other officers , when all of them , by common consent , nominate three of every county knights or esquires , persons of distinction , and such as they esteem fittest qualified to hear the office of sheriff of that county for the year ensuing . The king only makes choice of one out of the three so nominated and returned , who , in virtue of the king 's letters patent , is constituted High Sheriff of that county . " He contrasts the Roman procedure , which is satisfied // with two witnesses to condemn a man , with the jury , the three permitted challenges , the admirable guarantees of justice with which the uprightness , number , repute , and condition of the juries surround the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good and true men being sworn , as in the manner above related , legally qualified , that is , having , over and besides their moveables , possessions in land sufficient , as was said , wherewith to maintain their rank and station ; neither inspected by , nor at variance with either of the parties ; all of the neighbourhood ; there shall be read to them , in English , by the Court , the record and nature of the plea . " 1 Thus protected , the English commons can not be other than flourishing . Consider , on the other hand , he says to the young prince whom he is instructing , the condition of the commons in France . By their taxes , tax on salt , on wine , billeting of soldiers , they are reduced to great misery . You have seen them on your travels ... .

And also other freeholders , and many yeomen able for their livelodes to make a jurye in fourme afore-mentioned .

" 2 Harrison says : 8 r // " This sort of people , have more estimation than labourers and the common sort of artificers , and these commonlie live wealthilie , keepe good houses , and travell to get riches .

" Such men , says Fortescue , might form a legal jury , and vote , resist , be associated , do everything wherein a free government consists : for they were numerous in every district ; they were not down-trodden like the timid peasants of France ; they had their honour and that of their family to maintain ; " they be well provided with arms ; they remember that they have won battles in France . " 1 Such is the class , still obscure , but more // rich and powerful every century , which , founded by the down-trodden Saxon aristocracy , and sustained by the surviving Saxon character , ended , under the lead of the inferior Norman nobility , and under the patronage of the superior Norman nobility , in establishing and settling a free constitution , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as here , men are endowed with a serious character , have a resolute spirit , and possess independent habits , they deal with their conscience as with their daily business , and end by laying hands on church as well as state . Already for a long time the exactions of the Roman See had provoked the resistance of the people , and the higher clergy became unpopular . Men complained that the best livings were given by the Pope to non-resident strangers ; that some Italian , unknown in England , possessed fifty or sixty benefices in England ; that English money poured into Rome ; and that the clergy , being judged only by clergy , gave themselves up to their vices , and abused their state of immunity . In the first years of Henry M. 's reign there were nearly a hundred murders committed by priests then alive . At the beginning of the fourteenth century the ecclesiastical revenue was twelve // times greater than the civil ; about half the soil was in the hands of the clergy . At the end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church were five times greater than the taxes paid to the crown ; and some years afterwards , ? considering that the wealth of the clergy only served to keep them in idleness and luxury , they proposed to confiscate it for the public benefit . Already the idea of the Reformation had forced itself upon them . They remembered how in the ballads Robin Hood ordered his folk to spare the yeomen , labourers , even knights , if they are good fellows , but never to let abbots or bishops escape . The prelates were grievously oppressing the people by means of their privileges , ecclesiastical courts , and tithes ; when suddenly , amid the pleasant banter or the monotonous babble of the Norman versifiers , we hear the indignant voice of a Saxon , a man of the people and a victim of oppression , thundering against them . It is the vision of Piers Ploughman , written , it is supposed , by a secular priest of Oxford . ' Doubtless the traces of French taste are perceptible . It could not be otherwise : the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people above ; and the most unshackled popular poets , Burns and Beranger , too often preserve an academic style . So here a fashionable machinery , the allegory of the Roman de la Rose , is pressed into service . We have Do-well , Covetousness , Avarice , Simony , Conscience , and a whole world of talking abstractions . But , in spite of these // vain foreign phantoms , the body of the poem is national ; and true to life . The old language reappears in part ; the old metre altogether , no more rhymes , but barbarous alliterations ; no more jesting , but a harsh gravity , a sustained invective , a grand and sombre imagination , heavy Latin texts , hammered down as by a Protestant hand . Piers Ploughman went to sleep on the Malvern hills , and there had a wonderful dream : " Thane gan I meten ? a merveillous swevene , That I was in a wildernesse ? wiste I nevere where ; And as I biheeld into the eest , ? an heigh to the soune , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ y-maked , A deep dale bynethe ? a dongeon thereinne With depe cliches and derke ? and dredfulle of sighte . A fair feeld fill of folk ? fond I tiler bitwene , Of alle manere of men , ? the meene and the riche , Werchynge and wandrynge ? as the world asketh . Some putten hem to the plough , ? pleiden ful selde , In settynge and sowynge ? swonken ful harde , And wonnen that wastours ? with glotonye dystruyeth. " 1 A gloomy picture of the world , like the frightful dreams which occur so often in Albert Durer and Luther . The first reformers were persuaded that the earth was given over to evil ; that the devil had on it his empire and his officers ; that Antichrist , seated on the throne of Rome , displayed ecclesiastical pomps to seduce souls and cast them into the fire of hell . So here Antichrist , with raised banner , enters a convent ; hells are rung ; monks in solemn procession go to meet him , and receive with congratulations their lord and father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the seven deadly sins , he besieges Conscience ; and the assault is led by Idleness , who brings with her an army of more than a thousand prelates : for vices reign , more hateful from being in holy places , and employed in the church of God in the devil 's service : " Ac now is Religion a rydere ? a romere aboute , A ledere of love-dayes ? and a lond-buggere , A prikere on a palfrey ? fro manere to manere . . . . And but if his knave knele ? that shal his coppe brynge , He loureth on hym , and asketh hym  --  who taughte hym curteisie . " But this sacrilegious show has its day , and God puts His hand on men in order to warn them . By order of Conscience , Nature sends forth a host of plagues and diseases from the planets : " Kynde Conscience tho herde , ? and cam out of the planetes , And sente forth his forreyours ? feveres and fluxes , Coughes and cardiacles , ? crampes and tooth-aches , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and botches , ? and brennynge agues , Frenesies and foule yveles , ? forageres of kynde . . . . There was Harrow ! and Help ! ? Here cometh Kynde 1 With Deeth that is dredful ? to undo us alle ! ' The lord that lyved after lust ? tho aloud cryde . . . . Deeth cam dryvynge after ,  --  and al to duste passhed Kynges and knyghtes , ? kaysers and popes , . . . Manye a lovely lady ? and lemmans of knyghtes , Swowned and swelted for sorwe of hise dyntes. " 2 Here is a crowd of miseries , like those which Milton has described in his vision of human life ; tragic pictures // and emotions , such as the reformers delight to dwell upon . There is a like speech delivered by John Knox , before the fair ladies of Mary Stuart , which tears the veil from the human corpse just as coarsely , in order to exhibit its shame . The conception of the world , proper to the people of the north , all sad and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iii their country ; they have to strive continually against cold or rain . They can not live there carelessly , lying under a lovely sky , in a sultry and clear atmosphere , their eyes filled with the noble beauty and happy serenity of the land . They must work to live ; be attentive , exact , keep their houses wind and water tight , trudge doggedly through the mud behind their plough , light their lamps in their shops during the day . Their climate imposes endless inconvenience , and exacts endless endurance . Hence arise melancholy and the idea of ' duty . Man naturally thinks of life as of a battle , oftener of black death which closes this deadly show , and leads so many plumed and disorderly processions to the silence and the eternity of the grave . All this visible world is vain ; there is nothing true but human virtue , ? the courageous energy with which man attains to self-command , the generous energy with which he employs himself in the service of others . On this view , then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , neglect sensual joys , to attain this . By such inner thoughts and feelings the ideal model is displaced ; a new source of action springs up ? the idea of righteousness . What sets them against ecclesiastical pomp and insolence , is neither the envy of the poor and low , nor the anger of the oppressed , nor a revolutionary desire to experimentalise abstract truth , but conscience . ' They tremble lest they should not work out their salvation if // they continue in a eorrupt church ; they fear the menaces of God , and dare not embark on the great journey with unsafe guides . " What is righteousness ? " asked Luther anxiously , " and how shall I obtain it ? " With like anxiety Piers Ploughman goes to seek Do-well , and asks each one to show him where he shall find him . " With us , " say the friars . " Contra quath ich , Septies in die cadit justus , and ho so syngeth certys cloth nat wel ; " so he betakes himself to " study and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak much of God and of the Trinity , " and taken Bernarde to witnesse , and putteth forth presompcions . . . ac the carfid mai crie and quaken atte gate , bothe a fyngred and a furst , and for defaute spille ys non so hende to have hym yn . Clerkus and knyghtes carpen of God ofte , and haveth hym muche in hure mouthe , ac mene men in herte ; " and heart , inner faith , living virtue , are what constitute true religion . This is what these dull Saxons had begun to discover . The Teutonic conscience , and English good sense too , had been aroused , as well as individual energy , the resolution to judge and to decide alone , by and for one 's self . " Christ is our hede that sitteth on his , Heddis ne ought we have no mo , " says a poem , attributed to Chaucer , and which , with others , claims independence for Christian consciences . ' " We ben his membres bothe also , Father he taught us call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Al maisters ben wickid and fals . " No other mediator between man and God . In vain the doctors state that they have authority for their words ; // there is a word of greater authority , to wit , God 's . We hear it in the fourteenth century , this grand " word of God . " It quitted the learned schools , the dead languages , the dusty shelves on which the clergy suffered it to sleep , covered with a confusion of commentators and Fathers . ' Wielif appeared and translated it like Luther , and in a spirit similar to Luther 's . " Cristen men and wymmen , olde and yonge , shulden studie fast in the Newe Testament , for it is of ful autorite , and opyn to undirstonding of simple men , as to the poyntis that be moost nedeful to salvacioun. " 2 Religion must be secular , in order to escape from the hands of the clergy , who monopolise it ; each must hear and read for himself the word of God : he will then be sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it better , and more , he will understand it better ; for " ech place of holy writ , both opyn and derk , techith mekenes and charite ; and therfore he that kepith mekenes and charite path the trewe undirstondyng and perfectioun of al holi writ .. . Therfore no simple man of wit be aferd unmesurabli to studie in the text of holy writ . . . and no clerk be proude of the verrey undirstondyng of holy writ , for whi undirstonding of hooly writ with outen charite that kepith Goddis heestis , makith a man depper dampned . . . and pride and covetise of clerkis is cause of her blindees and eresie , and priveth them fro verrey undirstondyng of holy writ . " 3 // These are the memorable words that began to circulate in the markets and in the schools . They read the translated Bible , and commented on it ; they judged the existing Church after it . What judgments these serious and untainted minds passed upon it , with what readiness they pushed on to the true religion of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' One hundred and thirty years before Luther , they said that the pope was not established by Christ , that pilgrimages and image-worship were akin to idolatry , that external rites are of no importance , that priests ought not to possess temporal wealth , that the doctrine of transubstantiation made a people idolatrous , that priests have not the power of absolving from sin . In proof of all this they brought forward texts of Scripture . Fancy these brave spirits , simple and strong souls , who began to read at night in their shops , by candle-light ; for they were shopkeepers ? tailors , skinners , and bakers ? who , with some men of letters , began to read , and then to believe , and finally got themselves burned . ' What a sight for the fifteenth century , and what a promise ! It seems as though , with liberty of action , liberty of mind begins to appear ; that these common folk will think and speak ; that under the conventional literature , imitated from France , a new literature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half-mute since the Conquest , will at last find a voice . She had not yet found it . King and peers ally themselves to the Church , pass terrible statutes , destroy books , burn heretics alive , often with refinement of torture , ? one in a barrel , another hung by an iron chain // round his waist . The temporal wealth of the clergy had been attacked , and therewith the whole English constitution ; and the great establishment above crushed out with its whole weight the revolutionists from below . Darkly , iii silence , while the nobles were destroying each other in the Wars of the Roses , the commons went on working and living , separating themselves from the established Church , maintaining their liberties , amassing wealth , but not going further ) . Like a vast rock which underlies the soil , yet crops up here and there at distant intervals , they barely show themselves . No great poetical or religious work displays them to the light . They sang ; but their ballads , first ignored , then transformed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but beyond one or two indifferent poems , their incomplete and repressed doctrine bore no fruit . We may well see from the verse , tone , and drift of their ballads , that they are capable of the finest poetic originality , ' but their poetry is in the hands of yeomen and harpers . We perceive , by the precocity and energy of their religious protests , that they are capable of the most severe and impassioned creeds ; but their faith remains hidden in the shop-parlours of a few obscure sectaries . Neither their faith nor their poetry has been // able to attain its end or issue . The Renaissance and the Reformation , those two national outbreaks , are still far off ; and the literature of the period retains to the end , like the highest ranks of English society , almost the perfect stamp of its French origin and its foreign models . // CHAPTER III The New Tongue . I Amid so many barren endeavours , throughout the long impotence of Norman literature , which was content to copy , and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language was nevertheless formed , and there was room for a great writer . Geoffrey Chaucer appeared , a , man of mark , inventive though a disciple , original though a translator , who by his genius , education , and life , was enabled to know and to depict a whole world , but above all to satisfy the chivalric world and the splendid courts which shone upon the heights . ' He belonged to it , though learned and versed in all branches of scholastic knowledge ; and he took such a share in it , that his life from beginning to end was that of a man of the world , and a man of action . We find hint by turns in King Edward 's army , in the king 's train , husband of a maid of honour to the queen , a pensioner , a placeholder , a member of Parliament , a knight , founder of a family which was hereafter to become allied to royalty . Moreover , he was in the king 's council , brotherin-law of John of Gaunt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Florence , Genoa , Milan , Flanders , commissioner in France for the marriage
