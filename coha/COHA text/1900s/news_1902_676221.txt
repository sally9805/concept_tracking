txt Semi-panicky conditions ruled for a time on the Stock Exchange yesterday , under a pressure of liquidating sales and selling for the short account which fairly stag+ gered the market . As a result of this selling , the market , which had opened heavy . developed sudden and extreme Weakness , with practically every active stock on the list tumbling from 2 to 8 points each , while one extreme decline of 22 points was reported-this , however , in an inconspicuous issue , Homestake Mining Company . In the break , the culmination , apparently , of the decline which set in a fun month ago and has carried prices down on an average of 20 points from the high level , the accounts of many operators , big as well as little , were , in the vernacular , " wiped out . " So extreme , indeed , was yesterday 's break that at one time It looked as if an old-time panic could not be averted . At the critical period , however , leading banking houses-notably those acting for Standard Oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , putting in large buying orders , first steadied , and finally rallied , the market , on an average of a point or more from the low figures . MANY RUMORS IN CIRCULATION . While the decline was in progress the Street was filled with all sorts and conditions of rumors-all of them wholly disquieting . Most of these had to do with the Western element , whose position , it was declated , was decidedly shaky and could only be bettered by enforced liquidation such as , it was declared , was being seen in the market-especially in such stocks as Rock Island , St. Paul , Baltimore and Ohio , Norfolk , Chesapeake , Reading . Louisville , 0,1 New York Central , in which the Vestenters were reported to be especially interested . But the stories did not stop there . They declared even that certain of the Westerners had " laid down " and were unable to meet their loans , and that as a cense- , quenee several local and Western banks were in difficulty . Then , - too , tyke name of a well-known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gossips , the declaration being that as a result of the Boston bank failure and the break in Amalgamated Copper this gentleman was in sore financial distress . To cap all , there came reports of Mr. Morgan 's absence from the Street and of his alleged illness-reports that soon took on an alarming phase , one statement being that he was sick beyond hone of recovery . The report that Mr. Morgan is seriously ill was authoritatively and emphatically denied . He is slightly indisposed from a cold , it is said . As a result of these and other such stories a feeling of uneasiness began to spread through the Street . Manifestation of it soon appeared when stocks , for no explained reason other than the circulated rumors , started to decline-slowly at first , but in time much too fast to please timid or weakly margined holders . First Rock Island- owned by the Moores and their Chicago friends-slumped ; then St. , Paul and Baltimore and Ohio . in which the ( 3ra.te people are linown to have been heavily interested ; then Norfolk , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Street was by this time thoroughly alarmed and there was much hasty selling . Brokers rushed about in great excitement , both in their offices and on the floor of the Exchange . calling for additional margins in some cases and in others advising even strongly protected customers to sell . At the moment , however , when the market looked as if it would go head over heels downward large supporting orders appeared , and soon the entire list rallied , the rally being in progress at the close . When the market was weakest , which was about 1:30 o'clock , some of the extreme declines in representative stocks were : Amalgamated Copper 2% Rock Island pf Atchison 214 St. Louis &; San F .. 41/2 Baltimore &; Ohio .. - 5% Louisville &; Nash .. 51,6 Canadian Pacific 5 ; ; , Southern Pacific 31/2 Colorado Fuel 4% St , Paul ? 7y4 , Chesapeake 31/4 Tennessee Coal Delaware &; HudsOn.4 Union Pacific 31/2 Erie 2 United States Steel .. 1% Erie 2d Of .2 United ' States S. pf.lt Illinois ** ' Wabash pf Manhattan 2% United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &; Western . .4% Peoria &; Eastern New York Central-31/2 New York Air Brake Pennsylvania 31/2 General Electric Reading 4 Big Four Rock Viand .0% After the market had closed and the Street was able to take a breathing spell and investigate the many reports put out there was generally a feeling that the collapse Wad not been warranted , but was due in large measure to the cleverly planned operations of the bear party in the Street , at whose head is reported to be a leading operator heretofore generally believed to be bullish . This operator and his friends , it is said , were not slow to take advantage of the market 's weak technical position and to realize that a vigorous onslaught would force out a liberal supply of stock . However this be , certain it is that not the least verification could be had of the various alarming reports concerning the Western interests , though it is not denied that they have been heavy losers . Their losses , however , it is pointed out , are but losses of profits made in the big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that any original capital has been touched . According to the best information that could be gathered from bankers , none of whom , however , cared to be quoted , the break yesterday was not considered serious enough to threaten any legitimate financial enterprises . THE SOUTHERN PACIFIC POOL . The reports of great losses of individuals and of pools were declared by them to be largely exaggerated . So , for instance , the story that the Southern Pacific pool had lost $17,000,000 : " The Southern Pacific pool , " said a banker , " held only 400,000 shares of $40 , - 000,000 par value . At the highest prices this block represented a market value of about $32,000,000 . At to-day 's prices the market value is about $24,000,000 , a difference of $8,000,000 . This would be the loss on paper , but as a matter of fact the average price at which this stock was accumulated was probably not much higher than what - it is now , so that the actual losses could not have been very large . " Similar unloading of pools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Ohio , and in one or two other stocks . There was during the afternoon a story in circulation that announcement had been made on the floor of the Stock Exchange that failures would be announced at 3 o'clock sharp . Many people who heard the rumor telephoned to the Exchange shortly after 3 o'clock . The officers of the Exchange absolutely denied that such an announcement had been made . " Some years ago , " said one of them , " such a decline would have resulted in the crash of many firms . To-day Stock Exchange houses are In a much stronger position . " From several bankers It was ascertained that all calls for margin had been promptly ' complied with . There was a report that one banking institution was in trouble , but the President of the Clearing House and the Bank Examiner both denied that this was true . The situation itself was described in this way by the President of one of the biggest banks of Wall Street : " What has happened is exactly what a great many people have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a buying movement for nearly five years . Naturally , this must be followed by a selling movement . No one who had foresight ' enough was hurt much by this decline , although it came suddenly . All such declines come suddenly . The country at large , the farming , industrial , railroad , and banking interests are all in good shape , earning money and prosperous , so that when this liquidation has exhausted itself the sky in , Wall Street will assume again a friendlier aspect . " Reports that several of the large banks bad called many loans were authoritatively denied . Call money was around 6 per cent . There were no important developments in the money market . WESTERN CONTINGENT 'S LOSSES . There is much speculation in Wall Street as to how great have been the losses of the so-called " Western contingent " ? for admittedly the interests have suffered heavily as a result of the market 's continued decline . Not unnaturally none of the parties interested would - stand for " admissions of heavy losses , but it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of pocket . These were " the Gates crowd , " ' the Moore crowd , " and the Lawson interests in Boston . In the case of the Gates people one story had it that Mr. Gates himself was out $7,000,000 , although there were reports that he had in fact been a gainer by the slump of the past few days . As for the Moores , . it was pointed out that they had started in to buy control of Northwest when it was around 210 . They were thought to have sold on the advance to above 270 , while " the Gates crowd " trailed on in the belief that the Moores were still.buying . This of course is only gossip , but what is not gossip but fact is that one of the Gates people took a loss of over half a million dollars on 10,000 shares privately transferred the other day to the Vanderbilts at 204 , the average purchase price being 258 . Another fact is that John W. Gates on his return from Europe some weeks ago started bulling Baltimore and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down twenty points from the high figure reached then and the latter over twelve points . Yet that Mr. Gates was not so badly hurt would appear from the fact that at the bottom prices yesterday Charles Gates . his son , was a buyer of Baltimore and Ohio . The Gates people were also known to be interested in St. Paul , New York Central , Chesapeake and Ohio , and Illinois Central , all of which are down ' considerably . The leading stock in which the Moores are interested is Rock Island , which they control , and a decline in which would , it is believed , not affect them inasmuch as their stock is owned outright . The conspicuous members of the so-called Gates crowd are John W. Gates . John Dupee . John Lambert . Isaac L. Elwood , and John Drake , while the members of " the Moore crowd " are J. H. Moore , W. H. Moore , H. C. Frick. and Pittsburg steel men generally , D. G. Reid , W. B. Leeds , and John J. Mitchell , President of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself , and has no wellknown associates in his deals . Representatives of these interests on the Street who were seen yesterday afternoon were practically unanimous in denying any heavy losses . The Moore people wished a clear distinction drawn between themselves and the Gates interests . saying that it had become too common to identify Mr. Gates with all the Western interests . and that as a matter of fact he had nothing in common with some big Western operators . The assumption in these quarters seemed to be that the Gates crowd had lost heavily , the representatives of the Moores saying that they had got out of the market some time ago , and were , as one hanker put it , " on Easy Street . " John W. Gates himself was out of town . but one member of his firm said : " The West has lost no more than anybody else . Everybody was in on the market , and the decline affected the East as much as it did the West " At the office of Counselrna.n R. : Co .. who have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been buyers on the break more than sellers . and that they knew of no large losses . Practically the same statement was made at the office of &; Marshall . . who have some big Western operators among their customers The - effect of tho hea.vy slump , it was said . had been profitable on account of selling out at the top notch prices and getting ready for the decline . The Street generally , howilver , was inclined to credit enormous losses to the Western operators . and this formed the staple subject of gossip around the closing hours . Mr. Gates was supposed to have been the heaviest sufferer , and no mention was made of any big individual losses of any East.rn interest except in the case of Mr. Lawson .
