WE may compare the human mind to a city . It has its streets , its places of business and amusement , its citizens of every degree . When one person is introduced to another it is as if the warder drew back the bolts , and the gates were thrown open . If he comes well recommended he is given the freedom of thecity . In the exercise of this freedom , however , the stranger should show due caution . There is usually a new quarter . Here the streets are well lighted and policed , the crowds are cosmopolitan , and the tourist who wanders about looking in the shop windows is sure of a civil reply to deleted material of flowering briers would have had still further interest . When one 's intellectually slothful neighbor points with pride to portions of his untilled fields , we must not be too hard upon him . We also have patches of our own that are more picturesque than useful . Even if we ourselves are diligent husbandmen , making ceaseless war on weeds and vermin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tenderness when the ploughshare of criticism turned up a prejudice of your own ?

Itsdeleted material You would have been very angry if any one had trampled upon it . This is the peculiarity about a prejudice . It is very appealing to the person who holds it . A man is seldom offended by an attack on his reasoned judgments . They are supported by evidence and can shift for themselves . Not so with a prejudice . It belongs not to the universal order ; ? it is his very own . All the chivalry of his nature is enlisted in its behalf . He is , perhaps , its only defense against the facts of an unfriendly world . We can not get along without making allowances for these idiosyncrasies of judgment . Conversation is impossible where each person insists on going back , all the time , to first principles , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who is incapable of changing his point of view we can not converse ; we can only listen and protest . We are in the position of one who , conscious of the justice of his cause , attempts to carry on a discussion over the telephone with " Central . " He only hears an inhuman buzzing sound indicating that the line is busy . There is nothing to do but to " hang up the ' phone . " When a disputed question is introduced , one may determine the true conversationalist by applying the method of Solomon . Let it be proposed to divide the subject so that each may have his own . Your eager disputant will be satisfied , your genial talker is aghast at the proposition , for he realizes that it would kill the conversation . Instead of holding his own , he awaits developments . He is in a mood which can be satisfied with something less than a final judgment . It is not necessary that his friend 's opinions should be just ; it is sufficient that they are characteristic . Whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temper . He is a heresy hunter , ? not the grim kind who go hunting with a gun ; he carries only a camera . If he stirs up a strange doctrine he does not care to destroy it . When he gets a snap-shot at human nature he says , An English gentleman relates a conversation he had with Prince Bismarck . The prince was inclined to take a pessimistic view of the English people . He thought that there was a degeneration in the race , which he attributed to the growing habit of drinking water . " Not that he believed that there was any particular virtue per se inherent in alcoholic drink ; but he was sorry to hear that the old three bottle men ' were dying out and leaving no successors . He had a suspicion that it meant shrinkage in those qualities of the English which had made them what they were in the past , and for which he had always felt a sincere admiration . " It would have been very easy to drift into debate over this proposition . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

It is true that a certain section of English society has indeed taken to water as a beverage . But to argue therefrom that the English people have become addicted to water would be to draw premature conclusions from insufficient data . In this way I was able to calm Prince Bismarck 's fears in regard to what the future might bring forth , and our conversation reverted to Royalty . " Each nation has its own set of preconceptions . We must take them altogether , or not at all . They are as compact and as natural a growth as the concentric layers of an onion . Here is a sentence from Max Miller 's Autobiography , thrown out quite incidentally . He has been telling how strange it seemed , when first coming to Oxford , to find that the students got along without dueling . Fighting with swords seemed to him the normal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the German universities " pistol duels are generally preferred by theological students because they can not easily get a living if the face is scarred all over . " This remark must be taken as one would take a slice of the national onion . One assumption fits into another . To an Englishman or an American there is an incongruity that approaches the grotesque , ? because our prejudices are different . It all becomes a matter-of-fact statement when we make the proper assumptions in regard to dueling in general and theological duels in particular . Assuming that it is necessary for theological students to fight duels , and that the congregations are prejudiced against ministers whose faces have been slashed by swords , what is left for the poor theologues but pistols ? Their method may seem more dangerous than that adopted by laymen , but Max Muller explains that the danger is chiefly to the seconds . Individual peculiarities must be taken into account in the same way . Prince Bismarck , in dining with the Emperor , inquired the name of the brand of champagne , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emperor explained , I drink it from motives of economy , as I have a large family ; then again I drink it from patriotic motives . ' Thereupon I said to the Emperor , ' With me , your Majesty , patriotism stops short in the region of my stomach . ' " It is evident that here was a difference not to be arbitrated by reason . If the Emperor could not understand the gastronomic limitations to the Chancellor 's patriotism , neither could the Chancellor enter into the Emperor 's anxieties , as he economized for the sake of his large family . One can not but wonder at the temerity of a person who plunges into conversation with a stranger without any preliminary scouting or making sure of a line of retreat . Ordinary prudence would suggest that the first advances should be only in the nature of a reconnoissance in force . You may have very decided prejudices of your own , but it is not certain that they will fraternize with those of your new acquaintance . There is danger of falling into an ambush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Son of Sirach , ? " Many have fallen by the edge of the sword , but not so many as have fallen by the tongue . " The mischief of it is that the most kindly intent will not save us . The path of the lover of mankind is beset by difficulties for which he is not prepared . There are so many antagonisms that are unpredictable . When Nehemiah came to rebuild the walls of Jerusalem he remarked grimly , " When Sanballat the Horonite , and To-blab the servant , the Ammonite , heard of it , it grieved them exceedingly that there was come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel ; " and the trouble was that a large number of the children of Israel themselves seem to have resented the interference with their habitual misfortunes . The experience of Ne- // hernial ' is that of most reformers . One would suppose that the person who aims at the greatest good for the greatest number would be greeted with instant applause . The difficUlty is that the greatest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One does not need to believe in human depravity to recognize the prejudice which most persons have against anything which is proposed as good for them . The most successful philanthropists are those who most skillfully conceal their benevolent intent . In Coleman 's Life of Charles Reade there is a paragraph which gives us a glimpse of a prejudice that has resisted the efforts of the most learned men to eradicate it . An incident is there recorded that took place when Reade was a fellow in Magdalen College . " Just as I was about to terminate my term of office ( I hope with credit to myself and the ' Varsity ) an untoward incident occurred which embittered my relations for life with two very distinguished men . Professor Goldwin Smith and his friend John Conington , who belonged to us , had attempted to inaugurate a debating society . A handful of unmannerly young cubs , resenting the attempt to teach them political economy , ducked poor Conington under the college pump . " " Resenting the attempt to teach them political economy ! " ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has fathomed the abyss of the dark prejudice which the natural man has against those who would improve his mind ? It is a feud which reaches back into hoar antiquity . Doubtless the accumulated grievances of generations of schoolboys have intensified the feud , but no amelioration of educational methods has put an end to it . In the most successful teacher you may detect a nervous strain like that which the trainer of wild beasts in the arena undergoes . His is a perilous position , and every faculty must be on the alert to hold the momentary ascendency . A single false motion , and the unmannerly young cubs would be upon their victim . Must we not confess that this irrational resentment against our intellectual benefactors survives , in spite of all discipline , into mature life ? We may enlarge the area of our teachableness , but there are certain subjects in regard to which we do not care to be set right . The polite conventionality according to which a person is supposed to know his own business is an evidence of his sensitiveness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A man 's own business is just the thing he is conscious of not knowing , and he would give anything in a quiet way to find out . Yet when a candid friend ventures to instruct him , the old irrational resentment flashes out . What we call tact is the ability to find before it is too late what it is that our friends do not desire to learn from us . It is the art of withholding , on proper occasions , information which we are quite sure would be good for them . The prejudice against our intellectual superiors , which leads us to take their well-meant endeavors in our behalf as of the nature of personal insults , is matched by the equally irrational repulsion which many superior people have for their inferiors . Nothing can be more illogical than the attitude of these gifted ones who use their gifts as bludgeons with which to belabor the rest of us . When we read the writings of men who have a stimulating sense of their own genius , we are struck by their nervous irritability whenever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the quarrels of the authors , which the elder Disraeli chronicled , arose from the fact that the authors had the habit of accusing one another of this vice . One would suppose mediocrity to be the sum of all villainies , and that the mediocre man was continually plotting in the night watches against the innocent man of genius ; and yet what has the mediocre man done to 668 An Hour with our Prejudices . deserve this detestation ? Poor fellow , he has no malice in him His mediocrity is only an afterthought . He has done his level best ; his misfortune is that several million of his fellow men have done as well . The superior man , especially if his eminence be accidental , is likely to get a false notion of those who stand on the level below him . The biographer of an English dignitary says that the subject of his memoir was not really haughty , but " he was apt to be prejudiced against any one who seemed to be afraid of him . " This is a not uncommon kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is unfounded . The great man should remember that most of those whose manners seem unduly respeetf ul mean nothing personal . As great Pompey passes through the streets of Rome , he may be pardoned for thinking meanly of the people . They appear to be a subservient lot , with no proper interests of their own , their happiness dependent on his passing smile , ? and he knows how little that is worth . He sees them at a disadvantage . Let him leave his triumphal chariot , and , in the guise of Third Citizen , fall into friendly chat with First Citizen and Second Citizen , and his prejudices will be corrected . He will find that these worthy men have a much more independent and self-respecting point of view than he had thought possible . They are out for a holiday ; they are critics of a spectacle , easily pleased , they will admit ; but if no one except Pompey is to be seen to-day , why not make the most of him ? Pompey or Caesar , it matters not ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ origin of some of our prejudices must be sought in the childhood of the race . There are certain opinions which have come down from the cave dwellers without revision . They probably at one time had reasons to justify them , though we have no idea what they were . Thereare others , which seem equally ancient , which originated in the forgotten experiences of our own childhood . The prehistoric age of myth and fable does not lie far behind any one of us . It is as if Gulliver had been educated in Lilliput , and , while he had grown in stature , had never quite emancipated himself from the Lilliputian point of view . The great hulking fellow is always awkwardly trying to look up at things which he has actually outgrown . He tries to make himself believe that his early world was as big as it seemed . Sometimes he succeeds in his endeavors , and the result is a curious inversion of values . Mr. Morley , in speaking of Lord Palmerston 's foreign policy , says : " The Sultan 's ability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord Palmerston was sanguine of Turkish civilization . " This association of ideas in the mind of the Prime Minister does seem odd till we remember that before Lord Palmerston was in the cabinet he was in the nursery . The fugitive impressions of early childhood reappear in many curious shapes . Who would be so hard-hearted as to exorcise these guiltless ghosts . Sometimes , in reopening an old book over which long ago we had dreamed , we come upon the innocent source of some of our long-cherished opinions . Such discovery I made in the old Family Bible when opening at the pages inserted by the publisher between the Old Testament and the Apocrypha . On many a Sunday afternoon my stated hour of Bible reading was diversified by excursions into these uncanonical pages . There was a sense of stolen pleasure in the heap of miscellaneous secularities . It was like finding under the church roof a garret in which one might rummage at will . Here were tables of weights and measures , explanations about shekels , suggestions in regard to the probable length of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the word " and " occurred in the Bible . Here , also , was a mysterious deleted material going about it regularly , we wait for some extraordinary occasion . We make it a point of sportsmanship to shoot our grievance on the wing , and we are nervously anxious lest it get out of range before we have time to take aim . Not so the protesting Briton . He approves of the answer of Jonah when he was asked , " Doest thou well to be angry for the gourd ? " Jonah , without any waste of words , replied , " I do well to be angry . " When the Englishman feels that it is well for him to be angry , he finds constitutional means provided . Parliament furnishes a number of permanent objects for his disapproval . Whenever he feels disposed lie can make a good stout protest , feeling assured that his indignation is well bestowed . He has such satisfaction as that which came to Mr. Micawber in reading his protest against the villainies of Uriah Heep : " Much affected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the letter and handed it with a bow to my aunt , as something she might like to keep . " These stout - hearted people have learned not only how to take their pleasures sadly , but , what is more to the purpose , how to take their sadnesses pleasantly . We Americans have , here , something to learn . We should get along better if we had a number of argument-proof questions like that in regard to marriage with the deceased wife 's sister which could be warranted to recur at regular intervals . They could be set apart as a sort of public playground for the prejudices . It would at least keep the prejudices out of mischief . Religious prejudice has an air of singularity . The singular thing is that there should be such a variety . If we identify religion with the wisdom that is from above , and which is " first pure , then peaceable , easy to be entreated , without partiality , " it is hard to see where the prejudice comes in . The religious element has the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nitro-glycerine . This latter , we are told , is " a compound produced by the action of a mixture of strong nitric and sulphuric acids on glycerin at low temperatures . " It is observable that in the making of religious prejudice the religion is kept at a very low temperature , indeed . We are at present in an era of good feeling . Not only is there an interchange of kindly offices between members of different churches , but one may detect a tendency to extend the same tolerance to the opposing party in the same church . This is a real advance , for it is always more difficult to do justice to those who differ from us slightly than to those whose divergence is fundamental . To love our friends is a work of nature , to love our enemies is a work of grace ; the troublesome thing is to get on with those who are " betwixt and between . " In such a case we are likely to fall between nature and grace as between two stools . Almost any one can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trifles is like trying to use a large screw-driver to turn a small screw . In a recently published correspondence between dignitaries of the Church of England I find many encouraging symptoms . The writers exhibit a desire to do justice not only to the moral , but also to the intellectual , gifts of those who differ from them even slightly . There is , of course , enough of the old Adam remaining to make their judgments on one another interesting reading . It is pleasant to see brethren dwelling together in unity , ? a pleasure seldom prolonged to the point of satiety . Thus the Dean of Norwich writes to the Dean of Durham in regard to Dean Stanley . Alluding to an opinion , in a previous letter , in regard to Archbishop Tait , the writer says : " I confess I should n't have ranked him among the great men of the day . Of our contemporaries I should have assigned that rank , without hesitation , to little Stan , though I quite think he did more mischief in our church and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Still I should say that little Stan was a great man in his way . " There you may see a mind that has , with considerable difficulty , uprooted a prejudice , though you may still perceive the place where the prejudice used to be . While the methods of the exact sciences have had a discouraging effect on partisan and sectarian prejudices , they seem , for the moment , to have given new strength to those which are the result of differences in race . Time was when Anti-Semitism derived its power from religions rancor . The cradle hymn which the Puritan mother sang began sweetly , lint after a while the mother thinks of the wickedness of the Jews : In these days , the Anti-Semites are not so likely to be angry while they sing , as while they cast up their accounts . The natural sciences discriminate between classes rather than between individuals . Sociology deals with groups , and not with persons . Anthropology acquaints us with the aboriginal and unmoralized man . It emphasizes the solidarity of the clan and the persistence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the sub-conscious and instinctive life . For its purpose it treats a man as a series of nervous reactions . Human history is being rewritten as a branch of Natural History . Eliminating the part played by personal will , it exhibits an age-long warfare between nations and races . This is all very well so long as we remember what it is that we are studying . Races , cults , and social groups exist and have their history . There is no barns in defining the salient characteristics of a race , and saying that , on the whole , one race is inferior to another . The difficulty comes when this rough average is made the dead line beyond which an individual is not allowed to pass . In our Comedy of Errors , which is always slipping into tragedy , there are two Dromios on the stage , ? the Race and the Individual . The Race is an abstraction which can bear any amount of punishment without flinching . You may say anything you please about it and not go far wrong . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it . Who is offended at the caricatures of Brother Jonathan or of John Bull ? We recognize certain persistent national traits , but we also recognize the element of good-humored exaggeration . The Jew , the Slav , the Celt , the Anglo-Saxon , have existed for ages . Each has admired himself , and been correspondingly disliked by others . Even the Negro as a racial abstraction is not sensitive . You may , if you will , take up the text , so much quoted a generation ago , " Cursed be Canaan ; a servant of servants shall Ise be . .. . God shall enlarge Japheth , and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem ; and Canaan shall be his servant . " Dromio Africanus listens unmoved to the exegesis of Petroleum V. Nasby and his compeers at the Crossroads : " God cust Canaan , and sed he shood be a servant forever . Did he mean us to pay him wages ? Not eny : for of he bed he wood hey ordered our tastes and habits no es we shood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impassive Genius of Africa answers the Anglo-Saxon : " If it pleases you to think that your prejudice against me came out of the Ark , so be it . If you find it agreeable to identify yourself with Japheth who shall providen- daily be enlarged , I may as well be Canaan . " So long as the doctrinaires of the Crossroads are dealing only with highly generalized conceptions no harm is done . But now another Dromio appears . He is not a race ; he is a person . He has never come that way before , and he is bewildered by what he sees and hears . Immediately he is beset by those who accuse him of crimes which some one who looks like him has committed . He is beaten because he does not know his place ; how can he know it , stumbling as he does upon a situation for which he is altogether unprepared ? It is an awkward predicament , this of being born into the world as a living soul . Under the most favorable conditions it is hard for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his environment . But this victim of mistaken identity finds that he has been judged and condemned already . When he innocently tries to make the most of himself a great uproar is created . What right has he to inter-fere with the preconceived opinions of his betters ? They understand him , for have they not known him for many generations ? Poor man Dromio ! Whether lie have a black skin or a yellow , and whatever be the racial type which his features suggest , the trouble is the same . He is sacrificed on the altar of our stupidity . He suffers because of our mental colorblindness , which prevents our distinguishing persons . We see only groups , and pride ourselves on our defective vision . By and by we may learn to be a little ashamed of our crudely ambitious generalizations . A finer gift is the ability to know a man when we see him . It may be that Nature is " careful of the type , " and " careless of the single life . " If that be so , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up our anxieties about the type , knowing that Nature will take care of that . Such relief from cosmic responsibility will give us much more time for our proper work , which is to deal justly with each single life .
