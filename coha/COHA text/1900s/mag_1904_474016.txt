can not expect that the wisest men of our remotest posterity , who can base their conclusions upon thousands of years of accurate ob ? servation , will reach a decision on this subject without some measure of reserve . Such being the case , it might appear the dictate of wisdom to leave its considera ? tion to some future age , when it may be taken up with better means of informa ? tion than we now possess . But the ques ? tion is one which refuses to be postponed so long as the propensity to think of the possibilities of creation is characteristic of our race . The issue is not whether we shall ignore the question altogether , like Eve in the presence of Raphael ; but whether in studying it we shall confine our speculations within the limits set by sound scientific reasoning , Essaying to do this , I invite the reader 's attention to what science may suggest , admitting hi advance that the sphere of exact knowl ? edge is small compared with the possibili ? ties of creation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more or less probable conclusions . The reader who desires to approach this subject in the most receptive spirit , should begin his study by betaking him ? self on a clear moonless evening , when he has no earthly concern to disturb the serenity of his thoughts , to some point where he can lie on his back on bench or roof , and scan the whole vault of heaven at one view . He can do this with the greatest pleasure and profit in late sum ? mer or autumn ? winter would do equally well were it possible for the mind to rise so far above bodily conditions that the question of temperature should not enter . The thinking man who does this under circumstances most favorable for calm thought , will form a new conception of the wonder of the universe . If summer or autumn be chosen , the stupendous arch of the Milky Way will pass near the zenith , and the constellation Lyra , led by Yor C1X. ? No , 651-99 its beautiful blue Vega of the first magni ? tude , may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will be seen the constellation Aquila , marked by the bright Altair , be ? tween two smaller but conspicuous stars . The bright Arcturus will be somewhere in the west , and , if the observation is not made too early in the season , Aldebaran will be seen somewhere in the east . When attention is concentrated on the scene the thousands of stars on each side of the Milky Way will fill the mind with the consciousness of a stupendous and all-embracing frame , beside which all human affairs sink into insignificance . A new idea will be formed of such a well-known fact of astronomy as the motion of the solar system in space , by reflecting that throughout all human history , the sun carrying the earth with it has been flying toward a region in or just south of the constellation Lyra. with a speed beyond all that art can produce on earth , without producing any change apparent to ordi ? nary vision in the aspect of the constella ? tion . Not only Lyra and Aquila , but every one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were seen by our earliest ancestors just as we see them now . Bodily rest may be ob ? tained at any time by ceasing from our labors , and weary systems may find nerve rest at any summer resort ; but I know of no way in which complete rest can be ob ? tained for the weary soul ? in which the mind can be so entirely relieved of the burden of all human anxiety ? as by the contemplation of the spectacle presented by the starry heavens under the condi ? tions just described . As we make a feeble attempt to learn what science can tell us about the structure of this starry frame , I hope the reader will allow me to at least fancy him contemplating it in this way . The first question which may suggest itself to the inquiring reader is : How is it possible by any methods of observation yet known to the astronomer to learn any ? hing about the universe as a whole ? We may commence by answering this ques ? tion in a somewhat comprehensive way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is , shows certain charac ? teristics of a unified and bounded whole . It is not a chaos , it is not even a collec ? tion of things , each of which came into existence in its own separate way . If it were , there would he nothing in common between two widely separate regions of the universe . But , as a matter of fact , science shows unity in the whole struc ? ture , and diversity only in details . The Milky Way itself will be seen by the most ordinary observer to form a single structure . This structure is , in some sort , the foundation on which the uni ? verse is built . It is a girdle which seems to span the whole of creation , so far as our telescopes have yet enabled us to de ? termine what creation is ; and yet it has elements of similarity in all its parts . What has yet more significance , it is in some respects unlike those parts of the universe which lie without it , and even unlike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our system is now situated . The minute stars , individual ? ly far beyond the limit of visibility to the naked eye , which form its cloud ? like agglomerations , are found to be mostly bluer in color , from one extreme to the other , than the general average of the stars which make up the rest of the universe . There are two points in the sky called poles of the Milky Way , which bear the same relation to it that the north and south poles of the earth hear to the equa ? tor : they lie in opposite directions and are each 90 ? from the central line of the milky arch . The careful counts of stars made since the time of the Herschels show that , as a general rule , there are fewest stars on a given surface of the sky round the galactic poles ( as those of the Milky Way arc called ) and that their thickness gradually increases as we ap ? proach the great girdle itself . This fea ? ture of the sky will , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without a telescope , who will see that the stars are somewhat more numerous along the out ? skirts of the Milky Way than around its poles . The regions of the heavens occu ? pied by the poles of the Milky Way are as far apart as two points in the sky can be . And yet , the most careful counts of the stars show that , although they are fewer in number around these poles than elsewhere , they are about equally thick in these two opposite directions . For every point in the sky there is an opposite point , one of the two being below the horizon when the other is above it . The relation is that of our antipodes to us . It is a noteworthy feature of the universe that a certain resemblance is found in any two opposite regions of the sky , no mat ? ter where we choose them . If we take them in the Milky Way , the stars are more numerous than elsewhere ; if we take opposite regions in or near the Milky Way , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; if we take them in the region anywhere around the poles of the Milky Way , we shall find fewer stars , but they will be equally numerous in each of the two regions . We infer from this that whatever cause determined the num ? ber of the stars in space was of the same nature in every two antipodal regions of the heavens . Another unity marked with yet more precision is seen in the chemical elements of which stars are composed . We know that the sun is composed of the same chemical elements which we find on the earth and which we resolve in our labora ? tories . These same elements are found in the most distant stars . It is true that sonic of these bathes seem to contain elements which we do not find on earth . But as these unknown elements are scat ? tered from one extreme of the universe to the other , they only serve still farther to enforce the unity which runs through the whole . The nebula are composed , in part at least , of forms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are ac ? quainted . But , different though they may be , they are alike in their general character throughout the whole field we are considering . Even in such a feature as the proper motions of the stars , the same unity is seen . The reader doubtless knows that each of these objects is flying through space on its own course with a speed comparable with that of the earth around the sun . These speeds range from the smallest limit up to more than one hundred miles a second . Such diversity might seem to detract from the unity of the whole ; but when we seek to learn something definite by taking their aver ? age , we find this average to be , so far as can yet be determined , much the same in opposite regions of the universe . Quite recently it has become probable that a certain class of very bright stars known as Orion stars ? because there are many of them in the most brilliant of our constel ? lations ? which are scattered along the whole course of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general average , slower motions than other stars . Here again we have a definable characteristic extend ? ing through the universe . In drawing attention to these points of similarity throughout the whole universe , it must not be supposed that we base our con ? clusions directly upon them . The point they bring out is that the universe is in the nature of an organized system ; and it is upon the fact of its being such a sys ? tem that we are able , by other facts , to reach certain conclusions as to its struc ? ture , extent , and other characteristics . One of the great problems connected with the universe is that of its possible extent . How far away are the stars ? One of the unities which we have de ? scribed leads at once to the conclusion that the stars must be at very different distances from us ; probably the more dis ? tant ones are a thousand times as far as the nearest ; possibly even farther than this . This conclusion may , in the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to be scattered equally throughout those regions of the universe which are not connected with the Milky Way . To illustrate the principle , suppose a farmer to sow a wheat-field of entirely unknown extent with ten bushels of wheat . We visit the field and wish to have some idea of its acreage . We may do this if we know how many grains of wheat there are in the ten bushels . Then we examine a space two or three feet square in any part of the field and count the number of grains in that space . If the wheat is equally scattered over the whole field , we find its extent by the simple rule that the size of the field bears the same proportion to the size of the space in which the count was made that . the number of grains sown bears to the number of grains counted . If we find ten grains in a square foot , we know that the number of square feet in the whole field is one-tenth that of the number of grains sown . So it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are sown equally through space , the extent of the space occupied must be proportional to the number of stars which it contains . But this consideration does not tell us anything about the actual distance of the stars or how thickly they may be scat ? tered . To do this we must be able to de ? termine the distance of a certain number of stars , just as we suppose the farmer to count the grains in a certain small extent of his wheat-field . There is only one way in which we can make a definite measure of the distance of any one star . As the earth swings through its vast an ? nual circuit round the sun , the direction of the stars must appear to be a little different when seen from one extremity of the circuit than when seen from the other . This difference is called the paral ? lax of the stars ; and the problem of measuring it is one of the most delicate and difficult in the whole field of practi ? cal astronomy . The nineteenth century was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? omer were brought to such perfection as to admit of the measurement . From the time of Copernicus to that of Bessel many attempts had been made to measure the parallax of the stars , and more than once had some eager astronomer thought him ? self successful . But subsequent investi ? gation always showed that he had been mistaken , and that what he thought was the effect of parallax was due to some other cause , perhaps the . imperfections of his instrument , perhaps the effect of heat and cold upon it or upon the atmosphere through which he was obliged to observe the star , or upon the going of his clock . Thus things went on until 1837 , when Bessel announced that measures with a heliometer ? the most refined instrument that has ever been used in measurement ? showed that a certain star in the con ? stellation Cygnus had a parallax of one-third of a second . It may be interesting to give an idea of this quantity . Suppose oneself in a house on top of a mountain looking out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another mountain one hun ? dred- miles away . One is allowed to look at that distant house through one edge of the pane of glass and then through the opposite edge ; and he has to determine the change in the direction of the distant house produced by this change of one foot in his own position . From this he is to estimate how far off the other mountain is . To do this , one would have to measure just about the amount of parallax that Besse ' found in his star . And yet this star is among the few nearest to our system . The nearest star of all , Alpha Centauri , visible only in latitudes south of our middle ones , is perhaps half as far as Bessel 's star , while Sirius and one or two others are nearly at the same distance . About one hundred slurs , all told , have had their parallax measured with a greater or less degree of probability . The work is going on from year to year , each successive astronomer who takes it up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ? self of better instruments or to use a bet ? ter method . But after all , the distances of even some of the one hundred stars carefully measured must still remain quite doubtful . One general result of these measures of parallax may be set forth in this way : Imagine round our solar system as a centre ( for in matters relating to the uni ? verse our whole system is merely a point ) , a sphere with a radius 400,000 times the distance of the sun . An idea of this dis ? tance may be gained by reflecting that light , making the circuit of the earth seven times in a second , and reaching us from the sun in eight minutes and twenty seconds , would require seven years to reach the surface of the sphere we have supposed . Now , the first result of meas ? ures of parallax is that within this enor ? mous sphere there is , besides our sun in the centre , only a single star ; namely , Alpha Centauri . ? Now suppose another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun , so that its surface is twice as far as that of the inner sphere . By the law of cubes the volume of space within this second sphere is eight times as great as that within the first . So far as can be determined , there are about eight stars within this sphere . We can not be quite sure of the number , because there may be stars within the sphere of which the parallax is not yet detected ; and of those supposed to be within it , one or two are so near the surface that we can not say whether they are really within or with ? out it . But the number eight is not egregiously in error . We may imagine the spheres extended in this way indefinitely , but the result for the number of stars within them becomes uncertain owing to the increasing diffi ? culties of measuring parallaxes so minute . The general trend of such measures up to the present time is that the number of stars in any of these spheres will be about equal to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for this unit the smallest and innermost of the spheres , having is radius 400,000 times the sun 's distance . We are thus enabled to form some general idea of how thickly the stars are sown through space . We can not claim any numerical exactness for this idea , but in the absence of better methods it does afford us some basis for reasoning . Now we can carry on our computation as we supposed the farmer to measure the extent of his wheat-field . Let us suppose that there are 125,000,000 stars in the heavens . This is an exceedingly rough estimate , but let us make the supposition for the time being . Accepting the view that they are nearly equally scattered throughout space , it will follow that they must be contained within a volume equal to 125,000,000 times the sphere we have taken as our unit . We find the distance of the surface of this sphere by extracting the cube root of this number , which gives us 500 . We may , therefore , say , as the result of a very rough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be contained within a distance found by multiplying 400,000 times the distance of the sun by 500 ; that is , that they are contained within a region whose boundary is 200,000,000 times the dis ? tance of the sun . This is a distance through which light would travel in about 3300 years . It is not impossible that the number of stars is much greater than that we have supposed . Let us grant that there are eight times as many , or one thousand millions . Then we should have to extend the boundary of our universe twice as far , carrying it to a distance which light would require 6000 Years to travel . There is another method of estimating the thickness with which stars are sown through space , and hence the extent of the universe , the result of which will be of interest . It is based on the proper motion of the stars . One of the greatest triumphs of astronomy of our time has been the measurement of the actual speed at which many of the stars are moving to or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spectroscope . Unfortu ? nately , they can be best made only on the brighter stars ? at least , those plainly visible to the naked eye . Still the mo ? tions of several hundreds have been measured and the number is constant ? ly increasing . A certain general result of all these measures and of other estimates may be summed up by saying that there is a gen ? eral average speed with which the indi ? vidual stars move in space , and that this average is about twenty miles per second . We are also able to form an estimate as to what proportion of the stars move with each rate of speed from the lowest up to a limit which is probably as high as 150 miles per second . Knowing these propor ? tions we have , by observation of the proper motions of the stars , another method of estimating how thickly they are scattered in space ; in other words , what is the volume of space which , on the average , contains a single star . This method gives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifty per cent . than that derived from the measures of parallax . That is to say , a sphere like the second we have proposed , having a radius 400,000 times the distance of the sun , and therefore a diameter 800,000 times this distance , would , judging by the proper motions , have ten or twelve stars contained within it , while the measures of parallax only show eight stars within the sphere of this diameter having the sun as its centre . The probabilities are in favor of this last result . But , after all , the discrepancy does not change the general character of the conclusion as to the limits of the visible universe . If we can not estimate its extent with the same certainty that we can determine the size of the earth , we can still form a general idea of it . The estimates we have made are based on the supposition that the stars are equally scattered in space . We have good reason to believe that this is true of allthe stars except those of the Milky Way But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half the whole number of stars visible with a telescope , and the question may arise whether our results are serious ? ly wrong from this cause . This question can best be solved by yet another method of estimating the average distance of cer ? tain classes of stars . The parallaxes of which we have heretofore spoken consist in the change in the direction of a star produced by the swing of the earth from one side of its orbit to the other . But we have already remarked that our solar system , with the earth as one of its bodies , has been journeying straight forward through space during all historic times . It follows , therefore , that we are continu ? ally changing the position from which we view the stars , and that , if the latter were at rest , we could , by measuring the ap ? parent speed with which they are moving in the opposite direction from that of the earth , determine their distance . But since every star has its own motion , it is impossible , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparent motion is due to the star itself , and how much to the motion of the solar system through space . Yet , by taking general averages among groups of stars , most of which are prob ? ably near each other , it is possible to esti ? mate the average distance by this method . When an attempt is made to apply it , so as to obtain a definite result , the astrono ? mer finds that the data now available for the purpose are very deficient . The proper motion of a star can be determined only by comparing its observed position in the heavens at two widely separate epochs . Observations of sufficient pre ? cision for this purpose were commenced about 1750 at the Greenwich Observatory , by Bradley , then Astronomer Royal of England . But out of 3000 stars which he determined , only a few are available for the purpose . Even since his time , the determinations made by each generation of astronomers have not been sufficiently complete and systematic to furnish the material for anything like a complete de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determine a single position of any one star involves a good deal of com ? putation. and if we reflect that , in order to attack the problem in question in a satisfactory way , we should have observa ? tions of a million of these bodies made at intervals of at least a considerable fraction of a century , we see what an enormous task the astronomers dealing with this problem have before them , and how imperfect must be any determination of the distance of the stars based on our motion through space . So far as an estimate can be made , it seems to agree fairly well with the results obtained by the other methods . Speaking roughly , we have reason , from the data so far available , to believe that the stars of the Milky Way are situated at a distance between 100,000,000 and 200,000,000 times the distance of the sun . At dis ? tances less than this it seems likely that the stars are distributed through space with some approach to uniformity . We may state as a general conclusion , indi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that - nearly all the stars which we can see with our telescopes are con ? tained within a sphere not likely to be much more than 200,000,000 times the distance of the sun . The inquiring reader may here ask an ? other question . Granting that all the stars we can see are contained within this limit , may there not be any number of stars without the limit which are in ? visible only because they are too far away to be seen ? This question may be answered quite definitely if we grant that light from the most distant stars meets with no obstruc ? tion in reaching us . The most conclu ? sive answer is afforded by the measure of starlight . If the stars extended out in ? definitely , then the number of those of each order of magnitude would be nearly four times that of the magnitude next brighter . For example , we should have nearly four times as many stars of the sixth magnitude as of the fifth ; nearly four times as many of the seventh as of the sixth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually found that while this ratio of increase is true for the brighter stars , it is not so for the fainter ones , and that the increase in the number of the latter rapidly falls off when we make counts of the fainter telescopic stars . In fact , it has long been known that , were the uni ? verse infinite in extent , and the . stars equally scattered through all space , the whole heavens would blaze with the light of countless millions of distant stars sepa ? rately invisible even with the telescope . The only way in which this conclusion can be invalidated is by the possibility that the light of the stars is in some way extinguished or obstructed in its passage through space . A theory to this effect was propounded by Struve nearly a cen ? tury ago , but it has since been found that the facts as he set them forth do not justify the conclusion , which was , in fact , rather hypothetical . The theories of mod ? ern science converge toward the view that , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can ever be lost , no matter how far it may travel . But there is another possible cause for the existence of light . During the last few years discoveries of dark and therefore invisible stars have been made by means of the spectroscope with a success which would have been quite incredible a very few years ago , and which , even to-day , must excite won ? der and admiration . The general conclu ? sion is that , besides the shining stars which exist . in space , there may be any number of dark ones , forever invisible in our telescopes . May it not be that these bodies are so numerous as to cut off the light which we would otherwise receive from the more distant bodies of the universe ? It is of course impossible to answer this question in a positive way , but the probable conclusion is a negative one . We may say with certainty that dark stars are not so numerous as to cut off any important part of the light from the stars of the Milky Way , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be so clearly seen as it is . Since we have reason to be ? lieve that the Milky Way comprises the more distant stars of our system , we may feel fairly confident that not much light can be cut off by dark bodies from the most distant region to which our tele ? scopes can penetrate . Up to this dis ? tance we see the stars just as they are . Even within the limit of the universe as we understand it , it is likely that more than one-half the stars which actually exist are too faint to be seen by human vision , even when armed with the most powerful telescopes . But their invisi ? bility is due only to their distance and the faintness of their intrinsic light , and not to any obstructing agency . The possibility of dark stars , therefore , does not invalidate the general conclu ? sions at which our survey of the subject points . The universe , so far as we can see it , is a bounded whole . It is sur ? rounded by an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , appears as the Milky Way . While we can not set exact limits to its distance , we may yet confidently say that it is bounded . It has uniformities running through its vast extent . Could we fly out to distances equal to that of the Milky Way , we should find compara ? tively few stars beyond the limits of that girdle . It is true that we can not set anydefinite limit and say that beyond this nothing exists . What we can say is that the region containing the visible stars has some approximation to a boundary . We may fairly anticipate that each succes ? sive generation of astronomers , through coming centuries , will obtain a little more light on the subject ? will be enabled to make more definite the boundaries of our system of stars , and to draw more and more probable conclusions as to the exist ? ence or non-existence of any object out ? side of it . The wise investigator of to ? day will leave to them the task of putting the problem into a more positive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
