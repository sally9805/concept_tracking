txt William Jennings Bryan lectured on Moral Issues " last night in the concert Hall of the Madison Square Garden before a crowded house , which , enthused by his Impassioned oratory , applauded his remarks in a way long to be remembered by all present . Every seat in the place - was - occupied. and scores were content to stand tip . In the audience there were many wo'men , although fully one-third of the people In the body of the house were clergymen . According to a member of the Entertainment Committee the invitation extended to clergymen to occupy seats in the boxes was responded to largely by Roman Catholic priests and rabbis . Neither Dr. Parkhurst nor the Rev. Newell Dwight Hillis was discernible . The speaker was greeted vociferously at various stages of his address , and his comments on the corruption of the voter was the signal for loud responses , till he nad to hold up his hands as a signal that he wished to continue . Mr. Bryan spoke tirelessly except when he reached his climaxes , when his voice became husky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fancy of the audience particularly , but toward the end , ashen he began to unfold his schema of finance , toe audience tecame undemon -- -Etrative . ' When Mr. Bryan stepped onto the platform . unescorted. and started to unfold his manuscript , he was greeted with cheers and applause which lasted fully three minutes . and seemed to shake the very foundations of the building . Mr. Bryan , smiling in a satisfied way , sat down until the audience was quiet . Then he rose and said in the main : A PRIVATE CITIZEN 'S PLEA . " You were invited to this meeting because I wanted to present for your consideration a subject which I deem important  --  the moral issue which you can not evade even if you desire to do so . " I have preferred to speak independently of any organization because I do not care to embarrass any friend or supporter who may differ from me in opinion . Those who supported me in two campaigns have done so . I presume , because they thought my election would be beneficial to the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which , I was capable . Both I and they , therefore , are left to pursue in the future as wd have in the past the course that seems to us best . " I do not speak with authority ; I am not a candidate for any office ; I am neither asking favors at your hands nor am I in a position to bestow favors upon you . If I were , many would be here who are not . Laughter . I am only a private citizen , and I can prove by the editorial pages of nearly all of our leading dailies that I have excellent prospects of remaining a private citizen during the remainder of my life . " But think not that this prospective obscurity has been forced upon me by unfortunate circumstances or by cruel fate . These same infallible witnesses , the newspapers , have told you how I have twice thrown away the Presidency by voluntary adherence to certain policies which are obnoxious to these papers . " I can even prove by an interview which appeared in yesterday morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was within my grasp  --  a prominence easily mine if I had only followed the advice of one of your distinguished financiers , Mr. Joseph C. Hendrix . who is accepted as authority by all who make money their god . He is quoted as saying : " ? if Mr. Bryan had come here from Europe and said that he had learned a great deal in his trip abroad , and declared that he was convinced that it would be a desirable thing for ail Democrats to get together , he would be a great man , and his influence would have been greatly increased . By his present course he is killing himself : " Not only have I lost an opportunity to be great ? Applause spurned it , as it were , real greatness , greatness 24 karat fine , with its weight and purityplainly stamped upon the bar ; but I ' killing myself ' ? surely , if Mr. Hendrix is to be believed  --  and I quote him not because he deserves special notice , but because , having left us in 1856 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last seven years have been giving our party advice instead of votes .

Because they are indefinite in their language . I want to know what they are getting toTlethz er for , whether to defend rights or to enter upon a course of pillage . I am not willing to borrow greatness from Mr. Hendrix and his associates without first inquiring what security will be required of me and what rate of interest will be demanded on the loan . " I did profit by my trip to Europe . In every country in Europe there is a party , sometimes small , with its face toward the rising sun of democracy , and there is everywhere also a party which opposes , even v-hen it can not wholly obstruct , every effort to make the voice of the people potent in government and the interests of the people paramount in legislation . " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There will always be some party which espouses the cause of the common people , end that Harty will necessarily present a moral issue and mike Its appeal to tale conscience . I want my party to take this pc sition , and yet I am anxious that every other party shall , if possible , be brought into the same attitude . " When I tell you that the first and most important object of government is not money making er the extension of commerce . or even the care of property , but rather the protection of human rights . I ern not asserting an original proposition . I am not promulgating a Western theory . am simply giving expression to a funda // BRYAN LECTURES ON " MORAL ISSUES " // mental truth that very many have recognized in the past . ? , those who still believe in a Declaration of Independence , it ought to be sufficient to define the purpose of government as it is therein defined , namely , to secure to the individual the enjoyment of his inalienable rights . ' LOYALTY TO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that it is too much influenced in its operations by men whose only loyalty is loyalty to the money bags . Who will say that this is or can be a noble loyalty ? And yet in this great commercial centre  --  in the very City of New York  --  this worship of the money bags has been carried as far as it has anywhere else in this country . How many prominent men have you in this city , either in the Democratic Party or the Republican Party , who are brave enough to defy the influence of the money bags ? Occasionally a protest is heard from the pulpit against the business methods of Wall Street . " Occasionally a voice is raised against some particular manifestation of commercialism , some new evidence of the degradation that it has wrought ; but why are your leaders in religion , in business , and in polities not grappling with the vicious principle that is responsible for the present demoralization of political life  --  namely , the theory that Government can properly be used as the means of bringing pecuniary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay ? ' has been substituted for ' Is it right ? ' and as a consequence our legislative assemblies , City , State , and National , are becoming auction rooms in which governmental privileges are knocked down to the highest bidder . " Is it strange that two Senators have been indicted for ' selling their political influence ? Is it strange that Government officials and members of Congress have been interesting themselves in Government contracts ? IS it strange that boodle investigations are bringing to light wholesale corruption in State and municipal Govern-ment ? " Is it strange that many obscure voters use their suffrage , the only political asset they have , as a source of pecuniary profit , when they see more prominent citizens using the Government for private gain ? " I had- a letter recently from a man in Indiana . It was a pathetic appeal . He said : ' Why do n't you get out of the leadership of the Democratic Party so that we can have some money ? Until you were nominated we had all the money we needed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1896 . ' I can feel sorry for that man , and yet , my friends , I am not willing ' to surrender to him to get money : " If I had no other reason for attempting to exert some influence in the- Democratic Party there would be reason enough in the fact that I might be able in some degree to prevent my party from mortgaging itself to organized wealth . Loud applause . WANTS LAW AND ORDER . " I might suggest that you are not going to make people respect Government or laws unless you enforce the laws against the small and large violators alike . Some were afraid that I would not enforce the law . They knew that there was not in this country one more in favor of law and order than I. They know now that there is not in this country a man who would be further than I am from permitting any man , be he farmer , laborer , or trust magnate , to violate the law . What is wanted is a man that will apply the law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones , and put the stripes on where they belong . Great applause . " One evidence that our party was honestly seeking to secure justice to the masses in 1896 and in 1900 is to be found in the fact that our campaign funds were insignificant in both campaigns , although more individuals contributed than had ever contributed before . And what further evidence is needed of the corrupt bargain made by the Republican Party with the corporations than you have in the prompt enactment of legislation desired by the protected interests and by the financiers , and by the failure of that party to interfere with the rapacity of the trusts ? " In 1892 the Democratic Party collected a large campaign fund from the corporations . It spent more ** in the two States of New York and Indiana . One , trust contributed 8175,000 , and in all the close States there - was , money to buy . every purchasable voter , and what was the result ? The most plutocratic tedfnihiStration this country had ever known . We witnessed a surrender to organized and predatory wealth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from power have not entirely removed the stain from the party . " I - would be glad to see those who left us in 1896 return ; and those who are Democratic in sentiment , and in sympathy have either already returned or will return when they understand the situation ; but I verily believe that if during the past seven years our leaders had spent half as much time reasoning with honest eRpublicans as they have spent in trying to conciliate corporation Democrats , our party would be very much stronger to-day . " In attempting to discuss the question of morals as applied to imperialism I have felt some hesitation in the matter . But I want to say that if we stop the tide of imperialism we must stop it by an . appeal to the conscience of the people . I have been surprised at the way some people have felt about th.a matter of imperialism . Some have even said that they thought it might be God 's work , after all . Did you ever notice how quick some people are to see the hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laughter and applause . THE ISTHMIAN CANAL . No plea of profit can justify the killing of human beings in order to extend trade or to force a foreign Government on an unwilling people . In the action of our Government in the Panama case , what principle controls ? Was it a jealous care for our so-called commercial interests , or a scrupulous regard for National honor and . the rights of the people of Central Amer-ica ? The Isthmian Canal has been delayed years to please the transcontinental railroads . Could we not have delayed a few weeks more rather than subject our Government to the suspicion of coercing a little republic for our own gain ? " Instead of inquiring whether a trust magnate can possibly be benevolent , or whether a trust does not sometimes reduce prices temporarily : instead of spending our time trying to discriminate between bad trusts , and trusts not quite so bad , we should rather ask ourselves whether any economic advantage that a private monopoly can bring can compensate for the destruction of individual independence , whether any group of men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the highway , giving their victims a choice between surrendering money arcs losing life . " In discussing the money question , instead of asking merely whether one standard will help one class or another , one section or another , the aim should be to adopt that system of finance which will give us - the nearest approach to justiee as between man and man , and this end can not be reached by delegating this question to financiers  --  a class which , with occasional exceptions . has in all history thrown its powerful weight against reforms . , It is not a question of , gold or silver , these are but incidents . It is a question whether the money changers shall control the volume of money and the National Treasury . " The whole protective tariff system is built upon supposed pecuniary profit to those who vote for it . The manufacturers are to be paid for their support with higher prices , the laboring man with better wages , the wool growers with more remunerative markets for their wool , and the others who vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money which goes out of their pockets through tariff taxation returns in some invisible way , bearing compound interest with it . A direct bounty . which our Supreme Court has called larceny under the form of law , would be much less harmful than a protective tariff , because its evils are more easily estimated . " Instead of calculating whether a 42 per cent . tariff will pay more than a 47 per cent . tariff , we should ask ourselves whether the Government , acting for all the people , has any moral right to turn the taxing power over to any class on any ground whatever . And we should also consider whether a protective tariff could possibly offer a business advantage which would compensate for the demoralization caused by the lobbyiets who infest Washington , and by the corporation funds that have been fried out of the tariff barons . " How can we restore respect for the doctrine of self-government , how can we eight the trusts , how can we obtain a just financial system , how can we oppose a high tariff , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the election of Senators by popular vote , if we are willing . to put the party hi the hands of those who profit by present laws , arid stand ready to stranglei any movement that gives the . people hope of relief in any direction ? " The Democratic Party must be more than an organization bent upon feeding its members out of the flesh pots . The Democratic Party must not be converted into a varietYtheatre , with an entire change of programme promised for each campaign . " The first step forward for any party is to write an honest platform , and how better can an honest purpose be proved than by an honest platform ? " The Kansas City platform was an honest platform , and it dealt honestly with the people . In that platform imperialism was declared to be the paramount . issue . Is imperialism less objectionable to-day than it was four years ago ? Have its principles changed ? Some believe , and I am among them , that we should reaffirm the position taken four years ago on that subject . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1900 ? I believe they are even more dangerous than they were when the Kansas City platform was written . Some  --  and I am among then  --  believe that we should . maintain against the trusts the position taken four years ago and make the platform even stronger , if possible . Let those who oppose reaffirmation , whether they favor the trusts or favor a different remedy , present their views clearly and definitely . PLEA FOR BIMETALLISM . " The ? Kansas City platform , following the Chicago platform , declared for bimetallism , and pointed out the means of securing it . Nothing has arisen to discredit the principle of bimetallism . The increased production of gold and the better times that have followed an increase in the circulation have , on the ctriltrary , vindicated the quantitative theory of money , although the world has not yet been relieved of the necessity for silver . This Nation must be bimetallic or monometallic , and if monometallic it must consider what the effect will be if we assist in driving all the - world to a gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold as use it now . " And the ratio ? If we are to have bimetallism at all , what other ratio is there than the present that is seriously supported ? Let no one deceive himself or be deceived by the argument that the money question is settled . " The proposition to make silver redeemable in gold , the proposition to retire silver , or withdraw its legal tender qualities , the proposition for an asset currency , the proposition for branch banks , the proposition known as the Aldrich bill , for the loaning of public money to favored banks  --  all these are parts of the money question , and no concessions will please the financiers that does not cover all of these questions and make Wall Street influence supreme in the councils of the party . That is evident from the fact that those who want to ignore the money question are very careful to advocate for President only those who are known to take the Wall Street view of finance . " Some , I among them , believe that the money plank , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ platform , should be reaffirmed . Let those who are opposed to this plan offer a platform which suits them . Will they indorse the gold standard outright ? They dare not do it . Will they declare for bi-metallism at some other ratio ? They have no intention of doing so . Those who oppose bi-metallism at the present ratio do not want bi-metallism under any circumstances . " What will they do ? If they have their way they will attempt a confidence game upon the people  --  they will prepare a platform so ambiguous , so uncertain , and so meaningless that , like the platform proposed by one of your New York papers recently , . it would suit the Republican Party as well as the Democratic Party . ? " When the next Democratic Convention convenes and undertakes to write . a. new platform , it will find the last one a model of clearness and conciseness and of'square dealing ; and- I hope that the delegates Cd the convention will be instructed by the various States to indorse it . And if they indorse it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , applying the same principles to new questions . " And how about candidates ? It does not matter much what the name Of the Presidential candidate Is , but it does matter what he stands for . It does not matter much from what section he comes , but It does matter in what direction he , is go " - ing to lead the party . " This is not a sham battle in which we are about to engage . It is intensely real and terribly earnest . We need candidates whose records are such as to inspire courage in Democrats  --  such as appeal to the conscience of Republicans . Love , a great philosopher has declared , is not stupid , and those who love Democratic principles will certainly not be so stupid as to select a candidate whose past is indefensible , whose present position is inscrutable , or hose future conduct can be a matter ofw conjecture . " And how shall our committee conduct the campaign ? Not by the - purchase of votes , or by the corruption of citizenship , but by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the American people . Let the Republican Party be challenged to meet the moral issue presented  --  this is Democratic , this is patriotic . Let this be done , and unless reason and love of country have fled , we shall fight without being ashamed . If we lose . it will be but a temporary defeat , and will bring no disgrace with it . If we win . the victory will mean much for our country and for the world . " " I am going to be in the city to-morrow , " Mr. Bryan said after the lecture when asked about his plans for the future . " I have some private work to do which will confine my attention for three or four hours . On Thursday I speak in the evening at Burlington , N. J. ' Mr. Bryan denied that he had any appointments with political leaders here , or that they had made any overtures to him . After most of the audience had gone , Mr. Bryan , accompanied by his wife and a small crowd who clung to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his carriage . A man cried out was he was about to leave : tI voted foe you- twice , Mr. Bryan . and I hope I can make it three straight . " As he entered his victoria the crowd gave him three cheers .
