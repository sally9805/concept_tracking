 |p657  @# NO two events in British history of the closing year offered such a striking contrast as the Coronation in the Abbey of Westminster and the meeting of the Colonial Conference , which were held in London about the same time . In the former , everything that the artistic imagination of the British race could suggest or employ was done in order to create a superb spectacle and to elaborate a ceremony which for splendor and beauty would attract the attention of mankind . The other was entirely devoid of the accessories of pomp or splendor . Half a dozen men in plain clothes met in private conference in one of the rooms at the Colonial Office , but the public was not admitted to their deliberations , nor have any reports of their debates been published . Yet the scene in the Abbey , magnificent in its pomp and pageantry , was a mere theatricality of history ? homage paid by the present to the past ? an act interesting , poetical and religious in its way , but without any direct bearing upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coronation , the King would have reigned , Parliament would have legislated , and events would have taken their course exactly in the same way as they are doing now . But at the Colonial Conference the men of the present were shaping the destinies of the future . They have shaped them negatively but potently in such a way that their meeting will constitute one of the landmarks of empire . The scene in the Abbey witnessed and paid tribute to the majesty of the English tradition , to the unbroken continuity of a historical development which links together a thousand years . It is true that the 658 THE CORONATION A21  |p658  monarchy is little more than a splendid apparition whose glories belong to the bygone centuries . But while the Abbey said it was , " the conference at the Colonial Office said it will be . " Yet the coronation and the conference formed two inseparable parts of one whole . It is because the crown has become nothing but a golden symbol of sovereignty , from which the reality has departed , that the Empire exists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ center of the motherland there is cherished an institution which , while exciting interest and commanding respect , is nevertheless peremptorily forbidden to exercise any dominion over the semirepublican commonwealths which dwell within its borders . The political significance of the conference , largely ignored at the time of its meeting , will be seen in its true proportions in years that are to come . For what the Colonial Conference did was to decide definitely , once for all , that the Chauvinist dream of a militant empire , closely compacted together in all parts , available for common action against a common foe , is an unrealizable ideal . Sir Wilfrid Laurier representing the Dominion of Canada , and Sir Edmund Barton representing the great @# Commonwealth of Australia , made it unmistakably clear to Mr. Chamberlain and the English ministers that their despatch of contingents to assist in the war against the Boers in South Africa was in no sense to be taken as a precedent , and that neither of these two great self-governing communities were willing to consent in advance to participation in any war in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colonial Conference has tended to clarify the ideas of Englishmen , and has compelled them to recognize the limitations of their power . The British Empire is not an empire in the ordinarily accepted sense of the word . It is not even a federation in the American sense . Canada and Australia are independent , self-governing republics , which are much less closely united to the mother country tha ? any American state is united to the federal power . Since the great Civil War of the sixties , no American state would venture to claim the right to secession , much less would they venture to assert a right to remain neutral should the United States be involved in a war . Far different is it with the British colonies . They claim the right , and their claim is recognized , not only to secede if they decide  |p659  that their interests would be better served by a declaration of independence , but they further claim , and this is also recognized , to decide as if they were sovereign states whether or not they will take part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappointed Chauvinist angrily remarked , the ties which bind Austria and Germany together are infinitely closer than those which unite Great Britain to her self-governing colonies beyond the seas . The colonies are quite willing to call themselves subjects of His Majesty , King Edward , but on the well-understood condition that at any future crisis they shall have absolute liberty of choice as to whether they shall or shall not take part in any of the military or naval enterprises in which the Empire may he involved . Such partnership and limited liability is possible . To no other partnership would they listen for a moment . The nominal sovereignty of King Edward VII . they are ready to acknowledge with all loyal protestations of affection , but , as Sir Wilfrid Laurier has declared again and again during his stay in London , any attempt to bind them together in a firm fighting-alliance , so that the ruler of the Empire at Downing Street could touch a button and compel them to embark in war at England 's bidding , would inevitably shiver the Empire into fragments . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but Mr. Seddon 's attendance at the Conference was probably his last public appearance as Premier of New Zealand . The coronation , as it was originally fixed for the twenty-sixth of June , was a festival very different from that which actually took place on the ninth of August . The sudden illness of the King and the operation which it necessitated acted with sobering effect upon public feeling . The ceremony in the Abbey gained in impressiveness , but outside the walls of that ancient and famous edifice the ceremony created little excitement . None who were present on that occasion can forget the stately sublimity and profoundly religious effect of the solemn rites which , like a great organ-peal of melody , proclaimed the formal assumption by the King of his functions as constitutional monarch . The ceremony of the coronation has been so frequently described that it would be superfluous to dwell upon the ceremonial itself . What surprised most of those who @#  |p660  were present was the extent to which the religious character of the ceremony asserted itself , subduing into comparative insignificance the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The fact that the central figure had escaped from the jaws of death aided the general effect , and gave the touch of awe requisite to compel reverence even in the most frivolous freethinker privileged to be present . The coronation in England is the nearest approach which the British make to an American presidential election . In the United States the citizens have the excitement of choosing their chief magistrate once every four years . In the United Kingdom it is more than sixty years since there was a coronation . It is only natural that they made the most of it . To the outside observer the chief use of a presidential election in the United States is not by any means the choice of a president . Probably either of the presidential candidates at any of the recent elections would have made a very good president . The difference between them has often been a matter of tweedledum and tweedledee . The question as to which should occupy the White House might often have been decided quite as wisely and much more eco-@# nomically by drawing lots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But a president chosen in any of these cheap and easy methods would interest nobody , and his election would lose its chief value ? which is the development of a sense of national unity among all citizens . It is difficult to exaggerate the importance of these quadrennial contests in which for a period of several months everything that press , platform , poster and procession can do is done for the purpose of compelling seventy millions of people to concentrate their thoughts upon one and the same subject , and to identify the welfare and prosperity of their country with the election of the candidate of their choice . But for these quadrennial turmoils , when the thought of the nation as a unity is brought most forcibly before the minds of all , it is , to say the least . somewhat doubtful whether the vast , varied and heterogeneous communities scattered over the continent that divides the Atlantic from the Pacific would have held together . What the presidential election is to Americans , the coronation is to the British . It serves the same purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unity ; it makes all men think at the same time of the same subjects ; it incarnates the  |p661  whole nation in the person of an individual . It reminds the whole world-scattered race of the existence of a center common to them all , of one institution which towers aloft superior to all party conflict , the heirloom and ornament of the whole people . In the presence of such a national function , the personality of the individual who happens to be crowned counts for as little as the character of Caiaphas affected the sacerdotal importance of the Jewish high priest . It may be permitted to a Britisher to remark that , regarded from this point of view , the British system of advertising national unity by a coronation has some advantages over the American plan of effecting the same object by means of a presidential election . From the historical standpoint there is no comparison . The coronation is a great object-lesson in history . It is a vast living picture , every figure in which recalls the sovereigns and statesmen of vanished centuries . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glorious stage which the present generation of mortals has inherited from its ancestors , the whole instinct with political symbolism and historical suggestion . The coronation reminds the dull , average , commonplace person that William the Conqueror , Richard Coeur de Lion , Edward Longshanks , Harry of Agincourt , bluff King Hal , good Queen Bess , were no mythic figures in the legendary saga , but real flesh-and-blood men and women who lived and reigned and were crowned in the very same abbey and in the very same way as His Majesty Edward VII . was crowned . Thomas Carlyle once remarked to me that he regarded the Chinese as standing at the forefront of mortal men , because they more than any others cultivated the sentiment of reverence for their ancestors . The English do not worship their ancestors ? for the most part the masses have forgotten they ever existed . But once in a while , when some celebration like a coronation occurs , they wake up to a consciousness of the splendor of their historic inheritance . English history is like the " storied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the stained glass are often unnoticed owing to the lack of light . But at certain hours , when the rays of the setting sun flood the long aisles with radiance , the once darkened window glows resplendent with the pictures of heroes and of saints . What the slanting rays of the setting sun do for the windows , such a ceremony as a coronation does for the famous episodes of English history . It  |p662  recalls us to the past , it reminds us of the making and the makers of England , and links us as no presidential election can ever do to the long procession of worthies who , with sweat of brow and outpoured blood , lived and labored and fought and died that we might enter into their labors . The coronation has another great advantage over the presidential election as an element making for national unity , in that it concentrates the thought of the nation upon one person instead of , as in America , upon two . No presidential election terminates without leaving nearly one-half of the citizens disappointed and gloomy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elected President of the whole United States , but almost one-half of the citizens had been saying and hearing for a month before his election that the peace and prosperity of the whole country was bound up in his defeat . The American president , when installed , represents the triumph and victory of one party , the discomfiture and defeat of the other . At the British coronation the ceremony is raised above all party strife . The King , being deprived of all political power , is elevated to the position of a mere symbol , the animated effigy necessary to display the crown to which he serves as a human pedestal . Of course it may be urged on behalf of the presidential election that it is infinitely superior to the coronation as an education in politics . That is true . There is no comparison . No political issue is raised , discussed or settled by the coronation . In that respect the presidential election should be paired off against our general election of members of the House of Commons . It occurs on an average about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is thick with politics . It may be said by a superficial observer that a presidential election is supe- rior to a British coronation because it is the supreme affirmation of the sovereignty of the people . But , if closely looked at , the coronation may be seen to constitute a still more decisive demonstration of the political supremacy of the people . The citizens of the United Kingdom have so effectively drawn the teeth and clipped the claws of the royal lion that they amuse themselves by keeping it for ornament and recreation as a kind of tame poodle . The consciousness of power is much more effectively manifested by toleration than by extirpation . When the English people were afraid of their kings they made a clean sweep of the insignia of royalty . They would do so again if they imagined that Edward VII . would attempt to exercise any of the sovereign authority claimed by Charles I. But to the average Englishman this is simply unthinkable . Demos has taken to himself , once for all , the power of the kingship ; why should he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloak borne by a royal lay-figure ? Demos himself can not find a crown to fit his myriad heads . Even if he could , the wearing of pot-hats is more natural to him than " the gilded sorrow " which circles the temples of kings . A royal personage thoroughly well trained to know that there is nothing behind the ceremonial , but at the same time impressed with its tremendous importance , will play the principal role in the great historic ceremony much better than anyone else . There will also be less difficulty in connecting him with the real things than if he were some stage-player hired for the show . By heredity he is directly descended from most of the doughty warrior-monarchs whose dust moulders in the Abbey . He has a proper family pride in the right ordering of the great ceremonial . This brings me to the charge which is often brought against King Edward VII. ? that he takes the Coronation too seriously . @#  |p663  The Editor of THE COSMOPOLITAN , when entrusting me with the handling of this subject , expressed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but on the contrary vigorously trounce the sacred person because for these last months his royal mind has been preoccupied with questions of coronets and tippets , with the fastening of a buckle or the length of a lady 's train , instead of attending to the grave duties of statesmanship . Why should he fret himself about the tithing of much anise and cummin , and neglect the weightier matters of the law ? It is a very natural observation to make , but with the gracious leave of the Editor , of whom , as being far more absolute monarch of his magazine than Edward VII . is of Great Britain , I stand in much more dread , I venture to suggest with all humility that Edward VII. , being the man that he is , could hardly be more usefully employed than in playing ? as he does to perfection ? the part of stage-manager for the great historical pageant in which he is the central figure . Queen Victoria after her husband 's death found it necessary to forswear almost all ceremonial functions in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself so diligently to the practise of statecraft that long before she died she was more versed in the art of governing her empire than any of her ministers . She had a better memory , better tact and more acquaintance with affairs than any of her advisers . Hence , she continuously exercised a great personal influence in the affairs of state . But it was personal to herself . Her throne gave her the opportunity of exercising it , but that was all . A goose on the throne would only be more conspicuously a goose . When the Queen died , she left her throne to her first-born son , but the qualities by which she had redeemed the monarchy went down with her into her tomb . She was succeeded by Albert Edward , who was crowned on August ninth as Edward VII . The resolute and tenacious character of his mother he did not inherit , but he is not without ambitions . The imperial authority of his nephew , the Kaiser , has from time to time roused in him a spasm of envious regret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most anxious to give pleasure to others . But he has not got in him the stuff to play a great role in the state . A Peter the Great in his place or a Frederick the Great or a President Roosevelt could , no doubt , in the present collapse of party government  |p664  in England , do almost anything he pleased . But Edward VII . is neither Peter nor Frederick nor Roosevelt . He is not a lazy man , but neither can it be said that he is a devotee of the strenuous life . Doomed to pass the first sixty years of his life in a position of little responsibility , jealously shut out from the exercise of any authority by the Queen , he has come to the throne in his declining years , without the spring and energy of youth , without the trained experience of a life passed in harness , and without any inspiring ideal to goad him into action . Why , then , should he be blamed for not aspiring to a role for which he is consciously incapacitated and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I have no great admiration for the statesmanship of the present British cabinet . But heaven forbid that any one should seek to temper the aggressiveness of Mr. Chamberlain and the indolence of the Duke of Devonshire by superadding to all the qualities of the many-headed cabinet the fitful , capricious , easy-going irresolution of the King ! His mother was the most persistent , some might say obstinate , of mortals . She made up her mind firmly @# and held her ground resolutely . Every one knew where the Queen stood , what the Queen meant . She was a fixed , definite , and , on the whole , very valuable factor in the problem . But the King , her son ! His views of any question would always be the x , the unknown quantity of the problem , and unfortunately it would be an x of a constantly shifting quantity . The King is not by any means unintelligent . He is bright enough , and he has had unrivalled opportunities of improving his by no means contemptible natural gifts . IIe can , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The worst of it is he can not stick to it . " Tot homines tot sententiae " applies to him in a novel sense . For he is of as many opinions as there are people who talk to him . He is facile to a fault . Talk to him at ten o'clock , and no one can be more sane and sensible . Go back at three o'clock , and you will find him of just the opposite way of thinking . His mind is like a polished mirror which reflects for the moment whatever is before it , but on its smooth surface reflection succeeds reflection without leaving a trace behind . He has been the despair of friend after friend , of counsellor after counsellor . This fatal lack of continuity even in prejudices , which @#  |p665  are usually most tenacious , renders him a waste force in political affairs . No one ever knew where he would turn up in any division . It would depend largely upon his mood and still more largely upon the last crony with whom he happened to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the King to magnify his kingly office and emulate the all-devouring activity of his nephew in Germany ? We have no objection to profiting by the wisdom and common sense of a wise and sagacious sovereign like Victoria , but that is because wisdom and common sense are too rare qualities for us to flout them because their owner wears a crown . But no British subject has any desire to impute to the Crown a thaumaturgic faculty of inspiring its wearer with a capacity for statecraft . If Edward VII . possessed it we should not debar him from using it because of his kingship . We have progressed so far from the old monarchical idea that we no longer regard the coronation as a disqualification for political service . But that is the very antipode of the belief assumed in the editorial reproach that the King , being a king , ought to meddle in the affairs of State . We do n't mind him doing so if he has anything helpful to suggest or anything useful to do , but if he has not he had much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruler in the land , has still ample scope in which to exert himself . Even as first master of ceremonies in the Empire his post would be no sinecure . But he is much more than that . This year he was charged with the duty of seeing to it that the great state pageant of the Coronation was properly staged , that every scene so far as possible was carefully rehearsed , that all the performers were suitably attired , and that , in short , everything was arranged decently and in order . This might bore some men . It suited the King " down to the ground . " He has always had a passion for questions of etiquette , of ceremonial and of uniform . At any time a button more or less , an order worn on the wrong side of the breast , excited him more than grave questions of legislation . They belonged to his domain . Hence in looking after the staging of the Coronation he was in his glory . Here was something for which he had a natural genius . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ile had every detail at his fingerends . Why not leave him to do without cavilling , nay rather with honest appreciation for such zeal in the discharge of such apparently unimportant duties ? If we pay  |p666  a tribute of applause to the skill of the stage-manager at the opera-house , is the stage-manager of Westminster Abbey to go unrecognized or to be rewarded only with sneers because , ignoring the work he is not fit for , he drudges diligently away at the humbler duties which have been entrusted to him to discharge ? There was a king once who upbraided his courtiers for paying excessive attention to ceremony . " Your Majesty , " replied a courtier , " forgets that you yourself are only a ceremony . " King Edward VII . never forgets it , and in his reign he will see to it that ceremony hath due respect paid unto its majesty . Leaving these preliminary observations and coming to the actual Coronation itself , it is full of interesting and suggestive features . Of course it is no longer a real thinsg , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more or less theatrical spectacle , which only its deep historical significance can save from a charge of blasphemy . The whole ceremony of the coronation is based upon the assumption that the man to be crowned is the man who is going to govern the realm . The progress of democracy has demolished this foundation , and the ceremony therefore is essentially unreal . There is just enough reality of influence left to the sovereign to save the whole thing from being a mockery and a farce . But the British mind , conservative of old traditions , condones these outrages upon reverence and reality by reflecting that the coronation , after all , deceives nobody , least of all the Supreme Being who is constantly addressed as if the whole ceremony was instituted for His worship , and that the great pageant is interesting both as a historical object-lesson and as a symbolic representation of ideas of government which can never become obsolete . It is a distinctly good thing that the monarch ? who in his person is all the more symbolic of all governing men because he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the symbolic office ? should not be crowned until he has first sought and obtained the approval of the people , and secondly that , having obtained that popular choice , he should at once publicly , in the sight of all men , humble himself on his knees before the Deity and make thankoffering of gold and vestments in token of his gratitude to Divine Grace . It is also an admirable thing that before  |p667  the king can be crowned he must be put through a careful catechism , and made to promise on oath faithfully to discharge his duties to the people . Not until that oath is taken , both by word of mouth and by signature in the presence of all the people , can any prince be crowned King of England . The doctrine of popular sovereignty finds much more picturesque expression in the quaint but simple ceremony in the Abbey than it does in any of the more prosaic republics . It has been well said that the British constitution is to the American what the Catholic Church is to the Protestant . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there is a clinging to symbol , to ceremonial , to elaborate ritual , and an anxious desire not to break even a single link of the chain which binds us to the distant past . In the United States , as in churches of the Protestant Communion , there is throughout a stern simplicity and a constant appeal not to the senses but to the reason . As high mass is to the administration of the sacrament in the Presbyterian church , so is the coronation of a British king to the inauguration of an American president . In essence they are , however , both the same thing . What can be said in ridicule of the entire ceremonial is obvious . But is it not better , instead of letting off cheap and mayhap vulgar witticisms at the expense of royalty reduced to be the mere emblematical figure in a historical pageant , to try to understand what it all once meant , what the inner soul of the thing was , and whether even in this advanced twentieth century the quaint old ceremonial may not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crown the mayor of Greater New York , but is it not necessary to surround his office with symbols , picturesque and suggestive of tae immense responsibility , and to remind the multitudinous polyglot cosmopolitan crowd of the city that those whom they install in office by their votes recognize their responsibility to a higher than any earthly tribunal ? Is it quite impossible to combine with the stern simplicity of the Republic some element of the profoundly religious conception which inspires every part of the English Coronation Service ? No one can be more opposed than I am to any approximation to officialism in religion or to the fatal oldworld union between Church and State , but can nothing be done to give modern political institutions something of the historic charm and the religious aureole which constitutes the distinguishing characteristics of the English Coronation ?
