" And while there was still but a faint light of the morning , and as we marched up a sloping piece of land , there rose up many Tyrolese in front of us ? we knew them by their hats with the cocks ' leathers stuck up behind , ? and they fired fast at us ? ham ! bum ! bum ! ? and we fired at them , and we fixed bayonets , and we ran up the sloping piece of land , and the Tyrolese flew away . " That was the beginning of our battle , and although this was but a skirmish , it was a very bitter skirmish , and on both sides there were men that were struck down . " We halted . And a Tyrolese , lying on the ground , cried out : ' I am dying . Give me to drink . ' Whereat my companion stooped to offer him a flask , and as he stooped the Tyrolese struck savage at him with his bayonet , but my companion jumped back and it missed him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said you wanted a drink before you died , and now you shall die without the drink . ' And he stuck his bayonet through him as a boy would stick a pin through a fly . " The fighting soon began again , and it was very fierce . It was soon that we came to know that we were to capture a little village and the hills about the village . The village it was named San Martino , and there were walled barns and gardens , and the Austrians were very strong there . " We , the Italian soldiers , we always call that day the battle of San Martino , but the French , they call it the battle of Solferino , because they fought to take the village of Solferino , on our right , just as we fought to take that San Martino . " It was many times that we tried to take the hill ground around that village . We had many regiments and we had cavalry and we had great guns , and again and again we fired , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " All the time they , too , were firing , and shells were falling and bursting , and bullets and cannon balls were striking down our men . " There were times when their cavalry rude hard at us . They would mono with a great gallop and a rush , and of the smoke we would see them coming , the horsemen with a great shout and a waving of their swords . " But this did not hurt us sO MAI as the bullets and the shells , for our cannon would shoot at them , and we of the infantry would form quick in double rank in squares ? we had good officers , we ? and our front rank would stand or kneel , according as the horses looked little or big , and we would hold out our bayonets , so ? ? and that was a sharp fence for horses to gallop against ; and while the front rank held out their bayonets the men of the second rank were firing very fast . So always the cavalry flew away . " The bursting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us close by would be thrown down and be covered with mud and earth , but most of us would jump up again , not wounded ; but always there were some who would not jump up again , because they were wounded or dead . " At the beginning of a battle a soldier feels afraid . At the beginning of this battle I felt afraid , and I know that other men felt afraid , though it was not our first battle , and we knew what it was to be under ' fire . " So it was that , at the beginning , we commended ourselves ; we felt like death ; but soon that passed away , and we thought no more of death , but only of the killing of the Austrians . " All around me men were killed . There were heads end arms blown off , and men flew into pieces like the smashing of a jug . But we did not care , we . We thought nothing of it . I do not know that we even knew we saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I sit with you and talk of that long day . We did not notice ; and we did not think that at any moment we too might have our heads blown off or be smashed into little pieces like the breaking of a jug . " That village , it was a place that was very - hard to get . We would get the high ground there , and then those Austrians would come at us again with more men with bayonets and more horses and a great firing of guns ; and though we would fight and fight we would be pushed back again . " All the time there was a great , thundering of noise ; an incredible noise ; and the smoke was so that you could not see far except when the wind blew it a little . A great noise and a great smoke and the bursting of shells , and now we would be running at the Austrians and now the Austrians would be running at us . " Once , when we had been pushed back , we marched a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rested there for a little while , and to every man was given brandy , and our officers led us again , very brave , and again we took the hill . " Each time we took that hill with the bayonet ; and when you strike with the bayonet it is the same as what makes a madman . " It was a very fierce fight , and it was so that it went on for hours . " Our leader was our King , Victor Emmanuel , and the leader of the French , who led their great army , was their Emperor , Napoleon , and the leader of the Austrians was their Emperor , too . " While we waited once more , driven back from that hill , and panting and wild , and waiting again for the command to run at the Austrians , our King came galloping up to us , and behind him came officers . " A little man in height was our King , but he was broad and stout , and he was a quick rider , and he rode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was our King , and we shouted , loud and glad , Viva it Re ! ' I looked hard at him , knowing that he was the King , and I saw that he had great mustaches , long and curled , and his cap was gray , with a stripe , and on his shoulders was a cape coat of bluish gray that flew back when he galloped . And when they put up a statue of him , on a horse , in Bologna ( for I lived in Bologna many years , though now I live here in this little Lombardy village looking over toward Milan , which I know is across this plain ) ? when they put him on horseback in that statue I said , ' Yes , that is our King . and that is just as he looked when he galloped up to us after we had again been driven hack from San lartino . ' " He reined In his horse , and he looked at us , and he called out in a loud , strong voice , a voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must all die or we must take San Martino ! ' " I was close to him , I , and I could hear him , and even the men who could not hear him knew what he meant when ho pointed to the hill . " It was not in good Italian that he spoke to us , but in the dialect of Savny , for you know he was a man of Savoy . And it pleased us , and we all shouted : Savoy ! Savoy ! Savoy ! ' " Again , now , we ran at that hill with our bayonets fixed . They were flat and long , those bayonets , and very sharp . I remember them well ! And some of our officers ran on ahead of the bayonets , but most of them ran at one side , and a very few there were who ran close behind . But there was no one , either of officers or men , who wanted to run away . " That was a very fierce charge that we made . It was a terrible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . Our colonel fell dead . Our color-bearer fell . He was shot in the breast , and he gave a great cry and fell dead , but another man took the flag and ran on with it in the front . In such a charge it is that a man can never feel fear . I do not think it is possible to feel fear . You have no time to think of such a thing when you are close to the Austrians and see them aiming at you , while their eyes are blaring very fierce , like the eyes of eats that are angry . " We fought for a flag of the Austrians ; we tore at them and at their flag . They pulled and struck and we pulled and struck , and it was very fierce , with much noise and shouting . And after a long time we had to go down that hill again , but we took the Austrian flag with us , though it was torn into little strips and rags . And we said to each other , We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many and we have this fl.ag . ' " I think that perhaps it was about two o'clock when we charged for the King , but in such fighting you do not know of time . It is only that sometimes , when you are gasping and resting , you look up , if there is not too much smoke , and you see if the sun is high or low . " It was after this that we thought the battle was lost . We had so often run up that hill and fought the Austrians , and always we had been driven back , for always the Austrians would come against us in greater numbers . So we thought the battle was lost . " Then we heard great firing again on our right , and we knew that the : French were still fighting , and so we thought we must go on and fight too . " Sometimes we charged against artillery , and it was very hard , for those Austrians they fired the cannon till we came close , close , and men fell all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big guns and killed the men who still fought with us , we turned the guns to fire on the Austrians as they flew away , but they had driven bits of steel into the touchholes , and so we could not fire them . They were of a courage , those Austrians . " Only once in all that battle did I think much of what I saw or heard , and that was when there was the so terrible screaming of a captain who had his foot shot off . He twisted and turned as hecried out , he , and it was a very bad sound . But it is just as it chances . I saw many men who were hurt worse than that captain , and many who were blown into little bits , but I did not trouble about them . It is just if it chances so . " And it is not often that the wounded men try to trouble you while you are fighting . If they cry out , it is to say Get at those Austrians ! ' Viva Italia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is when the fighting is over that they cry so sad . " It is very often that a man does not know that lie is hurt . I remember that once there was a man near me with a great hole in his forehead , but he ran right on with us with his bayonet , and I thought , ' He will fall dead . ' But after that I saw him no more , for there was always the fighting . " Myself , I was wounded , but it was a little wound , and it did not stop me . It was a bayonet stroke , and ? yes , I will tell you , though you may not think me a hero for it . " For the stroke came not from the enemy , but from one of my own regiment , running behind me , and he shouted in my ear , Let us kill those Austrians ! ' And he was very excited , he , as he ran , and so it was that the point of his - bayonet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had no other wound than that so little one . " Most of the time we could not hear our officers , for the noise was very great , but we were trained to know that the drums and the cornets sounded our orders ; and when they sounded for a charge we were always glad and fierce , for it made a courage in us , so that we would run harder at the enemy . " Again we got together on that lower ground , regiments and regiments of us . Yes ; there were still very many of us . We looked at the hill and we looked at each other , and all along our lines ran the cry of Alla riscossa I ' Yes ; we wanted to attack once more and have revenge . Alla riseossa ! ' we cried . And again we ran at that hill and fought . " I do not know how time passed . You can not think of time . You can only think that still there is light enough to see those Austrians . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought night had come , for there was a great . blackness , and it was a terrible blackness . But it was not night . It was still the afternoon . It was a storm , and never have I seen such a storm . " The blackness and the wind and the so drenching rain ? Ali ! " We were fighting , close fighting , when the great blackness and the wind and the rain came upon us , and we still fought , for we were very angry and fierce , and the Austrians they were very angry and fierce . " The storm and the blackness , they made of us a great mixing . Yes ; it was a very great tangling , for all lines were lost , and I know that sometimes Austrians struck at Austrians , and sometimes Italians struck at Italians , for we were in a very great mixing , and very fierce in the blackness of that storm . " That storm , it helped us very much , for the great wind was at our backs and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemies , and it much confused and troubled them . Perhaps we would not have won had not that storm come and helped us , for the Austrians were very brave , and there were so many of them . " It was a terrible fighting , a terrible stabbing , in that darkness . " At last they gave way before us and went off , very slow and angry , and after that they no more took that hill from us . " It was many prisoners that we took there , and one that I took was a gunner by his cannon . And afterwards he said : ' You have saved my life . I am glad to be a prisoner ' " So for a time the noise of the battle ceased , and we listened and could not bear the boom ! boom ! boom ! from where we knew the French and their Emperor had been fighting . So we said to each other : ' It is well . We have won a great battle here , and the French too have won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eager to make charge and to fight ; and when there was silence there we knew it was because they too had won . " Early in the morning we had seen a balloon , high up , and we had said , ' The French are wise ; they are high up there , spying out where it is best to make their attack ' " Afterwards , it was told among the soldiers that the Emperor of Austria , when lie saw that his army was beaten , flew away very fast on his horse , riding right over his dead . I do not know . I did not see him . And there arc many things that you hear around your camp fires , and it is not always that they are so . " We still stood on guard , though night had now come , and it was dark with a great blackness from night and clouds . " It was well that we stood on guard and that our officers were wise , for out of the blackness there came another charge against us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long , long line , and then those Austrians were upon us , and no man could think of anything but the enemy right in front of him . " But this time they were not to send us down that hill . We fought them , very fierce , and they went away , and the battle was ended . " We were told to lie down and sleep . So we lay down where we were , among the dead and the wounded , among the Italians and the Austrians . " And we slept . Yes ; we were tired ; for we had fought hard for all that long , long day , and on that hill that at last we had gained we slept , and we gave no heed to the dead men or the wounded . " The wounded , they made very great cries , and there were men sent to go among them with lights . Some were surgeons and some were men to carry them to the field hospitals . But the most of us , we lay there and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew that with the morning there might be another fight . " No ; the dead and the wounded they did not trouble us , for a soldier must not think of such things , and so we slept on the ground among them . " We were cold , and we shivered , for although it was June there was a chill wind from the mountains , following the great storm , and the ground was soggy with rain , and every man was very , very wet , and those who could get hunches of straw or hay were very glad . " As morning came , and the music sounded . T woke with a sudden fear , for right above me was the arm of an Austrial ' , raised to strike me . I jumped up quick . But it was only a dead man , and it was that way that he had died , while his arm was raised to strike , and his face it was still very fierce , and I had rolled under his arm as I slept . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were formed in lines . And I looked at my bayonet and saw that it was covered with blood . " Brigades and regiments , they were all in a mixing , and many men they did not know where their officers were or their comrades , but music was played all ever the tattle-ground ? drums and cornets and the bands of the regiments partly for the victory and partly to get the men together . And the officers were very sharp and quick , and it was not long before we were all orderliness . Very many men of my regiment were killed . Yes ; we had suffered much . But that is part of a soldier 's duty . He shoots and he kills , and perhaps while he is thinking only of that he is himself shot and killed . Ecco ! A man must die . " We marched from the hill into that village of San Martino . We broke ranks , and we went into houses , and in many rooms there was much blood , and some said , ' They killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it is the blood from their wounded . ' And there were many dead men there . And in corners , hiding away , were wounded who could only crawl , for they feared we would kill them . " There was no food in the houses , but we went into the cellars . We went into the cellars , fur we knew that it was in the cellars that the pleasant peasants of that pleasant land kept their wine , in casks and in great bottles . " But there was no wine . No ! Of the good wine there was nothing . For the Austrians ! ? they had drunk all they could before flying away , and then they had broken the casks and the great bottles , and the good , good wine it was lost . "
