HARRIET FORDYCE ( Shaking her head ) In a bath-robe and slippers . ELLA SEAFORD How awfully romantic ? And you ? HARRIET FORDYCE ( Pantomiming ) As I 've told you . He grasped the danger in a moment , disappeared ; returned with a bath-tub full of water ; extinguished the fire ; blushed ; stammered something ; went out . ELLA SEAFORD What a delicious adventure . HARRIET FORDYCE I had been dressing to take the train . Father and Senator Barker came at once and the rest of the time was taken up wrangling in broken French about the damages . I thought I 'd lost him  --  but I met him again a month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me another service  --  but I was too sea-sick to thank him . And again I thought I 'd lost him . p. 44 ELLA SEAFORD ( Positively ) I 'd have advertised for that fellow . HARRIET FORDYCE I had to consider his feelings , remember .

HARRIET FORDYCE I had a prim old English chaperone , and my dear ! let me tell you  --  the wheel stuck . ELLA SEAFORD Stuck where ? HARRIET FORDYCE In the air  --  turned half way around , and stopped with our car on top . ELLA SEAFORD For how long ? HARRIET FORDYCE Twenty-four hours . ELLA SEAFORD Twenty-four hours ? HARRIET FORDYCE One entire day and night . ELLA SEAFORD And you did n't speak to him ? p. 45 HARRIET FORDYCE Oh , yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked him many questions about our danger . Then the night came on . A sailor man climbed up to us with sandwiches and coffee , but the wheel still stuck . My Englishman stammered something about " rest  --  and the car to ourselves  --  ( In imitation of CARDINGTON 'S speech and manner  --  stroking moustache , etc. ) and to call if we needed anything in the night , " and to our great terror but equally great relief he then climbed after the sailor man into the car behind us , which happened to have only men in it . ELLA SEAFORD How considerate . HARRIET FORDYCE Well , he was probably sleepy himself . ELLA SEAFORD And how did you get out of the car ? HARRIET FORDYCE They mended the machinery the next day . Papa and the Senator Barker came  --  late , as usual , and camped on the ground below us . When our car reached the ground , they took me and my old lady friend to the hotel , and I 'd lost my Englishman again . ELLA SEAFORD And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear , ( Pause ) I 've seen him this morning . p. 46 ELLA SEAFORD Where ? HARRIET FORDYCE Here . ELLA SEAFORD This hotel ? HARRIET FORDYCE This room . Papa and Senator Barker , as usual , are planning a sudden departure by train , but I mean to stay awhile this time . ELLA SEAFORD Perhaps the man follows you . HARRIET FORDYCE No such luck , my dear . But I hope he does n't think I follow him . ( Enter HEADWAITER . Enter ARTHUR . ) HEADWAITER One , sir ?

ELLA SEAFORD Oh ! ARTHUR WEATHERBEE You know our business with him ? Miss Seaford 's told you ? HARRIET FORDYCE Oh , yes : ARTHUR WEATHERBEE Yes  --  er  --  seems to me a chap who wishes to marry  --  qualifies quite strongly enough if he pleases the young lady  --  and her mother  --  and her father  --  and that sort of thing . Uncles  --  well , tastes differ so  --   --  p. 48 HARRIET FORDYCE It does make the requirements fairly Protean . ( To WAITER ) Check , please ! ARTHUR WEATHERBEE ( Gratefully ) Yes , does n't it ?

This is a self-addressed envelope from Berlin to Boston , forwarded to New York . Well  --  I do n't understand that . If my brother insists on writing to himself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

WILKINS The door , ma'am . Excuse me . ( Goes to door ) MISS JANE PUTNAM ( Crossing behind and down R. of settee , before which she pauses . To ELLA ) Bells on a bedroom door  --  of all the fool hotels  --   --  WILKINS ( At door ) He 's not in , Mr. Weatherbee . ARTHUR WEATHERBEE Has n't come back , then ? ( ELLA rises . ) WILKINS No , sir . ELLA SEAFORD ( Going up L. ) It 's Arthur , Auntie . Oh , Arthur ! ARTHUR WEATHERBEE ( Appearing ) Yes  --  ( Sees JANE ) Wow !

MISS JANE PUTNAM And Ella says you 're quite old friends , shook hands with you  --  after he recognized you  --   --  ARTHUR WEATHERBEE Oh , yes , yes . MISS JANE PUTNAM Well , it 's very funny you never mentioned it to us . Montgomery Putnam 's not a very common name . ARTHUR WEATHERBEE ( In front of table C. ) You know I called him Mr. Putnam . You see , Putnam  --  Putnam by itself is not so unusual , especially in England . ( WILKINS turns up to hide his amusement . ) MISS JANE PUTNAM True ! ARTHUR WEATHERBEE And then this one  --  that is  --  he 's so much like an Englishman I always thought he was an Englishman , and  --  your brother 's an American . MISS JANE PUTNAM ( Pause ) Why did n't you ask him flatfooted about Ella ? ARTHUR WEATHERBEE Well , that seemed rather a family matter , do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I suppose it is . ( Rises and crosses L. , looks into dining-room ) ARTHUR WEATHERBEE ( Relieved ; turns up to mantel C. ) Yes . ( ELLA goes C. ) MISS JANE PUTNAM Then he expects us , of course . His table is set for four to lunch . ( To WILKINS ) Do you know anything about it ? WILKINS ' E said ' ave lunch for four , that 's h'all I know . MISS JANE PUTNAM Well , you and Mr. Weatherbee might wait downstairs , then , Ella . There 's a woman coming with a new dress , and  --  ( Lowering voice ) and some other articles for me . ( Going up L. ) ELLA SEAFORD ( Rising and following ) Very well . ( Exit JANE . ) ARTHUR WEATHERBEE ( Quickly . To WILKINS ) The young lady has never seen Mr. Putnam , Wilkins . But the old one 's his sister . WILKINS I understand , sir . ELLA SEAFORD ( Re-appearing ) You coming , Arthur ? p. 97 ARTHUR WEATHERBEE Yes , dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir . Master might come and send some word to the old ' un . ARTHUR WEATHERBEE ( Up L. ) Oh , Ella , have you noticed this boot-box in all the rooms ? ELLA SEAFORD No . ARTHUR WEATHERBEE ( Displaying box ) Man puts his boots in there at night . The porter takes them by another door in the hall . Man opens this door in the morning  --  there you are  --  clean boots . ELLA SEAFORD Why , how convenient . WILKINS This is a bloomin ' fine mess for an Earl to be into . ( Exit door U. R. ) ARTHUR WEATHERBEE And the clock  --  one in every room in the hotel , run by electricity , and regulated from the office . ( Touches connecting wire ) ELLA SEAFORD Lovely rooms . ARTHUR WEATHERBEE Yes , indeed  --  fine corner . ELLA SEAFORD ( Crossing to window R. ) That 's Fifth Avenue . ARTHUR WEATHERBEE ( ARTHUR joining ELLA at window , his arm about her waist ) Running this way , yes . That 's 34th street . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) That 's Mr. Putnam , is n't it , Wilkins ?

ELLA SEAFORD Think of it . ( Going to C. ) ARTHUR WEATHERBEE I introduced them . ELLA SEAFORD ( Facing him , amazed and amused ) You  --  you introduced them ? ARTHUR WEATHERBEE Yes , I introduced them . ELLA SEAFORD ( Going and sitting settee ) Oh , Ha , ha , ha ! ( Curls up in laughter on the sofa ) ARTHUR WEATHERBEE What 's the matter ? ELLA SEAFORD ( Trying to control laughter ) Matter ? ( She looks at WILKINS , who smiles knowingly and renews her laughter ) ARTHUR WEATHERBEE ( Also looking at WILKINS ) What 's the joke , Wilkins ? WILKINS ( C. ) Ask the lady , sir . ELLA SEAFORD How long have you been working for my uncle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Miss ? Several years . ELLA SEAFORD He introduced Harriet Fordyce to Uncle Montgomery Putnam this morning . ( Laughs again , rising and going up L. ) Oh , Arthur ! ( Exit , laughing ) ARTHUR WEATHERBEE Wilkins , what the devil was all that  --  ( Indicates sofa ) about ? WILKINS Well , I suppose the young lady knows them two did n't need much introduction . That 's the Earlscourt , Ferris-wheel young woman , sir  --   --  ARTHUR WEATHERBEE ( Disgusted ) Oh , Piffel ! ( Comes down R. of table ) Why , that 's why I introduced them . ( Enter CARDINGTON L. , smiles . ) LORD CARDINGTON ( Calls ) Wilkins . ( Sees ARTHUR ) Oh , Arthur ! ( Going C. ) ARTHUR WEATHERBEE ( Down R. of C. ) Better shut that door , Wilkins . ( WILKINS moves towards door , hesitates , looking for CARDINGTON 'S sanction . CARDINGTON regards WILKINS , WILKINS obeys. ) p. 100 LORD CARDINGTON ( To ARTHUR ) Why ? ARTHUR WEATHERBEE Putnam 's sister is going to call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Leave the door open , Wilkins . It 's  --  it 's all going along beautifully , Arthur . ( Gives hat , stick and gloves to WILKINS , who places hat on mantel-shelf and hangs cane at the edge ) ARTHUR WEATHERBEE Well , I 'm glad you like it . Four thousand dollars to pay to some lawyers and an old lady coming , who 'll know you 're not her brother , the minute she claps eyes on you . LORD CARDINGTON ( Easily and proud of himself ) I sha n't see her , Arthur . ( ARTHUR moves over R. ) Wilkins , take my coat . ( To ARTHUR , while removing his coat ) Excuse me , old chap , wo n't you ? ( ARTHUR moves , going ) Do n't run away , but I ca n't lunch in these garments . Miss Fordyce is coming to lunch with  --  with us . ( WILKINS lays coat over back of chair , then takes hat and cane from mantel-piece and exit R. U. E. Much pleased with himself ) You must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and you  --  you must chaperone me , do n't you see , you jolly old dog , you . ( Both hands on ARTHUR 'S shoulders ) p. 101 ARTHUR WEATHERBEE But you 're my girl 's uncle . LORD CARDINGTON ( Annoyed ) Of course I am . I keep forgetting that . Why , that 's what she said , when she accepted my invitation . ARTHUR WEATHERBEE But see here , if you 're so punctilious , you ca n't pretend to give an uncle 's consent to our marriage , why do you expect two young ladies to lunch with you privately ? LORD CARDINGTON ( Sitting , settee ) I do n't . I asked her to fetch her father , dear boy . ARTHUR WEATHERBEE Oh , you did ? LORD CARDINGTON ( Rising ) Of course , I did . She said , if I did n't mind , she 'd rather have you and Miss  --  what 's her name ? ARTHUR WEATHERBEE Miss Seaford ? LORD CARDINGTON Yes  --  said she would n't mind coming with my niece ; I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the girl 's uncle , you know , Arthur . ( At table . Re-enter WILKINS ) ARTHUR WEATHERBEE Yes  --  but  --   --  LORD CARDINGTON ( With mail ) Oh , here 's a letter in Putnam 's handwriting . p. 102 WILKINS So his sister said , sir  --   --  LORD CARDINGTON ( opening letter ) His sister ? ARTHUR WEATHERBEE Just left here  --  ( WILKINS nods . ) LORD CARDINGTON Oh ! ( Pause ) Excuse my reading it , wo n't you ? ARTHUR WEATHERBEE I should rather advise you to read it . ( Crossing down to armchair L. , sits ) LORD CARDINGTON ( With envelope , sits ) Boston  --  been forwarded ! WILKINS ' Is sister Jane wondered , sir , why you was writin ' to yourself , sir . ( Goes up to door at back R. C. ) LORD CARDINGTON ( With letter , smiles ) Oh ! ( To ARTHUR ) Yes , it must have perplexed her . ( Reads ) " Dear Cardington : Have changed my mind about Cairo . Shall go to Monte @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me that you had better be in possession of my reason for advising you not to visit New York , though it 's rather a sore subject with me . I was married for a short time  --  three months in fact  --  " ( Pause . To ARTHUR ) You know , Arthur , I 'd never have used his name at all , if I 'd known that  --   --  p. 103 ARTHUR WEATHERBEE ' T is a pity , of course , but we must make the best of it now . LORD CARDINGTON ( Reads ) " Three months , in fact  --  " ( Speaks ) You know it is n't as if I 'd asked him for his damned name . He offered it , you know . ARTHUR WEATHERBEE ( Amused ) Well , see what he says . LORD CARDINGTON ( Reads ) " Married for a short time  --  three months , in fact  --  " ( Speaks ) A  --  a  --  and I pay for it ! ( Glances at letter , looks up thinking ) A thousand dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ARTHUR WEATHERBEE Yes , a trifle more , but  --   --  LORD CARDINGTON Everything 's devilish expensive over heah . ( Reads ) " Married for a short time . " ( Speaks ) You know , I never went in for that sort of  --  dissipation myself and why Mr. Putnam  --  ARTHUR WEATHERBEE ( Indicating letter  --  half impatient ) He 's explaining that . LORD CARDINGTON ( Reads ) " Married for a short time  --  three months , in fact . " ( Pause . Speaks ) You know , Arthur , it is n't so much the money , either . But during our walk , Miss Fordyce expressed herself very forcibly about divorced people and I found myself defending them . p. 104 ARTHUR WEATHERBEE But why should you ? LORD CARDINGTON Exactly , why should I ? ( Pause ) But you see , that 's the Cardington habit of mind . The Cardingtons are always profound thinkers , but not  --  not  --   --  ARTHUR WEATHERBEE Not superficially alert . LORD CARDINGTON ( Admiring the phrase ) Exactly ! ( Reads ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a divorce in New York , and got her decree with a considerable allowance for alimony . She was in London when I last saw her , but I fancy if you should go to New York under my name , her attorneys might annoy you . " ( With a world of irony but no smile ) Annoy ! Is n't it laughable ! ( Regards envelope ) Boston , when did this come , Wilkins ? ( Turning to C. ) WILKINS ( Coming forward ) This morning , sir . I brought it to you in the dining-room , sir , when you were talking with the Ferris-wheel young lady . LORD CARDINGTON You 'll call her Miss Fordyce , Wilkins . ( C. below table ) WILKINS Yes , sir . ( Exit door back R. C. ) p. 105 LORD CARDINGTON ( To ARTHUR ) Great presence of mind , but no  --  no delicacy . ARTHUR WEATHERBEE Montgomery Putnam 's at Monte Carlo , then ? LORD CARDINGTON So he says . ( Removing necktie , which he lays on table ) ARTHUR WEATHERBEE You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ca n't you do that for me , old chap ? ARTHUR WEATHERBEE ( Rising ) Yes , if you wish it . LORD CARDINGTON That 's a good fellow . ARTHUR WEATHERBEE What shall I say ? ( Goes to desk R. 2 ) ( Enter WILKINS door R. C. , an assortment of scarfs over his arm . ) LORD CARDINGTON Why , tell the truth , Arthur , and do n't be too modest . Say that I 've known you for many years , and you 're a devilish good sort . ARTHUR WEATHERBEE Thank you very much . ( Writes on telegraph blank ) ( WILKINS presents necktie . ) LORD CARDINGTON Give me the white one , Wilkins . ( WILKINS hangs scarfs over back of chair . Selects white one and proceeds to tie it on CARDINGTON 'S collar. ) p. 106 LORD CARDINGTON I say , Arthur , who was that old chap  --   --  ARTHUR WEATHERBEE ( At desk  --  writing ) Which chap ? LORD CARDINGTON That old chap who said I 'd got to leave the hotel , because my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . LORD CARDINGTON ( Speaking over WILKIN 'S head ) My  --  a  --  ha  --  my thousand-pound wife . Sounds like a museum poster . ARTHUR WEATHERBEE His advice was good anyway . I think you should leave the hotel . LORD CARDINGTON Leave the hotel !  --  with Miss Fordyce heah ? Rather not  --  she 's the sole object of my trip to America . And I shall not leave the hotel , if only to prevent her and ( Rises ) this Mrs. Putnam coming together . ( Approaching and indicating necktie ) How is that tied , Arthur ? ARTHUR WEATHERBEE ( Turning and glancing at tie ) Perfectly ! LORD CARDINGTON What you deah old boys over heah would call a  --  a  --  corkah . Fetch my coat and carnation , Wilkins . ( Exit door R. U. C. , removing waistcoat as he goes ) p. 107 WILKINS ( Exit door U. R. C. , follows with coat ) Yes , sir . ARTHUR WEATHERBEE ( Calling and writing ) You do n't mind my making you say , " My friend Arthur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Not at all , Arthur . ARTHUR WEATHERBEE Thanks . " I advise your consent to their marriage . " LORD CARDINGTON ( Heard off ) Say , " May I give your consent ? " ARTHUR WEATHERBEE Oh , very good . ( Scratches out and repeats in low tone as he writes ) " May  --  I  --  give  --  your  --  consent . " LORD CARDINGTON ( Calling ) Got that , Arthur ? ( Re-appears , displaying with much pride colored waistcoat he has just donned ) I say , Arthur , how 's that ? ( ARTHUR looks up smiling ) Is n't that the  --  ah  --  the limit ? ( ARTHUR laughs . Exit CARDINGTON R. U. C. ) ( HARRIET appears L. U. ) ARTHUR WEATHERBEE ( Calling ) Sign " Cardington . " ( Turns . See HARRIET ) p. 108 LORD CARDINGTON ( Off ) Not at all , Arthur . Sign my initials only . HARRIET FORDYCE ( With finger on lips , enters . She carries copy of Evening Telegram ) Come here ! ( Beckoning ; ARTHUR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'S picture in the paper ) ARTHUR WEATHERBEE Miss Fordyce , there are diplomatic reasons  --   --  HARRIET FORDYCE Oh , I wo n't tell , not even him , and I 'll hide the picture . ( Tears picture from paper ) LORD CARDINGTON ( Off ) I say , Arthur , you must make haste and fetch my niece to luncheon  --  my deah niece . HARRIET FORDYCE ( Still in undertone ) Why did you persuade him to pretend to be Ella 's uncle ? ARTHUR WEATHERBEE I ? LORD CARDINGTON ( Calling ) Well , Arthur  --   --  ARTHUR WEATHERBEE Oh , yes , I 'm going at once . HARRIET FORDYCE ( Retreating ) Not a word . Not a word ! ( Exit ) p. 109 LORD CARDINGTON It 's time , you know , now . ( Re-enter , in " swell " attire , followed by WILKINS ) ( ARTHUR goes down L. ) ( Doorbell is heard . ) LORD CARDINGTON Oh !

( Going up to meet HARRIET , taking her hand and coming forward with her ) Have you arranged with my niece ? HARRIET FORDYCE ( Pausing C. ) No , I concluded not to come to luncheon , Mr. Putnam , unless your sister , Jane , comes too . ( WILKINS , laughing covertly . Exit L. ) LORD CARDINGTON ( Disconcerted ) Oh ,  --  Jane  --  well , really , Miss Fordyce , Jane  --  Mr. Weathebee knows , do n't you , Arthur ? ( Coming down R. of table ) Jane 's my sister , but the fact is  --  I 'd rather get acquainted with my niece , without her mother being present . HARRIET FORDYCE Her mother ? p. 110 ARTHUR WEATHERBEE ( Almost ill with it , but trying to help him ) Ella 's mother was too ill to come , so her Aunt Jane came instead . LORD CARDINGTON Oh  --  that 's it  --  well , I do n't think I care to have even Aunt Jane with us . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you ca n't persuade the  --  young lady , Arthur . Miss Fordyce and I will wait for you .

( ARTHUR shrugs his shoulders to HARRIET and goes , closing the door after him . ) HARRIET FORDYCE ( Pretending dismay ) Why did you do that ? LORD CARDINGTON ( Fervently ) Because I wanted to have this moment alone with you  --  if our luncheon must be given over . HARRIET FORDYCE But if some one should come , Mr. Putnam , this " moment alone " as you call it , would appear unpardonably indiscreet , to say the least . p. 111 LORD CARDINGTON Indiscreet  --  what ; with Wilkins ? ( Calls ) Wilkins ! ( Enter WILKINS L. ) WILKINS Yes , sir . LORD CARDINGTON Wilkins , I want you to stand at that window and tell me if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Takes position at 2nd window ) LORD CARDINGTON Now , Miss Fordyce , there can be no  --  no inclement weather with Wilkins in the cross-trees . At home , Miss Fordyce  --  ( Both R. C. above settee ) HARRIET FORDYCE By " home " you mean , Pawtucket ? LORD CARDINGTON Did I say home ? HARRIET FORDYCE Yes . LORD CARDINGTON I meant London . Most of my things are there at present . HARRIET FORDYCE Oh ! LORD CARDINGTON And in England , you understand , no gentleman places a lady in a compromising position without being willing to accept the  --  the  --   --  HARRIET FORDYCE Why do you hesitate ? p. 112 LORD CARDINGTON Well , the word " consequences " has been unfortunately distorted into meaning only undesirable results . Ah  --  if your being here in my  --  my  --  apartments should embarrass you , my dear Miss Fordyce , I should be proud and happy to claim the  --   --  HARRIET FORDYCE The consequences ? LORD CARDINGTON Let us say reward . HARRIET FORDYCE Do I understand you correctly ? Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  ( Pause ) LORD CARDINGTON ( Following ) Like a declaration . HARRIET FORDYCE ( Down R. ) Like misguided self-sacrifice . LORD CARDINGTON Do n't laugh at me , Miss Fordyce , I feel my entire unworthiness of your consideration , yet  --   --  HARRIET FORDYCE I scarcely know you , Mr. Putnam . Of course I 've heard of you from your family , but I find you so different yourself . LORD CARDINGTON Does anyone 's family ever really know that one ? HARRIET FORDYCE ( Steadily ) Does one ever really know one 's self ? p. 113 LORD CARDINGTON Oh ! ( Turning away to C. ) HARRIET FORDYCE ( Approaching ) Your point of view  --  about matrimony , as you explained it in the park , seems to have charity for men  --  alone . LORD CARDINGTON Pardon me , I did n't say so . We English ( Quickly seeing his mistake ) and  --  and  --  Americans regard the sexes as equals . HARRIET FORDYCE ( Front of table C. ) What if a woman discovered her mistake too late , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Sentimentally , interrupting ) Why do you fear it would be a mistake , Miss Fordyce ? HARRIET FORDYCE ( Turning away L. ) You are applying my remarks personally , Mr. Putnam  --  I said , a woman . LORD CARDINGTON Oh ! HARRIET FORDYCE ( Facing him ) Suppose  --  a woman found herself mistaken  --  after she was married  --  what then ? LORD CARDINGTON ( At C. ) Well ,  --  I think she should ask the other fellow to wait until she got a divorce . p. 114 HARRIET FORDYCE I said nothing of another fellow . LORD CARDINGTON I beg your pardon . ( Turns up C. around table ) HARRIET FORDYCE ( At settee ) Would you accord a woman the right to marry a second time ? LORD CARDINGTON ( Above table ) Why certainly , unless she were a deceased wife 's sister . ( HARRIET , laughing , sits , settee ) Oh , but that does n't apply , does it ? HARRIET FORDYCE Would you marry such a woman ? LORD CARDINGTON ( To settee , bending over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , Miss Fordyce , I hope to tell you how love  --  that one touchstone love  --  love  --  regardless of condition  --  or rank or possession , or any consideration but the affinity  --  the personality affinity of two people  --  ( Prolonged ring of door-bell . HARRIET shows some annoyance  --  rises . WILKINS turns from window ) Now , that 's Arthur . ( Aside , petulantly ) I think he might have waited  --  Mr. Weatherbee  --  ( WILKINS goes to door. ) p. 115 HARRIET FORDYCE ( Retreating R. , drawing back ) But it may not be Mr. Weatherbee . LORD CARDINGTON ( Sharply ) Careful , Wilkins . ( WILKINS draws portires , shutting off hallway from view . ) MR . FORDYCE ( Outside ) Mr. Montgomery Putnam ? HARRIET FORDYCE ( In alarm , going up R. of settee ) My father ! WILKINS ' Is apartment , sir . MR . FORDYCE Mr. Putnam in ? WILKINS No , sir . LORD CARDINGTON ( At settee , in undertone to HARRIET ) Let me speak to your father  --  do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FORDYCE He came into the hotel fifteen minutes ago . WILKINS ' Ave you looked into the billiard room for him , sir ? MR . FORDYCE No , but I will . ( Door is heard to shut . WILKINS draws portieres back ) WILKINS ' E 's gone , sir . ( WILKINS crosses to position at window ) p. 116 LORD CARDINGTON ( Aside , in annoyed undertone ) Great presence of mind , but no  --  no delicacy . ( Turns to HARRIET ) HARRIET FORDYCE I must go , you see . ( Crossing to door up L. ) LORD CARDINGTON Do you fancy he was looking for you ? HARRIET FORDYCE I 'm sure of it  --  you see , someone has told him we were walking together . LORD CARDINGTON Why not ? ( Interposes ) HARRIET FORDYCE ( Coming down R. of table ) Oh , I came to tell you that your name is in the Telegram first edition , out at noon . LORD CARDINGTON My name ? ( Coming forward R. of table and joining HARRIET C. ) HARRIET FORDYCE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a torn copy . ( Reads paper from which she has torn his picture ) " Foul play suspected , Lord Cardington , a peer of England , missing . Last seen at Southampton with Mr. Montgomery Putnam . " LORD CARDINGTON Dear me , may I look at that ? p. 117 HARRIET FORDYCE Certainly . ( Gives CARDINGTON the paper ) Did you know Lord Cardington very well ? LORD CARDINGTON ( Looks uneasily at Harriet , moving away a few steps ) Oh , yes . ( Reads ) " Lord Cardington and Mr. Putnam were together several days before Lord Cardington was last seen alive . " ( Speaks ) " Seen alive . "  --  sounds rather spooky , does n't it ? ( Reads ) " Mr. Putnam 's name was on the cabin list for America . The English authorities think that if found he might throw some light on Lord Cardington 's disappearance . " Oh ! HARRIET FORDYCE ( Eagerly ) Can you ? LORD CARDINGTON Yes . ( Pause ) But I wo n't  --  you know  --  and that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper with his fingers ) HARRIET FORDYCE Where is Lord Cardington ? Tell me ? ( Laying her hand on his arm ) LORD CARDINGTON Why  --  in  --  in Monte Carlo , but that 's not to be known . ( Tries to take her hand , HARRIET removes it from his arm , moving away a little R. ) p. 118 HARRIET FORDYCE Why not ? LORD CARDINGTON ( Approaching her ) Well , it seems  --  so Cardington told me , that there 's a trial in the House of Lords . You see , it mentions it heah , Lord Culver 's trial  --   --  HARRIET FORDYCE Yes , I saw that . LORD CARDINGTON Well , Cardington  --  so Cardington told me  --  knows all about the case . He does n't want to sit as a juryman in the matter  --  it 's all so jolly blue , you know . HARRIET FORDYCE Blue ? LORD CARDINGTON That is , it 's so  --  how shall I say  --  risqu  --  that Cardington does n't even wish to talk about it , so he decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  rather than admit anything that would incriminate himself . LORD CARDINGTON Rather than tell on a fellow he likes . Oh , no , Cardington was n't mixed up in the affair himself . HARRIET FORDYCE So you think ? LORD CARDINGTON ( Turning away L. ) So I know , my dear lady . HARRIET FORDYCE ( Following to C. ) How can you know , Mr. Putnam ? p. 119 LORD CARDINGTON Ah  --  Cardington told me  --  you see . HARRIET FORDYCE ( Suppressing a smile ) Admitted he was innocent . And is Lord Cardington 's word so infallible ? LORD CARDINGTON ( With dignity ) Well , I rather choose to take it , you see . HARRIET FORDYCE Yes , I see ; but I asked if Lord Cardington was so completely the soul of honor ? LORD CARDINGTON ( Stroking moustache ) Quite the average sort , I should think  --  but  --  ah  --  if you 'll pardon me , I 'm rather keen about having Cardington right in this particular matter . It 's all so jolly blue , you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blue sort of thing  --  ah , I 'm sure . HARRIET FORDYCE Then this allusion to foul play ? LORD CARDINGTON Tommy rot ! HARRIET FORDYCE ( Turning away R. ) I 'll tell father so , but I wished you to see the item . When our reporters learn you 're in this hotel , you 'll be quite busy , I fancy . New York is more enterprising than  --  than Pawtucket . ( Going R. of settee and up C. ) p. 120 LORD CARDINGTON ( Worried ) Oh ! ( Turns away L. ) HARRIET FORDYCE ( Casually ) I shall watch the Washington papers very anxiously to  --   --  LORD CARDINGTON Washington papers ? ( Going to her ) HARRIET FORDYCE Yes , we are going to Washington for a week 's visit . Papa has no house there ; we stop at the hotel . LORD CARDINGTON ( Lighting up ) By Jove . ( Tosses newspaper on the table ) HARRIET FORDYCE What is it ? LORD CARDINGTON May I ask the name of the hotel ? HARRIET FORDYCE The Willard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of leaving ? LORD CARDINGTON Well , Washington 's quite worth while itself , is n't it ? HARRIET FORDYCE Oh , quite . LORD CARDINGTON ( Again wooing ) Would you  --  ah  --  would you resent the same hotel ? p. 121 HARRIET FORDYCE No ! LORD CARDINGTON ( Earnestly ) Thank you . HARRIET FORDYCE It worked very well in Paris , did n't it ? LORD CARDINGTON ( Laughs ) By Jove  --  you 're an angel . HARRIET FORDYCE Good-bye till Washington . ( Turning up L. of table and offering hand ) LORD CARDINGTON ( Taking her hand ) Oh , do n't go  --  Arthur 's sure to come . HARRIET FORDYCE I must , I 'm dying of hunger  --   --  LORD CARDINGTON I 'm a beast not to know it . ( Going above and L. of HARRIET ) Wilkins , is n't lunch ready ? WILKINS Not quite , sir . ( Turning from window and crossing towards dining-room ) HARRIET FORDYCE Good-bye . ( Starts off ) LORD CARDINGTON ( Gently interposing ) Some of it must be . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , sir . ( Exit dining-room L. ) p. 122 LORD CARDINGTON ( Taking her hand and leading her down R. above settee ) Now , do have a bit of roll at least . Your first visit to me and we 'll break bread together , anyway . I 've an Arab 's sentiment about that , if you 'll allow me . ( Enter WILKINS with rolls . ) HARRIET FORDYCE Well , then , as a matter of sentiment . LORD CARDINGTON Yes ! ( Taking plate from WILKINS and going to table ) And make haste with the rest of it . WILKINS Yes , sir ! ( Exit L. ) LORD CARDINGTON Ah  --  open that bottle , Wilkins . HARRIET FORDYCE Oh , no , please do n't , Mr. Putnam . LORD CARDINGTON ( Restrains her with a gesture . HARRIET sits ) By Jove , it 's awfully jolly this . Even your saying  --  ah ! " please do n't " gives  --  piquancy to it . ( Bottle pops in room L. ) HARRIET FORDYCE ( Rising ) That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . p. 123 HARRIET FORDYCE I prefer water . LORD CARDINGTON You shall have water then , but just a sip of the champagne first . ( Enter WILKINS L. , with bottle , filling glasses , which he carries on tray . CARDINGTON takes glasses from tray and hands one to HARRIET ) HARRIET FORDYCE Your Arab superstitions extend to champagne ? LORD CARDINGTON ( Handing the wine ) By Jove  --  you are ,  --  you know  --  you 're an angel . ( Taking his own glass ) HALLWAITER ( Heard off L. ) That 's the reason you ca n't come in here , I tole you . ( CARDINGTON and WILKINS turn . ) HARRIET FORDYCE There 's a man ! WILKINS The waiter , sir ? LORD CARDINGTON ( Easily ) Only the waiter ? Never mind .  --  We touch glasses , do n't we ? HARRIET FORDYCE ( Touching glasses ) Glass is a non-conductor , I believe . ( WILKINS goes behind and puts bottle on table. ) p. 124 LORD CARDINGTON My dear lady , when I look into your eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that disregards even non-conductors . HARRIET FORDYCE But should it disregard canvention ? LORD CARDINGTON Will it ? Convention , you know , means , literally , " coming together . " HARRIET FORDYCE ( Leaning away ) But not collision .

LORD CARDINGTON Not at all , and you 're not my sister Sarah . I told you there was a mistake somewhere , Arthur . ( A confusion of voices follows , made up of the following speeches in concert . ) ELLA SEAFORD But , Arthur , you told me that was Uncle Montgomery , and he kissed me . ( Crosses to ARTHUR ) MISS JANE PUTNAM ( To HOOPER ) You should have known Montgomery Putnam ; he lived right next door to you in Pawtucket . SILAS HOOPER But  --  I put my name on a lawyer 's bond for security for four thousand dollars . MR . SEAFORD Well , it 's only a mistake , and what of it ? We wanted to come to New York anyway .

SENATOR places hat on chair C. FORDYCE goes down R. MR . FORDYCE She 's writing . SENATOR BARKER To him , you think ? MR . FORDYCE Yes . SENATOR BARKER That 's the trouble in dealing with these eastern lawyers . I wanted to arrest him on the contempt charge . Duffield thought it was so much better to get the money from him . MR . FORDYCE Damn the money ! p. 140 SENATOR BARKER Certainly . If we 'd jugged him , there 'd been no promenade up the Avenue . MR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into his rooms . I tell you , Senator , I used to have little jealous twinges about her mother when she was alive , utterly groundless , you know , but real at the time .

FORDYCE Well then , ask her . Duffield 's waiting to see me , anyway . She 's coming now . I 'll leave you together . SENATOR BARKER ( Losing heart ) Ca n't be a mistake , can it ? MR . FORDYCE I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course . Good counter-irritant anyway . ( HARRIET rises and crosses D. C. SENATOR to L. FORDYCE up R. ) p. 141 HARRIET FORDYCE Finished your business ? ( HARRIET R.

HARRIET FORDYCE ( At chair R. ) Well , quotation marks mean that one is only quoting . They are what the doctor calls antiseptic . MR . FORDYCE Well , I ask you not to send it . I do n't understand this  --  this eccentricity , Harriet . ( Going ) Senator Barker has something of importance to say to you . I hope you 'll give it your serious attention . ( Exit L.

( Sitting on arm of chair R. ) SENATOR BARKER But we were always good friends . HARRIET FORDYCE The best of friends , Senator . SENATOR BARKER And perhaps you do n't know it , Harriet , but a girl of twelve , fourteen , fifteen  --  along there  --  and  --  and  --  a man of say forty , thrown constantly together , why she just does that  --  ( Turns his hand as if wrapping something ) with his heart . Of course a man of forty 's got some upper lip and maybe he does n't give himself away , but nine times out of ten he 's hit . HARRIET FORDYCE But , my dear Senator  --   --  SENATOR BARKER No  --  hear me  --  please . When I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't see much of the Senator , did you ? HARRIET FORDYCE No ! p. 144 SENATOR BARKER Because the Senator purposely kept out of the way . That 's why . But , Harriet , no hay-seed legislature on earth , could have held me up for two hundred thousand dollars if I had n't wanted the senatorship to lay at the feet of the little girl that used to sit on my knee . HARRIET FORDYCE ( Tenderly ) But , Senator  --  ( Rising and going to him ) My dear , old , Senator  --  ( Pause . Extends both hands ) Why do you pain yourself  --  and me  --  by telling me this ? SENATOR BARKER I want to get direct  --  I want to say , in just so many words , will you be my wife ? HARRIET FORDYCE ( Shaking her head ) I wo n't do you that injustice .

HARRIET crosses L. ) ( Enter FORDYCE and DUFFIELD L. C. ) MR . FORDYCE Well ? ( SENATOR shakes his head ) Why not ? ( SENATOR points to HARRIET 'S note ) That man ? ( SENATOR nods ) Is that the truth , Harriet ? HARRIET FORDYCE Yes , papa . MR . FORDYCE And you 're going to let him pull the wool over your eyes again , are you ? HARRIET FORDYCE ( Pause  --  restraining a smile ) Well , I should n't call it that , and I do n't care much for " again . " MR . FORDYCE Well , I call it that . He does n't care that  --  ( Snaps his fingers ) for you . It 's his own pocket , that 's all . Do you know this gentleman ? ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Regarding DUFFIELD ) I think I saw the gentleman this morning , but  --   --  MR .

After laughter , rising and crossing R. ) I wish that when you gentlemen decide to interfere in my affairs , you 'd consult me . ( SENATOR goes D. L. ) p. 147 MR . FORDYCE Why , you always refused to talk about the alimony . HARRIET FORDYCE ( Turning . Seriously , to herself ) Alimony ? I wish I could remember everything I said on that walk this morning .

( Nods to FORDYCE and SENATOR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't Uncle Montgomery at all . MR . FORDYCE What 's that ? ELLA SEAFORD ( TO C. ) No , he 's some swindler and he has a confederate who pretends to be a lawyer . MR . DUFFIELD What ? ELLA SEAFORD They got four thousand dollars from Mr. Hooper , and  --   --  MR . FORDYCE ( With look at DUFFIELD ) Well , see here . ( Looks at check and security in his own hands ) Here , these belong to you , sir . MR . DUFFIELD ( Taking them ) But , Mr. Fordyce  --   --  p. 148 HARRIET FORDYCE ( To DUFFIELD ) You should divide with the Senator , I think .

FORDYCE I guess you 're mistaken , my dear . Harriet certainly knows Montgomery Putnam , if anybody does , and  --   --  ELLA SEAFORD Why , that 's what I thought . Harriet and I both saw him in the breakfast room . Did n't we , Harriet ? HARRIET FORDYCE Certainly , my dear . ELLA SEAFORD But , Aunt Jane  --  Aunt Jane ought to know too , and she says he 's a swindler. p. 149 SENATOR BARKER ( Easily ) ' M. Your Aunt Jane " turned him over " pretty thoroughly to me this morning before she met him . Your Aunt Jane , Miss Seaford , strikes me as an old pelican . ( Rises , goes up , joining DUFFIELD .

C.  --  the others converse up-stage C. ) You were there when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Yes ! HARRIET FORDYCE What about that  --  that money ? ARTHUR WEATHERBEE ( Laughing ) That goes with the name , you know ; Cardington 's never been married any more than you and I have . HARRIET FORDYCE Oh ! ARTHUR WEATHERBEE But , once taking Putnam 's name he was in for it , you see . HARRIET FORDYCE Did n't you know he 'd be " in for it , " when you gave him the name ? ARTHUR WEATHERBEE Why , bless you , Miss Fordyce , I did n't give it to him . p. 150 HARRIET FORDYCE Who did ? ARTHUR WEATHERBEE Mr. Putnam himself . Lord Cardington wanted to come to America to  --  to  --  pardon me , but to find you , Miss Fordyce , and Mr. Putnam , who is n't known very extensively here , thought it might help Lord Cardington if Cardington used his name . HARRIET FORDYCE That 's the way it struck Mr. Putnam . ARTHUR WEATHERBEE Yes . HARRIET FORDYCE Oh ! ARTHUR WEATHERBEE Cardington knew nothing of Mr. Putnam 's marriage until this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him closely ) And now ? ARTHUR WEATHERBEE ( Smiling ) Well , now , of course , there 's the deuce of it . It seems the old hen 's here in this hotel . HARRIET FORDYCE Who ? ( Covers face and turns up C. ) ARTHUR WEATHERBEE The old hen  --  Putnam 's wife . ( Turns away L. , laughing ) ( HARRIET turns up C. , covering face . ) MR . FORDYCE ( Coming down L. ) What is this , Harriet ? Miss Seaford says the man admitted that he was not Aunt Jane 's brother . p. 151 HARRIET FORDYCE He admitted that ? ( Coming forward C. ) ELLA SEAFORD Yes , indeed , to Dad  --  and me  --  and everybody . Said , " you 're not my sister , " to Jane . HARRIET FORDYCE ( To ELLA ) Did he admit it willingly , or was he  --  ( Pantomimes " pushed " ) MR . FORDYCE Is it Putnam ? ( Pause ) Answer me , Harriet ? HARRIET FORDYCE Not the Putnam you mean , papa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Going L. ) ELLA SEAFORD But , Harriet , you  --  you said " Oh Ella "  --  like that , the minute he came in the breakfast room this morning . HARRIET FORDYCE ( Sitting , ottoman L.

MR . FORDYCE That man ? HARRIET FORDYCE ( Nodding to ARTHUR ) That man  --  and at that time papa thoughtlessly had no fire insurance on me at all . p. 152 MR . FORDYCE ( With check ) But he paid this alimony . Why should he do that ? ARTHUR WEATHERBEE Alimony ? HARRIET FORDYCE ( Innocently ) Why should he climb out of a Ferris wheel ? ( Indicates check ) Simply another gentlemanly attempt to be pleasant to strangers , I suppose . ARTHUR WEATHERBEE ( To HARRIET ) Alimony ? Did you say alimony to you ? MR . FORDYCE Certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks down in pretended demureness  --  then to ELLA , who smiles pleadingly . ) ELLA SEAFORD That 's what I meant about your introducing them .
