 | When we compare the present system of government in France with the various oth ers which have flourished and fallen since the Revolution overthrew the traditional monarchy , at least two circumstances distinguish it from all the rest . The first is that in origin it was not deliberate . Foreign invasion had resulted in the fall of the empire ; a provisional government was a matter of necessity ; and from this provisional government the republican system still in existence was presently developed , by methods of debate rather than of armed force . Though , beyond doubt , the republic had intense partisans , their convictions would hardly have established it but for the solid fact that no other proposed plan of government , royalist or imperial , proved practicable at the moment ; something had to be done and this seemed , on the whole , the only thing to do . Exceptional though the tragic conditions of its beginning were , there is , accordingly , a case for those who should maintain , with what seems paradox , that the present republic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France since the old regime . For it is the only one which was forced upon the country by the practical logic of necessity . All the others were based on the revolutionary precedent of supplanting the regularly constituted authorities by armed force ? a process which , of course , resulted in making the suppressed parties revolutionists themselves , duly waiting their turn . The republic , to be sure , has as much doctrine of its own as the empire had or as either scheme of royalty ; but this doctrine is rather the defence of its power than the basis . Even if this were the only circumstance to distinguish it from the forms of government to whose authority it has succeeded , it would stand conspicuously alone . A second cir-@# cumstance makes its position doubly clear . Whether the unrecognized normality of its origin has had anything to do with its endurance or not ? the question might well prove debatable ? the fact of its endurance is now beyond question . Between the outbreak of the Revolution and the fall of the second empire no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . There had consequently never been a period when everyone in the country who had attained the age of twentyfive could not personally remember both the state of affairs which had preceded that under which he was living and the revolutionary disturbances by means of which the government actually in pov , er had come into existence . During the first years of the third republic it must have seemed as palpable a political novelty as almost any other of the systems which had come before it in living memory . By the year 1888 , however , it had already survived as long as either the reign of Louis Philippe or the second empire , its two most prolonged predecessors ; and by this time the interval since 1888 is as long as that which separated 1888 from 1870 . For thirty-six years the actual form of government in France has now remained unbroken by revolution . By 1906 there was not a living Frenchman under the age of forty , whatever his political convictions , who could personally remember any other system than that under which he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the present Republic of France is growing to have such sanction as must come to any institutions from time wherein the memory of man runneth not to the contrary . This of itself would give the present republic a chance of stability not enjoyed by any other French system of the nineteenth century . When governments , as when children , survive the dangers of infantile disease , their prospects of survival till old age  | regularly sets in are indefinitely strengthened . The important question becomes whether anything seems to be organically the matter with them . In the case of a government , such questions are extremely complicated . They involve all manner of statistics , for one thing ; for another , they are always confused by the methods of practice common among political experts and political quacks alike . Politicians , particularly when they have brewed panaceas of their own , are always eager to prove that the state needs their medicine . Their habitual eloquence , accordingly , resembles that of the travelling vender of pills who declared that the great art of his profession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in knowing how you could talk so as to make a crowd feel sick . In such quandary , an unprofessional listener , affected with qualms , has no resource but to look at the crowd for himself . If it appears healthy , there is a strong probability that , whatever its momentary misgivings , it is really in sound condition . If any traveller in France thus considers the aspect of the country in the thirty-seventh year of the third republic , he can hardly avoid the impression that , at this moment , nothing could look more prosperous . Other countries , to be sure , may look more aggressively enterprising ; you will perhaps see elsewhere more obtrusive novelties of modern trade and manufacture , or notice more bustle ; but you will discover nowhere else more constant evidence of solid and substantial welfare . From Flanders and Normandy to Provence , wherever you go , ? from the Atlantic to the Alps , too ,  - -  you will find less evidence of poverty , of idleness , of misery , than will force itself on your attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strongly on such an impression as this may be imprudent ; yet one can not rationally neglect it . Travellers ' tales have their value , as well as their limitations ; and a pervasive national prosperity , a sound national virtue , is a fact as incontrovertible as any assertion of statistics or philosophy . What is more , there are moods in which you are disposed to think it more significant than the best of them . No government , to be sure , could produce the prosperity which must impress travellers throughout France unless the people under its control were vigorous , intelligent , and thrifty ; , but no vigor or intelligence or thrift on the part of a people could produce it under a government which had not proved itself on the whole salutary . Whatever statistics or philosophy may tell you , the general condition of France at the present day is evidence enough for any traveller that throughout the memory of all men under forty years of age the government of the country has been not onlunbroken , but efficient ? that it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked any better than some other form of government might have done , or even so well as might have been the case with some other , is evidently another question . In other countries , or at other epochs , this question might have been merely academic . In France , throughout the existence of the third republic , it has often seemed one of practical politics . As we have already reminded ourselves , the present form of French government , though it has had the good fortune to survive beyond the limit of average human memory , began as a makeshift during a period of unprecedented national disaster which threatened to result in anarchical revolution . For the moment , almost all Frenchmen were willing to submit themselves to it provisionally . To many of them , however , it seemed at best only a prudent temporary alternative for some other form of government which they sincerely believed to be superior . The empire had fallen ; but the spirit of the imperialists was not yet ? extinct . And , as everyone knows , the whole force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had in no wise crushed the spirit of devoted royalists ? Legitimist or Orleanist ? any more than it had smothered that of devoted republicans . What is more , everybody in the whole world could vividly remember the empire of Napoleon III ; men still in the full vigor of middle life could remember the reign of Louis Philippe ; and it was only forty years since Louis Philippe had dethroned Charles X ? Iittle longer than it is now since Napoleon III surrendered at Sedan . Evidently , the present republic began its career under great disadvantages . Throughout France there were admirably honest Frenchmen who ardently believed that the country could not fully prosper until it returned to one or another of the three rival systems . Each of the three , too , had a personally respectable pretender to the throne of France . Had any of these aspirants to  | hereditary sovereignty possessed a vividly commanding personality , the course of history might have taken another turn than that which we have been considering together . In this respect fortune favored the republic . Without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we can hardly fail to agree that none of them was graced with that kind of power which , whether you love it or hate it , impresses the imagination of an enthusiastic people . Even from the beginning , accordingly , the republic was in less danger than might otherwise have been the case of succumbing to some freshly revolutionary assertion of royalist or imperialist tradition . And the course of events during the past thirty-six years has gone far to avert what danger of such fate may have originally existed . The direct line of Napoleon III is extinct ; so is that of Charles X. The Orleanist prince who has succeeded to the Legitimist claim is not even descended , in male line , from Louis NIV ; and the present heir of the Bonaparte , ' must go back to the Corsican lawyer of the eighteenth century if he would prove kinship with either of the French emperors . Neither of these gentlemen , furthermore , is any more fortunate than the pretender whose claims he inherits , in the matter of such personal qualities as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeat that nothing is further from my purpose than to make any comment whatever on their private characters , which I am led to believe deserving of universal esteem . The plain truth is that neither of them , for all his honorable virtues , has the gift of such distinction as should make people in general quite sure of just who he is . A pretender whom you have to verify in the Almanach de Gotha is no longer a serious menaceuness , in time to come , he remove himself from those impressive pages into the sunshine and shadow of open air . At this moment , accordingly , the claims of rival traditions to the established government of France seem less threatening to established order than at any previous time since 18i5 . For all this , these rival traditions persist to the present day ; and at times they have been real dangers to the republic . Even though they no longer present themselves , at least for the moment , in so serious a light , the effect of them is evident everywhere thoughout France . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of practical politics . So long as they remained there they could not help emphasizing the fact that , as a form of government , the republic is based on only one aspect of French tradition , ? on the tradition of the Revolution , which is passionately contradictory of royalist and of imperial tradition alike . The course of the republic , in many questions of detail , has done nothing to mitigate this emphasis ; rather it has gloried in the tradition peculiar to itself . Had it done otherwise , it might have been more prudent , but it certainly would have been less French . There is something pleasantly typical in the device which now ornaments the reverse of its gold coinage . Instead of the imperial eagle , we have the Gallic cock . To all appearance , this spirited bird is in the act of crowing ? for the purpose , one opines , of reminding us that he is on top of the heap ; which is very delightful for the cock , but not conciliatory to the temper of less fortunate fOwls . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with which the republic has everywhere decorated the public buildings of France . Wherever you go , the words Liberty , Equality , Fraternity stare you in the face , never suffering you to forget that the watchwords of the Revolution are once more those of the government in full possession of power . And another vivid example of the spirit in question happens to rise straight to the surface of my memory . Among the masterpieces of Renaissance architecture in France is the Chateau of St. Germain , a great part of which was erected in the reign of King Francis I. It was accordingly decorated , like many other of his buildings , with his personal device , the salamander , and with the initial " F " of his royal name . In the course of time it fell out of repair , and furthermore was disfigured by various additions , and surrounded by other buildings , of neither dignity nor importance . Within a few years the government has undertaken to restore it , as an historical monument . The restoration , which has proceeded with intelligence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in certain places , it has reached the stage of finishing touches , of ornamental detail . Here the salamander writhes as splendidly as ever ; and here , as in the elder time , admirably designed initials alternate with him . But the new initials , of the restored palace are not those of  | King Francis . Instead of " F , " you perceive " R. F. " everywhere . The republic does not show itself quite confident enough to admit the past . Thus , by its own act , it reveals what still seems true . Even to this day the republic presents itself , both to its partisans and to its opponents , not so much in the light of an established national government as in that of a temporarily dominant political party . In spite of this , we should be much mistaken if we supposed its career exactly like that of some party which should have proved able to maintain itself indefinitely in power under a system like our own . In the course of its career , it has come , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of people . There have been moments in its existence , indeed , when it has so nearly passed into the hands of sympathizers with royalist tradition that the advent of a king seemed close at hand ; and , radical though its revolutionary devices must always have appeared , it has more than once found itself under the management of people whose impulses were certainly conservative , if not reactionary . In other words , if we are disposed to liken the republic to a dominant party , as distinguished from a system of government established by full consent of the governed , we must never suffer ourselves to forget that it has resembled a party composed of discordant factions rather than one vigorously united by general devotion to a common purpose . Viewing the matter in this light , one would naturally suppose that when any faction found itself for a while dominant it would be disposed , as a matter of obvious policy , to behave in a manner which so far as possible should conciliate its opponents . Precisely this form of amenity seems one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wherever you go in France you find aggressive assertions on the part of any faction or party which has ever got itself into control of affairs that it has had its way , if only for a while . The Gallic cock of the republic struts crowing on coins which are still popularly described as napoleons ; the cockerels which France has hatched for him show themselves of the pure breed . An obvious example of this tendency must instantly attract the notice of any visitor to Paris at the present day . The capital city of the republic is , in most respects , very like the capital of the second empire . Viewed from any distance or from any height , however , it proves to be dominated by two lofty structures which have been built under the present system of government . And these rise so conspicuously above all the rest of Paris that they are inevitably the points which catch the eye , and which linger in memory as the most salient features of the view . One is the Eiffel Tower , a remarkable achievement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accuracy of its lines give it something more like dignity and beauty than one would have supposed possible . At the same time , this network of steel pushed skyward has no apparent quality of permanence . It is evidently nothing more than a colossal piece of eccentric ingenuity , devised for the purpose of amusing crowds who flocked from everywhere to one of the international expositions . It has outlasted the occasion for which it admirably served its advertising purpose ; and , as it still attracts and amuses a good many travellers every year , it stands there still , a huge plaything . But it does not look as if it need stand there very long . When people grow tired of playing with it , you fancy , it will be taken down and sold for old metal . And everybody will be happy ? including those sensitive persons whose artistic susceptibilities are wounded whenever they look at the monster . It has never done any harm to anybody else ; and it is said to have proved a lucrative investment . The other structure which now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? except that there might be a case for those who should maintain it no more beautiful . The highest hill within the limits of the city is Montmartre . It is at present crowned not with the houses and the windmill which used to distinguish it in former times , but with a huge white edifice , unmistakable in its ecclesiastical character , yet so obviously modern in its lines that you can perceive it instantly to be a brand-new monument of the wealth and the power still resident in the Church . This sumptuous sanctuary , you presently discover , is the new Church of the Sacred Heart , specially consecrated to an extremely French species of mystic devotion . It symbolizes that aspect of the Church which is most intensely enthusiastic , and least concerned with the affairs of this world . It stands not for the  | inexhaustible charity of Christianity , forever bringing aid and comfort to the poor and unfortunate , earnestly endeavoring to mitigate the ills of life . It stands rather for such holy ecstasies as those who doubt or dislike Catholicism are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is immensely expensive ; millions on millions of devout francs have been consecrated to it by the faithful . Every centime of them has gone into its masonry and its decorations , to remain fixed there forever . For its foundation and its walls are as solid as human skill can make them . The church has been built there on Montmartre to dominate Paris so long as Paris shall stay on earth to be dominated . And , for fear that it might sometimes escape the notice of Parisians , the countryfolk of Savoy have given their savings to buy for it the biggest bell that can be had for money . They promise you , I believe , that when the " Savoyard " is sounded , you shall hear the note of it in every cranny of the capital city of the French Republic . All of which is admirable in its way . One can not too deeply respect the self-sacrificing devotion with which the Catholics of France have thus testified to the living persistency of their faith . If any splendor of enshrinement can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man who can sympathize with the longings of the human soul would ever grudge the Church a bit of it . But you can not be long in Paris without learning that this colossal new place of worship has another aspect than this primary one of testifying to the depth of orthodox devotion still resident among the French . As is well known , a great number of honest republicans have believed , throughout the nineteenth century , that the Christian religion , particularly in its purely devotional aspects , is a relentless obstacle to human progress . To men of this disposition , the most unwelcome of all French cults has been the adoration of the Sacred Heart ? for the reason that it carried people farthest in sympathy from the things of this world , directing their attention rather to mystical ecstasy in regions which they believed heavenly . To unbelievers , in short , this worship stood for the acme of superstition . It was therefore the form of devotion which was most certain to excite their antagonism . When the republic was for a while in reactionary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disposed rather to sympathize with the Church than to oppose it ? you might accordingly have expected them , as prudent statesmen , to have taken this phase of opposition into consideration . You might have expected the Church itself to have displayed a similar spirit . There are aspects enough and to spare in which Catholic Christianity is obviously beneficent . These , you would have supposed , would be those which both its clergy and its laity would have thought for the moment most deserving of emphasis . The last thing which you would have supposed astute men to favor would have been manifestations of their more exasperating points of difference from fellow-citizens who had the misfortune to hold them in distrust . Yet with free choice of conduct , the most extreme imaginable manifestation of such difference was the course which they preferred to take . Churchmen eagerly proposed this colossal monument of the Sacred Heart ; the government of the moment consented to it . And there it stands to-day , a monument of several other facts as well . It reminds everybody that for a while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it reminds everybody that the moment it became so , it proceeded to celebrate its dominance in the most obtrusive and self-glorifying way ? and also in that which might he the hardest to obliterate when politics should take another turn . It reminds everybody that this other turn of politics has ensued . It reminds all who enthusiastically delight in the doctrines for which it stands that these are no longer in power . It reminds everybody who distrusts or hates them that , if they once get into power again , their enemies need look for little mercy at their hands . At best , no matter what may have been the actual motives of its founders , it reminds the whole world that the Frenchmen who built it were willing to set up , the moment they could do so , a constant and aggressive cause of provocation to any compatriots who should not sympathize with the phase of national force which it so sumptuously represents . Even as yet , I believe , the Church of the Sacred Heart is nowhere near finished . Meanwhile , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ republic has fallen into far from clerical hands . These more intense republicans have not as yet set on foot a Temple of Reason , or what- ever else , which should dwarf the Sacred Heart . On the other hand , they have lost few opportunities to assert their own opinions in fashions quite as aggressive as that in which contrary opinions were asserted by clerical sympathizers a few years ago . All over France you will find monuments to the worthies of the republic and the heroes of the Revolution . In the Louvre itself , the two monuments which vie with the Arch of the Carrousel are a most restless one in memory of Gambetta , and a sketch for an equestrian statue not yet cast of that hero of two republics , Lafayette . One of the avenues which radiate from the Arc de Triomphe has been deprived of its name of imperial victory and given instead that of Victor Hugo ; and this not because he was an eminent poet , but because he was a stanch republican opponent of the empire . There is hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which has not given his name to a principal street . And just such violent , instantly aggressive changes of nomenclature are still occurring everywhere . Now the use of a name , either for an individual or for a locality , is obviously to serve as a means of identification . Any alteration of a name , accordingly , is inconvenient and confusing . This reasonable consideration seems rarely to present itself to the minds of enthusiastic French republicans . They are at present disposed rather to regard the names of public places as instruments of doctrinal propagation . At Dijon , for example , one of the most memorable local worthies is Saint Bernard , who was born in a little village overlooking the old Burgundian capital . A bronze statue in his honor was very properly erected there some years ago ; and the square which surrounded it ? in a new part of the town ? was duly named the Place St. Bernard . How long it retained the name I do not know . At present it has been renamed the Place Etienne Dolet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little if anything to do with Dijon ; but beyond question the conduct of this skilful printer , who flourished at the period of the Reformation , was such as to get him into trouble , and he was ultimately burned at the stake . The reason why his name has replaced that of Saint Bernard is not that he was a more memorable personage , or that he had anything like so much reason for commemoration on the spot in question . It is simply that Saint Bernard was a canonized worthy of the Catholics , and that Etienne Dolet was a heretic , whose memory must remain obnoxious to anyone who cherishes Catholic tradition . They have left the saint on his pedestal ; but no one who believes in the faith which he preached can see him there without reminder that this faith no longer has the best of it . Again , in the city of Lyons there existed , a few years ago , three distinct streets , which very properly had three distinct names . What these names were , I do not remember . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that at present all three bear the same name ? that of Emile Zola . They are distinguished , I believe , as Rue , Avenue , and Boulevard ; or perhaps one of them is a Place , and not a street , All I feel quite sure of is that the confusion is annoying to travellers and to cabmen . It is more than annoying ? it is persistently exasperating ? to people who live in any of the three and who do not chance unreservedly to approve the work of the eminent novelist in question . Even his most eager admirers can hardly deny his tendency to pornographic excess , which goes far to counteract the impression of his indisputable power . Few would pretend him , as a man of letters , a model for the young . But this is not the question . During the progress of the Dreyfus affair he devoted himself , with generous enthusiasm , to the cause of what he believed to be justice . In so doing he was probably encouraged by the fact that he found arrayed against him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he had been a violent opponent through his whole literary life . The certain fact is that , as a most conspicuous advocate for Dreyfus , he had'made himself more objectionable than almost anyone else to the very considerable and personally respectable body of conservative and clerical prejudice which believed , on general principles , that a case , once decided , had better not be reopened . Meanwhile , this same line of conduct made him a partisan hero of the anticlericals . Anticlerical people came into power at Lyons . Among the first things they proceeded to do in the heat of their victory was to name for Zola not one public place , but three separate ones . The conciliatory wisdom of this process seems rivalled only by its practical good sense .  | In some towns this kind of thing has gone further still . I remember one where a number of small streets bore extremely local names . These I did not take the precaution to copy ; but they run somewhat as follotivs : " Rue Jean Duval ( Maire 1882 ) . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at pains to remember who Jean Duval was . His name , however , has served the worthy purpose of supplanting that of the saint for whom the street had been named ever since the Middle Ages ; and if you should take the pains to look into his municipal history , you might very likely discover that he had some lively dispute with the priest in charge of the neighboring church . Now , whatever the personal merits or faults of jean Duval , there can be little question that his name is not so easy to remember as that of Saint Peter , we will say ; and consequently that it is intrinsically less adapted to the purpose of naming a street , I ventured to make this observation to a staunch republican friend , who lived at the town in question . He admitted the justice of my view , except , he went on to say , that it showed a foreigner 's ignorance of the local situation . My argument , he said , had actually been presented to the authorities of the town ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a matter of obvious convenience ; the authorities had been disposed to take their view of the case ; the matter had been laid over till the next meeting of the local council . But then , what happened ? M. le Cure had preached a jubilant sermon to the effect that an impious attempt to dislodge Saint Peter had been frustrated by the faithful ; the clerical newspaper of the town had flapped its wings and crowed like the cock of Saint Peter himself . And at the next meeting of the town authorities down went Saint Peter and up went Jean Duval . The unhappy saint , it appeared , had ceased to be a topographical fact , and had become a political . A more familiar manifestation of this spirit was widely published a few years ago . The law courts of the republic , continuing the tradition of the empire , and I believe of all French governments since the Concordat , had been ornamented with crucifixes , which meant , in point of fact , just about as much as the Bibles used for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The anticlerical authorities of the republic came to the conclusion that these had best be removed . In this , we may admit , they showed good sense . There was no actual relation between the administration of French law and the doctrines of Catholic Christianity . There was no reason for pretending that any existed . The crucifix was evidently exasperating to anticlerical prejudice . The absence of it , when people once got used to the new state of things , need not excite any prejudice whatever . If the crucifixes had been quietly taken away from the court-rooms , accordingly , the process might have been salutary , as distracting from public notice an evident matter of rancorous dispute . Instead of seizing this opportunity , the republican authorities preferred to emphasize their anticlerical sentiments in the strongest v ay they could think of . So , of all days in the year , they selected Good Friday for publicly removing from their courts of justice the traditional image of Christ . One 's mind recurs , in contrast , to the old story of the high-church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it an inch every week , until ? quite undetected by his evangelical congregation ? he got it safe against the all . In fact , as we have reminded ourselves enough and io spare , whenever the extreme partisans of the republic in France have got the government into their hands , they have conducted themselves with no more reserve , with no more attempt to conciliate doubtful or hostile sympathy , than was shown by reactionary people when for a while they had the best of it in republican politics . Rather they have been disposed to dwell triumphantly on every detail of the differences between themselves and their conscientious opponents . They have insisted on the full extent of their radical doctrines . They have exulted in every triumph . They have often behaved , in fact , as if they were complete advocates of a partisan tyranny , differing chiefly from the conventional tyrannies of history in the fact that it pretends to be the tyranny not of an individual , but of a special class which likes to be described as the people . Had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tyrannical as its utterances and its petty acts might lead us to infer , the present state of France could hardly be so healthy and so prosperous as it appears .  | The republic seems French to the core , in the fact that it lays down a system as near logical consistency as it can devise . That system has the advantage of being comparatively new ; it is consequently contradicted by fewer incompatible facts than would be the case with an old system , like that of the ancien regime , or of the Church . Being human , nevertheless , it can not help being confronted with some facts ? among others , with persistent contrary prejudices ? not to be reconciled with its doctrines . These , accordingly , it attempts either to ignore or to suppress after the good old human fashion . It does not try to reconcile opposition ; it tries rather to impose its own principles , by force of assertion , or , if need be , by civil force . It seems still affected by the youthful dream that men on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The principles which it holds and promulgates appear on the whole to he those of extreme theoretical democracy . And there is no reason to doubt that it holds and promulgates them with sincerity . At the same time , so far as a foreigner can understand what these principles signify to the French mind , they are by no means what the principles of democracy are really held to be among us of America , who have so long lived under a democratic system of government . With us , as well as with other peoples , the commonplaces of democracy have been popularly set forth during the nineteenth century almost without reserve . In practice , however , American democracy has hitherto confined itself to insistence on the principle that government should derive its just powers from the consent of the governed . It has rather maintained than weakened the traditions of its own constitutional system . It has not indulged in the delights of class tyranny . We have talked very valiantly about the people and their rights . We have never clearly defined what that term , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conduct , the while , we have acted on the tacit assumption that a complete people consists of no one class or kind of men ? high or low , learned or ignorant , few or many ; but rather of the inevitable variety of human beings who must exist , each in his own sphere , in any healthy society . Democracy with us seems to mean government by common consent for the common good . Practically , so far as it has prospered in France , it has signified even there government for the common good , but with the element of common consent decidedly subordinated . In theory , however , and it utters its theories with intense effusiveness , it seems to mean among the French a system of government conducted in the interests of the masses , as distinguished from those of the better classes . It fiercely condemned the privileges of the better classes in former times . In their place , it now seems disposed to do all in its power to establish something like privileges for the common people . How far it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the persistence of the better classes throughout France . It is proved , as well , by the stability of the general social structure throughout the country . It is proved by the beautiful solidarity of domestic life in France . It is proved , among people of all classes , by the steady conscientiousness with which they maintain , and transmit to their children , their ancestral personal traditions . The extreme result of democratic doctrine ? the arbitrary supremacy of the lower classes ? however generous in impulse and agreeable to fervid faith , is something which France seems still almost as far from as ever . For the practical consequences of theoretical democracy , so far as it means that the ideal of equality shall drag down the ideal of excellence , would be either utopian , or barbarous , or both . And no one who knows contemporary France could possibly mistake it for either Barbary or Utopia . How eagerly , on the other hand , the advocates of an equality sanctioned neither by divine law , scientific observation , nor human experience occasionally try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notice by an anecdote told me by a professor in a provincial secondary school . He happened to be called on to examine candidates for free instruction ? for state scholarships ? in the school with which he was connected . . His subject was the history of France ; the candidates were children from twelve to fifteen years of age who had honorably completed the course of instruction in the primary schools of the region . In general , as I understand the case , they were of the respectable middle class ? the smaller bourgeoisie , or the more well-to-do peasantry . Their examiner began by asking  | them various questions concerning the older history of France . Their confusion of mind was appalling . They hopelessly mixed up kings and queens , cardinals and poets , wars and rebellions ; the only fixed idea in their minds seemed to be that France had once been in a state of deplorable turbulence , much like that which was said once to have been taught concerning ancient Rome in the common schools of Russia : " The last of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unprincipled demagogue named Brutus . A period of hideous disturbance followed which was brought to an end by the commanding genius of Julius Caesar . " Startled by the extraordinary ignorance displayed by these young French candidates for honorable distinction in the history of their country , their examiner was by chance reminded that he had put to them no questions concerning the history of the Revolution . The moment he touched on that the clouds rolled away . There was no Revolutionary incident so trivial that they did not know both the circumstances of it and the precise date ; some of them could transpose the Revolutionary calendar into the terms of common civilization at a moment 's notice ; they knew by heart not only the great men of the Revolution , but the smaller ones , too . They had been taught and had learned the history of France , in short ,  - -  and France , we must remember , was their own dear native land , ? as if until 1789 the whole country had been plunged in depths of medieval darkness , too dense to deserve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case is solitary and perhaps unique . But even if it indicate how apostles of democracy now and then demand elsewhere that nothing be taught to ignorant children except the doctrine and the legends and the pious tales of the Rights of Man , there is no reason why we should blame their purpose . In its philanthropic sincerity , it is as worthy of respect as is the contrary purpose of so many religious teachers , who suppress or distort the facts of heresy everywhere . Whether doctrine , legend , and pious tale be devout or philanthropic , they are honestly meant ; they represent conscientious effort to direct the course of children toward righteousness . On the other hand , there can be no question that any teaching of French history which neglects the development of France , throughout its thousand years of pre-Revolutionary existence , deliberately discards a priceless treasure of national tradition . The mood which would dictate.such a policy , too ? however aspiring and devoted in purpose ? involves further injury than this to the full welfare of the nation . It would evidently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from participation in public life , all who cherish this elder treasure of national tradition as in any wise comparable with the newer tradition of Revolutionary philanthropy . Thus it deprives the form of government in which it believes of what , in happier case , might be its most confident hope for endurance . For no one who comes to know the France of to-day can question that the men in actual power , however doctrinarian they may seem , and however tyrannical may seem the acts which they occasionally commit , are men of serious purpose , of alert intelligence , and of moral dignity . But neither can any such visitor doubt that there is equally serious purpose , equally alert intelligence , equal moral dignity , in many of their opponents . Were the republic as a system of government now in open danger , distrust of all sentiment not intensely republican might be a sad necessity of republican polity . As the republic stands to-day , one can perceive no reason why a policy of more hearty mutual confidence , of more magnanimous sympathy , should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be with generosity . France still seems a country of irreconcilable antagonisms ; yet France , I believe , has reached a point where such reconciliation is no longer inconceivable . Born of necessity , as we have seen , the republic has had the unique fortune of persistence throughout the range of average human memory . And it has proved , whatever else , favorable to the material welfare of the country which it has governed . And meanwhile chance has greatly weakened the hold on popular imagination of the systems ? royalist or imperialist ? which during the earlier years of its existence were threatening rivals in their claim to power and to loyalty in France . Another fact about it is surely true . The men now living in France , whatever their personal convictions , are men who have lived for more than thirty-five years under no other form of government than this . They have inherited , one and all , from the traditions of former  | times the habit of mutual intolerance and suspicion . Men of each side will honestly tell you , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theirs are either densely stupid or deliberately wicked . Yet when you meet those other men , who will tell you just the same things about their critics , you can not feel that in truth they are either unintelligent or evil . There are unworthy people , no doubt , in any party , anywhere . What is more salient to a traveller among divergent kinds of Frenchmen is not this fact that some men everywhere must fail to command his complete esteem . It is rather that wherever he goes , among radicals or reactionaries , devout Catholics or philanthropic philosophers , he will surely find honest and admirable gentlemen , in the best sense of the term . There is less true discord of the spirit left in France than Frenchmen yet seem to dream . There are not wanting , meantime , certain small symptoms that the French themselves may perhaps be approaching a point where they can at last do more justice to one another than has been quite possible through the recurrently revolutionary period of the nineteenth century . A happy suggestion of this came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to some interesting old towns in central France . A month or two before I had written for a French review an article on contemporary politics in America . In the course of this , I had mentioned , as a commonplace . the view of American democracy which I have long entertained , namely , that it is not the tyranny of anv one class over any other , but the consent of all classes -- none secured by inflexible privilege ? to exist together under a system which all can trust , on the whole , to act as the guardian and the agent of their common welfare . For the moment nothing was further from my mind than this little essay of mine in political philosophy . I had passed a delightful day in travelling through beautiful and interesting country ; and came hungry to my dinner in the chief hotel of a small town remarkable for possessing some romantic mediaeval buildings and an excellent secondary school . Some of my neighbors at table presently proved to he teachers in this establishment ; they were highly intelligent young men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which one could not help overhearing , was eagerly concerned with democratic doctrines , and indicated no difference of opinion about general principles . It was an alertly critical discussion of a phase of democratic doctrine which to them seemed new . To my rather amused surprise , this turned out to have been suggested by my own article . They had no idea who I was , and , I fancy , not much that , in my character of a foreign traveller , I was paying any attention to what they said . In point of fact , however , they were eagerly wondering whether my doctrine ? that a truly healthy democracy could never coexist with a persistent misunderstanding between social classes ? might not throw light on the present troubles of France . The democracy of America they freely admitted to display a quality of traditional endurance not yet evident in the newer democracy of their own country . The democracy of France , they went on to say , had always been intolerantly distrustful of the old privileged class , the nobility . They admitted that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them that any other course was possible . Was it conceivable that they had been mistaken ? that the French people could never be a complete people unless it was willing to count as an essential part of itself that very nobility , which , after all , was as French as they were themselves ? In other words , it appeared , these young Frenchmen had been at least momentarily impressed by two or three suggestions in my article which seemed to them far more novel than to me . Any stable national government , for one thing , must take into its account the full range of rooted national tradition . This is obviously the case in England to-day , where the nation , as a whole , cherishes with equal respect and affection the memory of men who took the side of the king in the civil wars of the seventeenth century and of those who took the side of Parliament . There are statues in London of both Charles I and Cromwell ; and England could not be the England of our own time , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them . Something similar is true already of our own republic , the United States . Little more than forty years ago , we were engaged in the most portentous civil war in modern history ; to-day the survivors of that conflict are fellow-countrymen whose mortal enmi- ties are beginning to be fused in precious historical memories . Our American republic has had no more loyal services in all its career than it has received already from honest men who fought hard against it through four earnest years . The monuments which commemorate Union soldiers in the North and those which commemorate Confederate soldiers in the South have already been consecrated by the friendly presence of men who fought against the dead in whose honor they were raised . It will not be much longer , one grows confident , before the descendants of both sides shall find themselves ready to join in equal tribute to the heroes of both . When that time comes our true national tradition will come once more to be that of a united country . Again , it is beyond peradventure that an enduring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people ? a single social class -- -is dominant , to the exclusion of the rest . Such a state of affairs is a democracy only in name . In fact , it is at best an oligarchy ? and oligarchy is oligarchy , whether the ruling class chance to be large or small , high or low . What is more , good sense should seem to remind us that the oligarchical tyranny of the masses must be a more dangerous ? a less tolerable ? one than an oligarchical tyranny on the part of people of the better sort . For surely , to put the case most mildly , it must be animated by Iess intelligence and by more fickle instability of emotion . To us of America , immemorially habituated to the practice of democracy , the notion of submitting ourselves to the direction of a small privileged ( LI S d abhorrent . Hardly less so , in really , valid be the notion of submitting ourselves to the absolute sovereignty of a lower class , privileged in point of mere numbers by the very fact of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment under the suspicion that too much power among ourselves is concentrating itself in the hands of our richest men . We are little less restive at the suggestion that there is danger of finding our country at the mercy of trades-unions . It is not that either form of oligarchy might not conceivably work well , or even prove beneficial . It is rather that both alike are oligarchy , and not democracy . For true democracy , I can not too earnestly repeat , must tolerantly include all manner of men and of classes who are sure to exist inevery vital nation . It must give each his due , and demand its own due from each . It must preserve the structure of society so firmly that the opportunity of a career shall always be open to talent . It must preserve such liberty of the individual that no inherited privilege shall keep weakness long secure , nor stand in the way of ability born in a station too narrow for its power . But it may never safely meddle with the elemental truths of human nature -- pretegding things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safely deny the fatal fact that most men , in whatever range of human effort , are bound to have their superiors in power , and that civic insecurity is the surest means to offer the semblance of a career not to talent but to mischief . It must recognize in itself not an immortal and inspired system , but only one of the means by which human beings attempt so to govern society that society may advance in prosperity and in righteousness . It must humbly admit itself as subject as any polity which it opposes to the insidious temptation of such tyranny as must surely bring any form of government to grief . If democracy can truly rise to such full sense as this of its duties and its limitations , it may grow , by such happy historical chance as has been our own in America , into the venerable sanction of historical tradition . Then , and only then , it can begin to enjoy such security as shall warrant it in holding high hopes for the future . And these hopes shall be the higher , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself to democracy is such a nation as the France of to-day , rich with many noble memories , instead of with only one . In outward semblance the vital traditions of France seem fatally divergent , but at least they have the deep community of enthusiastic devotion to ideals . Though the dream that these several ideals can ever be reconciled may well seem utopian , it already has the sanction of a memorable phrase . And this phrase , I found , appeals nowadays to almost every Frenchman , whatever the complexion of his political convictions . Again and again , amid surroundings which seem hopelessly at odds with each other , this same little story was told me , and always with the same admiring sympathy with its truth . For it goes straight to the heart , not of one party or another , not of one or another system of doc- trinal tradition , but of all alike . It touches the common imagination of the whole people ? not in the mere democratic sense of the word , but in that broader and truer sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood is flowing . The greatest military calamity of the war which brought the empire to an end , and from which the present republic emerged as the only system of government for the moment practicable , was the surrender of Metz with its intact army , by Marshal Bazaine . What his motive may have been remains debatable . Whatever the case , there can be no doubt that he gave up , without a blow , a force with which the invaders of his country would otherwise have had to reckon . Wherefore , in due time , when the war was ended , he was brought to military trial . There , in his own defence , he maintained that at the moment of his surrender the empire had fallen , and no government had arisen securely in its place . His duty had been to defend the government . With the disappearance of constituted authority it came to an end . The citadel was in the hands of the enemy . The empire was a thing of the past . What was left to fight for ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer was made by the member of his court of judges who could make it best . From the time when the kingdom of Louis Philippe had fallen the princes of the house of Orleans had been mostly in exile from their native country . Their presence there in any position would have seemed to menace either the republic which for a little while ensued on the constitutional monarchy or the revived empire before which the second republic fell . But the moment that France was in national danger , struggling with the terrific force of foreign invasion , the Orleanist princes came back to their century , not as royal personages , but only as Frenchmen . As such they were welcomed with all the rest ; and the royal prince who ? of all his kind ? has perhaps done most to re-establish the dignity of royal character in the estimation of a radical century was among the officers who sat in judgment on the accused marshal of the second empire . It was he ? the Duc d'Aumale , the son of Louis Philippe ? who made the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was nothing to defend , said Bazaine ? " Il n'y avait rien . " " Monsieur le Marechal , " said the royal prince , " il restait la France . " ? " There was France . " So there was , and so there is , and so there shall be . France has been the France of the empire ; France to-day is the France of the republic ; and no Frenchman who would treasure the full richness of memories which have gathered in his country may wisely forget the glories of either . But neither comprehends France , any more than France was completely comprehended in that constitutional monarchy which made the house of Orleans for a while sovereign by the will of the people . The true France embraces all three , and more and more besides . It is the France of the song of Roland , the France of St. Louis , the France of Jeanne d'Arc . It is the France of the Renaissance , and the France of Henry IV ; the France of Richelieu , and the France which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century of Louis XIV . It is the France of the old regime , as well , the France of the Revolution , and the France of the empire . It is the France of that bewildering , aspiring nineteenth century over whose history we have been lingering together . No single one of these memories , nor yet of the myriad others which these stirring names evoke , has made the France of to-day such as it has seemed to me and as I have tried to tell you . All of them together combine to make France heroic ? none alone , none apart or neglected . Without every glory of its glorious past , France would be the poorer , the lesser . All of them , blended and shining together , make the France of to-day that inexhaustibly noble fact which those who come to know it , and thus grow to love it , must always feel it to be . So when , now and again , good friends of mine were apt to speak of France as the republic , I found myself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak not of the republic , but of France . This implied no lack of eager response to the kindness with which the French republicans whom I met welcomed me to their friendly country . It implied , indeed , no shadow of doubt that the system of the present republic , strengthening as it is into an immemorial tradition , is the system under which that friendly country may most confidently hope for a future as admirable as its past . What  | I felt was only that the word republic still might seem to mean not the whole nation , but only the accident of the sovereignty under which that nation now finds itself . To the French themselves , the republic still appears not so much national as partisan . I long , with the best of them , for the time when it shall have grown to be no longer partisan but national ; and I believe that the time will come . But even then we shall be truer to the full splendor of the past , if we salute the republic still as France , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the utmost can ever comprehend it all .
