AN animal can not move upon the surface of the earth without leav ing a record of his progress in the note-book of Nature , and if we can not read the records written in that book , it means either that our eyes are not sharp enough to see them or that we do not . understand the characters in which they are written . If a deer takes but a single step , he alters the contour of the earth . De depresses the soil , scrapes the lichen from a rock , or bends a blade of grass beneath his hoof . If he nibbles a leaf , the scar remains , and if he rubs his neck or his antlers against a tree , he is sure to break a twig or to detach loose pieces of the bark . All such records are phrases in the language of the trails . In this language , as in other written languages , there are many characters , each of which is subject to endless modifications , and , like the letters of our own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain arrangement of footprints and other marks on a trail means that a rabbit has been present under certain definite conditions . It means that he was travelling at a par-ticular gait , at a VOL . CX ( I. ? No. 667-16 particular speed , in a particular direction , and over a particular kind of ground . A modification of the record he has left would signify that some of these conditions were different , No man knows the language well enough to translate correctly all the records he sees , but any one who is really interested in the doings of animals can learn to translate enough to make him feel thoroughly at home in the woods ' and fields . At no time of the year are certain phrases of the language more legible than in winter , when they are seen as clear impressions in the snow , and I propose to confine this brief article chiefly to a discussion of certain records which I have read at this season . The first time I went out for this purpose was a white morning in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and every twig was bending beneath its burden of snow . The storm ? if such a gentle down-floating of feathery flocks could be called a storm ? had ceased . The sun was bright , but the air was cold and clear and still , All movements on the earth gave muffled sounds , and perhaps for this reason the cawing of crows and other voices from the'air were unusually distinct . As I tramped along on my snow-shoes , there came to me from the corner of a field the musical tinkling twitter of tree-sparrows . As I approached , the merry little birds flew up and away , but they left a network of tracks upon the floor of a forest of dry weeds which projected above the snow . There was something very beautiful about . these tracks ; they looked as if they might have been made by a band of fairies dancing on snow-shoes . On the weeds were many pods containing seeds , and it was for these that the birds had come here . A myriad scattered fragments of the weeds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ busy they had been . But in the story of this merry gathering there was a touch of pathos : while nearly all the tiny footprints were arranged in pairs , one there was which had no mate ? it had been made by a bird which had lost a foot . Up and down among the weed stalks I traced it ? a single print made by the left foot ; here and there by its side was a little round dent , doubtless made by the stump of the right leg . That this disabled little soldier had tried to balance himself with his wings occasionally could be seen by impressions which were much deeper than those made by the wings of the other birds when they flew away . The next track I saw was that of a large dog ; great broad imprints which could have been made by nothing else thereabouts . The old fellow had evident-ly been out for a walk by himself , for no other tracks were near . He had sauntered along a fence , sniffing here and there at fence-posts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and entered a wood . Here he had come upon the trail of a rabbit , and he had followed it for half a mile to the mouth of a drain , which was quite too small to admit his huge body . Here he had done a lot of useless scratch-ing , and had finally trotted off , doubtless greatly disappointed . There were no rabbit tracks leading out of the drain , so I knew that " Bunny " must still be biding . I took a long stick , and after a little gentle poking , out the rabbit popped and away he leaped across the snow , leaving a beautiful Y-shaped track at every jump . Of course no eye is quick enough to follow the move-ments of a rabbit 's feet when lie is going at full speed , but if you watch him from a hiding-place sometime , and see him hopping slowly along , it is easy enough to learn how that Y-shaped track is made . The two small fore feet go down into the snow either side by side or one in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often making but one impression , and then the large hind feet are thrown forward , one on either side of the body , and make two separate and larger depressions , usually more or less in advance of those made by the fore feet ? how numb in advance depends a good deal upon the speed at which the animal is travelling , which in turn depends more or less upon the depth of the snow . had T never seen the rabbit I had just started , the appearance of the trail before me would have imparted the information that lie had been going at full speed . Speaking of the conditions which govern the appearance of an animal 's trail , let me say that it is affected not only by the depth but by the condition of the snow . As an example I will take the track of a deer . On a very light snow one sees simply the pointed hoof - marks , arranged according to the gait and speed at which the deer was moving when he made them . If the snow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each footprint two little holes , one on either side . These were punched by the dew-claws , which were too high up on the leg to reach the shallower snow . if the snow is deeper still , the feet simply make holes in it , but even these holes differ in form with the quality of the snow . If the latter is light and fluffy , the holes are ragged and the hoof-marks are obliterated ; if it is firm and moist , the holes are sharper in outline and the hoof-prints are distinct at the bottom . And if there is a crust on the snow , the hole is dumb-bell-shaped , each foot having made a roundish hole where it went in , another where it came out , and between the two a narrow line , cut by the sharp shin in the forward movement before the foot was withdrawn . Crossing an open space in the woods , I came upon the trail of a red squirrel . It started at a point several feet from the base of an oak-tree , showing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distance from the ground . The snow at the base of the tree was sprinkled with fragments of the bark , which had doubtless been detached by the claws of the squirrel . Where he had landed he had made an irregular hole in the snow , but as he had got into his stride , he had taken a series of fairly uniform leaps in a straight line to another tree , and from that to another and another , marking out triangles , pentagons , and other geometric figures , with a tree at every corner . The trail itself closely resembled that of a rabbit , except that it was smaller . I had walked along some time , when I saw extending across my path the delicate trail of a white-footed mouse . I followed it until it led me out of the wood , wondering if it . would end as did another mouse trail I found one winter ? in a blood-stain in the centre of a deep depression , evidently made by some bird of prey , probably an owl , which in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the pathway of the terrified rodent . But the mouse which had made the trail before me had been more fortimate . He had gone well out into the open , down a hill to an old cherry-tree , had hunted for cherry-pits , found and eaten two , and then returned , crossing his own trail on the side of the hill . If the reader had been present , he would have seen much of the story of this mouse 's journey told there in the language of the trails . Supposing ourselves to be standing in the fore-ground of the scene and facing the in-tersection of the trails , it was evident that the mouse was going away from us when he made the right-hand trail . This we could tell by the disposition of the foot-prints , two large ones in front and two small ones behind , as in the case of the rabbit trail spoken of above . In the same way we could tell by certain of the foot-prints on the left-hand trail that the mouse was coming toward us when he made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he must have been going down-hill on the . right-hand trail and coming up-hill on the left one ; for if we had counted the num-ber of leaps made from the first set of footprints on each trail to the point where the two intersected , we should have found there were ten on the right-hand trail and fourteen on the one to the left , showing that while the mouse took only ten jumps to go down-hill to a certain point , he took fourteen jumps to come back up-hill the same distance . Then going down-hill the travelling would naturally be easier , and the animal would probably move freely at a good pace , and as a result the hind feet would be thrown well in front at each leap . This is evidently what happened when the right-hand trail was made , as shown by four distinct impressions in each group of footprints . Com-ing back up the hill , however , the animal could nut move so freely ; he would he likely to travel more slowly , and as a consequence the marks of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The story told by the left-hand trail agreed with this , for it was evident that in most cases , at least , the hind feet did not go far enough ahead to clear the imprints of the fore feet , but fell into them and obliterated them , leaving two impressions instead of four in each group . Looking at the trails once more , we should have seen that as long as the mouse was fresh and moving freely on the down trail his tail left no mark , as it was held up in the air . But coming back up the hill , when he was probably tired , or at any rate could not more so freely , the tail was dropped occasionally and left a record of the fact in the snow . The next time I went out to study the language of the trails the snow lay three and a half inches deep . While crossing a frozen pond I ran upon the trail of a mink ? a trail which I always follow if I have time , as there is sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a newspaper man would say . The trail in this particular depth and quality of snow consisted of a series of oblong holes , made by the four feet of the mink et the end of each leap . Having crossed the pond , the little animal had followed the line of the shore , stopping here and there to nose under rocks and roots , until he reached a point where a stream flowed kn. ) the pond . Then he had followed the bank of the stream and presently had reached a hole in the ice , where his footprints disappeared , showing that he had entered the water . A little farther on there was another hole , where he had come out again , and it was evident from the trampled , blood-stained snow and the fish-scales lying about that he had captured n fish and that he had eaten it on this spot . And where the snow had been wet the mink had left clear individual impressions of his feet .. One unaccustomed to the winter woods can hardly realize the number of woodland tragedies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , foxes , wildcats , mink , weasels , and other carnivorous animals are literally " out for blood , " and the very fact that their tracks are found at all is good evidence that a fair measure of success attends their expeditions . That they are alive means that there have been many deaths , and most of these deaths were tragic . I was once following the trail of a rabbit , when I found it abruptly joined by that of a weasel . From this point the two trails had the seine direction , and often they were interlaced . They led me through a wood , over rocks , and between tree trunks , to a pile of brush left by the lumbermen . Here the rabbit 's tracks ended in a mass of gray fur which moved in the wind , and beyond the brush-pile for a leap or two the tracks of the weasel were bloody . Sometimes it is a fox which has been 11 o ti n g , and I follow the stealthily made footprints , arranged one almost directly in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his intended victim . ' Sometimes the latter is a muskrat which has been busy scratching and tunnelling in a snow-covered corn - field to gather the few grains of corn which the farmers had left in the autumn , and I can see exactly the point at which the rat first became aware of the presence of his enemy . Up to that point , perhaps , his footprints are arranged in a zigzag line , made as he walked or trotted from one likely spot to another , stopping to scratch at each for the kernel he knew or guessed was beneath . But when he saw the fox he broke into a gallop , and the footprints are arranged in a pattern somewhat like that made by the rabbit , while probably there is a line running through them , made by tho knifelike , almost hairless tail , which trailed on the ground behind . Sometimes the fox 's intended victim is a gray squirrel , surprised perhaps in the act of digging beneath the snow for nuts hidden in the autumn ; and again the trail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has plunged beneath the snow to pass the night . Once , after following a fox for some distance , I had the satisfaction of getting a glimpse of him as he lay intently watching a grouse which was feeding on bayberries . Every now and then his tail quivered with suppressed excitement , and several times he half started forward , as though he could hardly control the strong impulse to dash out after his prey . At last , as the grouse , all unconscious of danger , came as near the fox as it soc-nned likely that sho would come , Reynard launched himself , and there was a red streak across the snow . The distance was just too far for complete success , however , and all he got was a little bunch of feathers as the grouse whirred away through the bushes . When I came up the whole story was written out in plain characters . One of the most interesting records of the kind which I ever saw I came upon one evening as I was walking along the western slope of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Boston . The first part of the record , shown in the photograph on page 123 , consisted of a few nearly straight parallel lines about a foot long , followed by four distinct pairs of impressions , evidently made by the wings of some large bird . On the centre line of the trail there were two smaller holes , one midway between each of the last two pairs of wing-prints . The last pair of wing-prints was lighter than the others , and on the left one there was a small blood-stain , which shows quite plainly even in the photograph . This was all very interesting , but I felt that it represented but one chapter of the story , and I at once began to search for the rest of it . After some tramping about , I found , much higher up on the hillside and about fifty yards from the record I have described , two sets of three parallel lines , cut in the soft snow apparently by the primary feathers of the right wing of a bird . They were directly beneath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet from the ground . Forty yards beyond this point I came upon a record showing four sets of wing impressions much like the first ones . The last pair were made quite close to the foot of a straggling bush , and beneath the overhanging branches of this there was a heap of feathers the feathers of a ruffed grouse . This , at least , was the last chapter of the story . To give the precise meaning of every character in this record is beyond my scant knowledge of the language , but the following rough translation may not be so very far from the correct one . In the depression at the end of the first parallel lines a grouse had been sitting , possibly with a view to spending the night there . A large bird of prey had seen her , swooped and struck her . This bird in nearing the ground had depressed its tail to check its flight at the last , and in doing so had with its tail feathers cut the parallel lines spoken of above . The raptor had struck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prey . But the grouse was heavy ( there was abundant food at the time ) , and for a short distance its bearer could do nothing better than flap along the ground , striking the snow heavily with its wings , and allowing the feet of the grouse to drag or puncture the snow . But after the third flap it began to rise ; at the fourth flap its wings struck the snow with little force ; at the fifth they did not touch the ground at all . Just as the bird of prey began to rise , the blood began to flow from its wounded victim , and a drop fell to the snow . The captor then carried its victim up the hill toward the spot where the final disposition was made , but in doing so it had to pass under a low-growing branch . At this point the grouse , which was struggling hard , with her right wing free , had cut the snow with her primaries twice before she was again carried up out of reach of the ground . Then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dine , had sailed low , checked itself with its tail as before , flapped several times along the ground , in order to reach the hush , which , for the grouse , marked the end of the trail . Of course , footprints in the snow COElituLe but a very small part of the Ianauage of the trails , but perhaps it is the easiest pert for the beginner . Later he will be able to read the records left elsewhere . By a study of the tracks of a doe in May he may discover the hiding-place of her tiny spotted fawn , newly horn , and lying , seemingly a patch of white flowers , in the shadow of the wood ; and he may tell the very day that it is able to follow its mother as she wanders through the forest by watching for the wee footprints beside the larger ones . Every mark on the ground , every scratch on the hark of a tree , every depression made in the grass by the body of a sleeping animal , is a character in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its flight , a tuft of hair clinging to a twig or root , the east skin of a snake lying among the stones ? each has a definite piece of information ( apart from the feet of its presence ) to impart to one well versed in the language of the trails .
