 | ON April 8 , 1908 , my brother , Dr C. G. Mixter , Mr C. R. Cross , Jr. , and I left Seattle for Alaska with but a hazy idea of where we were going or what we would find when we got there . We knew that there was a place called Portage Bay on the Pacific coast of the Alaska Peninsula , where there was a small empty shack , and that opposite to it , on the Bering Sea coast , were Herendeen Bay and Port Moller Bay , on the former of which was a coal mine and a camp where the care-taker lived , in company with three horses ; this was the region where we expected to find the Great Brown Bear of Alaska , the Ursus gyas . We hoped ? for by this time definite knowledge ended ? that we would be able to get to the Coal Camp from Portage Bay , where we were to land , secure the use of the horses , transport our outfit to the other coast , and find some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us as guides . We had already telegraphed to Seward , Alaska , a town some 400 miles east of Portage Bay , engaging a certain Alfred Lowell , who had the reputation of being an excellent hunter and a strong packer , but who , of course , knew nothing of the country where we intended to hunt . We spent seven days on the steamer Yucatan , following the coast back of Vancouver Island , through Seymour Narrows , and then , by the outside passage , straight to Cordova , Alaska , the terminus of the Copper River Railway , which is being built to form an outlet for the rich Copper River region . From here we followed a coast of extreme grandeur to Valdez and Seward , where we landed on the 15th . Seward , like Cordova , was a railway terminal and grew to a large town , but the Alaska Central Railroad was abandoned after penetrating 56 miles inland , and Seward is now nearly a dead town , with half of its houses deserted . We found Alfred , and the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dora , a small and unsteady but very seaworthy craft . This part of the journey took us past Kodiak Island , near the middle of which we left the last trees we were to see until our return . To the westward there is nothing larger than alder bushes and scrub willows , which , by the way , will not burn in the open ,  | but have to be burned in a stove , which we found later to be the most important item in our camp outfit . As we got farther west the scenery grew more and more splendid , but the weather became steadily worse , wind and snow or sleet becoming the rule . Our most interesting point of call beyond Kodiak was Chignik , where there is one of the largest salmon canneries in that region , and where the rocks and snow mountains are particularly fine . On April 27 we landed at Portage Bay in a blinding blizzard , and settled ourselves in the shack . We had already decided that , even if we could get them , the horses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight feet of snow , so we were rather at our wit 's end to know how to get our outfit across . When the weather moderated , Cross and Alfred left us and started to find the Coal Camp , where they arrived after covering a very bad 16 miles . By good luck they found at the camp a white man named Johnson with a team of four " outside dogs " ( so called in contrast to the native dog , and which were in this case part setter and part " just dog , " and made excellent pullers ) , so as soon as Cross , who had gone wholly snow-blind after the trip over the divide , was able to see well enough to take care of himself , Alfred and Johnson left him and came back to us with the dog-team . We were thus able to get our outfit , including a 15-foot cedar canoe , to the Coal Camp after three or four days of good hard work . Before leaving the United States we had bought of the principal owners of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boat , salvaged the previous year near the mouth of the Herendeen Bay , where there is a station for catching and salting salmon . The next thing to do was to get our boat , but this was impossible for the present , as there were still 22 inches of ice in Herendeen Bay , and it was not until the 23d of May that we started for our real hunting grounds on Port Moller , and before that time we were fortunate enough to find two men whom we engaged to go with us . One of them , Mike Munson , a Swede , was a trapper , and the other , Andrew , an Aleut native , came as cook . It turned out that Mike knew but little and Andrew nothing at all about the country , but both proved excellent fellows and willing workers . Andrew was from a small Indian village on the Bering Sea coast at the mouth of Bear River , the largest stream we found , which was composed of perhaps 20 " barabaras " or native houses . The Indians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the country ) , and are clean , though rather lazy . There are also a few Eskimo who have drifted down from Cape Nome , the southern boundary of their original district , and these are far more industrious than the native Aleuts . We found a small band of them camped at a hot sulphur spring near the shore of Port Moller . We gradually became accustomed to the sudden heavy wind squalls ( known as wooleys ) and the incessant rain , which are the rule during May and the first half of June , and soon learned to pitch our tents in the middle of a thick clump of alders and to build wind-breaks around them . Nor did it take long to find a way to arrange our belongings indoors to give plenty of room near the stove for drying racks of alder sticks . It was very early on the trip , too , that we learned the inflammability of the paraffined silk of which our main tent was made , for a defective asbestos ring around the stovepipe set fire to the cloth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before we could extinguish it . After this accident we used what was left of the old tent , and added to it an extension about seven feet long , which we christened the portico . The old part , now about nine feet square , we used for a sleeping-room , and put our stove , drying racks , etc. , in the portico , which we made from the canvas tarpaulins from our blanket-rolls . At this work Mike was invaluable , as he had been a sailor and was quite at  | home with a sail-maker 's needle and palm . In fact , although we all worked on it , he was really the one who made the tent habitable . Later he was again invaluable to us as a cobbler , for we found that we had to do most of our hunting in rubber boots on account of the wet , and the daily mountain climbing wore them out very rapidly . Each of the party wore out two pairs of rubber boots and two pairs of " shoe packs " ( shoes with rubber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , and when they were gone Mike cut off the legs of the rubber boots , which were still whole , and sewed them to some ordinary tramping boots which we had up to that time found no use for . Our menu was very good most of the time , for the country contained quantities of caribou , Arctic hare , porcupine , and ground squirrels , besides clucks , ptarmigan , small shore and land birds , and an occasional goose and white swan . Of course the bay swarmed with gulls , and we found their eggs excellent and easy to gather , for , although Port Moller Bay is zo miles long and four or five wide , it contains only two very small islands , and these are literally covered with gulls ' nests . Our principal staple when we left the neighborhood of Gull Island was caribou meat , and we found it very good and that we did not tire of it as quickly as is the case with most game . The liver , eaten within twelve hours from the time the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is far better than the calf 's liver one gets in the market , and is , in fact , entirely different in flavor . We had with us , of course , such staples as flour , sugar , baking powder , corn and oat meal , rice , salt , tea , bacon , and dried fruits , the latter being very acceptable in the absence of fresh vegetables . The country is very rugged . and during the early weeks of our trip the heavy snow , soggy with the rain and fog , made hunting very difficult , especially as the bears kept well up to the tops of the mountains until the snow left the slopes bare , and they could browse on the young grass and alder buds lower down . We were soaked with the rain from morning until night , and the streams , fed by the melting snow and glaciers , are often waist deep , and must be waded many times a day . They are so swift and rocky , however , that we had to tow the canoe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camp , and even running down we always prepared for a capsize and were seldom disappointed . The method of hunting was , to the uninitiated , rather curious . We left camp about 7 o'clock and made ourselves comfortable on the first knoll which gave us a good view of the surrounding country . Here we spent from half an hour to two hours examining every foot of the country in sight with our field glasses , which were good binoculars , to discover a bear or some fresh tracks in the snowfields . The bear were generally two or three miles away when first seen , and a long stalk , sometimes lasting four or five hours , followed , the shots being made at distances ranging from 5o to 350 yards . If nothing was seen from the first lookout , we moved some miles to another and repeated the same tactics , the total country examined in a day by the whole party ( which usually went out in two divisions , one taking Alfred and the other taking Mike ) being enormous , although we seldom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very early in the season , I was out with Alfred , and about zo in the morning sighted a bear and a cub playing in the snow on the top of a ridge perhaps 300 feet above the valley floor . Our stalk was a difficult one , first over snow and then over slide-rock , where the slope was so steep that it was quite bare . Although the temperature was several degrees below freezing , we stripped to our undershirts and were dripping with perspiration before we reached the crest by the opposite slope from the bears . They had not gone far , and were about 75 yards away and below us . Between us and them we saw a hole in the snow , which turned out to be the den which they had just left after  | their winter hibernation , and toward it they were now making their way . The old bear had evidently been warned of some danger , for she drove the cub into the den and continued alone toward where I was sitting with my gun ready . I let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped and looked up , exposing her chest . She was my first bear and looked as big as a house , and it was not surprising , perhaps , that I shot high . She was growling , her mouth wide open , and my shot struck a canine tooth , glancing off without doing any damage , so I. fired again with better effect . By this time the cub had heard the racket , so she came out of the den and proceeded to get mixed up in her mother 's legs , making it hard to shoot without hitting the little fellow . After  | a while I got in another shot , and the old bear went somersaults down the snow slide , much to the horror of the cub , which took one look and made for the den . Here Alfred followed her , and , with a great deal of trouble , managed to catch her by the ears and carry her squealing and fighting out of the hole . We made a collar of my gun sling and led her down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy work of skinning began . It takes from one to three hours to do this job , and I for one was tired when we got back to camp at half-past 7 . Alfred had packed the skin , which , though not as large as many we got later , weighed 105 pounds , and I led the cub until she gave out , and then packed her the last mile to camp in my coat . After this she and the two others which we caught later lived in the cook tent with the boys , and soon learned to be decent members of society when left quite alone . When we first caught them we had a good deal of trouble to make the cubs eat . We had neither the time nor the ingenuity to devise a makeshift nursingbottle , and condensed milk was too much of a luxury to give it to them as a regular diet . This first cub , Fritzi , was the hardest to teach . At first she would slap a dish or spoon out of our hands , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a thin oatmeal gruel with a good deal of milk and , holding a spoonful just out of reach , waited until the baby 's rage got the better of her and she opened her mouth and wailed . Then a well-aimed toss sent a spoonful of gruel into her mouth , and she had to swallow it . It was a long process , but I can not give any idea of how funny it was , as the noises and antics of this half-human baby are not to be described . After a while , by dint of much coaxing , the cubs learned how good the food was , and after that the mere sight of a dish was enough to set them squealing . In fact , when we were at meals , Fritzi would tease to be fed , and would wail most dismally if no notice were taken of her . Luckily for all concerned , the men were devoted to the cubs ; in fact , the suggestion that they live in the cook tent came from them , and the extra work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The cubs , Fritzi , Pauline , and Little Willie , kept well and healthy throughout the trip , and I think the boys were all very sorry when it came time to set sail for civilization and start the " babies " on their long journey to the bear dens of the National Zoological Park at Washington , where they now seem to be quite happy and absolutely at home . THE ALASKAN BROWN BEAR MR WILFRID H. OSGOOD , of the U. S. Biological Survey , gives the following account of the Alaskan bears in the last Yearbook of the Department of Agriculture : Alaska is without a rival in respect to the number and the variety of its bears . They belong to four general types : the brown bears , the grizzlies , the black bears , and the polar bears . The brown bears are the most numerous and most important . They are of huge size , being much larger than the grizzlies and all other bears except the polar bear and their own relatives of Kamchatka . Therefore the statement , often made , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs little , if any , qualification . They are confined almost exclusively to the coast region , ranging from Bering Sea throughout the Alaska Peninsula and some outlying islands , and thence south along the Pacific coast nearly or quite to British Columbia . Their color varies greatly , ranging from dark seal brown to bully brown , the feet , legs , and underparts usually being darker than the shoulders and back . Although the ends of the hairs are often paler than the bases , the silver-tipped effect of the grizzlies is wanting . The front claws are shorter , thicker , and more abruptly curved than in the grizzlies . It is often said that the brown bears  | are less ferocious than the grizzlies , but the evidence is conflicting . Certainly they are more powerful and at close quarters correspondingly dangerous . They come out of hibernation early in the spring , usually in April . When the salmon begins to run they feed largely on them , and on this account have been called fish bears , or fish-eating bears , although other bears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of other food , however , including kelp and shellfish secured about the mouths of streams and along tide flats , and also berries , roots , ground squirrels , and mice , obtained on higher ground . The brown bears of Alaska will doubtless become very rare or extinct at no very distant date . Such formidable carnivorous animals , even though not inclined to attack human beings , are commonly regarded as a menace to the safety of travelers , and therefore undeserving of protection . Already they have become scarce on Kodiak Island , where formerly very abundant , and on the Alaska Peninsula , though still fairly numerous , they are being killed at a rate probably greatly in excess of their increase . In the heavy forests of southeast Alaska and in the region of Mount Saint Elias they may hold their own longer .
