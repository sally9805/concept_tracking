For many years the late Lord Acton of Cambridge is said to have cherished the plan of writing a History of Liberty , which , considering his vast erudition , would probably have been a masterpiece of historical writing . Professor Mackinnon , of St. Andrews University , has given us the first two volumes of a work planned on somewhat the same lines , except that he purposes to restrict himself to a narrower field , ? namely , the history of liberty during modern times . This self-imposed limitation has not , however , been strictly observed by the author , for his initial volume is devoted entirely to the premodern period , with a view to tracing the mediaeval origins of modern liberty which were slowly evolved from the chaos and confusion of the Roman Empire in the West . The second volume covers the period of the Reformation , the major part being devoted to a study of the struggle for liberty in England and Scotland ; for here it was , says the author , that " the great battle of constitutional liberty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reformation Age in those countries formed the preliminary of that great constitutional drama . " Succeeding volumes , we are told , will be devoted mainly to tracing the impulse which the theories and conflicts of the sixteenth century gave to liberty , which came to full maturity in the French Revolution , and were displayed in the constitutional struggle in England and Scotland in the seventeenth century , the American and the French Revolutions in the eighteenth , and in those movements in the nineteenth century resulting in the establishment of full intellectual , religious , political , and social liberty . An examination of the two volumes at hand warrants the conclusion that a useful and valuable contribution to historical literature will be made if the work is ever completed on the scale its author planned . It should be observed , however , that the work is designed to be what its name indicates ? a history of liberty , not a philosophical treatise . In vain does one search for a discussion of the nature and limitations of liberty , with the exception of a few brief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have obtained in different ages and by different schools concerning the idea and scope of liberty . To some , this will appear to be a serious defect ; but in view of the author 's explicit disclaimer of an intention to treat his subject philosophi- cally , criticism on this score is hardly just . Nevertheless , we are justified in feeling a sense of regret that a work on so important a subject should be restricted entirely to its historical aspect . It may be seriously questioned whether the usefulness of the work would not have been increased by the topical method of treatment rather than the chronological . Thus , there is no place to which one can turn for an account of the rise of religious liberty , or the freedom of the press , or the other forms of intellectual emancipation . To gain specific information concerning the development of liberty under any one of these heads would require a reading of the entire work . Another possible ground of criticism is the inclusion in the history of much that has little or no bearing on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understood . Thus , there is a long account of the Reformation , that has little to do with liberty except as regards the emancipation of the Church from Rome . The work is encumbered with a detailed history of the religious wars , and a discussion of the lives and doctrines of Luther , Von Hutten , Calvin , Zwingli , and other reformers , containing a large amount of historical detail mainly foreign to the subject of liberty . The same is to a less extent true of the detailed discussion of the political theories of Machiavelli , Hotman , Languet , L'Hopital , Bodin , and other political philosophers , ? theories interesting in themselves , but belonging rather to a history of political philosophy than to a history of liberty . Professor Mackinnon 's style in places is characterized by lucidity of statement , forcefulness of expression , and even by brilliancy ; but too often the detail which mars his discussions is dry and prolix . Unfortunately for the serious student , he does not indulge in what he calls the luxury of footnotes , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the source of information for particular statements ; but this is not given . At the end of each chapter , however , is appended a list of the authorities consulted , an examination of which affords evidence that the author possesses a wide familiarity with the literature of his subject . Starting out with a definition of liberty as the free development of man , Professor Mackinnon reviews the history of the Middle Ages in a vain search for some evidence of that larger conception which the word possesses to-day . He points out that the terms " rights , " " liberties , " and " privileges " are frequently met with in the chronicles and state papers of the Middle Ages , but that they seldom had reference to the masses . " Liberty of the subject , " he says , applied to the privileged few , not to the servile class . Popular liberty as we understand it was wholly nonexistent . Occasionally a bold champion of freedom of thought and conscience appeared to challenge traditional authority , but he was usually suppressed by the sword @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of towns , following the crusades , gave an impulse to the movement for emancipation from feudal subjection . Then came a recognition of the rights of the craft-guilds , or artisans , and the gradual elevation of the peasantry in the social scale , to be followed in time by the admission of the Third Estate to the Parliaments . During the feudal regime , the individual overshadowed the State , just as during the period of the Roman Empire the State regulated and controlled almost every activity of the individual . The sovereignty of the individual under feudalism was no more conducive to the development of real liberty than was the despotism of Rome , for the former regime meant disintegration of the State , with its resulting anarchy and oppression of the masses , just as the latter meant the crushing out of the individuality of the citizen . Everywhere the despotism of caste tended to compress within narrow limits the liberty of action of the individual , and to destroy his sense of initiative and energy . The sum total of the struggles during the Middle Ages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partial freedom , the endowment of the merchant and artisan with political and civil rights , the attainment of municipal freedom , and the inauguration of the movement for intellectual and religious liberty . The Renaissance and the Reformation constitute an important stage in the evolution of modern liberty . The former was characterized by an emancipation of the intellect from the thralls of tradition and the bonds of the feudal age , the latter by an emancipation of the conscience in spiritual matters . More particularly it liberated the . soul from the authority of Rome and brought it into immediate relation with God . The modern spirit of liberty of thought and of worship breathed freer , and gradually awoke from the nightmare of authority . The Reformation , the author says , was a crusade in favor of liberty as the age understood liberty ; but , mighty as the movement was , it constituted little more than the mere background of that larger movement which did not finally take shape until the nineteenth century .  |            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
