txt Dowie 's restoration host , burdened with bandboxes , blanket rolls , and Bibles , evacuated Zion City to-day and is now moving 3,500 strong on Satan 's stronghold in Manhattan Island . Eight big special trains on as many different railroad systems left the faith healing community during the morning and early afternoon , skirted Chicago via the outer belt lines , and pushed eastward as fast as steam could carry them . Dowie 's plans contemplate the arrival of all the trains at the same time . There was no waving of flags or cheering or blowing of trumpets to mark the departure of the host from Zion . On the contrary , the train pulled away from the little city amid a silence as deep as Dowie 's strongbox and nearly as impressive . The restorer himself reserved his leavetaking until the last train . At 3 o'clock his carriage reached the station , and he entered the private car of the President of the Nickel Plate Railroad , attended by various members of his cabinet . That portion of Zion 's population which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left them , and the executive train steamed away with as little ceremony as did the others . Zion City was , astir early this morning . Daybreak disclosed the uniformed Zion guards scurrying through the streets completing the preparations for the exodus . and an hour later most of the population seemed to be on the alert . long before 8 o'clock the narrow boardwalk leading from the town to the station was full of prospective pilgrims , each family grouped under escort of a guard , who carried bundles of bedclothing , luncheon boxes , and other paraphernalia . At the station the crusaders ranged themselves 1n line and waited for the first train to be ready . As a part of the admirable arrangements each trainload went to the station separately , so that at no time was there confusion in the neighborhood of the tracks . The elimination of spectacular display previous to and during the departure was evidently at the direction of the General overseer , for each excursionist seemed to be laboring to repress his feelings . The chorus of " Peace . Be to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of restpraticnists , was pitched high in an excited tone . alany of the people talked of the sights they proposed to see at Niagara Falls , in ' Washington , or at other points of interest along the road , and others discussed the errand which takes them to New York . Devotion was not much in evidence , however , save where a Zion guard now and then drew front his belt a Bible and prayed sitently with some member , either wavering or for some other cause needing heavenly help . That the start eastward might not be entirely without its picturesque features , the departure of the first train , the Pennsylvania , was delayed until the whistle on the Fire Department headquarters sounded the signal for morning prayer . At the first harsh blast each follower of Zion ceased motion . The chatter- ' was - hushed , hats .. , - were doffed , and heads bowed in prayer . For two minutes there was ' an uncanny - silence. rflten another blast ended the supplication , and the crowd moved toward the train . Among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there Is a sprinkling of Asiatics among the guards . The Orient is represented by several Japanese and Syrians . Old men , with long , flowing beards : old women , middle-aged and youthful , even some with infants in arms , crowded the cars . Two Pullman coaches were attached to the rear of each special for the accommodation of the more well-to-do of Zion 's host . WHEN THE ARMY ARRIVES . Dowie Host to Visit Every Home in Manhattan  --  Big Meetings in Madison Square Garden . The " Restoration Host , " led by John Alexander Dowie , known among his followers as " Elijah , " having left Chicago yesterday morning , is expected to arrive in this city during the early hours of to-morrow morning , coming in at various railway stations . The crusaders will gather at Madison Square Garden , ready to begin a campaign against the flesh and the devil unique in the history of the metropolis . The baggage train , bearing the belongings of the crusaders . will arrive to-day at the Grand Central Station , and to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trunks and bags to hundreds of boarding houses and hotels throughout the city . For months Dowie , with his overseers , elders , evangelists , and deacons. has been preparing for the campaign and the huge undertaking has been planned with the minutest care . Advance agents have been in the city for weeks seeking lodging places for the huge army , arranging for food supplies , obtaining permits for marching in the streets , studying the city topographically. financially , morally , religiously , and in every one of its multifarious aspects . The entire city has been plotted into districts , and between Sunday next , when the crusade begins , and Nov. 8 , when it ends , every home from the mansions in Fifth Avenue to the humblest dwelling in the tenement districts of the ' east side still have been visited by a man or a woman member of the " Restoration Host . " It is expected that there will be some trouble with New York janitors , but the disciples of " Elijah II . " are instructed when smitten to turn the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is gained . Every member of the family visited will be greeted with the regulation " Elijah " greeting . which is in ' form as follows : " In the name of Christ , the King of Kings , I greet you with- His message : Peace be to this house . " Then will be placed in the hand of some member of the family a " restoration " tract and an invitation to attend a meeting in Madison Square Garden . Madison Square Garden , which is to be the headquarters and centre of activity in the campaign , resounded yesterday with a tremendous hammering and sawing . At the eastern end of the great amphitheatre was being erected a semi-circular platform capable of seating a thousand persons . On this platform will be seated the whiterobed choir of Zion , having 600 voices . Here also will be the great brass band of the " Restoration Host , " and from the platform " Elijah II . " will thunder forth his words of warning and exhortation . In front of this great platform excavations were being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and four feet deep and capable of accommodating considerable numbers of redeemed sinners . In the cafe of the Garden the bar had been cleared away , and men and women were at work unpacking and assorting huge hogsheads of tableware , for the army of 3,000 or more will take their meals at the Garden , dining together . Deacon Frank F. Cotten , advance agent and chief of the cc-In/miss:ivy of the crusade , was dickering with scores of representatives of meat and provision houses for supplies , and already trucks and wagons were arriving with big 1 consignments . ? As the different trains arrive to-morrow morning the crusaders will not march to the Garden , but arrangements have been made with the trolley companies for special street cars on which the members of Zion will ride to the Garden , incidentally paying their own fares . They will register at the Garden , and each ? will receive a slip of Paper showing where his allotted lodging house is'located . Each has been equipped with a complete guide book to New York , and is supposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . twice a day in the Garden , once in the arly morning and once in the evening . ' The concert room and the cafe of the Garden will be used as the dining rooms , and 1,500 men and women will be fed at the same time . Ten expert cooks - will come from - Elijah Hospital , the hotel in Zion- City , and each day fifty volunteer assistants will be assigned . Each day also will be appointed three hundred women volunteer waiters . Deacon Cotten said that the hosts of Elijah were supposed to nourish- the body liberally , and the bill of fare will be varied and ample . Many dishes found on the ordinary bill of fare will be missing , however . For instance , there will be absolutely none of the products of the hog , as " Elijah " has declared the hog unclean . Likewise , there is a- ban against oysters , crabs , lobsters , and all shell fish , as being unclean . There will be fish , but only fish with gills and scales . The Zionists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that really begins at 6:30 Sunday morning with a big meeting at the Garden . There will be a second meeting at 10:30 o'clock in the forenoon , and again at 7:30 o'clock in the evening . At the early morning meetings each day a discourse will be delivered by " Elijah . ' I At the forenoon meetings a series of divine healing discourses will be delivered , after which the general overseer , as Dowie is known ' officially , and Mrs. Dowie , assisted by various elders , will pray-with those who may become penitent . At the evening meetings a series of discourses will be delivered by Dowie in his office as " Elijah the Restorer . " In the meantime throughout the day thousands of the Zionites will be scattered throughout the four quarters of the city . Each crusader win pay his or her own car fare on these expeditions , and will take his midday meal at restaurants and lunchrooms wherever he may be at work . The big Madison Square Garden meetings will continue daily until Nov. 1 , when the general campaign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they will return to their homes in Zion , but the leaders will remain and conduct four big public meetings in Carnegie Hall on Nov. 3 , 4 , 6 , and 8.
