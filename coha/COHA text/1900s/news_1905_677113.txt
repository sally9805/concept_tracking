txt A letter is now on its way to the Vanderbilt Cup Commission from the Automobile Club of France , and as soon as it is received the Racing Board of the American Automobile Association will hold its first meeting since the running of the Vanderbilt Cup race . Baron Adrien de Turckheim , the official representative of the Automobile Club of France at the recent race , declared yesterday that the cup would not be accepted by the French club . es ' " The French club has already declined I to promote another Gordon Bennett Cup race , " he said , " and it could not very well accept the Vanderbilt Cup under the conditions of holding a race for that trophy in France next season . " Baron de Turckhelm , who will sail for home to-day on La Savoie , intimated that the French club would offer suggestions regarding future competitions for the Vanderbilt Cup . " I would like to see it turned into a trophy for a big touring event , " he added . " I do not say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hold a road contest next year the French manufacturers - would not enter . Perhaps we would , for It is quite likely the French manufacturers would feel that they have more to ? gain in races in America than in France . We have so many high-class cars of acknowledged reliability that the mere fact of winning a big speed event counts comparatively for little . " A. Rawlinson , managing Director of the Darracq Company , whose car , driven by Hemery , retained the trophy for France , favored a race here even more strongly than the Baron . " I hope the Vanderbilt Cup will be raced for in America next year , " he said . " The French club has undoubtedly read aright the sentiment of the French manufacturers regarding the utility of high speed contests abroad , but racing conditions are different here . I believe the most progressive American manufacturers are inclined to favor road events for another year or two at least . Because the French club declines to foster road races there is nothing to prevent French manufactures from entering - open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action of the French Automobile Club in refusing to foster any more road races , said that it was because the leading foreign automobilists felt that development in motor cars should now be along other lines than are laid out by road racing . " These races have been a great benefit , " he said . " We have been enabled to determine certain proper weights for cars combined with lightness and durability of material . Now . improvements should be directed more to the perfection of touring cars . Here we have a number of details for fruitful study , as , for instance , tires , suspensions , comfortable devices for the passengers , and more -. ease in running . Big touring contests , I think , are going to be more popular in the future than formerly . Such events as the Pyrenees cup event in France or the big reliability run last season in India are both valuable and interesting to practical automobilists . I would like to see a big touring contest held in America next season , the event lasting , say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles . I would even go beyond this and suggest touring contests for cars of the same kind of spoke , of the same size of piston rod , and making practically the same number of revolutions . But it is too early for that at present , but It is certain that future development of the automobile lies through the medium of the touring car , $22,000 NECKLACE HELD . Philadelphia Woman Sends It by Her Lawyer , Fearing Arrest . A valuable , pearl necklace , which was smuggled into the country a few days ago , is locked up in a safe deposit vault downtown to secure payment of a large duty , which .

Several special agents of the Treasury Department from Washington were detailed on the case and were told upon coming here that the woman 's home was in Philadelphia . Site was not found at her home when the Government officials went there .

" It is not true . " saki Mr. Stranahan , " that the woman was followed to Chicago , Boston , and New York , as some one has stated , but the authorities at Washington have two reports , one made by me and another by the Treasury agent .
