IN the model tenements which have recently been opened in New York are to be found in many respects the most convenient , certainly the most scientifically constructed and arranged homes in America . Many will remember the models of scientific tenements or apartments exhibited at the Buffalo exposition . It is this model , believed to combine all the latest ideas in house building , that has just been completed in New York at an expense of three hundred thousand dollars . A number of gentlemen in that city well known for their wealth and philanthropic work have built this model tenement by way of experiment . Their organization is known as the City and Suburban Homes Company for the Housing of Wage Earners . It is their intention to demonstrate that the best homes may be provided for the poor at a rate below the ordinary rentals , at the same time insuring a fair interest on the investment . The model tenements pay five per cent on the money invested , with a moderate surplus . A competition for designs was held in 1900 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country submitted drawings . The first prize was won by Messrs Harde &; Short . It is a significant fact that this same firm of architects should have designed and built the most expensive apartment houses in New York . In other words , much the same methods have been employed in building a ten thousand-dollar-a-year apartment as in designing the model tenement . Mr Harde himself says that the rooms of his model tenement are designed upon the same lines as in his palatial apartment on Riverside drive , that they have all the practical conveniences , while in point of lighting , ventilation and outlook , the arrangement of the model tenement is even superior to his ten thousand-dollar-ayear suites . Practically the only difference is in the decorations . It is a great thing , of course , that the work of the best architects and the application of the newest ideas should thus be brought within the reach of every class . Housekeepers in every class of society will be interested in the arrangements of the model tenement . It is essential , to begin with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mind . The model tenements have a frontage on Avenue A and occupy the entire block between Seventy-eighth and Seventyninth streets in New York . They are six stories high above the cellar , and are built of fireproof material . They are divided into suites of from three rooms upward . The rental , which is uniform throughout the building , is one dollar per week per room , payable weekly . Every room in the entire building is an outside room looking upon the street . Each apartment is complete in itself , equipped with the necessities for housekeeping . Probably no other house in the world is better equipped . On entering the model tenement one of the first provisions to catch the eye , for instance , is a dust chute for the disposal of sweepings and debris . These chutes run from the top to the bottom of the building , with openings closed with iron doors at each landing . These openings are so contrived that even with the dust falling from an upper floor it will not escape at any door which may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chute in the cellar . Each suite throughout the building has its private entrance hall , toilet , large combination kitchen and dining room , and one or more bedrooms . Apartments with three or four rooms have parlors , while all the suites have  | with special hardware to prevent the sash from rattling or becoming loose . Rubber-tipped door-stops are provided for all doors . The iron work , both inside and out , is painted with aluminum paint . , Each kitchen contains two permanent wash trays of white earthenware glazed inside and out , private bathrooms . The smallest living room has one hundred and twenty square feet of floor space , the smallest bedroom seventy square feet , most of the rooms being s o m ewhat larger . The ceilings in every case are nine feet from the floor . As little woodwork as possible is used in the rooms . The plumbing is open and of the most scientific pattern . Each apartment has a refrigerator . The finishing of the rooms is complete even to the permanent moldingE for hanging pictures . Gas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are furnished free of charge . Many of the costliest houses in New York might well imitate some of the apparently trifling conveniences which mean so much to the housekeeper . All the windows , for instance , are provided and provided with attachments for securing wringers . The tubs in each kitchen are grooved to act as drip boards . The cellar , which is light and well ventilated , contains two laundries . In addition to the washtubs of the latest design there is a steam-heated clothes drier , and there are bars on which the  | clothes are hung , which are hollow and ventilated to prevent overheating . The rollers and guides are of lignum vitae , practically noiseless in operation . There are separate lockers for each apartment and ea-eh tenant is allowed a compartment for one day each week . The walls of the cellar are painted a light color ; all the exposed walls are cemented . A flushing system makes it possible to wash out the entire cellar at any time . A baker 's oven is built in the cellar , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unpierced brick walls . A series of speaking tubes connects every kitchen with the cellar , so that all tradesmen on delivering goods may speak to the tenants . The coal vaults are located in the rear yard for the sake of greater cleanliness . There are small individual storerooms in the cellar , one for each tenant , which may be securely locked ; the cellar , moreover , contains a general storeroom , a workshop , a ventilated garbage storeroom , a boiler room and a furnace for burning rubbish . The roof of the model tenement is one of its most original features . It is flat and surrounded by a brick parapet wall . It is designed as a playground for the children and open air refreshment place . The flooring of the roof is so constructed that flower gardens or grass may be laid there , which is an ultimate intention . A portion of the roof is arranged for drying clothes , a series of drying frames being provided for the purpose . The lines of plumbing have been carried up five feet above the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wooden tanks for cold water to supply the upper floors in case of the failure of the pressure of the regular city supply of water . The tanks contain eight thousand gallons each of water , which is raised by means of steam pumps , another detail of the equipment of the cellar . The model tenements ' rents are collected by a woman , who has a general supervision over the financial side of the movement . As a rule the rents are collected in the apartments , although many are paid in the office situated on the first floor . Every effort is made to have the relation of the rent collector and the tenants a cordial one . As a result the woman collector is the confidante of many of the tenants , who consult her frequently on points touching their household life . The model tenements make a strong appeal to people of moderate means of a class apart from the ordinary tenement dwellers , and to-day contain a considerable proportion of teachers , artists and professional people .
