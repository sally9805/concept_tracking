Whether the entire National Guard of Pennsylvania will be equal to the duty of covering the territory to which it is assigned , is open to question . Its highest officers have had long periods of strike duty at almost regular intervals of two years , but no foreign government , it is safe to say , would rest content with sending a force of this size , however experienced , into so turbulent and lawless a region . The problem , it must be remembered , is not a- military one , but purely a matter of police duty of a peculiarly trying kind . It is not merely one of protecting millions of dollars ' worth of valuable property , or of overawing strikers of eighteen or nineteen different nationalities , but of protecting men on their way to and from the collieries , and of safeguarding their families . The attitude of the strike leaders will naturally count for much in this matter . In view of Mitchell 's repeated assurances at the beginning of the strike that there must be no violence , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promises to discipline any offending local unions , it is distinctly his duty to give more time to denouncing criminal strikers and less to " advising " miners how to reply in mass-meetings to the charges of the operators . We do not think the President 's proffer of a commission of inquiry calculated to enforce this duty . If , aside from the doctrine of protection , the-Republican party is to blame for the coal strike , its responsibility arose two years ago when Senator Hanna meddled with the strike then going on in the anthracite region . That strike was engineered by Mitchell also . He - timed it for the Presidential campaign  --  wisely , as it turned out , for when the Republican prospects became somewhat overcast by the discontent of the wage-workers , Mr. Hanna came to New York and persuaded Mr. Morgan to make the concession of a 10 per cent . advance in wages as a political move . This may have been a just concession , but since the object of making it was political ; it led Mitchell and the United Mine Workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same way . The charge that the Republican party is responsible for the present coal shortage has just this foundation , no more . The strike might have come even if Mr. Hanna had not put his oar into the troubled waters in 1900 , but his movement at that time made a new strike almost certain . Cable advices from England report large orders for coal to be shipped to America , and corresponding engagements for freight room to convey it hither . The announcement is made also that the new steamship combine has ordered 50,000 tons to be brought from England for New York , and perhaps also for Boston . Orders have been sent to Canada for all the coal in sight . In short , we are in the world 's market as a buyer of coal , and if we have time we can get a sufficient supply by paying enough for it . Our demand in foreign countries will put up the price in those markets , and make the conditions of living somewhat harder there . But this is only reversing the condition that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bids up the price of the poor man 's flour in our market . One of the London newspapers suggests that the Government might , in an extreme case , prohibit the exportation of coal . The Government could not do so without an act of Parliament , and it is difficult to see how Parliament could prohibit exportation after putting a tax on exported coal for the benefit of the Imperial treasury . The coal owners would have something to say about that . There is one thing that we can do to cheapen the price of fuel , and that is to repeal the duty on coal . This tax is sixty-seven cents per ton , and it applies to anthracite as well as bituminous Under all tariffs prior to 1897 , anthracite had been on the free list , but a change was made in a rather shamefaced way in the Dingley bill , by which anthracite was made dutiable . The phraseology of the McKinley tariff included in the dutiable list only bituminous coal and shale and culm , but the Dingley measure added the words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . of fixed carbon . " There is no foreign anthracite which contains as much as 92 per cent . of fixed carbon . Thus anthracite became dutiable for the first time in our history . This change was made , not because anthracite was imported to any perceptible extent , but because anthracite mines existed near Banff , on the Canadian Pacific Railway , and it was possible that the product might find a market in the United States . In order to be prepared for an emergency , a duty of sixty-seven cents per ton was clapped on the article in this underhand way . Well , the emergency has now come . Anthracite from Wales is now on shipboard coming to the United States , and it is reported that a contract has been made for Canadian anthracite also . When it arrives , this blessed Government , which is trying in all ways to get rid of-its surplus revenue , will demand sixty-seven cents for each ton admitted to our ports , and the classes who can least afford it will have to pay the tax . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hill was in full control of the Democratic Convention at Saratoga last week , and his characteristic talent for intrigue , for low cunning , for shifts and turns , together with his inveterate inability to measure or to satisfy the best opinion of his party or the public , was stamped upon all the proceedings . It was all very well to drop Bryanism in silence , but what is to take its place ? Tammany played a humble rile in the Convention . That was in grateful contrast to the Croker domination of two years ago , but what assurance have we that there is any real change of heart ? The one great guarantee of a new purpose and honorable methods is lacking  --  the nomination for Governor of a man whose name should be a synonym for courage and character , intelligence and resolute will . How far Mr. Coler falls short of meriting that description , we have been compelled to point out from time to time , and there is no magic in a nomination for high office to make us read a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With many others , we had bright hopes of Mr. Coler when he first came to public notice as Comptroller of this city , blocking the path of the indecent Ramapo plotters . But Mr Coler himself was the one to disabuse the minds of the clear-sighted of the notion that he might be of the stuff of which true reformers are made . In the first place , he immediately developed a most unpleasing eagerness for political reward . He angled for nominations as Mayor , either by Tammany or against , he cared not which , and wondered at the fastidious people who thought it made any difference which ; or as Governor , whether by or against a boss , it was all one to him . He has long been , in short , that most undesirable of candidates  --  the uncommonly anxious one . Mr. Coler , moreover , has shown such instability of judgment and so feeble a personal grasp on either principles or the practical duties of a public servant , that he can arouse no hope of new life for his party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deceived , could imagine him in office anything but a tool of Hill's. - The Saratoga platform is a sort of catch-all , but is , on the whole , a much better document than the one which the Republicans adopted at the same place the week before . The demand for the nationalization of the anthracite coal mines is too glaringly a campaign dodge to be taken seriously . It is a kind of freak plank , of which we shall hear no more ( except reproach of its authors ) when the strike is over . On the subject Of the State canals , the Democrats are far more satisfactory than the Republicans They are explicit and progressive , where the latter were halting and evasive and meaningless . What is said about the need of instant tariff revision to relieve industry and to right injustice is admirable ; and the denunciation of a colonial policy , with a demand for generous treatment of Cuba , has a good ring These deliverances on national politics are sound doctrine , and should be embodied in law ; but that is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to the affairs of this State from putting them again in the hands of David B. Hill , by means of his proxy , Mr. Coler . The Democrats of Rhode Island did at least two good things in their State Convention last week . The first was that they utterly ignored Bryan and Bryan-ism and confined themselves mainly to State issues . Rhode Island is a small State , and the Democratic party there cuts a small figure in the national organization , but every convention that casts its clod on Mr. Bryan 's coffin does its part towards rehabilitating and strengthening the Democratic party . The Convention also defeated the ambition of John J. Fitzgerald of Pawtucket , who wished to run for Governor . The significance of this act lies in the fact that Mr. Fitzgerald is in his small way as thorough a demagogue as Bryan . Mr. Fitzgerald was Mayor of Pawtucket during the street-car strike in that city a few months ago In his endeavor to curry favor with the labor . vote , he abjectly surrendered to the strikers and allowed them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cowardice he won the contempt of all the decent and law-abiding- citizens of his State . He looked for his reward this autumn , but the gang of his backers was unable to force him upon the Convention . He retires , therefore , not only despised , but defeated . They teach logic in the colleges of Massachusetts , but little of it got into the tariff plank of the Massachusetts Republican platform . This recites that " the high wages and constant employment " of the past five years are " due " to the Dingley tariff ; but then it immediately proceeds to assert that " the habit of charging to the tariff whatever evils , real or imagined , afflict the country , has become an evil of itself " ! Why so , any more than charging blessings to it ? Do the Republicans of Massachusetts suppose that Ameri cans are so simple as to believe that every good they enjoy is due to a protective tariff , but that all the concomi tant evils are due to the Democrats , or an unkind fate or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causes " ? No , the tariff is either all or nothing . Treated as a fetish by the Republicans themselves , it will be so treated by the people ? that is , it will have flowers flung on it and rice spread out before it in prosperous times , but will be knocked about and have nails driven into it when the evil days come . If this is , as the Massachusetts Republicans lament , itself an evil , they are primarily responsible for it . They have sedulously cultivated the idea that tariff laws create prosperity and content , and it is not for them to dodge when discontent rises angrily to ask why they do not make a tariff to cure it Certainly one would search far before finding grosser inconsistency than their tariff plank , said to be the product of the pen of H. C. Lodge , LL.D . The notion that Speaker Henderson 's withdrawal was due to mere petulance is ranch weakened by the letter of acceptance of the candidate who has been nominated in his stead . Judge Birdsall takes his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cummins and the more progressive element among the Iowa Republicans . The idea that some man who held the same views as Speaker Henderson might be nominated and elected , in spite of the abrupt action of the latter , evidently was not shared to any extent in the district affected . The determination of Gov . Cummins and his associates to force the fighting for tariff revision is again exhibited by this nomination , followed by the plain speaking of the letter of acceptance . Speaker Henderson is thus required to support a candidate who adheres to the views on the tariff issue which he regards as utterly obnoxious , or else to take the responsibility of contributing to the election of ex-Goy . Bores , the Democratic nominee . Evidently the " Iowa idea " will not down , in Iowa at any rate . The nomination of Mr. Foss , at one time doubtful , but now confirmed by the recount , who made his contest in the Eleventh Massachusetts District on the platform of free hides , free coal , and free iron , indicates , moreover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country . Why are Crumpacker , Grosvenor , Chandler et al silent over the political ostracism of colored citizens by Republican organizations in the Southern States ? When the Democrats in that section were framing election turnstiles that would bar illiterate negroes while admitting ignorant whites , no political penalty was deemed too severe by the Northern champions of negro rights ; but when white Republicans in Alabama and North ' Carolina are denying representation in party conventions to the saving remnant of the colored vote  --  the educated and property-owning negro electorate , which not even Democratic malice and ingenuity could disfranchise ? not a protest is raised by the Republicans of the North . Their silence needs explanation They have not the selfish motive of their brethren of the South , who are substituting a white Republican organization for the lost negro vote as a basis for Federal patronage ; and the only logical conclusion is that they have jettisoned the negro vote in their pursuit of the iglus fatwas of a white man 's party in the South . To find a Republican virtue in a Democratic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political conscience . Secretary Shaw has been getting into deeper water from day to day since he made the decision that the banks need not keep any reserve against Govern . ment deposits . Several explanations of his true meaning have been put out unofficially , and each one seems to have been misinterpreted People tried to reconcile the ruling with the law as they read it in the statute-book , and as it was impossible to do so , they became mystified . A rumor gained ground that the Comptroller of the Currency did not agree with the Secretary 's ruling , and that he would enforce the law as it stood . Stocks fell two or three points when this divergence of views was announced So the Secretary made a fresh explanation in a circular dated October 4 , to which he affixed his signature . The substance of it is , that while the law requires the national banks to maintain a fixed percentage of reserve against all deposits , it leaves both the Comptroller and the Secretary a discretion as to enforcing the penalty for violating it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintain the reserve the Comptroller may notify it to make good such reserve , and that if it fails to do so within thirty days the Comptroller ? nay , with the concurrence of the Secretary of the Treasury , appoint a receiver , etc After reciting these terms of the law , the circular says : " You are therefore notified that the rule will not be enforced , so far as it relates to Government deposits secured by Government bonds " The Comptroller prudently refrains from issuing any circular on his own part , but intimates , through the newspapers , that he may continue to send the banks the usual notices when their reserve is less than the required percentage of their total deposits . This course would certainly be prudent , since the sending of such notrces does not commit him to any forward movement , while it does protect his rear The main question , however , is , what effect these notices are likely to have on the banks . The whole purpose of the new ruling was to open the way for an expansion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was rather loudly proclaimed in the dispatches from Washington on September 20 . It was then said that the new ruling would make possible an expansion of loans and discounts to the amount of $130,000,000 . The banks of New York , however , have not availed themselves of the opportunity to expand their loans . The Clearing-house returns of last Saturday are presented in the old way . The reserve is computed on the basis of all the deposits , public and private and a surplus , although not a large one , is shown . Perhaps the depositary banks , realizing that life is short , and the tenure of office uncertain , and the state of public opinion shifting , would not like to have notices from the Comptroller 's office piling up against them every thirty days , even though assured by the Secretary that such notices mean nothing But in point of fact they do mean something , as may at any time appear The Government 's revenue from cus toms taxes , during August , not only was $5,000,000 greater than the year before , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country 's history September 's customs revenue , complete returns for which are now at hand , is substantially the same as that of August Both returns show the effect of our enormous merchandise imports , which , in the two past months , have exceeded all precedent . The September customs return also explains the continued Treasury surplus , and the recent resulting drain on the money market . Last April 's internal-tax reduction law was expected to strike $72,500,000 from the annual revenue  --  an average cut of something over $6,000,000 monthly . In the three first months of the fiscal year , internal revenue has been diminished $13,800,000 . This is much below the estimate , but it was sufficient , along with a $15,000,000 increase during the period 's expenditure , to have caused a $6,000,000 deficit had customs receipts remained unchanged . But the customs revenue , since June , has been $15,000,000 greater than last year 's , hence , of course , an enlarged surplus It must be pointed out again , however , that this surplus revenue is comparatively small . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the excess since July 1 has been only $9,000 , - 000 , and of that excess $7,400,000 has been deposited with the banks . These figures hardly indicate that the Treasury has been , as is commonly declared , " draining " the money market . What it has actually taken and locked up this season is a bagatelle in the huge cash reserve fund of New York The real trouble has been that the West drew heavily for harvest needs  --  it took $10 , - 000,000 net last month ; that the settlement of our bankers ' large foreign borrowings has prevented movement of gold from Europe ; and that the banks , nevertheless , continued , until the rise in monney startled them , to increase their loans ad /lb ttzt , m . The resultant crisis in the market may have been one which warranted special help from the Treasury ; but the facts should be clearly understood . The details of the steamship combination , ' so far as the articles of incorporation go , have been made public . The companies joined together are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the White Star , the Leyland , and the Dominion . The three last named are under the British flag , but at least one of them ( the Leyland ) is owned by Americans . They are brought together under a New Jersey charter and under the name of the International Mercantile Marine Company This company has formed an agreement with the two large German companies ( the Hamburg-American and the North German Lloyd ) by which said German companies agree to contribute a portion of their dividends to the International , and the latter agrees to pay a fixed sum each year to the former . In other words , the International pays from its own funds to the German companies 6 per cent per annum on at least 20,000,000 marks ( $5 , - 000,000 ) in any event . If the German companies do not earn dividends within the year , they pay nothing to the International , but they get $300,000 as an annual bonus or subsidy from the combine . This , we suppose , is paid to the German companies to prevent rate-cutting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 0/2 per cent . bonds , or $195,000,000 in all . One-half of the stock is classed as preferred , one-half as common . The preferred is entitled to a 6 per cent . cumulative dividend , as in the case of the Steel Corporation . If the business should prove less profitable than the promoters expect , and the dividends on the common should be put in jeopardy , a conversion of some part of the preferred into bonds at 4i/2 per cent , as in the case of the Steel Corporation , would be a natural consequence . What would be a fair valuation of the entire property nobody outside the combination ( and probably few inside ) knows . It is customary to say that property is worth what it would cost to replace it , but that would be an over-estimate in this case , since an old ship is not worth so much as a new one . Judging by the usual procedure in the promotion of Trusts , the capitalization is probably three or four times what it cost to build the ships . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimate of its " good will " The statement has been given out verbally that none of the securities will be offered to the public , but that the owners of the constituent companies will take the whole . No instrument binding them to retain their holdings is shown among the papers We infer , therefore , that if the public should show a strong desire to buy the securities , the present owners might be induced to part with a portion of them . The refusal of an American naval officer at Panama to allow a Colombian General to proceed over the railway to Colon sustains our bouffe method of fulfilling our treaty obligation to " guarantee Colombian sovereignty " on the Isthmus Of course , it is the other clause of the treaty to which Admiral Casey points ? the clause under which it is our right and duty to keep transit open . But the Colombians may be excused for complaining of the progressive applications which we have made of that part of the treaty First , we would allow no fighting along the line of the railroad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to take passage on the trains . This we afterwards modified so as to allow unarmed soldiers to be carried across , their rifles going by separate train . But now we have held that the presence of a single General in transit would precipitate a conflict , and so we have put a veto on his going . He might have complacently taken this action as a striking tribute to his personal prowess . Yet the strange man is reported to consider himself and his Government insulted . The funeral of Zola at Paris on Sunday is , of course , described in the press dispatches as an impressive ceremony , for it is always true that " man is a noble animal , splendid in ashes , and pompous in the grave . " The impressiveness in this case , however , was not in the municipal guards that lined the route , in the company of infantry that added brilliance to the spectacle , or in the oration of M. Ilermant , who , on behalf of the Societies of Authors and Dramatists , reviewed Zola 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any prominent man of letters . The impressive feature of Zola 's funeral was the thousands of - workingmen , many accompanied by their wives , who marched behind the coffin , and the passionate appeal to these people by Anatole France M. France did not emphasize Zola 's skill as a constructor of plots , a delineator of character , or a master of style . The achievement which the moment of Zola 's death bullied large in the eyes of M. France and of his listeners , was that outburst of indignation which roused the country against injustice .
