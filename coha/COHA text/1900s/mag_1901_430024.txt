W HEN the history of English settlement in America begins , an age of discovery and bold adventure has given place to an age of commerce and organization . The breathless , eager stir of the Elizabethan age is over , and the sober , contentious seventeenth century has come , with its perplexed politics , its schismatic creeds , and its scheming commercial rivalries . More than one hundred years had elapsed since the discovery of North America . Spain had lost her great place in the politics of Europe , and France and England were pressing forward to take it . Meanwhile the great continent had lain " a veiled and virgin shore , " inflaming desires that could not be gratified , stirring dreams  | that only enticed brave men to their death , exciting to enterprise and adventure , but never to substantial or lasting achievement . The same mistake that had led to its discovery had prevented its profitable occupation . Columbus had set out to seek Cathay , and had died believing that he had actually found the eastern coasts of Asia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had persisted in seeking , not new , but old lands , rich with ancient kingdoms and vast stores of treasure , lying ready to the hand of conqueror or buccaneer . Such ancient kingdoms Cortez and Pizarro actually found in South America and upon the Isthmus ; and such every adventurer promised himself he would find just beyond the coasts of the northern continent also . Or else he would find something that would be quite as valuable , and possibly no less romantic , ? a fountain of youth , un touched mines of precious ore , or waters stored with priceless pearls . The discovery of the ew World had drawn Europe , when she was most credulous , into a realm of dreams . The Re vival of Learning had come ; Europe had read once more and with fresh ened eyes , as if for the first time , the free sentences of the ancient classics , written when men looked frankly , fearlessly , and far and wide about them , and her imagina tion had been quickened and enriched by what she read , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also , as well as what she had read , had given her new life . For the Middle Ages were now passed , and she had herself become a new world . France had lost her feudal princes in the Hundred Years ' War , and was at last a real kingdom under veritable kings , for Louis XI . had reigned . England had been transformed by the Wars of the Roses from a feudal into a national monarchy and the first Tudor  | was on the throne . Spain had cast out the Moor , and was united under Christian sovereigns . Former geographical relations , too , had disappeared . The old Europe had had its heart and centre in the Mediterranean ; but the capture of Constantinople by the Turk , and the steady spread of the Turkish power about the Mediterranean shores , now shut her out from the established courses of her life by cutting off direct intercourse with the East . She was obliged to seek new routes for her commerce , a different life for her nations , new objects of policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early airs of the Renaissance , her powers were heartened and stimulated for the task , and she faced it with a glad spontaneity and energy . She was strangely filled with hope and with a romantic ardor for adventure , ready to see and to test every new  | thing . It was naturally her first thought to find her way again , by new routes , to India and the great East . Portuguese sailors , accordingly , sought and found their way around the southern capes of Africa ; and Columbus , more bold and more believing still , pushed straight forth into the unknown Atlantic , that dread and mysterious " Sea of Darkness " which had lain so silent all the centuries , keeping its secrets . He would make directly for the shores of Asia and the kingdom of the Tartars . In the new delight of giving rein to their imaginations men were ready to believe anything . They could believe even Marco Polo , whom they had hitherto been inclined to deem an impudent impostor . In the latter half of the thirteenth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had journeyed overland to the farthest kingdoms of Asia , when the great Tartar empire of Kublai Khan stretched from Europe to the Chinese sea . Ile had seen throughout nearly twenty years the full splendor of that stupendous realm , its rich provinces , its teeming and ancient cities , its abounding wealth and unexampled power . Some of its authority he had himself wielded : for he had been taken into the intimate counsels of the Great Khan , and had gone up and down his coasts upon weighty errands of state . But the men of his day at home would not credit what he had to tell them of the boundless extent and resplendent glory of lands which no one else among their neighbors had ever seen , or ever heard named even , save by this Venetian adventurer . Who could say what truth there was , or what falsehood , in these tales of the ends of Asia and of a great sea lying beyond ? Polo 's story slumbered , accordingly , in curious manuscripts , or kept covert with the learned , until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the enticing credulity of the fifteenth century . In the view of that hopeful age nothing was impossible . These things and many more Columbus credited and pondered , as he pored over crude and curious maps , sketched out of travellers ' tales and astronomers ' reckonings ; and it was the very Cathay of Marco Polo he put across the new ocean to find . The success of Columbus solved the mystery of the Atlantic , but it slid little to instruct Europe , or even to guide her fancy , concerning the real nature of the lands he had found . No one dreamed that they were the coasts of a new world . Who could believe the globe big enough to have held through all the ages a whole continent of which Christendom had never heard , nor even so much as had poetic vision , ? unless , perchance , this were the fabled Atlantis ? Slowly , very slowly , exploration brought the facts to light ; but even then men were loath to receive the truth . When Vespucius brought home authentic charts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrust far out into the Atlantic , so that even mariners who strayed from their course to the Cape under stress of storms from out the east might hit upon them , there was nothing for it but to deem this indeed a New World . No such Asian coasts had ever been heard of in that quarter of the globe . This southern world must , no doubt , lie between Africa and the kingdoms of China . But the northern con- tinent had been found just where the Asian coasts were said to lie . It was passing hard to conceive it a mere wilderness , without civilization or any old order of settled life . Had Polo . after all , been so deep a liar Men would not cheat their imaginations and balk their hopes of adventure . Unable to shake off their first infatuation , they went wistfully on , therefore , searching for kingdoms , for wonders , for some native perfection , or else some store of accumulated bounty , until at last fancy was wholly baffled and rebuked by utmost discipline of total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wasted were confident adventurers sobered : the century of the Reformation and the Elizabethan literature . Then at last they accepted the task of winning America for what it was : a task of first settlement in a wilderness ,  - -  hard , unromantic , prodigious , ? practicable only by strong-willed labor and dogged perseverance to the end . While North America waited , South America prodigally afforded the spirit of the age what it craved . There men actually found what they had deemed Asia to contain . Here was , in fact , treasure-trove . The sea quickly filled with mighty Spanish armaments , commanded by masters of conquest like Cortez ; and the quaint and cloistered civilization of the New World trembled and fell to pieces under the rude blows of Spanish soldiers . Then the sea filled again , this time with galleons deep-laden with the rich spoils of the romantic adventure . Whereupon daring English seamen like Hawkins and Drake turned buccaneers ; and scant thought was given any longer to the forested wilds of North America . England and Spain faced one another on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ports undertook to make proud Spain smart for the iniquities wrought upon Englishmen by the Inquisition , while they lined their pockets , too , out of Spanish bottoms . By the time the Great Armada came , England had found her sealegs . Spain recognized in the smartly handled craft which beat her clumsy galleons up the Channel the power that would some day drive her from the seas . Her hopes went to pieces with that proud fleet , before English skill and prowess and pitiless sea-weather . It had been a century of preparation , a century of vast schemes but half accomplished , of daring but not steadfast enterprise , of sudden sallies of audacious policy , but not of cautious plans or prudent forecasts . The New World in the north still waited to be used . And yet much had in fact been accomplished towards the future successful occupation of North America . Some part of the real character of the new continent stood sufficiently revealed . Early in the century Balboa had crossed the Isthmus and Magellan had found his way to the south @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new ocean ; and before the middle of the century Spanish vessels had beat their adventurous way along almost the entire Pacific length of both continents . By the time Drake set out on his famous first voyage round the world in  | 1577 , the Spaniards had already established a trade route across the Pacific to India and the Spice Islands . Their discoveries became very slowly known to the rest of the world ; they had no mind to advertise what they found , and so invite rivalry . Each nation that coveted the new lands was left to find out for itself how they lay , with what coasts , upon what seas . It did at last become generally known , however , that America was no part of Asia , but itself a separate continent , backed by an ocean greater even than the Atlantic . What was still hidden was the enormous extent of the few World . It had been found narrow enough from ocean to ocean at the Isthmus ; and the voyagers along its farther coasts had not been expert to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They imagined it of no great bulk . Throughout the century every explorer who sought to penetrate its interior from the Atlantic along any considerable watercourse confidently hoped to find , near the sources of the stream , similar passage down the western slopes of the continent to the great sea at the west . Adventurer after adventurer , moreover , pushed northward among the ice to find a northwest passage whereby to enter the Pacific . All such mistakes only served to make the real character of tha northern continent the more evident . Every discovery contributed to sober discoverers . That the interior was one vast wilderness , grown thick with tangled forests , blocked by mountains which stood old and untouched , or else stretching wide " through mighty plains and sandy heaths , smooth and wearisome , and bare of wood , " with only " crook-backed oxen " for inhabitants , the Spaniards had abundantly discovered by many a costly adventure . In 1513 , the year of Balboa 's great discovery , and again in 1521 , the gallant Ponce de Leon led an expedition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ search of a fabled spring whose waters , of " sweet savour and reflaire , " it was said , " as it were of divers manner of spicery , " would impart immortal youth to those who drank of them . But the wilderness baffled him , and lie lost both his hope and his life in the enterprise . In 1528 Panfilo de larvaez sought to take the land by storm , in true Spanish fashion , landing an army of three hundred men at Apalache Bay , with horses and trappings and stores , to march in quest of kingdoms and treasures . And march they did , thrusting their way through the forests and swamps very manfully towards the vast unknown interior of the continent . " Their ships , meanwhile , they sent away , to bring still others to the enterprise , but with plans of rendezvous so vague and illconceived that they never beheld them again . After three fruitless months spent with keen suffering of want and disappointment in the wild forests , where there was neither kingdom nor treasure , they found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in search of their craft . Finding that they must help themselves , they built such boats as they could , and tried to pick their way by sea to the westward . Caught a rush of waters at the mouth of the Mississippi , two of their five boats were overwhelmed , and all who were in them were lost . The rest drifted on till . east ashore far to the west . Four men , and four only , of all the company survived to tell the story to the world . After a marvellous and pitiful pilgrimage  | of almost two thousand miles , full of every perilous and strange adventure , they actually reached the Spanish settlements on the Pacific , eight years after that gallant landing at Apalache . In 15:19 Hernando de Soto repeated the folly . He brought to the Bay of Espiritu Santo nine vessels , with near six hundred men and more than two hundred horses . Leaving a small part of his force with the fleet , he set out with a great army for the interior of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gallantly done , with all the audacity and hardness of purpose that distinguished Spanish conquest in that day . With contempt of danger , meting out bitter scorn and cruelty to every human foe , and facing even pitiless nature itself without blanching or turning back , proud and stubborn to the last through every tormenting trial of the desperate march , they forced their way onward to the great waters of the Mississippi . From the mouth of that river , in boats of their own construction , some three hundred survivors reached Spanish posts on the Gulf . But without their leader . De Soto had sickened and died as they heat up and down the wilderness which lay along the great stream of the Mississippi , whose inland courses he had discovered , and his body lay buried beneath its sluggish waters . Meanwhile a like expedition was wasting its strength in the wilds which stretched back from the Pacific . Tn 154O Coronado , Spanish Governor of New Galicia , had led an army of three hundred Spaniards and eight hundred Indians northward from Ins Pacific province @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " These " cities " proved to be only the humble pueblos whose ruins still so curiously marls the river cliffs of Arizona and New Mexico ; and Coronado pressed on , threading the canons of the Colorado River for weary hundreds of miles , putting out parties to explore the courses of the Rio Grande and the Gila , pressing doggedly on even as far as the Mis- souri , but finding nothing except vast desert stretches of country , without a trace of population or promise of treasure . It was a hard lesson thoroughly learned , bitten in by sufferings which corroded like deadly acids . By such means was the real nature of the North-American Continent painfully disclosed , each maritime nation acting for itself . Spanish , English , and French seamen beat , time and again , up and down its coasts , viewing harbors , trying inlets , tracing the coastlines , carrying away rumors of the interior . The Spaniards explored and partially settled the coasts of the Gulf . In 1534-5 Jacques Cartier penetrated the St. Lawrence , in the name of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Montrel l ; and in 1541 planted a rude fort upon the heights of Quebec . In 1562-4 settlements of French Huguenots were effected in Florida , only to be destroyed , with savage ruthlessness , by the Spaniards , who in 1565 established St. Augustine , from which the French were unable permanently to dislodge them . In the opening years of the seventeenth century French colonies were planted on the St. Lawrence at Montreal and Quebec , and in Acadia , in the region which was afterwards to be known as Nova Scotia . English settlements also were attempted . All signs combined to indicate the coming in of  | a new age of organized enterprise , when , with one accord , the nations which coveted the virgin continent should cease to fly to India for gold . Ransack the ocean for Orient pearl . And search all corners of the new-found world For pleasant fruits and princely delicates , and should compete , instead , to build communities and erect states over sea , and so possess themselves of a great treasure of their own creation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had held the first place throughout a century ; but for the task of colonization the parts were to be differently cast . The century had witnessed many profound changes in European politics . Inn the year 1519 Charles the Fifth , King of Spain , Archduke of Austria , heir of the House of Burgundy , and therefore lord of the Netherlands , King of Naples and Sicily , had become also Emperor of Germany , and threatened all Europe by his predominance . But the vast circle of his realm had not held together . It was not a single power , but naturally diverse and disintegrate . In 1568 began that determined revolt of the Netherlands which was eventually to sap and destroy the Spanish power . By scattering her force too ambitiously , and staking her supremacy on too many issues , Spain began steadily to lose the great advantage she had held upon the continent . For England the end of Spain 's power was narked by the destruction of the Armada , and the consequent dashing of all the ambitious schemes that had been put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been reckonings between England and France also . Henry VIII . and Francis I. had kept restlessly at work to adjust the balance of European power to their own liking and advantage . Wars , brief and inconclusive , but ceaseless . swept Europe in every direction ; and then radical changes set both national and international . In 1562 the great Huguenot civil wars broke out , to rage for more than twenty years ; and France stained her annals with St. Bartholomew 's day , 1572 . In driving the Huguenots forth to England and America , she lost the flower of her industrial population . She thwarted her European enemies , nevertheless , and solidly compacted her national power . The German countries all the century through were torn and distracted by the struggle of the Reformation , and remained selfabsorbed , forming the parties and defining the passions which were to bring upon them the terrible Thirty Years ' War of the next century . When the new century opened , France and England alone stood ready to nonpete for North America . And , for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the New World as in the Old , the signal advantage , as the event abundantly proved , was to lie with England in this new rivalry in the wilderness . The reason is now plain enough . England had obtained from the sixteenth century just the training she needed for winning America in the seventeenth , while France had unfitted herself for the race by the new life she had learned . England had become a commercial nation , quickened in every seaport by a bold spirit of individual enterprise that would dare anything for a success . The Tudor monarchs had , it is true , established a political absolutism ; but they had , nevertheless , somehow deeply stirred individual initiative in their subjects in the process . In France , meanwhile , individual initiative had been stamped out , and the authority of church and state combined to command and control every undertaking . France , therefore , sent official fleets to America and established government posts ; while England licensed trading companies , and left the colonists , who went to America in their own interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . The French colonies pined under careful official nursing ; the English colonies throve under " a wise and salutary neglect . " A churchly and official race could not win America . The task called for hard-headed business sense , patient , practical sagacity , and men free to follow their own interest by their own means . The Reformation had performed a peculiar service for England . It had filled her , not with intense religious feeling , but with intense national feeling . It meant that England had thrown off all slavish political connection with Rome , and was to be henceforth national in her church as well as in her politics . It meant , too , that she was to have less church than formerly . When Henry VIII . destroyed the monasteries and appropriated their means and revenues , he secularized the government of England , and in part English society too , almost at a stroke . The wealth of the church went to make new men rich who had won the favor of the crown , and a new nobility of wealth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a change met the spirit of the age half-way . The quickened curiosity and nimble thought of the Renaissance had no courteous care as to what it exposed or upset . The discovery of new lands , moreover , stimulated all sorts of trade and seatraffic . A general movement to learn and acquire new things had begun among masses of comfortable people who had never cared to disturb their minds before . The literature of the " spacious times of great Elizabeth " was the spontaneous speaking out , with unexampled freedom of heart , with unmatched boldness of fancy and amplitude of power , of the finer spirits of a nation excited by every new prospect of thought and enterprise . ' Fortunately the Tudor monarchs were stingy how they helped their subjects with money , even to defend their wealth and commerce against the foreigner . Henry VIII . interested himself in improved methods of ship-building ; and when he had time to think of it lie encouraged instruction in seamanship and navigation ; but he built no navy . He even left the English coasts without adequate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best they might against the pirates who in- fested the seas not only , but came once and again to cut vessels out of port in England 's own waters . Many public ships , it is true , had been built before the Armada came , and fine craft they were ; but they were not enough . There was no real navy , itt the modern sense . The fleet which chased the Spaniards up the Channel was a volunteer fleet . Merchants had learned to defend their own cargoes . They built fighting-craft of their own to keep their coasts and harbors free of pirates , and to carry their goods over sea . They sought their fortunes as they pleased abroad , the crown annoying them with no inquiry to embarrass their search for Spanish treasureships , or their trade in pirated linens and silks . It was this self-helping race of Englishmen that matched their wits against French official schemes in America . We may see the stuff they were made of in the Devonshire seamen who first attempted the permanent settlement of the new continent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adventurous and sealoving England was centred in Devonshire . Devonshire lies in the midst of that group of counties in the southwest of England in which Saxon mastery did least to destroy or drive out the old Celtic population . There is , accordingly , a strong strain of Celtic blood among its people to this day ; and the land suits with the strain . Its abrupt and broken headlands , its free heaths and ancient growths of forest , its pure and genial air , freshened on either hand by the breath of the sea , its bold and sunny coasts , mark it a place made by nature to indulge that sense of mystery and that ardor of imagination with which the Celt has enriched the sober Saxon mind . Next it lay Somersetshire , with its sea outlet at sturdy Bristol port , where trade boasted itself free from feudal masters , pointing to the ruined castle on the hill , and whence the Cabots had sailed , so close upon the heels of Columbus . For itself Devonshire had the great harbor and roads of Plymouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race of venturesome and hardy fishermen were nurtured . All the great sea names of the Elizabethan age belong to it . Drake , Hawkins , Ralegh , and the Gilberts were all Devonshire men ; and it was from Plymouth that the fleet went out which beat the great Armada on its way to shipwreck in the north . The men who first undertook to colonize the New World for England were bred to adventure , both by books and by the sea-air in which they lived . Sir Ilumphrey Gilbert and his half-brother , Walter Ralegh , were gentlemen , trained to books at Oxford , and men of fortune besides , who could put forth into the world to look into what they had read of . Their books were full of travellers ' tales ; their neighbors were seamen who had met the Spaniard at close quarters on the high seas . and lightened him of his treasure . Wealth and adventure alike seemed to call them abroad into the new regions of the West . Ardently , and yet soberly too , with a steady business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they obtained license &f; the crown and led the way towards new ports and new homes in America . They did all with unstinted energy and devotion , embarking their fortunes in the venture . In 1583 Sir Humphrey Gilbert himself went out to Newfoundland , and lost his life seeking a harbor to the southward where to plant a colony . Ile had made his own quarters in the smallest vessel of his little fleet , and calmly " sat abaft with a book in his hand , " even when the violent sea and the unknown coast threatened most sharply , cheering his companions the while with the stout-hearted assurance , " We are as near heaven by sea as by land . " On Monday night , the 9th of September , about twelve o'clock , his lights went out and he found a haven he had not sought . The next year , 1554 , Ralegh sent out two ships to take the southern course to America and find a coast suitable for set- tlement . They hit upon Roanoke Island . It was , their captains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most gentle , loving , and faithful , and such as live after the manner of the golden age . " Within the next three years , therefore , until the coining of the Armada called his attention imperatively off from the business , Ralegh made two distinct efforts to establish a permanent colony on the island . But both attempts failed . The right temper and purpose had not come yet . The first colony contained men only , and these devoted themselves to exploration instead of to tillage and building . Ralegh and his agents alike were still dreaming of El Dorado . The second colony contained women and families ; but they made small progress in learning to deal with the Indians , now no longer gentle and faithful ; and they continued to rely on England for supplies , which did not come . When finally search was made for them they were not to be found . Their fate has remained a mystery to this day . And so the century ended , with only a promise of what might some day be done . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and inhospitable , the approaches to it at least were at length known . The Atlantic was cleared of its terrifying mystery , and the common sun shone everywhere upon it . Both the northern and the southern routes across it had become familiar to seafarers . The merchants of Southampton regularly sent ships upon the " commodious and gainful voyage to Brazil " as early as 1540 ; and Newfoundland had been a well-known fishing and trading post ever since 1504 . In 1570 at least forty ships went annually from English ports to take part in the fisheries there ; and in 1578 no less than a hundred and fifty were sent from France alone . Hundreds of crews were to be found in St. John 's Harbor in the season , drying their catch and sunning their nets . Europe could not have been sure of fish on Fridays otherwise . The ocean ways were well known ; the coast of North America was partly charted ; its forests were no longer deemed the frontier barriers of kingdoms ; the romantic age of mere adventure was past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was beginning to appreciate the unideal economic uses to which North America was to be put , if Europe was to use it at all . It only remained to find proper men and proper means for the purpose .  | It was the end of the month of April , 1607 , when three small vessels entered the lonely capes of the Chesapeake , bringing the little company who were to make the first permanent English settlement in America , at Jamestown , in Virginia . Elizabeth was dead . The masterful Tudor monarchs had passed from the stage , and James , the pedant King , was on the throne . The " Age of the Stuarts " had come , with its sinister policies and its sure tokens of revolution . Men then living were to see Charles lie dead upon the scaffold at Whitehall . After that would come Cromwell ; and then the second Charles , " restored , " would go his giddy way through a demoralizing reign , and leave his sullen brother to face another revolution . It was to he an age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English world ; and the colonies in America , notwithstanding their separate life and the breadth of the sea , were to feel all the deep stir of the business . The revolution wrought at home might in being transmitted to them suffer a certain sea-change , but it would not lose its use or its strong flavor of principle . The new settlers came in two small ships and a pinnace , the Goodspeed , the Sarah Constant , and the Discovery , all of which belonged to the Muscovy Company , which usually sent its ships for trade much farther north , to Hudson 's Bay and Davis Strait , or to bring cargoes from Greenland and the Cherry Islands . The little band of adventurers had gone aboard their craft at Blackwell on the Thames , and had begun to drop clown the river to put to sea a week before Christmas , 1606 ; but rough weather had held them two weeks in the Downs , and it was New-Year 's day , 1607 , before they got finally away . It was the end of April @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bound . It was a lonely age in which to be four months upon the great sea , for " ships were rare , " only " from time to time , like pilgrims , here and there crossing the waters . " You were sure to see no sail anywhere as you went . And the land to which they came was as lonely as the sea , except for the savages who lurked within the forests . The three little merchantmen came none the less boldly in at the capes , however ; and the tired men on board thought the shores of the vast bay within very beautiful , with their " fair meadows and goodly tall trees , " and their " fresh waters running through the woods , " better than any wine to men who  | for four months had drunk from the stale casks on the ships . And yet the loneliness of those spreading coasts , forested to the very water , was enough to daunt any man . They presently found a great " river on the south side . running into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its banks for their settlement which was quite forty miles up its stately stream ; for they wished to he away from the open hay , where adventurous seamen of other nations , none too sure to be their friends , might at any tune look in and find them . They named their river the James , and their settlement Jamestown , in honor of the Ring at home . Eighty years before there had been Spaniards upon that very spot . They had built houses there , and had planned to keep a lasting colony . There had been Spaniards in the Nest Indies these hundred years and more , ? ever since the days of Columbus himself ; and in Vasquez de Ayllon had led a great colony out of Santo Domingo to this very place , no less than five hundred persons , men and women , with priests to care for their souls and to preach the gospel to the savages . But discord , fever , and death had speedily put an cud to the vent are . The place had soon been abandoned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reach Santo Domingo again ; and when the English put ashore there , where a tongue of low and fertile land was thrust invitingly into the stream , no trace remained to tell the tragic story . It was as still and bare and lonely a place as if no man else had ever looked upon it . There were but a few more than a hundred anon put ashore now from the English ships to try their hands at making a colony , and not a woman among them to make a home . They had been sent out by a mercantile company in London , as if to start a trading-post , and not a comnnmity set up for its own sake , though there could be little trade for many a long day in that wilderness . Certain London merchants had united with certain west-country gentlemen and traders of Bristol , Exeter , and Plymouth in the formation of a joint-stock company for the purpose of setting up colonies iii both " the north and south parts of Virginia " ; and to this company royal letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1606 . The name " Virginia " had been given , in honor of Elizabeth , the Virgin Queen , to the mainland which Ralegh 's first explorers found beyond Roanoke . So far as Englishmen were concerned , the name covered the greater part of the Atlantic coasts of the continent . The patentees of the new company were to attempt both a northern and a southern settlement , and , to serve their double purpose the better , were divided into two bodies . The London stockholders were to undertake the first colony , in some southern part of " Virginia , " between the thirty-fourth and the forty-first degrees of north latitude ; while the incorporators who were of Somerset and Devon were to undertake a second colony , to be conducted to some point farther north , ? though all were to rennin under the govenmacnt of a single general council . There were men of capital importance and quick energy among the London incorporators ; and the enterprise they had taken in hand was not all novel . Several of them were members also of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before , and of the " Russia or Muscovy Company , " whose trade in far-away seas was a thing established and familiar . They were most of them men who had heard all there was to be told or read of the voyages and adventures by which America had become known in England ; and some notable sailors who had themselves seen the strange seas and unfamiliar coasts which others only read of were also of their number . Richard Hakluyt , the genial and learned Churchman , who loved every tale of daring , and who knew more of the New World than any other man in the kingdom , was their associate in the new company . Captain Newport , to whom they intrusted the command of their little fleet , borrowed from the Muscovy Company , had already been twice to Americaa : a clear-eyed man hardly turned of forty , and likely to understand what he saw . Bartholomew Gosnold , whom they commissioned captain of the Goodspeed , had himself discovered the short route to America by way of the Azores , and went now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There were capacity and experience and audacity and steadfastness enough embarked in  | the service of the Virginia Company , it must have seemed , to make it sure of its success . And yet nobody very well understood what this new business of establishing colonies was to be like , for all that ; and the colonists whom these capable London gentlemen sent over with Captain Newport were a sorry lot , it turned out , with whom to attempt an enterprise which should need for its execution every manly quality of courage and steadfastness and industry . Prosperous and steady men who were succeeding at home were not likely to be willing to go to America , of which they knew nothing except that it was full of savages , and that Ralegh 's colonists had been lost there , never to be found again . Only men hopelessly out of work or out of sorts , and reckless men , young and fond of adventure , were likely to think the prospect inviting , or the novel risk worth taking , to better their fortunes , or to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that England was full of idle men , because her life was changing . The very quickening and expansion of commerce and of adventure in trade and conquest , which had changed all the age and the aspect of the world itself since the first crossing of the Atlantic , had given England a new place in the geography of the planet , and was radically altering men 's lives and occupations and ambitions there . New trades and industries were springing up , and the towns were reaping the benefits of a diversified commerce ; but the people of the rural districts had fallen upon evil days . Land , like everything else , had become a sort of commodity , as trade gained its mastery . The old tenures , under which small holders had so long lived unmolested , were breaking up . The city merchants bought estates for their pleasure , and wanted no tenants . The older land-owners got rid of small farmers as fast as they could , in order to turn their lands into pasture for the sheep , whose wool was so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even enclosed and appropriated for the same purpose commons which had time out of mind been free to all . The demand for agricultural labor sadly slackened . Town and country-side alike filled with idlers and with sturdy beggars , and unguarded wayfarers were robbed upon the highways by desperate men who could find no other way to obtain subsistence . James 's craven eagerness for peace had put an end to the wars with which Elizabeth 's day had resounded , and London was full of idle soldiers , mustered out of service . Younger sons and decayed and ruined gentlemen seemed to abound more than ever . And so it was men out of work or unfit for it who chose to go to America , and not men of the country-sides so much as discredited idlers and would-be adventurers of the towns . bore than one-half of the company Captain Newport conducted to James River called themselves " gentlemen , " ? were men , that is , of good blood enough , but no patrimony , no occupation , no steady habit , who were looking for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land , of which they knew nothing at all . Very few indeed of the rest were husbandmen or carpenters or trained laborers of any sort . There was only one bricklayer , only one mason , only one blacksmith , in all the hundred and twenty . The things it was most necessary to do when at last the landing had been made at Jamestown , ? the planting of crops , the building of houses , the dull labor of felling trees and making a beginning in a wilderness , ? were the very things which the men the Virginia Company had sent over knew least about , and had the least inclination to learn . They expected the company to send them supplies out of England , and gave little thought to what they were to do for themselves . When Captain Newport 's ships put to sea again and left them , they were at their wits ' ends to know how to maintain themselves . It would have gone desperately with them had there not been one or two men of masterful temper and governing talents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the winter ; and still another ship followed him the next spring . And , besides supplies , the two ships brought a hundred and twenty new settlers between them . But among the new-comers there were shiftless " gentlemen " in the usual proportion ; and there came with them a jeweller , two goldsmiths , two refiners , and a perfumer , ? as  | if there would be need of such people ! Such additions to the settlement only made it so much the harder to develop or even maintain it ; and the few men who could rule stood out like masters amongst the inefficient idlers of whom the incorporators in London had thought to make pioneers . There was one , Captain John Smith , among them to whom , in part at any rate , they owed their salvation from utter helplessness and starvation . Captain Smith had a gift for narrative and for boasting which his fellow-adventurers did not have , and we know of his achievements from himself . IIe was not yet thirty years of age ; he was exasperatingly sure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But it was certain he had seen more of the world and of adventure than any other man of the company . Ile had known and had come to conclusions with men of many races and of every kidney , as he had cast about the world , a soldier of fortune ; and he knew how they were to be governed , as he presently demonstrated . He rang like brass without , no doubt , but had a touch of gold within . IIe was a partisan of his own way of making a colony , and no doubt colored the narratives which were to be seen at home ; but he was no sluggard at work , and knew how to take the burdens of tasks which no one else would attempt . He at least found ways of getting food from the Indians , and of making interest with their chiefs . Though he took authority when it was not given him , he made the lazy , " humoursome , and tuftaffety sparks " of the settlement work , upon penalty of being set across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wouldbe deserters from running away with the boats ; explored the neighboring coasts and river-courses , for two years and a half played his part very diligently and very manfully in keeping the struggling settlement alive , when the majority of his comrades would have been glad to abandon it . No doubt there were others who seconded him in the maintenance of order and of hope , and who worked as he did to take some hold upon the wilderness for their principals at home ; but of him we know . When at last , in the autumn of 1609 , he was obliged to take ship for England , dangerously wounded by an explosion of gunpowder , it looked as if the worst were over at Jamestown . The company at home had been very busy getting colonists , and had sent them over in goodly numbers . There were about five hundred persons at the settlement when Captain Smith left , ? a few women among them , making it look at last as if the lonely place were to see a few homes ; and fifty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbers , it turned out , did not improve the living . The colonists still slid not know how to support themselves in the wilderness , or how to keep themselves safe against the fevers which lurked within the damp forests by the river . Added numbers made them a little more helpless than before ; and the six months which immediately followed Captain Smith 's departure brought upon them a desperate " starving ' time , " which no man who survived it ever forgot . There were few to work where every one was ill and in want . They tore their rude houses down for firewood before the winter was over ; and do what they could , only sixty of them lived to see the spring again . The forlorn survivors resolved to abandon the desolate and hopeless place , and were actually on their way down the river , meaning to seek food and shelter among ' the fishermen in Newfoundland , when Lord Delaware met them at its very mouth with fresh colonists and supplies sent by the company to their relief . The radical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its part to sustain the colony , but that it could get few colonists of the proper sort , and was trying to do an impossible thing . The settlers sent out had no hopes or prospects of their own , as the company managed the business then . They were simply its servants , fed out of a common store , and settled upon land which belonged to no one but was used for all alike . No man would work well or with quick intelligence if he could not work at all for himself , but must always he working for the company . First-rate men would not consent to be the company 's drudges . And what could the company get out of the wilderness in return for its outlay by the work of such men as it could induce to go to Virginia upon such terms ? A few cargoes of tim- ber , a few new varieties of medicinal herbs found in the forests , could not make such expenditure worth while . Captain Newport , after his second voyage out , had gone back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he supposed to contain gold ; but it contained nothing of the kind . It was only shining sand . Lord Delaware , though a little slow and stiff , and fond of wearing fine apparel , and going about attended by officers and halberd-bearers , which seemed ridiculous enough there in the shadow of the untouched forests of that vast wilderness , was a wise and capable man , and no doubt saved the colony by coming out , that spring of 1610 , as Governor and Captain-General for the company . But it needed a radically new policy to give it real life ; and that new policy was adopted at last by Sir Thomas Dale , who came the next year ( 1611 ) , after Lord Delaware had gone home stricken with fever . The new policy it needed was one which should give it expansion and a natural vitality of its own . It was necessary that new towns should be built upon the river which should not be , like Jamestown , mere stations where men worked at tasks for the company , but which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have land of their own , and should be given time enough to work for themselves as well as for the incorporators in London . For five years ( 1611-1616 ) Sir Thomas Dale and Sir Thomas Gates pushed this new policy forward ; and it was their new and better way of doing things that really made Virginia . " Henrico , " " Hampton , " " New Bermuda , " and other new settlements like them , were added to  | Jamestown , each with its fort and its stockade , its military commander and discipline , and each with its group o virtually independent land-owners , free to work for themselves . Dale and Gates both belonged to that capable race which had been bred under Elizabeth , willing to be soldiers or sailors by turns , if only they could be always in the thick of action . They had both been soldiers in the Low Countries against Spain , and , now that fighting flagged there , were both serving their turn at this interesting business of setting up colonies . Dale was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to men who would not work or were slow to obey ; a. leader after their own hearts for men who meant to ( 10 their tasks and succeed , ? and his stay in Virginia was , fortunately , longer by three years than Gates 's . He was hut Gates 's deputy so long as Gates was in Virginia ( 1611-1613 ) ; but he was master when Gates was gone , and it was his sagacious and soldierly energy which made the little group of " plantations ready to last and to expand into a lusty piece of England over sea . When he had finished his five years work , the colony , though small enough still , was yet strong and spirited enough to survive being despoiled by an adventuer . For a year after Dale quit the colony it was left under the government of Captain George Yeardley , the commandant of one of the new settlements . But in 1617 Samuel Argall came out to take his place , and proved himself no lover of the people he had come to govern , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tie was of gentle blood , but had too long followed the sea in those disordered times , as little better than a freebooter , to relish law or justice overmuch ; and it was excellent proof that the colony had grown strong and able to take care of itself that it endured him for full two years ( 1617-1619 ) and was ready at the end of them to assume a sort of independence , under a new form of government which gave it the right to make its own laws . In 1619 Captain Y eardley , now become Sir George , returned out of England commissioned to take Argall 's place and govern the plantations under a new and better charter . He was to call together an Assembly of representatives from the several plantations , and that Assembly , sit- ting with the Governor 's Council , was to have the full right to make laws for the colony , subject always to the approval of the court of the company sitting iii London . Here was a very radical change . The colony was to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controlled by its stockholders . It was to be a little state , governed by its people . The fact was that a notable change had come over the company at home . Until now it had been managed by men who were mere merchants , not statesmen : by men who eared very little about anything but the profits some time to he got out of the colony , the sooner the better . Now men of another sort were in control ; the chief among them Sir Edwin Sandys , a man who loved liberty and wished to see the settlement thrive for its own sake , and the noble Earl of Southampton , whom Shakspere loved . It was upon the initiative of these men  | that Sir George Yeardley had been sent out to give the colony self-government . The new Virginia Assembly met in the chancel of the church at Jamestown , on the 30th of July , 1619 . We look back with some emotion upon it , as to the first representative Assembly in America , ? as to the beginning of liberty and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to have taken it very quietly , as if they had expected it and took it almost as a matter of course under the circumstances . Its sessions were as brief , as businesslike , and as much without ado as if it were already an established part of the custom of the colony . Certain necessary enactments were adopted touching trade with the Indians , the use of tobacco as currency , the salaries and authority of clergymen , and various other matters in which special regulations for Virginia seemed called for ; but for the rest it was taken for granted that the common law of England was in force there , as in every other place where there were Englishmen ; and within six days of its coming together the little Assembly was ready to adjourn . The quiet and ready capacity with which the colonists accepted this radical change in the method of their life and government afforded the best proof that they were fit for the responsibilities it involved . The company , under its new leaders , was a little too eager to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faster than they could be provided for . During the three years 1619-1621 quite three thousand five hundred came pouring in , men , women , and children , fleet after fleet of the company 's ships appearing in the river to put their mixed hosts of inexperienced people ashore . And yet at . the end of the three years there were but twelve hundred settlers , all told , in the colony . Cleared land and means of immediate subsistence could not be found upon short notice for so many . Hundreds succumbed to the dangerous fevers and sudden distempers drawn out of the damp forests by the summer sun or the first chill of the autumn nights . A sore process of " seasoning " tried out the river settlements every year , and only a few could endure it . It was reckoned inevitable that hundreds of new-comers should die . Many saw how things stood and went back to England again . But those who remained and survived prospered well ; and the settlements grew , after all , as fast as it was safe for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ granted to settlers became more and more liberal as things settled to an established way of life . Even Dale had not relieved the tenants of his day from the duty of working part of their time for the company ; and the colony had been conducted , until Sir George Yeardley came , like a joint-stock enterprise in which only stockholders might expect private profit . But under the changed conditions which followed Sir George 's coming virtually independent landholding became possible under very easy terms ; and , what was quite as good , the company no longer insisted that everything bought or sold should pass through the hands of their factor , as the only middle-man , so that the profits of all trade might fall to them . It turned out to be a very important thing that Mr. John Rolfe , one of the colonists , had in 1612 introduced the cultivation of tobacco ; for tobacco grew amazingly well and of excellent quality in Virginia , and proved a most profitable crop . By 1620 there were forty thousand pounds of tobacco exported from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was planting it instead of grain . Its leaves even became the currency of the plantations , coin being very scarce . In 1619 , the year Sir George Yeardley came to set up an Assembly , another very notable thing happened . A Dutch man-of-war came into the river and sold twenty negroes to the colonists as slaves . A handful of slaves made no great difference at first ; they were so few as scarcely to affect the life of the colony , and it was to be many a long day before their number was much added to . But their coming was the beginning of a great change which was slowly , very slowly , to alter the whole face of society in the settlements . By 1622 it seemed as if the chief difficulties of settlement were safely passed and the plantations secure of their growth and permanence . But in the very moment of assurance a great calamity came upon them , sudden , overwhelming , like  | a bolt out of a clear sky . On the same day and at the same hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon every settlement from the falls of the river to the bay , all the tribes of all the region round mustering in concert to strike a single exterminating blow . The colonists had suffered themselves to be deceived by the submissive friendliness of their savage neighbors , and had grown strangely heedless of danger from them . For years they had traded with them , mingled with them , admitted them freely to their homes , taught them the expert use of fire-arms , made servants and even confidants of them , without caution or reserve , deeming them an inferior race who had accepted the white men as masters . But Powhatan , the real friend of the English , and ruler amongst the red men ever since the landing at Jamestown , was dead . Opecanchanough , their subtle and implacable enemy , had succeeded him . For four years the wily savage had been drawing the tribes together for a decisive treachery ; and the dreadful secret had all the while been kept safe behind the steady eyes of every Indian who entered the settlements . Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ servants warn their masters of the fearful peril ; and then it was too late to do more than put a few households on their guard . Before the stun went down that fatal clay three hundred and forty-seven men , women , and children lay ( lead in the desolate settlements . Only because the Indians feared the white man with an overmastering dread , and chew back dismayed wherever a firm stand was made against them , if only by a single settler barred within his house , did the terrible slaughter stop short of sheer annihilation . No place escaped the carnage . But the colony , though stuned , was not killed . The Indians ' courage had not held out to finish their work . There was henceforth a bloody reckoning in store for them , no longer any friendship vouchsafed or any consideration . Steadily , relentlessly , and by a masterful advance from settlement to settlement which they could in no wise withstand , they were pushed back into the forests . The very year which followed the massacre found nearly two thousand white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indomitable English , and their quiet way of growth had been resumed . But the great company which had founded the settlements and seen them safely through their first struggles for life and maintenance was doomed . The King did not relish the politics and suspected the loyalty of the gentlemen who were in charge of its affairs . They were of the party which opposed him in Parliament . Their enemies told him that they  | used the councils of the company to plot sedition against him , and he determined to be rid of them . Every mismanaged or ill-judged affair with which the company was chargeable was magnified and made the most of , and , despite a very gallant fight in the law courts to save it , their charter was taken away , and the government of the colony taken into the hands of the King and his ministers . It made little practical difference to the colonists . They kept their Assembly , and could live as comfortably under a Governor sent them by the King as under a Governor sent then by the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But a great company was destroyed , and the public-spirited men who had given it its best life and the colony its first taste of self-pleasing liberty were deeply wronged . Meanwhile other colonies were being successfully planted in the north . On the great river St. Lawrence , which doughty Jacques Cartier had explored quite seventy years before , the French had set up trading-posts at Montreal and Quebec . They had established , besides , a struggling settlement or two nearer the mouth of the river ; and to the southward , within the Bay of Fundy . A little colony of Englishmen had begun to make homes for themselves in Newfoundland . Dutch traders were established on the Hudson . A company of English dissenters were building a New Plymouth within Cape Cod , and little groups of English adventurers were trying to secure a foothold upon th southern shores of the wide Hay of Massachusetts . Nowhere except in Virginia had more than a beginning been made ; but the settlement of the continent seemed at last to have been begun in earnest ; and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the English all entered as active competitors in the race for possession . The Dutch were likely to be harder rivals to beat than the French . Their little , compact home states ill the Netherlands were , it is true , scarcely onefourth as big as England , but they teemed with a thrifty people almost as numerous as the English themselves , and their chief power was upon the sea . With them , at home , the very land itself was one-half sea . They lied been bred fishermen and mariners time out of mind ; and of late , because the 5paniard provoked them to it , they had put great fleets on the high seas and had made conquests at the ends of the earth . At first they had not thought of conquest . They had simply made themselves , with their stout craft and seasoned tars , the ocean carriers for Europe , ? because the Portuguese , who had captured rich lands and set up a great trade all the way from the Persian Gulf to Japan , did not trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Lisbon , and because the Spaniards brought their treasures out of South America no further than Seville , and some one was needed to carry what they would sell to the merchants and princes of the rest of Europe . No doubt the Dutch would have been content to be only traders and carriers , had Spain but let them alone . But Spain , in her folly , undertook to force the Dutch to be Roman Catholics ; and they , stout Protestants and stubborn men that they were , resisted after a fashion that in the end set the whole power of rich Spain at naught . The war began in 156S ; all Europe was stirred by it ; and when , forty-one years later , the Spaniard , quite out of breath , agreed to a truce , the world had changed . Holland had become a great sea-power ; had driven the Portuguese from the Orient , taking their trade and their colonies ; was sinking fleets upon the very coasts of Spain herself , and was sweeping Spanish treasure by the ship 's cargo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even in making herself mistress of the seas , and had turned to this new task of taking possession of America with confidence and audacity . The Dutch combined conquest with trade , as England slid , and it was a Dutch East India Company of merchants which drove the Portuguese from their possessions in the East , as it was an English East India Company of merchants which afterwards conquered India for England . And when their East India Company had made itself powerful and famous by its conquests and adventures , the Dutch formed a West India Company also , to trade and take what it could upon the western coasts of Africa , upon both coasts of South America , and among the southern islands of the Atlantic . It had , as Mr. Motley has said , a roving commission to trade and fight and govern for twenty-four years ; and it incidentally undertook to establish Dutch settlements on the Hudson and the Delaware . Henry Hudson , an English sailor in the service of the Dutch East India Company , had discovered the great river which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very year the baffled Spanish agreed to a truce with the redoubtable states of the Netherlands . He had also entered the great hay and stream of the Delaware . The Dutch had promptly named the Hudson the " Great North River , " the Delaware the " South River , " and all the rich country which lay about and between them " New Netherind " ; meaning from the first to keep and occupy what their seamen had found . There had been a New Netherland Company , formed in 1614 , before there was a West India Company . Its charter had given it control of all the coast country from forty to forty-five degrees north latitude , a region which the Dutch described as lying between New France on the northand Virginia . " This was at the very heart of the country which James of England had granted to the Virginia Company ; but the Dutch knew little of that , and would very likely have thought as little had they known more . It was the profitable fur trade with the Indians of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual adventurers amongst them had built a small " fort " or trading-post far up the river in the heart of the wilderness , as well as a little group of huts on the seaward point of Mnhattan Island in the bay , and had been trafficking there with the willing natives for quite four years before they formed their New Netherland Company . It was the New Netherland Company that grew into the greater West India Company , whose principal business it was to be to wrest what they could from the Portuguese and the Spanish in the south , but which was also to keep an eye all the while on the North and South rivers , where the New Netherland Company had put its trading posts . It was 1623 before the great company found time amidst its other business to carry out any systematic plans of settlement in North America ; but by 1625 there were already two hundred colonists on the lands they claimed : some up the great stream of the North River at the little post which they called Fort Orange , some within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Manhattan Island , a few on Long Island , ? even a little group of families as far away as the " Fresh River , " which the English were to call the Connecticut . It remained to be seen how they would fare scattered there in the wilderness ; but there they were , a very hard people to  | discourage , by the time Virginia was fairly established in its own scattered settlements on the James , and the rights of the great Virginia Company taken into the hands of the King , ? and there they meant to stay . Meanwhile there had come out from Holland itself a band of exiled English settlers , to be their neighbors and rivals at the north , and so put them between two growing English colonies , ? not " between New France and Virginia , " as their first charter had said , but between New England and Virginia . The new-comers were exchanging a temporary exile in Holland for a permanent exile in America , and effected their settlement within the sheltering arm of Cape Cod . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within a generation , and the two countries had been drawn very near to each other . Long before the war began which brought Spain and the Netherlands to a grapple , hundreds of English merchants had established themselves in the Dutch seaports ; and young Englishmen were beginning , even before dissenters were shut out from Oxford and Cambridge , to resort in influential numbers to the Dutch universities . When the Low Countries grappled with Spain , English volunteers crowded into their armies . The troops Elizabeth sent over after 1585 found the Dutch ranks already full of their countrymen . English Churchmen , too , for whom the policy of the Establishment proved too rigorous under the imperious Tudor Queens , had learned to seek in Holland the freedom of worship denied them at home . At the same time refugees from the ravage and slaughter of Alva 's armies poured across the sea from the Netherlands into England , and the two countries seemed to be exchanging populations . Tradesmen , weavers , mechanics , farmers , fled terror-stricken into the eastern and southern counties of England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressed most desperately . Their coveted skill and industry , which English statesmen knew how to value , their foreign birth and humble rank in life , which seemed to depress them below the level of political influence , gained for them an indulgence in theological error and separate worship which was denied to Englishmen themselves , and presently the English towns in the east and south teemed with thousands of Dutch artisans , who were suffered to be Anabaptists , Lutherans , ? what they would , so long as they taught England the industries and handicrafts which were to make her rich . The little company of Englishmen who , in 1620 , exchanged Holland for America were not soldiers and traders like the men who had led and established the colony at Jamestown , but members , most of them , of a humble congregation of dissenters who had fled from the very districts of their native land in which foreign heretics were tolerated , to escape the tyrannical surveillance of the Church , and who had found a refuge for a time in the great university town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not wish their children to become Dutch or lose altogether their English speech and customs , and because they could look to have an even more untrammelled freedom upon the fruitful coasts of the New World than in the ancient states of the Netherlands , into whose life they found it hard to thrust themselves . They were Protestants , and had left England because they could not brook the domination of her Church ; and yet the reason for their exile was as much political as religious . Many men England , some of them high in the counsels of the Church itself , held the same doctrines that they held , ? the doctrines which Calvin had made the creed and fundamental basis of belief among all Protestants of the sterner sort , ? and yet were not exiles , because they had not broken , as these men had , with the discipline and authority of the Church . England 's Protestantism had a color and character of its own . Her " Reformation " had struck at the roots of nothing except the authority of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national , had always held itself less subject than other churches to be ruled by papal delegates , or turned this way or that by the vicissitudes of continental politics and the policies of the papal state . She had broken with Rome at last , when the Reformation came , not because she was deeply stirred in thought and conscience by the doubts and the principles of belief  | which Luther had put afloat to the upsetting of Europe , so much as because her King , the wilful Henry , was vexed by the restraints put upon his marriages and divorces by the papal authority , and therefore chose to lead still further along upon the road of independence to which her position and her pride inclined her , in religion no less than in politics . When the change had been made , stupendous as it looked amidst the ruin of the monastic houses which the Ding had promptly despoiled , Englishmen found themselves very little more at liberty than before to choose forms of worship or of church government for themselves . The Church had become more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was its head and master , instead of the Pope . Heid not insist very much upon matters of doctrine , being himself in no case to set an example in that kind ; but he did insist upon the authority of the Church in matters of government , ? upon uniformity in worship and in discipline ; because the discipline of the Church was now the discipline of the state , and part of his own sovereignty . Ile deemed schism a form of disloyalty , though opinion , if it kept within discreet bounds , he would not too curiously look into . It was an easy enough rule . Things might have gone very quietly and with a normal growth and liberalization , had not Mary , a fanatical Catholic , become Queen , and tried forthwith to force every one in the kingdom back into the Church of Rome ; had not Elizabeth , in her turn , proved so absolute a martinet in every matter of obedience to the crown , in matters which affected the Church no less than in matters which affected only her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the stake , or out of the kingdom . Elizabeth looked shrewdly into every movement that threatened the uniformity of worship , as changes of opinion inevitably slid . Most people quietly submitted . Even men of strong convictions deemed it better to remain within the Church and purify its beliefs and practices without schism or revolution than to fling out of it , breaking both its unity and the peace of the country . Such men even drew together as a distinct party of " Puritans , " ? men who wished the Church to be pure and to hold the essential doctrines of the great reformers who had given life and substance to Protestantism , but who did not mean to lead it faster than it could go in the new ways , or to separate themselves from it and set up a Church and worship of their own , even though it were the excellent forms and beliefs of the Church of Geneva . Others , however , were of a more exacting conscience , a more imperious and separate way of belief . It meant a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Word of God , to have thought upon its living sentences with the free , unbidden , individual right of interpretation of which great Luther had set the example . It was King Henry himself who had authorized the publication of the Bible in English , and who had commanded that it be made accessible everywhere in the churches ; and when once they had thought upon it for themselves and had found their thought , sober and chastened as it was , running in unsancioned channels , they preferred their own consciences and their own views of the truth to obedience , and refused to conform . They followed the example of the Dutch , now to be found almost everywhere amongst them , and set up independent congregations , ? became " Separatists , " secretly and in defiance of the crown . Elizabeth , bent upon being sovereign in all things , had grown harsher and harsher toward those who would not submit to authority in matters of belief and worship . Law upon law had been passed to prevent Englishmen from organizing any worship of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever was law Elizabeth saw to it should be executed . And then , when Elizabeth was gone , James of Scotland came to the throne and completed the dissatisfaction and despair of those who had clung to the Church through all that had gone before , in the hope of better times and more liberal ways of government . He had seemed a veritable Presbyterian so long as he was King of Scotland ; but when he became King of England also he turned out to be of another opinion . " A Scottish presbytery , " he exclaimed , " agreeth as well with a monarchy as God with the devil . " He was not only head of the Church , he declared , because Henry had  | cast loose from Rome , but also because it was of divine ordinance and appointment that he should be . The bishops of the Church were his agents . " No bishop , no King , " he said ; and men must obey the King in matters of religion as never before . It was in the disheartening days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Separatists " fled from England into Holland who were afterwards to seek new shelter within Cape Cod in America . They waited only until there should be peace between the Netherlands and Spain ; and the truce came at last in 1609 which gave them their freedom to go , following after scores of their countrymen who had gone before them . They had formed their separate association for worship in England three years before , in defiance of the law , meeting quietly iii the old manor-house at Scrooby , a little hamlet just within the borders of Nottinghamshire , on the great north road from London to Edinburgh . They were humble folk , for the most part , of no social consequence , with only two or three scholars amongst them , William Brewster , their elder , and John Robinson , their " teacher , " and one or two others bred at Cambridge , men of strong convictions and an exalted sense of independence and duty , who had been driven from the Church for non-conformity . But , umble though they were , they could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The law was rigorously enforced against them , and they soon found that they could have no peace in England . They fled first to Amsterdam , but after about a year removed to Leyden ( 1609 ) . There they made comfortable enough homes for themselves , by dint of careful thrift and hard labor . Their new neighbors liked them and helped them , because they found them capable , honest , and diligent . But it was not like being in England , after all . They felt themselves exiles all the while . Mr. Robinson , with his learning and his sweet eloquence , made friends and found congenial tasks at the university , where his gifts were recognized and honored ; and Mr. Brewster established himself as a teacher , and even set up a printing-press , where books forbidden as heretical in England could be printed . But the majority of the little band found their lot hard , and even a bare living difficult to eke out in a strange country , whose manners were as unfamiliar to them as its language . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the years went by , in a way that threatened to make them as Dutch as their neighbors , and forfeit their nationality altogether ; and that was deeply distasteful to them . When the truce approached its end , therefore , and war was again at hand , a final argument of discouragement was added , and they determined to try their fortunes in the New World , where Virginia had now become fairly established and seemed secure of its future . They sent agents to London to speak with the managers of the Virginia Company , and obtain leave to settle within their grant . They did not wish to go to Jamestown or to lose in any way their separate organization as a congregation by being merged with plantations already made ; and for a little , while their negotiations with the Vir- ginia Company were dragging slowly , because Sir Edwin Sandys and its other leaders were busy about other things , they thought of entering into some arrangement with the Dutch West India Company to secure a separate allotment of land near the Great North River @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and some of them at last set forth with a charter from the Virginia Company . Not all could go . There was not money , there were not ships , enough . It was the month of September , 1620 , before those who could go , a hundred and two in all , got fairly upon their way , in a single small vessel , the Mayflower . Mr. Brewster went with them , as their leader , but Mr. Robinson staid behind ; for the greater number remained , to await a later opportunity , and wished to keep their pastor with them . Stress of weather kept the little Mayflower nine weeks on the Atlantic ; and when at last , in the bleak days of late November , they sighted land , it turned out to be Cape Cod , and not the Virginia coast at all . The Virginia Company had been divided into two bodies , as they knew very well , and the gentlemen in London from whom they had got their charter had no rights over this northern coast . It belonged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company . They had half a mind to make for Hudson 's River , after all . But the season was late and stormy , and the captain unwilling , and they determined to land where they were and make the best of what they had hit upon . They took care first , however , to have some sort of government made ready for the landing . Their charter from the Virginia Company being no longer serviceable , and a few even of their little group of settlers being persons taken aboard in England who were not of their congregation , ? and not certain , therefore , to submit without compulsion to be governed by their authority and discipline , ? they judged it best to draw up an agreement before going ashore , by which all should bind themselves to accept the authority of their leaders , until , at any rate , they should obtain a grant of lands and of power from the Plymouth Company , upon whose coasts they were thus unexpectedly to be set down . That done , they were ready to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new coast would afford them . The shores of the sea within Cape Cod by no means showed the soft summer aspect which Captain John Smith had found upon them in 1614 , when he had cruised along these coasts . They had reminded him then of green Devonshire and the soft slopes of England . But now they were bleak and frosted and desolate . The pilgrims were not men to lose heart , however , and their leaders were of such quality as to relish difficulty and find a zest in daring . Besides Mr. Carver , who had been their agent in obtaining the Virginia charter , which they could not use , and whom they chose to be their Governor under the voluntary compact they had signed in the ship 's cabin , there was Captain Miles Standish , whose people had served England ever since Agincourt , and before ; who had himself fought , for the love of it , against the Spaniard in the Low Countries ; and who , when the fighting was over , had come upon this little congregation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them to America because he liked both them and the enterprise . There was Edward Winslow , also , a young gentleman of Worcestershire , who had happened upon them in his travels and had of like preference cast in his lot with them ; and William Bradford , of their own humble sort , who had gone with them into Holland when he was a lad of twenty , had made himself a bit of a scholar while he plied his trade as a silk-weaver , and who was now , at thirty , counted one of their men of counsel and of action . Several weeks elapsed before a suitable place was found for landing and erecting shelter ; and even then it was only " the best they could find , " ? the spot , within a little bay , which Captain Smith had called " Plymouth " on the map lie had sketched as he passed that way , putting into bays and examining harbors with businesslike curiosity . January had come , and the first rigors of winter , before they got to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but icy cold , for all that . The strenuous work and cruel exposure of those first weeks , which wearily lengthened into months , and the poor and insufficient food eked out from their scant supplies , brought upon them agues , fe- vers , scurvy , and all the other distempers that want and exposure bring , and they saw what the settlers at Jamestown had seen of the pitiless power of the wilderness . By spring full half their number were dead , Mr. Carver among the rest . Before that dreadful season of suffering had passed they had seen a time when there were but six or seven sound persons amongst them all to care for the rest . But they were steadfast , as always . They elected Mr. Bradford Governor in the stead of Mr. Carver , and went on as they could with their work . No one asked to go back with the Mayflower when she set sail for England again in April . They worked against tremendous odds there on that barren coast ; but they wrung a living from it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned to succeed at the hard thing they had undertaken . It was a great burden to them that they had had to borrow large sums of money from certain London merchants to pay for the ship that was to take them out and for the stores she was to carry . They had been obliged to take the lenders into a sort of partnership , and very soon found that they were expected to return a profit almost from the outset . It was many a long year before they were able to buy themselves out of that quandary and begin at last a free life for themselves . Additional settlers came out to them , season by season ; but they were not always such persons as they wished for . They were , many of them , young fellows of a very irresponsible and unmanageable sort , " who little considered whither or about what they went . " It was not until a full ten years had gone by that the little congregation were able to fulfil their long-cherished hope and bring over from Leyden considerable numbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before that time came Mr. Robinson , their beloved pastor , whom they had most desired , was dead . They were not a little troubled , and even endangered , moreover , by helpless or unmanageable neighbors , ? Englishmen of one sort or another : some mere adventurers , others sober and earnest enough , but not fit for the grim work of making first homes in a wilderness such as that was , ? who came to attempt settlements , or trade with the Indians , on the great Bay of Massachusetts near by . Sometimes it was necessary in mere pity to succor these people ; sometimes it was necessary to check them or drive them off , lest they should make irreparable mischief with the Indians . Despite every difficulty , nevertheless , Mr. Bradford 's indomitable colonists made their foothold secure at Plymouth ; worked themselves free from the London partnership ; found how to get good crops , and what sorts of crops to get , out of the unwilling soil ; established fisheries upon the near-by coasts , and trading-posts here and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far away as Kennebec in Maine . The " Council for New England , " which represented the new company established in England to control and develop the northern coasts once included in the Virginia grants , was very glad to encourage these their unexpected colonists at Plymouth , and sent a liberal charter out to them by the very first ship that came from England after the return of the Mayflower ; and when they were ready to ask for more privileges , ? as , for example , for leave to set up a post on the Kennebec , ? very promptly gave them what they asked for . By the time their old friends from Leyden came to them , in 1 ( 330 , they had reason to feel secure enough in their new home , and had only their neighbors to fear . It was at first only unruly or shiftless English settlers who gave them cause for uneasiness ; but they had not been long at Plymouth before they were given reason to think about the Dutch also , as jealous neighbors and rivals who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A very cordial treaty of alliance between England and Holland had been concluded when King James died , and his son , the first Charles , came to the throne , in 1625 ; and there was likely , for the present at least , to be peace and goodwill between the two peoples . But there was no telling how long it would last , and the Dutch were meanwhile growing very numerous and strong on Hudson 's River . The treaty with England had , indeed , seemed to give the Dutch West India Company fresh heart for their enterprise in New Netherland : They immediately despatched thither an active man as Governor , and began to  | erect warehouses and batteries of good stone masonry at " Fort Amsterdam " on Manhattan Island , where guns could command the great bay of the North River very handily . The scattered families at Fort Orange and on the South River , at Fort Nassau , were brought together for greater strength and security at Fort Amsterdam , and there were presently close upon three hundred settlers there , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years had gone by under the new Governor ( 1628 ) they had sent home , in two ships alone , sixty-one thousand guilders ' worth of timber from the forests , and of furs bought from the northern Indians . Mr. Bradford and his people at Plymouth set up a trading-post some twenty miles to the southward of them on Buzzards Bay , but it turned out that the Dutch could beat them there ; for it was chiefly on Long Island , which the Dutch controlled , that the wampum was to be obtained which the Indians accepted as money , and the Plymouth traders were at a serious disadvantage without it , besides being pushed hard in every other way by the shrewd Dutch traders . The Governors of the rival colonies exchanged very courteous letters , and the Secretary of New Netherland was sent on a visit of ceremony and goodwill to Plymouth ; but even in this friendly correspondence there were threats of something less gentle and peaceable . Bradford called Governor Minuit 's attention to the fact that the Dutch were settled within the limits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that their right to be there might some day be called in question ; and Minuit replied , very spiritedly , " As the English claim authority under the King of England , so we derive ours from the States of Holland , and will defend it . " No doubt , too , the Secretary of the Dutch colony was sent upon his visit of courtesy as much to see the situation and report upon the strength of the Plymouth settlement as to carry messages of good feeling . It is from him that we learn what the Pilgrim colony looked like in that early day , when it was but seven years old ( 1627 ) : how a broad street , it might be eight hundred feet long , ran up the hill straight from the landing-place in the harbor , and asossed midway by another street , with four cannon in the open place at the crossing , and the Governor 's house close by upon the upper corner ; how the houses , all of good hewn plank , stood in their little gardens ranged at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and how , crowning the hill , there stood a square building , large and very stoutly made , on whose top , as on a platform , there were six cannon , to command from their elevation the country round about and the harbor below , and within which was their place of meeting and of worship . They went always to church in litary array , the said , their captain commanding , and laid their arms down close beside them while they worshipped and heard the sermon . They remembered their sojourn in Holland with much gratitude , and accorded the Dutch Secretary a hearty welcome . But it was likely that New Amsterdam and New Plymouth would be keen rivals , nevertheless , and no love lost between them in the long-run .  |
