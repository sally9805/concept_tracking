 | FEW people appreciate the fact that to-day , at the dawn of the twentieth century , there are still parts of the old Roman Empire where no traveler of modern times has been ; that there are ancient towns which no tourist has seen , temples and towers that no lover of classic architecture has delighted in , inscriptions in ancient Greek that no savant has as yet deciphered , whole regions , in fact , full of antiquities for which no Baedeker has been written , and which are not shown upon the latest maps . There are regions within our temperate zone where no modern European foot has trod , so far as we are able to tell ? regions where the civilization of Greece and Rome once flourished , and where fine monuments of classic art , and of an unfamiliar art that supplanted the classic , waste their beauties upon the ignorant sight of half-civilized nomads . To realize the truth of this , one needs only to cross the ranges of mountains that run parallel to the eastern coast of the Mediterranean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the barren country that lies between these mountains and the Euphrates . Here is a territory which , though not wholly unexplored , is full of most wonderful surprises . Here are cities and towns long deserted , not so great or so imposing , perhaps , as Palmyra , but far better preserved than the city of Zenobia , and giving a much truer picture of the life of the ancient inhabitants than one can draw from those famous ruins . These towns are not buried , like the great cities of the Mesopotamian plains , nor have their sites been built upon in modern times , as those of the classic cities of Greece have been ; they stand out against the sky upon high ridges , or lie sheltered in sequestered valleys , presenting to the view of the traveler , as he approaches them , very much the same aspect that they did in the fourth century of our era , when inhabited by prosperous , cultivated , and happy people , or when deserted by those inhabitants some thirteen hundred years ago . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a territory as large as England or the State of New York , traversed from north to south by a highway upon which the pilgrims from all the northern Islamic countries journey to Damascus and thence to Mecca . It is crossed in the north by a great caravan route extending from the sea to the Euphrates , and in the south by another important route leading from Damascus to Bagdad by way of Palmyra . At intervals between these extremes there are two other routes for caravans , which are infrequently used . Upon the more important roads , especially between Aleppo and Damascus , there are towns of considerable size . These are situated in the plain , and consist , in some cases , of houses poorly built of broken stones from ruined buildings of antiquity , but more generally of mud huts , called kubbe . But the hill country of northern central Syria , the country of deserted cities and towns , the region of which I am writing , is one of the districts that are still virtually unexplored . Portions of it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visited from time to time by scholars in search of inscriptions , but each of these has usually followed the track of the first explorers .  | This country was first brought to the notice of the scientific world over a hundred years ago , when an Englishman named Pococke touched at several points while traveling from Damascus to Aleppo . Pococke copied a number of inscriptions , but has little to say about the ruins , for the reason , we may presume , that he visited few of the more remarkable sites . In 1867 the first important publication was made of the architectural remains of the region . It was in the year 1860 that Count Melchior de Vogiie , later an attache of the French embassy at Constantinople , now the Marquis de Vogue , a member of the Institute and one of the " Immortals , " made a journey through the country east of the Orontes and in the Hauran , with sketch-book and measuring-rod in hand , and , upon his return to France , published one of the most remarkable works upon architecture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a collaborator in his work was M. Waddington , the well-known epigraphist and writer , who was afterward ambassador of France to Great Britain . In this book , " La Syrie Centrale : Architecture Civile et Religieuse , " were presented one hundred and fifty drawings of basilicas , churches , public baths , private houses , and tombs in great variety , dating from the first to the seventh century , all in a new and beautiful style and in a wonderful state of preservation . It seemed almost incredible that such remarkable remains should have existed so long within two or three days ' journey from the site of ancient Antioch , or from Damascus , without having been known before . Skeptical persons were inclined to believe that the drawings were more beautiful than the ruins themselves , and were , in a sense , restorations more or less imaginary from fragments found by M. de Vogue ; nevertheless they made an epoch in the history of architecture , and these same drawings will be found reproduced in every general history of architecture that has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ architectural illustrations to our knowledge of ancient architecture , M. de Vogue 's book contained charts which added to the general map of Syria a score and more of names of sites before unknown ; but since that time few travelers have found their wav to the country of M. de Vogue 's discoveries . In reading M. de Vogue 's book one wonders what there may be beyond and on each side of his route ; for he says that there were many great ruins to be seen in the distance , which could not be reached for lack of time . And it was from wondering what might be beyond that an American archeological expedition was organized , in 1899 , to extend M. de Vogue 's work and to verify his drawings by the camera . We were four ? three Americans and one German . When we started out in the autumn our work was divided so that one man was to make maps and study the general physical conditions of the country , another was to study the architecture and other arts , a third had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while the fourth was to take charge of the Semitic inscriptions , of which six kinds were found . In the spring we were joined by another member , who came out from America to study the natives , and for a few weeks the eminent American medical professor of the Syrian College at Beirut was one of us ; he joined us in order to collect in the desert between Aleppo and Palmyra material for the completion of his great work on the flora of Syria . Then we were six ; but the retinue of servants that one must have to travel comfortably in the East , together with the guard of Turkish soldiers that the government insists on sending , amounted to more than thirty men , while the cavalcade of horses , mules , donkeys , and camels when these were necessary ? eighty in all ? made up a goodsized caravan or a tribe of respectable proportions . We set out really from Alexandretta , though the caravan had come from Beirut and Jerusalem . Our tents were first pitched at Antakiyah , in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wretched collection of modern houses and one or two dingy mosques , with nothing visible to recall ' Antioch the Fair " of old but the ponderous arches of a Roman aqueduct outside the town , on the south , and the rugged masses of Mons Silpius , crowned with its mighty ruined walls , towering above . The glories of the city of Seleucus Nicator , Alexander 's great general , are gone , the splendid colonnaded avenues of Antiochus Epiphanes are no more . Naught remains of the gorgeous buildings which  | Roman emperors built to grace the " Crown of the East " ; not even a remnant of one of Constantine 's or Justinian 's great churches remains in the city where the disciples were first called Christians . The river and the mountain are the same , though the Orontes is to the natives el-'Asi , ? " the rebellious , " ? because it flows north , while Silpius is Habib en-N ejar . The balmy air is still as sweet as when it charmed an emperor away from his imperious Roma , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Daphne . At night the creaking wooden water-wheels chant mournful dirges for the city that is no more , while the jackals on the mountain-side wail piteously , like the wandering souls of her great ones . Our camp beside the Orontes was the last one for many days upon a site with a familiar name ; two days later , having crossed the Orontes by an old Saracenic bridge called Djisr il-Hadid , and having spent the night below the ruined castle of Harim , we had arrived in the Djebel it-A'la , the country of M. de Vogue 's travels , and had begun to prove the accuracy of the great Frenchman 's work and the inaccuracy of all the maps of the region . The country into which we had come is a barren , mountainous region extending seventy miles north and south , consisting chiefly of long , rocky ridges , seldom over 2000 feet high , with one prominent peak at the north ? the Djebel Shah BerekAt ? the dome of which , 3000 feet high , dominates the whole country . Extended views of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rolling in gentle waves , stripped of soil , destitute of trees , the monotony of its grayness broken only by the walls and towers of a - ruined and deserted city , or the uneven sky-line of some pagan shrine or Christian monastery perched upon a barren hill-top . But the nearer prospects , as one journeys over the hills , often show that the land is not so desolate or so barren as it seems from a distance ; for there are little valleys in which the soil has lodged and can not get away , where there are olive groves and patches of grain that afford a living to the scattered inhabitants who live in crudely constructed huts among the ruins . Olive groves are occasionally found among the ruins of cities and towns , where the soil has been held in place by ancient walls . Trees sometimes grow even in the ancient houses and send their branches out over the tops of the walls ; while here and there a flowering vine has climbed to the top of a ruined structure , festooning its broken columns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of silent desolation , naked rock , and deserted ruin . There are two or three small towns , even among the hills , widely separated , built out of ruins , poor and squalid . Water for these settlements is usually preserved in ancient cisterns ; for wells are rarely found , and the inhabitants , like the casual dwellers in ruined towns , find their subsistence in the olive groves and stony grain-fields of a few protected valleys . But the wonder of the land lies not in its barren hills or in the life of its scattered population , but in the splendid architectural remains of ancient civilization that rise in all directions from its rocky surface . On the second day out from Antioch , early in the afternoon , after several hours of hard traveling up a rough slope and through a rocky ravine , we came upon our first ruin , a small town , preserving several large houses in excellent classic style almost intact , and a lofty column which , with a sister shaft now fallen , stood as a monument above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruins were living several Druse families , who received us cordially and told us that the town was called Benabil , which is not a word from the Arabic , the language of the present inhabitants , but is of Syriac origin and has doubtless been handed down for thirteen centuries since the town was deserted by its original inhabitants . None of the monuments , so far as we knew , had ever been published . That same afternoon we stopped at another , still more extensive , ruined town , less well preserved than Benabil , and passed within hailing distance of a third town with ponderous outer walls shining in the last rays of the setting sun , before we joined our caravan and camped for the night . Our tents were pitched at Kalb Lauzeh , beside a great church which might have been the cathedral of a diocese ? a beautiful building , wonderfully preserved , built in massive style , of huge blocks of limestone that were a creamy white when quarried , but which are now toned to rich golden brown , brightened with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine monument of the days of Justinian and Theodora was the pride of the Djebel it-A'la and is a striking landmark , standing upon the top of a high ridge , conspicuous for miles around . This was the first of the buildings which we saw that was familiar to us from the illustrations of M. de Vogue 's book . We rejoiced to find that it had suffered but little decay during the lapse of forty years . All of the ruins described in " La Syrie Centrale " were found in time , while numerous sites were discovered on each side of the route marked upon the maps of that book , which more than repaid our constant search . Finally we found ourselves in a country wholly unexplored , so far as maps and books have told , and each day brought us to some new and interesting site that had been known only to the wandering natives for many centuries . Within a few weeks over thirty ruined towns were found that are unknown to modern geographers . This number includes only the more important sites and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monasteries , towers , and small groups of buildings . Comparatively few of these sites are sufficiently large in superficial area to be called cities , yet each of them is too extensive and too nobly built to be classed under the head of villages . The streets are very narrow and the buildings are set close together , and we must remember that the ancients lived in more crowded fashion than we do , and that small space was required to house a large number of inhabitants . The drawings of M. de Vogue 's book , wonderful and beautiful as they are , give but a faint notion of the extent of these ruined and deserted towns , or of the dignity and richness of their architecture . Great was the delight of finding old friends among these splendid remains of antiquity , and great the joy of making new acquaintances in the same towns , of studying those which were known before and those which had been seen by the first explorer , but which had not been introduced to the world ; but greater still was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monuments of which no appreciative eye had seen for many generations , and the records of which , often engraved in letters of stone upon their walls , @# had not been read since long before the time of Charlemagne and Alfred . Let the reader for a moment imagine himself withdrawn from the luxuriant landscapes of forest-capped hills and fresh green pastures with which he is familiar , and set down in this wasted land of barren gray hills , beneath a cloudless sky , and let him see before him in the distance a towering mass of broken walls and shattered colonnades , the mighty remnants of a city long deserted by civilized men , silent , sepulchral , with gates wide open and every house within untenanted even by wild beasts . Let him recall that this now lonely city was in existence before the day of Constantine the Great , while Rome was still the mistress of the world and the Antonine emperors still sat upon the throne , that its magnificent churches were erected while our ancestors were bowing to Woden and Thor , that its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , abodes were built while the Anglo-Saxon was content with a hut of branches and skins , and then let him reflect that this once wealthy and thriving town has stood uninhabited for thirteen centuries , that no hand has been raised to add a single stone or to brace a tottering wall in all that time , and he will grasp something of the antiquity and something of the desolation of these dead cities . There are many sites far older than these , many separate buildings the history of which carries us much further back into the story of the past ; but no other place has as yet been discovered , except among the ashes of Pompeii , where one can cast his eye over the massive walls of a city filled with fine buildings , temples and basilicas , crowded with residences , shops , and every structure that an advanced civilization requires , and say , " No hand but that of time " ? for weather and earthquake are but time 's handmaidens ? " has wrought the change which separates this dead city from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our era . " No vandal 's torch has destroyed , no restorer 's touch has marred , these monuments of a bygone age during forty generations . All that remains is genuine and original ; each civic edifice , each house , each tomb , whether sadly ruined or almost perfectly preserved , contains a record of a civilization lost and forgotten , a record which , like an ancient papyrus  | scroll , has known no overwriting and only slight effacement . Enter the city , walk through its narrow streets , often blocked by fallen walls , seek out the churches , find your way to the public bath ; pass through the bazaars , as if you were in a modern living city . Churches you will always find , baths are less numerous , but shops abound everywhere . Pass through one of the many narrow entrances in the walls that hedge the streets ; penetrate the arched vestibules with seats on each hand ; where you would have sat and waited fifteen hundred years ago until a slave opened the inner door and led you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond the houses of the town to the ancient burial-places , where you will find tombs of many kinds , some with large chambers and columned porches cut all in the solid rock , others built of fine masonry , square structures roofed with rounded domes or steeply pointed pyramids . All have been rifled and desecrated during the ages of Moslem rule ; each stone sarcophagus has been broken open and its contents scattered or carried away , though in a number of cases you will find bones which were not considered worth removing . Wherever you go , in stately hall , in market , or in tomb , a death-like silence reigns . The history of Syria , as well as the history of her architecture , is written in the buildings of these towns , and a picture is presented in them which is probably the best reproduction of the architectural aspect of ancient Antioch , in the days of her power and splendor as an imperial city , that can ever be found . The second century , the century of the Antonine emperors , under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a splendid temple , by private houses and imposing funeral monuments , that are of pure classic style , though they are suffused with Greek rather than Roman feeling . The third century , the period of decadence and lavish display in other parts of the Roman world , is represented in Syria , where the Christian religion was gaining a strong foothold , by a reaction against the prevalent extravagance of imperial paganism , for the architecture of that period is reserved and severe , though its elements are still classic . The architecture of the fourth century , foreshadowing the outburst of Oriental national feeling that was to follow the triumph of Christianity in Constantine 's decree , suppresses its classic motives , and shows a still timid Oriental sentiment in delicate touches in the ornamental details . With the fifth century , the lingering GrecoRoman style is clothed with garments of Oriental design , and a hundred elements are introduced which transform the architecture of northern Syria and create a distinct style . The newly created style was perfected in the sixth century , when the elements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrought into a developed style of architectural expression , while only the skeleton of the classic ? the fundamental principles of design and construction which had been learned from the West ? remains to the credit of Greece and Rome . The churches and baptisteries , and the greater number of the houses , baths , bazaars , and tombs , belong to the later styles which cover the fourth , fifth , and sixth centuries . The churches generally conform to one of two plans , the small structures being oblong , with wide , undivided naves and with an arched chancel at the east end and a chamber on each side of it ; the larger edifices have two rows of columns which divide the nave into central and side aisles , and carry a clearstory above the slanting aisle roofs . Many examples of the former class exist in an almost perfect state of preservation but for their roofs , which were of wood and have , of course , perished ; but the majority of the large churches have collapsed with the fall of the interior columns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their stone portions entire , columns , clearstory , and all , and in these we find the clue for the restoration of all the churches in Syria . A number of these churches , large and small , have had scarcely a stone displaced , from the square slabs of their pavements to the apex of their gables : restore the roofs of wood , furnish their portals with doors and their windows with glass , and they would again be comfortable houses of worship ; replaster the interior of the walls , replace the altars and other furniture , and you will have Christian shrines , the walls and arches of which would put to shame , in point of age , the oldest churches of Europe . Some of these structures have counterparts in the neighborhood , less well preserved , which have inscriptions upon  | them dated in the earliest years of the fifth century , while fallen church portals are to be found that have inscribed dates of the fourth century . The ancient basilicas of Rome , which belong to the same period , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their original structure remains in situ . But whatever is left of these Syrian buildings is sure to be of the original builders ' work . Many of these edifices have richly ornamented portals and arches carved in fresh and vigorous style , and ranges of stately columns with graceful flowing capitals . A number of them boast of pavements laid in mosaics of varied pattern and rich colors ; it takes but a slight touch of imagination to restore them in one 's mind to the dignified grace and rich simplicity of their original estate . The best preserved of the public baths , though comparatively small , was planned with all the divisions of the ancient Roman thermx , with caldarium , tepidarium , frigidarium , and other dependencies . In the great central hall of one bath we found a mosaic pavement showing scarcely a trace of time 's rude tread . Its highly colored designs , representing wild beasts in combat , its borders of intricate geometrical and floral patterns , and a fine Greek inscription wrought in black-and-white mosaics within a circle in the center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water was applied to them as when Julianus completed the bath in the year 472 A.D. , as the inscription tells us . The ancients in these regions seem to have had two general forms of private residence ? one long and low , seldom of more than two stories , and having capacious twostory colonnades or porticos with inclosed courtyards before them ; the other of tower form , four or five stories high , with two or  | three rooms in each story . Those of the latter sort are naturally preserved in fewer instances than the former , for the reason that high buildings are , generally speaking , a more easy prey to earthquake than low ones . Examples of the long two-story house are common in every ruined town , many of them in a remarkable state of preservation . The dates inscribed upon them range from 398 to 510 A.D. The porticos of these houses were their most interesting feature ; here the ornament was massed , here the inscriptions were carved , and here , doubtless , the leisure hours of the ancient owners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a parapet composed of rectangular slabs paneled , molded , and otherwise ornamented . Many of these apparently thin slabs are , in reality , the backs of settles cut in solid stone , with comfortable seats and curving arms . The wooden floors of all colonnades like this have , of course , perished , so that now , when one sits in one of the settles , his feet are necessarily suspended in space ; but these seats are an index of the homelike ease and luxury that these ancient people enjoyed in the open loggias of their town residences , when the floors were in place , when a sloping roof afforded welcome shade within the portico , and when clinging vines twined about the pillars of stone . The bazaars of these ancient towns , which are still recognized as such by the people who live among the ruins , who have no bazaars of their own , but have seen them in Aleppo , consist of long , narrow structures facing directly upon the street ; often they occupied both sides of a street of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ porticos of square monolithic piers carrying equally plain architraves . Behind the portico is a building , also of two stories , composed of a series of small rooms which were undoubtedly storerooms in the ground story and living-apartments above . The arrangement was not unlike that of the colonnades of the Greek market-places , and , indeed , they seem to have been called stow , as we learn from an inscription upon one of them . We may then suppose that the lower story of the porticos was employed for the display of merchandise in the daytime and that the goods were removed to the store-rooms at night . found within the limits of the cities and towns . One of the most imposing , perhaps , of all these monuments of the past is a Roman military road , built undoubtedly in the reign of the Emperor Trajan , which may be traced eastward from the region of Antioch , around the northern end of the Djebel it Ada and the Djebel Barisha , and across the southern part of the Djebel Halakah . It first appears in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rock , and where a Greek inscription carved in the side of the cutting high above the roadway gives us the name of one of the Antonine emperors , having been carved about a hundred years after the road was built . Farther along the road disappears beneath the soil of the plain of Sermeda , which seems to have risen as the hills became bare ; but it appears again in the hills to the south , where it ascends the slope in almost unbroken completeness , one of the most perfect monuments of Roman engineering that have been preserved to us , a highway twenty feet wide , built of huge blocks of limestone , many of them four feet square and four feet thick , joined with perfect accuracy , and still so smooth that horses stand with difficulty upon it ; for the ancient transverse grooves have been worn away by the tramp of myriads of camels . Not all the interesting remnants of this ancient civilization , however , are to be At one side of the plain , not far from the opening of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arch which  | spans the way like a triumphal bow . Stripped of its ornaments and broken at its ends , it still stands in gray solemnity , trying to tell us of some forgotten victory . For more than fifteen hundred years it has watched the tide between the East and the West . In its early history it stood above one of the main channels between Orient and Occident . Countless armies it has seen : armies exultant with hope , pressing toward the riches of the East ; armies jubilant with victory , loaded down with spoil ; armies dejected and depleted , returning disgraced to a thankless mistress . What worlds of wealth have passed beneath its broad expanse ! For , during many centuries , one of the main currents of the commerce of the East passed within the compass of its piers . Our expedition happened to be encamped at a ruin called Babiska when Easter ( lay came . It seemed like Easter , too , for the ground among the ruins was strewn with tulips and narcissus . Our tents were pitched between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we should observe the day with proper services . When our people had all assembled , sitting in semicircles about the door of our largest tent , ? a motley congregation of Mohammedans , Druses , and Christians ( Orthodox Greeks , Greek Catholics , and Protestants ) , all of our servants , in fact , except two Roman Catholics who kept discreetly in their tents , ? it seemed quite like the apostolic age , so diverse were our tenets ; and when Dr. Post , gray-bearded and erect , began , in clear tones , to read , " In the end of the sabbath , as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week , came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre , " I could not but reflect that this was undoubtedly the first time in thirteen centuries that those familiar words had resounded about the walls of these early abodes of Christianity , and that the Greek language , in which those words had last been repeated here , was now exchanged , first for Arabic and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as could well be imagined . Looking westward toward the mountains from the ruins of Babiska , one may see a solitary building of severe and stately lines , perched upon a sharp spur just below the summit of the Kubbit Babutta , like a sentinel above a ruined city . ? ' This ruin is the temple of Burdj Bakirha . The site is well worthy of a visit , both for the sake of the temple and for the magnificent view that may be had from this " high place " of the ancient Syrians . Where else in the world could we find a vievy to match this scene of desolation and death ? And this is only a small part of the region of deserted cities in northern central Syria : ten ancient towns , the greater number of them of considerable extent , abandoned and in ruins , with no evidence that they have been inhabited since the beginning of the seventh century ! This desolation was not the work of any great physical catastrophe such as that which destroyed the cities beside the Bay of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirely by invasion , war , and pillage , for conquerors seldom destroy a country , but take it for their own gain . What , then , can have wrought the change by which a wealthy , populous , and necessarily fertile land was transformed into a rocky wilderness strewn with the remnants of once thriving cities ? I believe this to have been due primarily to the cutting of trees . There is every evidence that , for five centuries at least , the inhabitants of these hills drew heavily upon the forests of the region . Every building , large and small , had a wooden roof and intermediate floors of wood , besides doors , shutters , sheds , and other details which must have been of the same material . Such a lavish use of the product of the forest would indicate the presence of extensive woodlands in the immediate vicinity ; for importation of materials into these rough mountain districts would have been both difficult and costly . We may believe , then , that the mountainsides were once clothed with forests , which means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are many other evidences that there was plenty of soil covering the bare ribs of the earth that are now exposed . Wine- and olive-presses may be counted by the hundreds in places where there is not sufficient soil to support a single vine or olive-tree , and there are slopes that were terraced up with a succession of walls ; but the walls have fallen down , and there is no remnant of earth behind them . The desolation , then , we may presume , is the result of the gradual washing away of the soil from the hills , caused primarily by the cutting of the forests . For a time the inhabitants saved their country by the  | judicious building of terraces for their vineyards and orchards . Then came the invasions , first , of the Persians who destroyed Antioch in 538 , then of the Mohammedans , in the train of the prophet , in 632 , and the consequent poverty which made it impossible for the people to keep their terrace walls in repair . After this the work of destruction was rapid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hills to the gray bareness of their limestone frames , while a continuous series of earthquakes has wrecked the buildings of antiquity , leaving only here and there a wellpreserved example of their former splendor . No one who looks at these pictures of the Syrian hills can fail to see in them an object-lesson for our day and generation . @#
