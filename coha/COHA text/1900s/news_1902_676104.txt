txt Ex-Chief of Police William G. Devery made his formal debut as an anti-Croker Tammany Hall politician last night . He also delivered an address which the habitues of the Devery Four Corners and Dem- 1 ocrats of the Ninth District characterized as a " corker . " Mr. Devery and his friends were in almost absolute possession of Eighth Avenue from Twenty-ninth to Twenty-third Street . and as the day passed into night traffic on Twenty-eighth and Twenty-ninth Streets and Eighth Avenue was often at a standstill . The er-Chief of Police reached the city at an early hour and spent much time and considerable money in " affiliating " with the voters . Incidentally , he coined another phrase , which was considered by his admirers as worthy of ranking with his " touchin ' on and appertainin ? to . " His latest is : " Politics is hereditary . " One of the first resorts he visited was the Utah House , generally recognized as the hangout of the idlers of the Pequod Club , the John C. Sheehan organization . There he found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the bar , and his invitation was accepted . Many other resorts did Mr. Devery visit , and act in a similar way . Coining out of the Utah House . Mr. Devery was interviewed concerning his plan of campaign . He said : " I do n't intend to make a practice cL making speeches . This Is an enlightened community , and the people read the newspapers . Now , to my way of thinking poll tics is hereditary . A man 's a Democrat because his father is one , but sometimes he forgets it . There ai n't no use to quarrel over differences of opinion , and speechmaking do n't convert anybody " I 'm glad to see Senator Platt has begun to get a few bets down . It 's a nice sport for the old gentleman . It must be a relief to him to go to the races instead of sitting on a hotel porch and have a man talk an arm off him . " It 's a hot day , ai n't it , but it will get to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Twenty-eig-htn to Twenty-third Street . I 'm going to warm things up so that they 'll know I 'm here from this out . " OPEN AIR RECEPTION . Before sundown a brass band took possession of " The Pump " corner , Twentyeighth Street and Eighth Avenue , and soon - that locality was densely thronged . ExChief Devery stood on the sidewalk bareheaded and mopping his brow . In the roadway were two Wagons loaded with full beer kegs , another had a supply of pyrotechnics that must have cost several hundred dollars . while in " The Pump " before the bar were cases upon cases of wine , liquors , and " soft " drinks , to say nothing of cigars Amid the explosion of fireworks and the tooting of the band Mr. Dever ! : was besieged with visitors , who were introduced with such remarks as " He 's been with Goodwin , but he 's v.-id you now : ' " Here are some of Sheehan 's followers , and they are going to support you . " " Now I 'm going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and I want youse fellows to come with us to No. 2G4 , the new headquarters of the Four Corners Club , " Then in answer to a question he said : " Yes , I hear ' Tim Sullivan is agin me . I like ' Tim . ' But if he has money to spend here let him come over . If he has not the time I 'll send over a committee of two to get it . But I guess we can take care of the west side without any help from Sullivan . weeping man are prominent . " That elephant there is the G. 0 . P. , " he remarked , " and that blubberer is ' Tom Smith . I 'll make them both sick " Meanwhile the fireworks were being discharged at a lively rate , and the bartenders in " The Pump ' worked as they never worked before . About S:45 line was formed and Devery and his followers , headed by the band , marched . down Eighth Avenue to near Twenty-third Street , the scene of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 264 was reached the upper floor was crowded to suffocation in less time than it takes to tell it . Yet room was made for the Chief , and as he reached the table he shouted , " Hats off ! " " Three cheers for our leader ! " - was the lusty response . Mr. Devery , who was banked on either aide with bottles of birch beer and lemon soda as large as Indian clubs , arose . Silence Yell at once on the room , but on the street there was a din from the fireworks and the band . These ceased on orders from the ex-Chief. who then said : " Gentlemen and Fellow-Citizens : The Four Corners Club has removed from Twenty-eighth Street and Eighth Avenue , and we propose to make this our headquarters for the campaign . And we 're going to stay right here . We go into this contest as amateurs belonging to the Tammany Hall organization . but anti-Croker . Cheers . ) Now , we 've got to do Mr. Goodwin . He wants to he the leader and thinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all know what this contest means . You know Mr. Goodwin . What has he done for the Democrats in this district ? Nuthing . He has led many of you a chase , a Tom Collins chase from pillar to post Shouts of " Thrue for you , " and " That 's right , Billy . " He has lied to me. he has lied to you , and he has lied to men of standing . No man of Goodwin 's stamp ought to lead anybody ill this district . " Now , there 's another man  --  John C. Sheehan . Hisses. lie 's a very good man , but what has he done for you ? He won a battle last Fall . but what has he done for the Young men of the Pequod Club ? Nearly all of them are idle . r " Lucky to get 20 cents for a meal . " shouted some en ... 1 He 's been in office six months . and has had many opportunities to find employment for laborers , teamsters , and workingmen . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done nothing . " He has with him a young man named Dowling , a fine young fellow . Cries of " That 's right . " He 's got nothing . He ought to leave them and come down with us . Has Sheehan given anybody employment ? Again I say no . What did he do on his contracts on Long Island , Second Avenue , and the bridge ? He put all Italians to work . " Now , I 'm here as an amateur . I 'm with the young men . I 'm always with the under dog . I 'm with you , and if you ca n't get those in power to hand out anything , why . I 'll pry in and try and get it for you . " Now , you 're fighting for me. and I 'm fighting for you . I want to see some young fellow leader in this district . We do n't want no college-bred man . We 've to go along the docks , in the foundries and tenements to get our votes , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We must put an end to the political careers of Goodwin and Sheehan now and forever . But if we are to win , you must put your shoulders to the wheel and hustle . MRS . DEVERY 'S OPINION . " I said to my missus this morning : ' I 'm going to have a lot of fun to-night . Lend me a two spot . ' ' You 're getting too much of a sport , ' said she . I told her ' No , ' and she said : ' Go way back and sit down . you 're getting to be a joke . ' " Now , boys , I want to tell you something . Instead of going down among the I lumber piles in Ninth , Tenth , and Eleventh Avenues sparking your girls ? no , cut that out  --  get out and work . I 'll go along the avenues once in a while . A brass band will give you notice of my coming , and I 'll give your girls a chance to ' spiel ' for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to I invite your mothers , wives , sisters , and I sweethearts to the outing of the W. S. Devery Association , due notice of which will be given in the press . We 'll also give I the kids an outing . What we intend to do is to have a little pleasure in this fight . ? *I see in one of the afternoon papers something about Tim Sullivan helping in the fight against us . Now , ' Dry Dollar ' belongs on the east side , Bill Devery and you belong here . I love Tim as a brother , but his place in politics is on the Bowery . " Now , boys , there are two men here . Goodwin and Sheehan , who will give you a Jolly , but wo n't give you a loaf of bread . Put your shoulders to the wheel and we 'll drive both of them out for all time . " Now go down stairs and take a drink or a cigar with me . There 's plenty of both . " There was no great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends surrounded him and shouted their congratulations . Mr. Devery went to Far Rockaway at 10 o'clock , but will be back in the city early to-day .
