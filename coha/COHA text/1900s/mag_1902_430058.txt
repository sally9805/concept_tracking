THERE can be no doubt that to compose a dedication is one of the primitive instincts of scribbling man . The most retiring of authors hopes that he may have one reader , and it is strange if he does not determine in his own mind who that reader is to be . If the exiled Adam completed his memoirs ? " Eden : a Reminiscence " ? depend upon it he dedicated them " To One who shared my raptures and my regrets . " Without the anticipation of Eve 's sympathy , literature would have been to our first father a wilderness of monkeys . The sympathizer must have preceded the patron , who is really the growth of an elaborate civilization . I take , therefore , a view of the origin of dedications diametrically opposed to that of the usual cynic , who believes that no one dedicated a book to any one else until it had occurred to him that he might put something into his pocket by doing so . Let us rather believe that it was the amiable and absorbing desire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person , as soon as possible after he has completed the exercise of writing , which led to this pleasant and almost universal practice . To write on the history of the literary dedication is to thread a trackless forest . At all events , I am not aware , and am not able to discover , that it has yet attracted a chronicler . The fact is that it is a subject extremely difficult to treat in a consecutive manner , for it shows very little development or progress . It is not a growth ; it is merely a collection of hundreds of thousands of instances . The modes in which a dedicatee can be approached are not numerous , and the changes were exhausted at an early period of literary history . That they were largely instinctive is proved by the fact that they occur in all the known literatures , in more or less identical form . The earliest written book which has come down to us in any Turanian tongue , the Kojiki , which was completed in the year 712 , is dedicated to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three volumes , which I reverently and respectfully present . I , Yasumaro , with true trembling and true fear , bow my head , bow my head . " I shall not attempt , however , in these brief pages , to cover more than one small section of the immense field which might be cultivated by a historian of the Literary Dedication . I shall endeavor to resume a few personal observations on the practice as it was employed in the Elizabethan age in England . At no time , and in no community , has the dedication of books been carried to a greater extravagance than it was at the close of the sixteenth and the beginning of the seventeenth century in England . This was a natural symptom of the extraordinary impetus given to literary art , to intellectual movement of every description , towards the middle of the reign of Elizabeth . So universal did the practice become that it grew to be rather disreputable not to provide a dedication  | to a book , or even to a pamphlet . Such an omission looked as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had written , or else was in so abandoned a social state that he could think of no one whom he might venture to address . This last difficulty , however , was not insuperable . We find that the names of great people were sometimes attached to books first , and their leaves asked afterwards . But this was not considered gentlemanlike ; it is frowned upon as a piece of had manners by the satirists . The usual mode was to find some man of high social position ? if possible a lord ? who would accept the dedication as a gift . It has been too much taken for granted that the patron was expected , if he accepted the book , to make an immediate present of money to the author . I have come to the conclusion that , although no doubt this was sometimes done , it was not the custom in the Elizabethan age , as it became later , in that of Anne . The dedication was , I believe , more often offered as a form of thanks for services rendered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Licia " in 1593 to Lady Molyneux , distinctly says it is in return for favors showered upon him by her husband , Sir Richard . Certain great lords were specially popular as dedicatees , and in particular Robert Devereux , Earl of Essex , that Absalom of his age , posed as the protector of poets , and , in return for a variety of services which we can now with difficulty define , accepted their grateful dedications . Scholars , we are told , flocked under the boughs of Essex , whom a poet of 1595 , in a glowing dedication , calls " England 's cedar , sprung up to preserve the humblest in all professions with your shadow . " Pembroke held a similar position . It was to him , of course , that , as some suppose , Shakspere 's Sonnets were mysteriously dedicated , and he shares with his brother Montgomery the glory of " protecting " the First Folio of 1623 . Ben Jonson said in praise of Pembroke that he had " led forth so many good and great names to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Esme Stuart , Lord Aubigne . In all such cases the desire of the dedicating poet was for protection , not for money . This is put very clearly by Raynolds , when , in dedicating his " Dolarny 's Primrose " in 1606 to Lord Aubigne , he says : " I seek not Ascanius ' rich cloak for bravery , but covet to be sheltered from the vulture 's tyranny . " In days when the courts were liable at any moment to swoop down upon an author , to have secured a powerful patron was of the highest importance . It might , however , become embarrassing after the fall of that patron , and so we find Robert Pricket , in 1604 , desiring to publish a poem about " the late Honourable and still Honoured Earl of Essex , " afraid to do so until he has secured the " love 's protection " of the Earls of Southampton and Devonshire and of Lord de Gray . If direct evidence is needed , it is to be found in Henry Crosse 's dedication of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mayor of London , in which he says , " the custom of this age is that such as write books do use to dedicate them to some worthy person or other , under whose protection they might pass with more safety from the biting of their enemies . " No doubt in all oligarchical communities , such as England was at the close of the sixteenth century , such protection was necessary to literature . My learned friend Mr. W. G. Aston tells me that in the Yeddo Period in Japanese history the Maecenas was prominent , and that numbers of books were dedicated to the Shoguns or Daimios who patronized literatures , exactly as to private noblemen in England under Elizabeth and James . But it was not humble and timid authors only who dedicated . People of importance were apt to display false humility in a sort of obsequiously familiar address to royalty . The extravagance of language in these courtly effusions often approached , or even crossed , the limits of the grotesque . That fine Scottish gentleman , the Laird of Rosecraig , saw fit to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Queen Anne of Denmark , in 1606 , in such terms as these : " Happy beyond the measure of my merit shall I be if I can purchase this portion of your princely approbation as to accept and entertain these trivial toys , where your Grace shall smell flowers to refresh , herbs to cure , and weeds to be avoided , in the lowest degree of least favour . But ,  | howsoever , wishing your Highness as many happy years as there be words in my verses " ( this would be to doom the Queen to live at least 20,000 years ) " and verses in my worthless volume , I am Your Majesty 's most obsequious orator , Alexander Craig . " It was very often to a great lady that the dedication was addressed . Nicholas Breton , who throws an unusual amount of light on the dedication by the immense number of his publications , and by the ingenuity with which he varies his compliments , dedicates his books over and over again to Sir Philip Sidney 's famous sister , the Countess of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into her service at a moment when his fortunes were in very low water , for he says , in the words he prefixes to his " Pilgrimage to Paradise " in 1592 , " your poor unworthy poet had utterly perished had not the hand of your Honour revived the heart of humility . " Later on it is possible to trace in Breton 's dedications a record of having , by his own fault , for- feited , and by her grace regained , his patroness 's favor . All through , it must be confessed , the attitude of this worthy poet to his protectors is that of a timid dependent . As a rule , however , the early dedications addressed to ladies form pleasanter reading than those to lords , the tributes seeming less obsequious . When Hobert Toft , in 1598 , dedicates his poem of " Alba " to Sir Calisthenes Brooke , and compliments that worthy soldier on his " lovely face , " we blush for him . A year earlier the same poet , in presenting his " Laura " to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most resolute staidness and the resolved courage of a true Percy . " The lady is praised for her " heroical and undaunted courage , " and the gentleman for his " lovely face . " This was very Elizabethan , and Robert Toft a true son of his age . It was rarely that a poet presented his work to a great man of letters . The only exception I remember is that of William Smith , who , in 1596 , dedicated his " Chloris " to Edmund Spenser in a brace of generous sonnets . It is true that Dickenson addressed his " Arisbas " in 1594 to Sir Edward Dyer , and Daniel his " Musophilus " in 1602 to Sir Fulke Greville , but in each case it was rather to the nobleman than to the poet . Men of quality , such as William Percy and Richard Carew , did not dedicate at all ; this was the little polite distinction of their birth . Ben Jonson was almost alone in the dignity of his dedications . He presented his Every Man in his Humour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IIe disdained the patron , and many of his books are not dedicated to particular persons at all . Plays , indeed , it was not the fashion to dedicate ; to do so seems to have been thought a little pretentious , although of course there are numerous ex- ceptions to the rule . There are interesting examples of books addressed to the public at large , in defiance of the patron . For this there was generally a reason to be found : the author was dangerous , or the book liable to scandal . A curious instance of this is to be found in the case of Peter Woodhouse , who dedicated his poem of " The Elephant and the Flea , " in 1605 , " to the giddy Multitude . " Woodhouse , not having been able to find any one who will accept his satire , and admitting that " in these our days every pamphlet must have his patron , or the fat is in the fire , " presents it cynically to that " many-headed beast , " the general public . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dedicated his volume " to all the constant Ladies and Gentlemen that fear God . " It became very difficult , when nothing must be said that was particular or private , to say anything fresh at all ; and the Elizabethan dedication is apt to be both stale and preposterous . There is , therefore , a refreshing note in the poems of Matthew Grove ( 1587 ) , when , in a dedication to Lord Compton , ? including a direct appeal for money for himself , ? the publisher , Richard Smith , confesses that he stole the MS. some four years previously from " some pail in scullery or kitchen , " into which it had accidentally fallen . But dedicators were rarely so frank as this . Preceding the " Diaphantus " of Anthony Scoloker , in 1604 , there is a burlesque dedication " to the mighty , learned , and ancient potentate , Quisquis , " showing that this author at least was not blind to the absurdity of the universal convention . In this parody , by-the-way , is to be found a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The actor Robert Arnim boldly began by dedicating his curious volume of doggerel verse , called The Italian Tailor and his Boy , in 1609 , " to the Reader here and there , " applauding " so Noble a Patron , " but then lost heart , and called in the Viscount and Viscountess Haddington to his protection in the usual way . The close of his dedication to the Lady is perfectly typical of the age : " And so wishing as much joy to your right well affected Viscount and you , from the King of Heaven , as I know you are possessed of from the King of Earth ( i. e. , James I. ) , I leave your honours both to Him that is , and ever shall be , yours and our Redeemer . Your Honours ' in all humbleness , Robert Arnim . " In his wild tract called Lanthorn and Candlelight , published in 1609 , Dekker gives an extraordinary account of a fraudulent trade in dedications , which he says had at that time become general . The person who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his assistant was known as the " mongrel . " The trick is to  | travel round the country with samples of a forth-coming book , to which an epistle dedicatory is prefixed , but with no name , the dedication being printed on a separate and loose sheet , of which the falconer carries a large store of copies ; on arriving at the mansion of some local magnate , the mongrel , who carries a hand-press , fills in the name of the particular nobleman , and the book is presented to him as dedicated to him alone . Having got all they can out of this " knight or gentleman of worth , " they proceed to another district and begin  | again . Dekker is very angry , in verse as well as in prose , with these scoundrels , " who , " he declares , " travel up and down most shires in England , and live by this hawking . " Ordinary authors were satisfied with one patron to each book . But there are several prominent examples of a multiplicity of patronage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " 1590 , was presented to Queen Elizabeth in what is perhaps the most superb dedication existing . But the poem is also protected by an epistle in prose to Sir Walter Raleigh , and some copies contain , in addition , as many as seventeen sonnets of dedication to people like the Lord Chancellor , the Lord High Chamberlain , the Great Master of the Horse , the Lord High Admiral , - and other personages of influence and renown at the court of Elizabeth . Sylvester 's translation of the sacred poems of Du Bartas , which was one of the most popular books of the age , was also most profusely and redundant ly dedicated . Chapman convened , like Spenser , seventeen noble lords and ladies to gather round the publication of his completed translation of the Iliad and the Odyssey in 1616 , and he showed a marvellous ingenuity in altering his form of address each time . What patroness could resist a suppliant poet who offered her his book as " To the Happy Star discovered in our Sydreian Asterism , Comfort of Learning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Dedications to the sovereign were frequent under the reigns of Elizabeth and James , but these offer few points of interest . In the ease of an ordinary patron , it is evident that some reciprocity was expected ? a place in the household , a purse of gold , or at least a continuation of personal protection . But from the King no such private favors could reasonably be expected , unless the poet had already secured a post of some kind at court . Hence even when he dares , in language more obsequious and more conventional than usual , to lay his poor book at the feet of Majesty , he adds a dedication to some lord or gentleman of less august pre-eminence , from whom he may reasonably expect a return of practical recognition . Thus Samuel Daniel , the Laureate , dedicated his History of England , as in duty bound , to the Queen , but in a separate and more moving address to Lord Rochester . There was yet another form of dedication , which would to-day be thought highly improper , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little hazardous . This was nothing less than the presentation of a book to the Deity Himself . I have not been able to trace an example of this in English earlier than 1612 , when King James I. , in his plunge into the Arminian Controversy , dedicated his Declaration against Vorstius " To the Honor of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ , the Eternal Son of the Eternal Father . " The whole notion of a dedication in those days was a presentment of the book to one in a more exalted position than the writer , and doubtless , in his pride as Christian King and Defender of the Faith , James I. considered that he must mount to heaven itself to discover a possible patron . But he had set the fashion in what soon became a seventeenth-century trick , by no means confined to princes . It will be remembered that in 1683 the spurious Second Part of the Pilgrim 's Progress was inscribed " to Him that is Higher than the Highest . " And William Streat , in 1654 , had dedicated his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " To God . " The eccentric Robert Fludd addressed a volume both to the Creator and to James I. , which led , through a slip in Fludd 's Latin , to his being accused of having attributed deity to the earthly monarch . These were dangerous forms of address , and by no means to be recommended to the unwary . Of the most curious and interesting of these , the dedication of his fine poem of " Psyche " by Dr. Joseph Beaumont , we give a reproduction in refined fec-simile . The peculiar conventionalities of address of which we have been speaking were modified by the Civil Wars , but more , one can not doubt , by the increased facilities of the printing-press . When it was no longer necessary to creep into publicity under the protecting shadow of some nobleman , dedications grew to be less universal , and more familiar and sincere . They became matters in which personal temperament dictated . Thus  | Cowley , although sprung from the lower middle class , dedicates his successive volumes to his friends or to Trinity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that his precocious school-boy verses , the Poetical Blossoms , of 1633 , are presented , very properly , to the Headmaster of Westminster School . The old Elizabethan , whose dedications tell his noble patron that he asks.nothing , but " leaves to your honourable discretion the liking of my soul 's labour , and commandment of my heart 's love , " gave way to a more independent English citizen . Ilenry More , in 1642 , " a novice in the affairs of the world , " broke new ground by presenting his " Platonic Song of the Soul " to his own father ; in this dedication , a charming outburst of cordial affection , he attributes his love of poetry to his father 's " having from my childhood turned mine ears to Spenser 's rhymes , entertaining us on winter nights with that incomparable piece of his , The Faery Queen , ' a Poem as richly fraught with divine morality as fancy . " Even when the formal address to a person of fashion was retained , it was apt to take a shape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thus Waller , dedicating his Poems of 1645 to Lady Sophia Bertie , says that if he paid her the usual extravagant compliments , people would " believe that I endeavored the character of a perfect nymph , worshipped an image of my own making , and dedicated this to the Lady of the brain , not of the heart , of your Ladyship 's most humble servant , E. W. " Still , if you desired to be preposterous , there was no one in 1640 to reprove you , and the dedications of Francis Quarles , prefixed to his various poetical collections , beggar belief by their grovelling servility . The light thrown by the old dedications upon the struggles , the terrors , and the consolations of men of letters in England is very important and interesting , and it is surprising that the historians of our literatures have so generally neglected it . During the last fifteen years of Elizabeth 's reign poetry and drama flourished like tropical vegetation in a hothouse , but always in conditions which proved these arts to be exotic , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people at large . There was a growing feeling in favor of toleration , moral , social , and religious , but it was timid still , and effectual only within the sphere of influence of certain broadminded and genial noble houses , who kept up a semblance of feudal state . It was under the shelter of the little Italianated courts of the Essexes and the Pembrokes , the Aubignes and the Montgomerys , that poetry flourished , in antagonism to the ruling and growing Puritan prejudice of the English middle classes . This is an aspect of the literary history of the period which we are too apt to overlook , and it is one which the study of Elizabethan and Jacobean dedications brings closely home to us.  |
