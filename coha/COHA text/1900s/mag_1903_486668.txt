From Washington , " on high authority " comes the intimation that the Panama muddle is to be settled this way : the United States will pay to the Republic of Panama the $10,000,000 fixed as the price of the canal strip by the Hay-Herran. treaty ; the bantling republic will then turn over the millions to Colombia as the price of undisturbed independence . As a corollary to the scheme , it appears that we are to take from the Republic of Panama whatever we choose . Against the beautiful simplicity of the plan it might be urged , first , that since $10,000 , - 000 seemed an insufficient consideration for ceding control of that canal strip , it is an insultingly low figure for the loss of the entire Isthmus ; next , that the pains of receiving the bonus and conveying it as a solatium to Colombia would be more cruel than any the Panamanians ever suffered under the tyranny of Bogota ; finally , that we really need not pay anything for the canal. ? The French company has rights that we must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Panama go ? Why give Little Ameridans a chance to say that we are paying " conscience money " ? So our full-blooded expansionists will reason . It would be better to employ the typographical device so engagingly advocated by the Sun , and read the $10,000,000 entirely out of the treaty . Thus  --  for $10,000,000 read $00,000,000 . We are glad to see the Tribune pitching into President Marroquin for his ignorance . You can not be too severe upon a man you have robbed , when he shows that he does not even know how to demand his money back . The idea of such an international faux pas as a direct appeal to the American Senate by the President of a foreign country ! It is enough to make the blood of a trained diplomat run cold  --  or , at any . rate , colder . Really , it is difficult to be patient with Marroquin . Has he never been cheated before , that he should display such ignorance of his remedy ? He ought to have known that no American could pardon so gross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back his property to a President who betrayed some knowledge of good usage , but to a blundering boor like Marroquin ? never ! Foreigners must be made to understand that this polite nation will make no restitution to violators of good form . A charitable plea might , however , be made for the irregularity of Colombia 's appeal to our Senate direct . President Marroquin had probably been reading Senator Lodge 's article on the Senate . He there learned that all the wisdom and goodness of the United States were massed in the Senate ; that Senators really ran this Government ; that they made the President do their will in every respect , and , particularly , allowed him to have nothing to do with treaties . What wonder , then , that the untutored Colombian Executive went straight to headquarters ? To show how scrupulously correct was our own conduct throughout , we need to read only the telegrams laid before Congress . Why , we did not recognize the revolution a minute before it occurred ! In our supreme desire to follow the right course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Panama on November 3 to find out if there was a revolution for us to recognize . He promptly replied that there was none yet , but hoped there would be in the course of the night . So , with great forbearance , our Government waited  --  with some impatience , it is true , but still it waited . Then note also how absolutely proper we were in paying no attention to- Colombia 's protest against our shearing off her best province . That protest did not arrive in Washington , Secretary Hay carefully observes , until two hours and fifteen minutes after we had recognized the independence of Panama . Of course , it was then too late to do anything . Justice might have required us to act , but think of the bad form ! Seriously , the official dispatches sent in to Congress , meagre as they are , and far from telling the whole story as they are , make it certain that our Government knew all about the Panama revolution in advance , and had arranged to give aid and comfort to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Admiral Glaze on November 2 , two days before the revolution , " Prevent landing of any armed force , either Government or insurgent , with hostile intent , at any point within fifty miles of Panama " ? There could not be a plainer guarantee to the rebels of immunity from attack by Colombian troops . Dr. Albert Shaw , the editor of the Review of Reviews , is one of the closest personal friends of Theodore Roosevelt , and a frequent visitor both at the White House and at Oyster Bay . Hence peculiar interest attaches to his utterances in the current number of the Review , upon the Panama situation . The article was obviously written long before the recent developments in the Isthmus . Its , comments are very striking for their accurate forecast of what- was likely to happen at Panama . The shadows of thecoming events are here cast before so clearly as to entitle Dr. Shaw to front rank among astrologists  --  provided , always , that the future had not already been revealed to him either at Washington or elsewhere . Thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the event of an uprising at Panama , " our Government will no longer follow the plan of holding the situation for the benefit of the Colombian Government . " It was also quite plain to Dr. Shaw that if Panama , in revolt , should " appeal to the United States for friendship and protection , " she would " not be treated with disdain . " Dr. Shaw further averred that Secretary Hay would not pay less to the new republic than to Colombia for a canal , and that he would not permit such a new republic " to assert over our canal strip any absurd pretensions of sovereignty . " Along the canal itself " the United States Government would be at liberty in its own way to administer justice , protect the public health , and do whatever it might find necessary in its capacity as a Government " Senator Hoar intimates that the Evening Post should be ashamed of itself for attacking the Government " in foreign affairs . " It ought to wait , the Senator insists , until it had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to show what was the real " purpose of the Administration . " But , really , it is only following the example of ? Senator Hoar himself . On December 6 , 1893 , he rose in the Senate to ask for information about Hawaii . That was an admission that he had not the " facts " before him , but did it deter him from attacking the Government ? Not at all . He went on roundly to assert that the President was about to " commit an act of war against a friendly Power . " So horrible a thing did that seem to him that he called for " a swift and indignant remonstrance of the American people , " of a kind to make itself " heard by Executive ears , however dull they may seem to be . " Surely , in that there is warrant enough for the Evening Post , from the very master of precedents and the flower of courtesy . The fact that President Cleveland was proposing to do an act of simple justice could not have so angered Senator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any rate , it does not lie in his mouth to rebuke those who speak out when the President is guilty , in the Senator 's own words , of " an act of war against a friendly Power . " , M. Bunau-Varilla had already , in his letter to Senator Morgan , shown him , . self such a - charming example of the diplomat of the new school that his venture into newspaper correspondence is like painting the lily . His cable dispatch to the Paris Mahn is , so far as reported back to America , one of ? hose inimitable combinations of sentiment and stock-jobbing which makes us regret the loss of a single word . He feels that the French recognition of Panania is proof that France appreciates the " elevated and noble scruples which have always governed America " in regard to French interests . Generous Americans , he says , gladly recall the services of France in the war of Independence , and also her magnanimity in offering us " for a nominal price ' the empire of Louisiana , " This fresh view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delicate consideration of the United States is ample proof of M. Bunau-Varilla 's skill in his new field of activity . But his burst of compliment rises to a climax when he assures the readers of the Hahn that if " only a part of the capital invested " in the Panama Canal is ' saved , there would be " compensation for the balance in the closer friendship between the United States and France . " Here we have a toast that beats the old one hollow . It is : ' Money is thicker than water . " The usual fatuous citation of foreign approval , when the United States undertakes a course questionable in morals and perilous in policy , is now made in connection with the movement to annex Panama . France likes it , Germany has no quarrel with it , England gives silent consent  --  therefore it must be wise and good . We know how swiftly that argument is reversed on occasion . The fact that other nations desire us not to do a given thing has been many times a powerful reason for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is unconcealed Europe has long wanted the United States to take direct charge of the Unruly peoples of Central and South America . - We have warned foreigners to keep their hands off , yet have refused to keep the turbulent and revolution-ridden republics in order . The result has been no end of vexation for European nations . Their debts have been refused payment ; their trade embarrassed . If we would only hold ourselves responsible for the foreign obligations of the South Americans , and make smooth the way of European trade with them , our commercial rivals would be delighted . No wonder , then , that they hail every step which promises to embarrass us and aid them . As for the break-up of Columbia and her consequent inability to pay the interest on her-foreign loans , it is obvious that we are , in that regard , laying ourselves open to troublesome reclamations . If the Republican party were not possessed of a mind conscious of its own rectitude , Monday would have been a trying day for it in the House . The be ginning of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an attempt on the part of the Democrats to make a virtuous action wear an unattractive appearance . The latter played their cards very well , and the honors of the first day 's discussion rest easily with them . The determination of the Republicans to railroad the bill through the House by shutting off all amendments gave their opponents a chance to impugn their motives . Although the bill was defended by the Republicans on the ground that " the national honor required it , " the new Democratic leader was quick to intimate that possibly the national honor had got mixed up with the necessities of the Sugar Trust . The refusal of the Republicans to entertain an amendment abolishing the differential on the refined , brought into play against the party that most deadly of all weapons . humor . The change of heart of those sixty-one Republicans who in the last Congress joined with the " solid Democratic phalanx in defiance of the Sugar Trust , " was most effectively used While questioning the sincerity of the Republicans , the Opposition hastened to support the pending bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it " a thoroughly Democratic proposition . " The Republicans were thus represented as parading ' in borrowed clothes . According to the Tribune 's Washington dispatches , familiar but very weak arguments are to be advanced in favor of Gen. Leonard Wood 's confirmation as major-general . Thus , we are told that the President had to promote him because he was the senior brigadier-general , and also because not to have done so would have been a discourtesy to the memory of President McKinley , who originally appointed Wood a brigadier-general . Now , if appointments to major-generalcies are to be made not for merit , but out of respect to dead statesmen , this is a valid argument The common belief at the time was , that President McKinley gave Gen. Wood the brigadier-generalcy in order to keep him from accepting the presidency of the District of Columbia street railways at a salary of $25,000 . As far as the argument of seniority is concerned , it is ridiculous enough when one considers that Gen. Wood had just been jumped over 456 other officers , all senior to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only chance to become a major-general , since vacancies in that grade will occur in 1904 , 1906 , 1907 , and also in 1909 , by which time Gen. Wood will undoubtedly be better fitted for the rank than today . Most important of all , promotions from brigadier to major-general have not been governed by seniority under either Mr. McKinley or Mr. Roosevelt . The latter , for instance , in July , 1902 , jumped Brigadier-Generals George W. Davis and John C. Bates over the head of the senior brigadier , James F. Wade , " ivhci had been five years in that rank . PresidentMcKinley had previously passed over Gen. Wade 's head to the rank of major-general Colonels S. B M. Young , A. R. Chaffee , Arthur MacArthur , Robert P. Hughes , and Loyd Wheaton . It was considered perfectly proper for Gen. Wade to take rank under these officers and to wait until this year for his double stars If the Senate committee really wishes to ' ascertain professional opinion about Wood , it should cite army officers . before it and promise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten per cent , cut in wages at Fall River is symptomatic . The abnormally high price of cotton does not really differentiate the textile situation from that of industry in general . The excessive amounts paid by the Steel Trust for its ore lands , its coke ovens , and other properties contributing to its finished product have put it in a similar dilemma . And it was only last week that the president of the American Cotton Oil Company explained a heavy drop in the earnings for the last year on the ground of the extremely high price of cottonseed . The railroads have also been exemplifying this tendency , the increase in. their gross - earnings being in a number of cases more than offset by the higher cost of all their supplies . The cut at Fall River is no surprise to any one acquainted with the industry , for it has been a well understood fact for months past that there could be little profit in manufacturing without an advance in the price of finished products . Granting that the excessive quotations on cotton are due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is still the question of the purchasing power of the community to be considered . A favorite argument with both cotton and wool manufacturers in recent years has been that the public would be forced to buy at any price . This has been shown to be a fallacy this year in the wool manufacturing industry ; and evidently fears are entertained that the doctrine will prove equally ineffective in cotton . The slump in the Chinese demand , occasioned by the high quotations made by our manufacturers , has greatly enlarged the offerings in the home market , where increased economy on the part of final consumers has already begun to be witnessed . Hence it is the inevitable which has occurred . The cost of production must be reduced , and wages , as is usually the case , must suffer first . There can be little doubt that the movement will not be confined to Fall River , but will extend to the other southern New England manufacturing centres , and eventually to the northern New England textile communities  --  that is , to the fine-goods mills . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the operatives take the new situation ? The presumption is that they will recognize its inevitable character and refrain from strikes . The latest phase of the Montana copper-mining situation is most menacing When a judge handed down a decision adverse to the Amalgamated Copper Company , that concern immediately announced the closing down of all its mines , smelters , and other plants in the State , throwing upwards of 12,000 men out of employment . We asked at the time if this action was foi- the purpose of coercing the higher court . It looks now as if the end in view was the coercion of the Governor and the Legislature , and eventually of the judiciary . The labor situation thus created threatened to demoralize the State . The burden of solving the problem was thrown upon the Governor , who received assurances from the Amalgamated people that if he would call an extra session or the Legislature to discuss the desirability of preventing judges with a bias from trying cases which might come before them , work at the mines and smelters would be resumed at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call The position in which he finds himself , even as the executive of so ' notorious a pocket borough as Montana , is extraordinary . He says that , bad as is the present condition of the State , he believes it should continue indefinitely rather than that such a precedent as this should be established . The fact is , he has found himself confronted with what the Roman poet calls the severe necessity of nature , and has been unable to stand up under the shower of petitions which have come to him from taxpayers , labor organizations , and others The " open shop " is a dangerous subject , as the American Federation of Labor discovered on Thursday . The members saved themselves from disaster by recommitting some wild resolutions which , apropos of President Roosevelt 's decision in the Miller case , declared that " this open-shop policy is but a subterfuge and a means of strengthening the non-union and scab-shop position of the union-hating capitalist corporations " ; and that " this applies to the open shop under private management as well as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The President can only be strengthened , not weakened , by such denunciation . He has take his stand squarely on the impregnable law which can recognize in public service no distinctions of color , creed , or social class . Should the Federation be rash enough to set up its dictum as superior to the fundamental principles of this republic , itwould be exactly in the position of a bull fighting an express'train. - One of the absurd pretensions of labor unions has been rebuked by a Canadian court . The city of Toronto called for bids for firemen 's clothing ; and the lowest competitor was the Crown Tailoring Company The contract , however , was awarded at a higher price to a concern using the union label . Thereupon the Crown Tailoring Company obtained an injunction . In rendering a judgment , Chancellor Boyd declared that in issuing its specifications the city could not demand the use of any particular union label , and thus discriminate against certain classes of laborers who might be as capable as those entitled to use the label The true test of ability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This decision simply applies to public contract work the same principle that President Roosevelt laid down in the Miller case in the Government Printing-Office . A private individual tray have on his clothing any label he chooses , and he may pay any price he can afford ; his whims and tastes are matters with him to settle with his conscience and his pocketbook . But the Government , whether Federal , State , or municipal , is bound to treat its citizens without fear or favor . The man who will do the work properly and at the lowest price , with or without union labor , is entitled to the contract . Else the public is robbed to fatten an industrial monopoly . Premier Combes has announced to the French Senate the Government 's intention of pushing the war against the teaching orders The famous Associations Act of 1901 has already driven ninny of the religious orders out of primary instruction ; now the Ministerial programme contemplates the permanent suppression of all secondary and superior schools managed by them . Authorized monks or nuns will be permitted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of many historic colleges , and presumably the sequestration of their properties to the State . M. Combes further declared that the rights of the regular clergy in school matters would be separately considered as a part of the general readjustment of the relations of Church and State . That is a pretty clear intimation that the Government will seriously weigh the abrogation of the Concordat . Having deprived the- orders of the liberties usual in all republican countries except France , and having withheld the stipends given by treaty to the regular clergy , the anticlerical campaign would be complete . It will not be achieved without opposition , for there is an alternate project , with respectable backing , which provides simply for more stringent supervision of peeondary and higher . education . " I have come to the melancholy conclusion that at present the country does not want a fleet nor an army nor public instruction " ? thus Sefior Silvela , the retiring Conservative chief , in his farewell address to the Spanish Cortes . Chamberlain may devote all the strength of his sixty-eight years to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and nights to the Agrarians and to the canal advocates . But not Silvela ! It is net for this grandee to stoop to things of a fiscal nature . " The country , " he declared , " is interested ? only in material reforms , in agriculture , in industry , trade , and public works . It is perhaps right . But I , for my part , in order to remain in office , required that the country should want an army , a fleet , and such a foreign policy as it ought to desire . " Lest any one should be in doubt as to that policy , Sefior Silvela added : " I mean a foreign policy frankly accepted without fear of the risk . To be on equally good terms with every one is not a policy . " No wonder that the Madrid correspondent of the London Times ' spoke of the dramatic interest of this scene . To think that a nation could fall so low as really to want to recoup itself after long years of war and oversea losses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the burdens of army and - navy ? Devoted to the arts of peace ? Engaged in industry ? How sordid , how material , how small ! No wonder Seiler Silvela , broken-hearted , quits politics . The acceptance of the Austro-Russian demands by Turkey and the reappearance of Boris Sarafoff , the Macedonian leader , who had been reported dead , indicate the renewal of the Balkan rising in the spring . For the Turks will do nothing , and Sarafoff is one of the three great revolutionary chieftains . At ' the moment of formal acceptance , the Parte is making every effort to render the reforms of no effect . That will be done in a way long traditional at Constantinople . The most distasteful feature of the reforms is the provision for Christian " assessors " ( inspectors ) and officers of the gendarmery . But there is a class of subsidized Christians kept for precisely such exigencies . So long as the Sultan may have their nomination , he need not fear excessive zeal from that quarter . No scheme of reform , the working of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is written on . Austria and Russia , or , better , the European Con- ' cert , must set up an autonomous administration in Macedonia or face the prospect of the insurrection renewing itself with increased bitterness in the spring . The immediate need of the 25,000 refugees is food and clothing . With rifles enough , says that practised observer , Mr. A. G. Hales , of the London Daily News , the Macedonians could win their own independence . Hence the need of intervention during the armistice.
