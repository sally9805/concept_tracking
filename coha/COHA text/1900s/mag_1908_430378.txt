 |p1228  THE publicity given to the " Emanuel Movement " has stirred up the pastors . Some want to study it , some wish to adopt it , and others are anxiously asking concerning the responsibility and opportunity of the modern pastor in regard to it . Among those who ignorantly consider psycho-therapeutics a modern discovery , and among those who think of its connection with the Church as a nineteenth or twentieth century innovation , not a little excitement has been generated , and great things are predicated of this movement in giving the long-sought impetus to the Church of which so many have felt the need . A more deliberate consideration is needed , so that the first wave of enthusiasm will not take us off our feet , and it behooves us to ask the question , Shall psycho-therapeutics be adopted by the Church ? After not a little thought and a longer experience than that furnished by the " Emanuel Movement , " I believe that psycho-therapeutics , as such , will not become a regular part of Church work . All students of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fully ) that there is no doubt about the efficacy of this treatment in functional diseases , principally of a nervous character . This is true regardless of the form in which the suggestion is presented . Relics , shrines , healers , patent medicines , Christian Science , hypnotism , placebos , or a combination of . these have been successful in curing diseases . This is conceded . Further , we deplore the fact that practitioners of psycho-therapeutics are not more widely available in our country , for , in truth , they are much needed . Is it the Church which shall supply the need ? Let one read for himself that most interesting and most valuable book written by directors of the " Emanuel Movement , " entitled " Religion and Medicine . " In the first place , he will notice that the title is a misnomer ; in order to be descriptive it should be something like ' Psycho-therapeutics and Religion as an Aid . " Less than one hundred pages out of more than four hundred are concerned with religion at all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the book is augmented by this fact , for the non-religious parts are by far the stronger . In the second place , one can see that , in order to have a pastor carry out the work as there suggested , special preparation is needed . Not every town has an alienist , and there are not sufficient in the city to supply the need . Not every church finds it easy to pay its pastor 's salary , and the salary of an alienist added to the staff would be a burden which few churches could undertake , for we can not assume that for long or in many cases neurologists can afford to serve without remuneration . The work , of course , will fall on the pastor , so , as soon as he completes his seminary course , he must take four years in the medical school , two years in post-graduate study in psychology , and at least one year in clinical  |p1229  work . If this is done , whence will the churches procure the young ministers for whom they are clamoring ? In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pastor embarks on this work in the church , this phase must occupy his whole time , for he will not have time for anything else . To treat a patient psychologically is very different from common medical practice . He can not be dismissed with a few pills at the rate of ten patients an hour , but one hour and in some cases more must be devoted to each patient , so that five or six is the limit in numbers for a day . When some of these have to be treated three or four times a week , from twelve to twenty are all one practitioner can handle in a week , giving all his time to it . The history of the " Emanuel Movement " reveals the fact that it grew out of the Tuberculosis Class conducted by this same Church . If there is to be a mental healing class , which , from the nature of the case , ministers principally to nervous diseases , there is as much demand on the Church for a continuation of the Tuberculosis Class , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Class , the Whooping Cough Class , and so on ad infinitum . To say that the Church should be interested in healing the sick is true ; it should be interested in the cure of all diseases , and not only nervous diseases . It should also be interested in keeping the healthy well . It should also be interested in all forms of education , in eliminating povrty and crime , in the advancement of ommercial and industrial affairs , in the crops , in good roads ? in fact , the Church waking tip to the realization that everything that is , of interest to man is f interest to God , and everything which ministers to the physical , intellectual or moral well-being of man is of vital interest to the Church . The Church has eliminated the distinction between sacred and secular , and recognizes that all things are sacred . The life can not be divided up and a fraction dedicated to God , but all must be given to Him : hence God and His Church are concerned with all human experience . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do all these things directly . It can not . Its work is inspirational , and it delegates to its members ? all its members ? certain factors of general progress , and retains for its direct work the moral and religious development of mankind . This is the dynamic of the inspiration which incites to the proper accomplishment of the world 's work . The factor which it retains as its direct work is so comprehensive that it touches all others . The " Emanuel Movement , " like Christian Science , will not be without its value , for it will stimulate the physicians to take up psycho - therapeutics openly , which heretofore they have not had the courage to do . The physicians have not been ignorant of the value of mental healing , but it has been practised so much by quacks and imposters , and hypnotism has had such a bad name , that any physician who let it be known that he used hypnotism or suggestive treatment of any kind would lose his reputation and his practice . He investigated it so little that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whereas he should know that it simply supplements his drugs . It needs a few brave physicians to step forward , remove the stigma from this branch of therapeutics , and placing it upon a scientific basis , deliver it to the service of mankind . When the physicians do their part , the supplementary work of the clergyman will not be onerous . The really religious part of the treatment , the part which must be demanded of the clergyman , could readily be taught in a course which should be furnished by every theological seminary , and could be provided by him without a too serious tax on his time . The inspiration of religious hope , the trust and faith of prayer , the rectification of morals , and a quiet , peaceful , religious life should be the result of the minister 's work . This would provide the general healthful bodily tone , as well as the mental attitude for specific cures , and there is no real physician who would not welcome this co-operation in his work . Of course , we know that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Athens in being attracted by " some new thing . " Churches will adopt mental healing because they think it is new . Clergymen will be attracted to it ; and it must be admitted that to the pastor who toils all night and catches nothing ,
