THE long road I have in mind is the long road of evolution , ? the road you and I have traveled Millie guise of humbler organisms , from the first unicellular life in the old Cambrian seas to the complex and highly specialized creature that rules supreme in the animal kingdom today . Surely a long journey , stretching through immeasurable epochs of geologic time , and attended by vicissitudes of which we can form but feeble conceptions . The majority of readers , I fancy , are not yet ready to admit that they , or any of their forebears , have ever made such a journey . We have all long been taught that our race was started upon its career only a few thousand years ago , started , not amid the warrings of savage elemental nature , but in a pleasant garden with everything needed close at hand . This belief has faded a good deal in our time , especially among thoughtful persons ; but in a modified form , as the special creation theory , it held sway in the minds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after Darwin had launched his revolutionary doctrine of our animal origin , putting man in the same zoological scheme as the lower orders . We are slow to adjust our minds to the revelations of science , they have been so long adjusted to a revelation , so-called , of an entirely different character . It gives them a wrench more or less violent when we try to make them at home and at their ease amid these new and startling disclosures . To many good people evolu- tion seems an ungodly doctrine , like setting up a remorseless logic in the place of an omnipresent Creator . But there is no help for it . Science has fairly turned us out of our comfortable little anthropomorphic notion of things into the great out-of-doors of the universe . We must and will get used to the chill , yea , to the cosmic chill , if need be . Our religious instincts will be all the hardier for it . When we accepted Newton 's discovery of the law of gravitation , we virtually surrendered ourselves to the enemy , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that traverses the whole system of created things . We can not turn back , we may lie down by the roadside and dream our old dreams , but our children and their children will press on , and will be exhilarated by the journey . It is at first sight an unpalatable truth that Evolution confronts us with , and it requires courage calmly to face it . But it is in perfect keeping with the whole career of physical science , which is forever directing our attention to common nearat-hand facts for the key to remote and mysterious occurrences . It seems to me that Evolution adds greatly to the wonder of life , because it takes it out of the realm of the arbitrary , the exceptional , and links it to the sequence of natural causation . That man should have been brought into existence by the fiat of an omnipotent power , is less an occasion for wonder than that he should have worked his way up from the lower non-human forms . That the man-ward impulse should never have been lost in all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pushed steadily on , through mollusk and fish and amphibian and reptile , through dinosaurs and mastodons , and all the dragons and monsters of the sea , the earth , the air , till it came to its full estate in a human being , is the wonder of wonders . In like manner , Evolution raises immensely the value of the biological processes that are everywhere operative about us , by showing us that these pro cesses are the channels through which the creative energy has worked , and is still working . Not in the far-off or in the exceptional does it seek the key to man 's origin , but in the sleepless activity of the creative force , which has been pushing onward and upward , from the remotest time , till it has come to full fruition in mini . It is easy to inject into man 's natural history a supernatural element , as nearly all biologists and anthropologists before Darwin 's time did , and as many serious people still do . It is too easy , in fact , and the temptation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the problem of man 's origin , and saves a deal of trouble . But this method is more and more discredited , and the younger biologists and natural philosophers accept the zoological conception of man , which links him with all the lower forms , and proceed to work from that . When we have taken the first step in trying to solve the problem of man 's origin , where can we stop ? Can we find any point in his history where we can say , Here his natural history ends , and his supernatural history begins ? Does his natural history end with the pre-glacial man , with the cave man , or the river-drift man , with the low-browed long-jawed Java fossil man ? the pithecanthropus erectus of Mead ? Where shall we stop on his trail ? I had almost said " step on his tail , " for we undoubtedly , if we go back far enough , come to a time when man had a tail . Every unborn child at a certain stage of its development still has a tail , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand-like foot . But could we stop with the tailed man ? the manlike ape , or the ape-like man ? Did his Creator start him with this appendage , or was it a later suffix of his own invention ? If we once seriously undertake to solve the riddle of man 's origin , and go back along the line of his descent , I doubt if we can find the point , or the form , where the natural is supplanted by the supernatural as it is called , where causation ends and miracle begins . Even the first dawn of protozoic life in the primordial seas must have been natural , or it would not have occurred , ? must have been potential in what went before it . In this universe , so far as we know it , one thing springs from another ; the sequence of cause and effect is continuous and inviolable . We know that no man is born of full stature , with his hat and boots on ; we know that he grows from an infant , and we know the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grows from a bit of nucleated protoplasm in the mother 's womb . Why may not the race of man grow from a like simple beginning ? It seems to be the order of nature ; it is the order of nature , ? first the germ , the inception , then the slow growth from the simple to the complex . It is the order of our own thoughts , our own arts , our own civilization , our own language . In our candid moments we acknowledge the animal in ourselves and in our neighbors , ? especially in our neighbors , ? the beast , the shark , the hog , the sloth , the fox , the monkey ; but to accept the notion of our animal origin , that gives us pause . To believe that our remote ancestor , no matter how remote in time or space , was a lowly organized creature living in the primordial seas with no more brains than a shovel-nosed shark or a gar-pike , puts our scientific faith to severe test . Think of it . For countless ages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth swarming with life , low bestial life , devouring and devoured , myriads of forms , all in bondage to nature or natural forces , living.only to eat and to breed , localized , dependent upon place and clime , shaped to specific ends like machines , ? to fly , to swim , to climb , to run , to dig , to drill , to weave , to wade , to graze , to crush ,  --  knowing not what they do , as void of conscious purpose as the thorns and stings and hooks and coils and wings in the vegetable world , making no impression upon the face of nature , as much a part of it as the trees and the stones , species after species having its day , and then passing off the stage , when suddenly , in the day before yesterday in the geologic year , so suddenly as to give some color of truth to the special creation theory , a new and strange animal appears , with new and strange powers , separated from the others by what appears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the others , but vastly more specialized in his brain and mental powers , instituting a new order of things upon the earth , the face of which he in time changes through his new gift of reason , inventing tools and weapons and language , harnessing the physical forces to his own ends , and ? putting all things under his feet , ? man the wonder-worker , the beholder of the stars , the critic and spectator of creation itself , the thinker of the thoughts of God , the worshiper , the devotee , the hero , spreading rapidly over the earth , and developing with prodigious strides when once fairly launched upon his career . Can it be possible , we ask , that this god was fathered by the low bestial orders below him , ? instinct giving birth to reason , animal ferocity developing into human benevolence , the slums of nature sending forth the ruler of the earth . It is a hard proposition , I say , undoubtedly the hardest that science has ever confronted us with . Haeckel , discussing this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us that is reluctant to own our lowly progenitors , the pride of family and position , like that of would-be aristocratic sons who conceal the humble origin of their parents . But it is more than that ; it is the old difficulty of walking by faith where there is nothing visible to walk upon ; we lack faith in the efficiency of the biologic laws , or any mundane forces , to bridge the tremendous chasm that separates man from even the highest of the lower orders . His radical unlikeness to all the forms below him , as if he moved in a world apart , into which they could never enter , as in a sense he does , is where the difficulty lies . Moreover , evolution balks us because of the inconceivable stretch of time during which it has been at work . It is as impossible for us to grasp geological time as sidereal space . All the standards of measurement furnished us by experience are as inadequate as is a child 's cup to measure the ocean . Several million years , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in ? We can not . A hundred years is a long time in human history , and how we pause before a thousand ! Then think of ten thousand , of fifty thousand , of one hundred thousand , of ten hundred thousand , or one million , or of one hundred million ! What might not the slow but ceaseless creative energy do in that time , changing but a hair in each generation ! If our millionaires had to earn their wealth cent by cent . and carry each cent home with them at night , it would be some years before they became millionaires . This is but a faint symbol of the slow process by which nature has piled up her riches . She has bad no visions of sudden wealth . To clothe the earth with soil made from the disintegrated mountains ? can we figure that time to ourselves ? The orientals try to get a hint of eternity by saying that when the Himalayas have been ground to powder by allowing a gauze veil to float against them once in a thousand years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been pulverized by a process almost as slow . In our case the gauze veil is the air , and the rains , and the snows , before which even granite crumbles . See what the god of erosion , in the shape of water , has done in the river valleys and gorges ? cut a mile deep in the Colorado canyon , and yet this canyon is but of yesterday in geologic time . Only give the evolutionary god time enough and all these miracles are surely wrought . Truly it is bard for us to realize what a part time has played in the earth 's history , ? just time , duration , ? so slowly , oh , so slowly , have the great changes been brought about ! The turning of mud and silt into rock in the bottom of the old seas seems to have been merely a question of time . Mud does not become rock in man 's time , nor vegetable matter become coal . These processes are too slow for us . The flexing and folding of the rocky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is only a question of time . Allow time enough and force enough , and a layer of granite may be bent like a bow . The crystals of the rock seem to adjust themselves to the strain , and to take up new positions , just as they do , much more rapidly , in a cake of ice under pressure . Probably no human agency could flex a stratum of rock , because there is not time enough , even if there were power enough . " A low temperature acting gradually , " says my geology , " during an indefinite age would produce results that could not be otherwise brought about even through greater heat . " " Give us time . " say the great mechanical forces , " and we will show you the immobile rocks and your rigid mountain-chains as flexible as a piece of leather . " " Give us time , " say the dews and the rains and the snow , " and we will make you a garden out of those same stubborn rocks and frowning ledges . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its protozoans in the old Cambrian seas , " and I will not stop till I have peopled the earth with myriad forms and crowned them all with man . " Dana thinks that , had " a man been living during the changes that produced the coal , he would not have suspected their progress , " so slow and quiet were they . It is probable that parts of our own sea-coast are sinking and other parts rising , as rapidly as the oscillation of the land and sea went on that resulted in the laying down of the coal measures . An eternity to man is but a day in the cosmic process . In the face of geologic time , man 's appearance upon the earth as man , with a written history , is something that has just happened ; it was in this morning 's paper , we read of it at breakfast . As evolution goes , it will not be old news yet for a hundred thousand years or so ; and by that time what will he have done , if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Probably he will not have caught the gods of evolution at their work . or witnessed the origin of species by natural descent , ? these things are too slow for him ; but he will certainly have found out many things that we are all dying to know . In nature as a whole we see results and not processes . We see the rock-strata bent and folded , we see whole mountain chains flexed and shortened by the flexure ; but had we been present , we would not have suspected what was going on . Our little span of life does not give us the parallax necessary . The rock-strata , miles thick , may be being flexed now under our feet , and we know it not . The earth is shrinking , but so slowly ! When , under the slow strain , the strata suddenly give way or sink , and an earthquake results , then we know something has happened . A modern biologist and physicist thinks , and doubtless thinks wisely , that the reason why we have never been able to produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can not take time enough . Even if we could bring about the conditions of the early geologic ages in which life had its dawn , which of course we can not , we could not produce life because we have not geologic time at our disposal . The reaction which we call life was probably as much a cosmic or geologic event as were the reactions which produced the different elements and compounds , and demanded the same slow gestation in the womb of time . During what cycles upon cycles the great mother-forces of the universe must have brooded over the inorganic before the organic was brought forth ! The archrean age , during which the brooding seems to have gone on , was probably as long as all the ages since . How we are baffled when we talk about the beginning of anything in nature or in our own lives ! In our experience there must be a first , but when did manhood begin ; when did puberty , when did old age , begin ? When did each stage of our mental growth begin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the French , or the German ? Was there a first English word spoken ? From the first animal sound , if we can conceive of such , up to the human speech of to-day , there is an infinite gradation of sounds and words . Was there afirst summer , a first winter , a first spring ? There could hardly have been a first day , even for ages and ages , but only slowly approximating day . After an immense lapse of time the air must have cleared and the day become separated from the night , and the seasons must have become gradually defined . Things slowly emerge one after another from a dim nebulous condition , in our own growth and experience , and in the development of the physical universe . In nature there is no first and last . There is an endless beginning and an endless ending . There was no first man or first woman , no first bird , or fish , or reptile . Back of each one stretches an endless chain of approximating men and birds and reptiles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began his existence seems to me misleading , because it appears to convey the idea that he began as man at some time , in some place . Whereas he grew . He began where and when the first cell appeared , and he has been on the road ever since . There is no point in the line where he emerged from the not-man and became man . He was emerging from the not-man for millions of years , and when you put your finger on an animal form and say , " This is man , " you must go back through whole geologic periods before you reach the not-man . There is no more reason for believing that the different species or forms of animal life were suddenly introduced than there is for believing that the soil , or the minerals , gold , silver , diamonds , or vegetable mould and verdure were suddenly introduced . II If we know anything of the earth 's past history , we know that the continents were long in forming , that they passed through many vicissitudes of heat and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subsidence ? that they had , so to speak , their first low , simple , rudimentary or invertebrate life ; that they were all so slow in getting their back-bones , slower still in clothing their rock-ribs with soil and verdure , that they passed through a sort of amphibian stage , now under water , now on dry land ; that their many kinds of soils and climes were not differentiated and their complex water-systems established till well into Tertiary times ? in short , that they have passed more and more from the simple to the complex , from the disorganized to the organized . When man comes to draw his sustenance from their breasts , may they not be said to have reached the mammalian stage ? The fertile plain and valley and the rounded hill are of slow growth , immensely slow . But any given stage of the earth has followed naturally from the previous stage , only more and more and higher and higher forces took a hand in the game . First its elements passed through the stage of fire , then through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of air . More and more the aerial elements , oxygen , carbon , nitrogen , have entered into its constituents and fattened the soil . The humanizing of the earth has been largely a process of oxidation . More than disintegrated rock makes up the soil : the air and the rains and the snows have all contributed a share . The history of the soil which we turn with our spade , and stamp with our shoes , covers millions upon millions of years . It is the ashes of the mountains , the leavings of untold generations of animal and vegetable life . It came out of the sea ; it drifted from the heavens ; it flowed out from thefiery heart of the globe ; it has been worked over and over by frost and flood , blown by winds , shoveled by ice , washed by floods , ? mixed and kneaded and moulded up as the housewife kneads and moulds her bread , ? refining and refining from age to age . Much of it was held in solution in the primordial seas , whence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of marine life , making a sediment that in time became rocks , that again in time became continents or parts of them , which the aerial forces reduced to soil . Indeed , the soil itself is an evolution ? as much so as the life upon it . We probably have little conception of how intimate and cooperative all parts of the universe are with one another , ? the debt we owe to the farthest stars , and to the remotest period of time . We must owe a debt to the monsters of Mesozoic and Cenozoic time : they helped to fertilize the soil for us , and to discipline the ruder forces of life . We owe a debt to all that has gone before : to the heavens above , and to the earth-fires beneath , to the ice-sheet that ground down the mountains , and to the ocean currents . Just as we owe a debt to the men and women in our line of descent , so we owe a debt to the ruder primordial forces that shaped the planet to our use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . The gods of evolution had served a long apprenticeship ; they had gained proficiency and were master-workmen . Or shall we say that the elements of life had become more plastic and adaptable , or that the life-fund had accumulated , so to speak ? Had the vast succession of living beings , the long experience in organization , at last made the problem of man easier to solve ? One fancies every living thing as not only returning its mineral elements to the soil , but as in some subtle way leaving its vital forces also , and thus contributing to the impalpable , invisible storehouse of vital energy of the globe . At first , among the mammalian tribes there was much muscle and little brains . But in the middle Tertiary , the mammal brain began suddenly to enlarge . So that in our time the horse 's brain is more than eight times the size of that of his progenitor , the Dinoceras of Eocene times . Nature seems to have experimented with brains and nerve-ganglia , as she has with so many other things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various dinosaurs ? had absurdly small heads and brains , but they had what might be called supplementary brains well toward the other end of the body , ? great nervous masses near the sacrum , many times the size of the ostensible brain , which no doubt performed certain brain functions . But the principle of centralization was at work , and when in later time we reach the higher mammalian forms , we find these outlying nervous masses called in , so to speak , and concentrated in the head . Nature has tried the big , the gigantic , over and over , and then abandoned it . In Carboniferous times there was a gigantic dragon-fly , measuring more than two feet in the expanse of wing . Still earlier , there were gigantic mollusks and sea-scorpions , a cephalopod larger than a man , then gigantic , fishes , amphibians , and reptiles , followed by enormous mammals . But the geologic record shows that these huge forms did not continue . The mollusks that last unchanged through millions of years are the clam and the oyster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone , and only their humbler types remain . Among men , giants are short-lived . If we figure to ourselves the geologic history of the earth under the symbol of a year of three hundred and sixty-five days , each day a million years , which is probably not far out of the way , then man , the biped , the Homo sapiens , in relation to this immense past , is of to-day , or of this very morning ; while the origin of the first vertebrates , the fishes , from which he has arisen , falls nearer the middle of the great year . Or , dividing this geologic year into four divisions or seasons , primary , secondary , tertiary , and quaternary , the fishes fall in the second- ary , and man in the early quaternary . If the fluid earth hardened , and the seas were formed , in the first month of this year , then probably the first beginning of life appeared in the second month , the invertebrate in the third or fourth , ? March or April , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in July or August , the reptiles in August or September , the mammals in October or November , and man in December , ? separated from the first beginnings of life by all those millions upon millions of years . If life is a ferment , as we are told it is , how long it took this yeast to leaven the whole loaf ! Man is evidently the end of the series , he is the top of the biological tree . His specialization upon physical lines seems to have ended far back in geologic time ; his future specialization and development is evidently to be upon mental and spiritual lines . Nature , as I have said , began to tend more and more to brains in the early Tertiary ? the autumn of the great year ; her best harvest began to mature then , her grain began to ripen . Indeed , this increased cephalization of animal life in the fall of the great year does suggest a kind of ripening process , the turning of the sap and milk , which had been so abundant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fruit and seed . May it not be that that long and sultry spring and summer of the earth 's early history , a time probably longer than has since elapsed , played a part in the development of life analogous to that played by our spring and summer , making it opulent , varied , gigantic , and making possible the condensation and refinement that came with man in the recent period ? The earth is a pretty big apple , and the solar tree upon which it hangs is a pretty big tree , but why may it not have gone through a kind of ripening process for all that ? its elements becoming less crude and acrid , and better suited to sustain the higher forms , as the eons passed ? At any rate , the results seem to justify such a fancy . The earth has slowly ttn- dergone a change that may fairly be called a ripening process ; its soil has deepened and mellowed , its harsher features have softened , more and more color has come to its surface , the flowers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air has cleared , and love and benevolence and altruism have been born in the world . Can we fail to see the significance of the order in which life has appeared upon the globe ? the ascending series from the simple to the more and more complex ? Can we doubt that each series is the outcome of the one below it ? that there is a logical sequence from the Protozoa up through the Invertebrates , the Vertebrates , to man ? Is it not like all that we know of the method of nature ? Could we substitute the life of one period for that of another without destroying this evidence of progressive development ? Is there no fundamental reason for the gradation we behold ? The same ascending series of creation as a whole is repeated in the inception and development of every one of the higher animals to-day . Each one begins as a single cell , which soon becomes a congeries of cells , which is followed by congeries of congeries of cells , till the highly complex structure of the grown animal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is reached . It is typical of the course of the creative energy , from the first unicellular life up to man , each succeeding stage flowing out of , and necessitated by , the preceding stage . Life had to creep or swim long before it could walk , and it walked long before it could fly ; it had feeling long before it had eyes , and it had eyes no doubt long before it could hear or smell . It was capable of motion long before it had limbs ; it assimilated food long before it had a mouth or a stomach ; it had a digestive tract long before it had a spinal cord ; ithad nerve-ganglia long before it had a well-defined brain ; it had sensation long before it had perception ; it is unisexual long before it is bi-sexual ; it has a shell long before it has a skeleton ; it has instinct and reflex action long before it has self-consciousness and reason . Always from the lower to the higher , from the simple to the more complex , and always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its stage of infancy , and of childhood , and of maturity , and it will doubtless have its old age . It took it millions upon millions of years to get out of the sea upon dry land ; and it took it more millions upon dry land , or since the Carboniferous age when the air probably first began to be breathable , ? all the vast stretch of the Secondary and Tertiarrizges , ? to get upright and develop a reasoning brain , and reach the estate of man . Step by step , in orderly succession , does creation move . I never see the sun rise or set without thinking how nature 's great processes steal upon us , silently and unnoticed , yet always in sequence , stage succeeding stage , one thing following from another , the spectacular moment of sunset following inevitably from the quiet unnoticed sinking of the sun in the west , or the startling flash of his rim above the eastern horizon only the fulfillment of the promise of the dawn . All is development and succession , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Cambrian or Silurian times , and is linked to that time as one hour of the day is linked to another . The more complex life became , the more rapidly it seems to have developed , till it finally makes rapid strides to reach man . One seems to see Life , like a traveler on the road , going faster and faster as it nears its goal . Those long ages of unicellular life in the old seas , how immense they appear to have been then how the age of invertebrates dragged on , millions upon millions of years ; then the age of fishes ; the Palteozoic age , how vast , ? put by Haeckel at thirty-four millions of years , ? adding a rock-stratum 41,000 feet thick . Then the Mesozoic or second period , the age of reptiles , eleven million years , with a stratum 12,000 feet thick . Then the Cenozoic age , or age of mammals , three million years , with strata 3100 feet thick . The god of life was getting in a hurry now ; man was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was hit upon in this age , and probably the diaphragm , and the brain of animals , all greatly enlarged . Then the Anthropozoic or Quaternary age , the age of man , 300,000 s with not much addition to the sedi-years , mentary rocks . Man seems to be the net result of it all , of all these vast cycles of Palaeozoic , Mesozoic , and Cenozoic life . He is the one drop finally distilled from the vast weltering sea of lower organic forms . It looks as if it all had to be before he could be ? all the delay and waste and struggle and pain ? all that long carnival of sea-life , all that saturnalia of gigantic forms upon the land and in the air , all that rising and sinking of the continents , and all that shoveling to and fro and mixing of the soils , before the world was ready for him . In the early Tertiaries , millions of years ago , the earth seems to have been ripe for man . The fruits and vegetables and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animals that have been most serviceable to us were here ; spring and summer , fall and winter , came and went ; evidently birds sang , insects hummed , flowers bloomed , fruits and grains and nuts ripened ; and yet man as man was not . Under the city of London is a vast deposit of clay in which thousands of specimens of fossil fruit have been found , like our date , cocoanut , areca , custard-apple , gourd , melon , coffee , bean , pepper , cotton plant , etc. , but no signs of man . Why was his development so tardy ? What animal profited by this rich vegetable life ? The hope and promise of the human species at that time probably slept in some lowly marsupial . Man has gathered up into himself , as he traveled his devious way , all the best powers of the animal kingdom he has passed through . His brain supplies him with all that his body lacks , and more . His specialization is in this highly developed organ . It is this that separates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no wings , and yet he can soar above the clouds ; he is not swift of foot , and yet he can outspeed the fleetest hound or horse ; he has but feeble weapons in his organization , and yet he can slay or master all the great beasts ; his eye is not so sharp as that of the eagle or the vulture , and yet he can see into the farthest depths of sidereal space ; he has only very feeble occult powers of communication with his fellows , and yet he ? can talk around the world and send his voice across mountains and deserts ; his hands are weak things beside a lion 's paw or an elephant 's trunk , and yet he can move mountains and stay rivers and set bounds to the wildest seas . His dog can out-smell him and out-run him and out-bite him , and yet his dog looks up to him as to a god . He has erring reason in place of unerring instinct , and yet he has changed the face of the planet . Without the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to particular ends , ? their tools , their weapons , their strength , their speed , man yet makes them all his servants . His brain is more than a match for all the special advantages nature has given them . The one gift of reason makes him supreme in the world . IV We have a stake in all the past life of the globe . It is no doubt a scientific fact that your existence and mine were involved in the first cell that appeared , that the first zoophyte furthered our fortunes , that the first worm gave us a lift . Great good luck came to us when the first pair of eyes was invented , probably by the trilobite back in Silurian times ; when the first ear appeared , probably in Carboniferous times ; when the first pair of lungs grew out of a fish 's bladder , probably in Trim- sic times ; when the first four-chambered heart was developed and double circulation established , probably with the first warm-blooded animal in Mesozoic time . These humble forms started the brain , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smell ; they invented the liver , the kidneys , the lungs , the heart , the stomach , and led the way to every organ and power my body and mind have to-day . They were the pioneers , they were the dim remote forebears , they conserved and augmented the fund of life and passed it along . All their struggles , their discipline , their battles , their failures , their successes , were for you and me . Man has had the experience of all the animals below him . He has suffered and struggled as a fish , he has groveled and devoured as a reptile , he has fought and triumphed as a quadruped , he has lived in trees as a monkey , he has inhabited caves with the wolf and the bear , he has roamed the forests and plains as a savage , be has survived without fire or clothes or weapons or tools , he has lived with the mastodon and all the saurian monsters , he has held his own against great odds , he has survived the long battles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ice-sheet that overrode both hemispheres , he has seen many forms become extinct . In the historic period he has survived plague and pestilence , and want and famine . What must he have survived in prehistoric times ! What must he have had to contend with as a cave-dweller , as a tree-dweller , as a river-drift man ! Before he had tools or weapons , what must he have had to contend with ! Nature was full of sap and rioted in rude strength well up to Quaternary times , producing extravagant forms which apparently she had no use for , as she has discontinued them . In all these things you and I had our part and lot ; of this prodigal outpouring of life we have reaped the benefit ; amid these bizarre forms and this carnival of lust and power , the man-ward impulse was nourished and forwarded . In Eo cene times nearly half the mammals lived on other animals ; it must have been an age of great slaughter . It favored the development of fleetness and cunning , in which we too have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some form , and escaped the slaughter . Then or later , it is thought , he took to the trees to escape his enemies , as the rats in Jamaica have taken to the trees to escape the mongoose . To his tree-climbing we probably owe our hand , with its opposing thumb . In all his disguises he is still our ancestor . His story reads like a fairy book . Never did nimble fancy of childhood invent such transformations ? only the transformations are so infinitely slow , and attended with such struggle and suffering . Strike out the element of time and we have before us a spectacle more novel and startling than any hocus-pocus or legerdemain that ever set the crowd agape . In every form man has passed through , he left behind some old member or power and took on some new . He left his air-bladder and his gills and his fins , with the fishes ; he got his lungs and his limbs from the amphibian ; he left some part of his anatomy with the reptile , and took something in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line he picked up the four-chambered heart , the warm blood , the placenta , the diaphragm , the plantigrade foot , the mammary glands ? indeed , what has he not picked up on the long road of his many transformations ? He left some of his superfluous forty-four teeth with his ancestral quadrumana of Eocene times , and kept thirty-two . He picked up his brain somewhere on the road , probably far back in Paleozoic times , but how has he developed and enlarged it , till it is now the one supreme thing in the world ! His fear , his cunning , his anger , his treachery , his hoggishness , ? all his animal passions , he brought with him from his animal ancestors ; but his moral and spiritual nature , his altruism , his venera- tion , his religious emotions , his aesthetic perceptions , have come to him as man , supplementing his lower nature , as it were , with another order of senses ? a finer sight , a finer touch , wrought in him by the discipline of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning de novo in him only as the wing began de novo in the bird , or the color began de novo in the flower ? struck out from preexisting potentialities . The father of the eye is the light , and the father of the ear is the vibration of the air , but the father of man 's higher nature is a question of quite another sort . Man owes his five toes and five fingers to the early amphibians of the sub-carboniferous times . The first tangible evidence of these five toes upon the earth is , to me , very interesting . The earliest record of them that I have heard of is furnished by a slab of shale from Pennsylvania , upon which , while it was yet soft mud , our first five-toed ancestor had left the imprint of his four feet . He was evidently a small , short-legged gentleman with a stride of only about thirteen inches , and he carried a tail instead of a cane . Ile was probably taking a stroll upon the shores of that vast Mediterranean Sea that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this mud-flat . It was raining that morning ? how many million years ago ? ? as we know from the imprint of the raindrops upon the mud . Probably the shower did not cause him to quicken his pace , as amphibians rather like the rain . Just what his immediate forebears were like , or what the forms were that connected him with the fishes , we shall probably never know . Doubtless the great book of the rocky strata somewhere holds the secret , if we are ever lucky enough to open it at the right place . How many other secrets that evolutionists would like to know , those torn and crumpled leaves must hold ! It is something to me to know that it rained that day when our amphibian ancestor ventured out . The weather was beginning to get organized also , and settling down to business . It had got beyond the state of perpetual mist and fog of the earlier ages , and the raindrops were playing their parts . Yet from all the evidence we have , we infer that the climate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greenhouse , and that vegetation , mostly giant ferns and rushes and Lycopods , was very rank , but there was no grass , or moss , no deciduous trees , or flowers , or fruit , as we know these things . A German anatomist says that we have the vestiges of one hundred and eighty organs brought up from our animal ancestors , ? now useless , or often worse than useless , like the vermiform appendix . Eleven of these superannuated and obsolete organs we bring from the fishes , four from amphibians and reptiles . The external ear is a vestige ? of no use any more . Our dread of snakes we no doubt inherited from our simian ancestors . How life refined and humanized as time went on , sobered down and became more meditative , keeping step , no doubt , with the amelioration of the soil out of which all life finally comes ! Life 's bank account in the soil was constantly increasing ; more and more of the inorganic was wrought up into the organic ; the value of every clod @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceased , and they became ashes . The giant and uncouth vegetation ceased , and left ashes or coal . The beech , the maple , the oak , the olive , the palm , came in . The giant sea-serpents disappeared ; the horse , the ox , the swine , the dog , the quail , the dove came in . The placental mammals developed . The horse grew in size and beauty . When we first come upon his trail , he is a four-hoof-toed animal no larger than a fox . Later on we find him the size of a sheep , with one of his toes gone ; still later , many hundred thousand years , no doubt , we find him the size of a donkey , with still fewer toes , and so on , till we reach the superb creature we know . The creative energy seems to have worked in geologic time and in the geologic field just as it works here and now , in yonder vineyard or in yonder marsh , ? blindly , experimentally , but persistently and successfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they search in every direction ; the climbing vines find their support , because in the same blind way they feel in all directions . Plants and animals and races of men grope their way to new fields , to new powers , to new inventions . Indeed , how like an inventor nature has worked , constantly improving her models , adding to and changing as experience would seem to dictate . She has developed her higher and more complex forms as man has developed his printing-press , or steam-engine , from rude simple beginnings . From the two-chambered heart of the fish she made the treble-chambered heart of the frog , and then the fou ? - chambered heart of the mammal . The first mammary glands had no nipples ; the milk oozed out and was licked off by the young . The nipple was a great improvement , as was the power of suckling in the young . Experimenting and experimenting endlessly , taking a forward step only when compelled by necessity ? this is the way of nature : experimenting with eyes , with ears , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with wings , with bladders and lungs , with scales and armors , and so on ; hitting upon the back-bone only after long trials with other forms ; hitting upon the movable eye only after long ages of other eyes ; hitting on the mammal only after long ages of egg-laying vertebrates ; hitting on the placenta only recently ; experimenting all around the circle , discarding and inventing , taking ages to perfect the nervous system , ages and ages to develop the centralized ganglia , the brain . First , life was like a rabble , a mob , without thought or head ; then slowly organization went on , as it were , from family to clan , from clan to tribe , from tribe to nation , or centralized government : the brain of man , ? all parts duly subordinated and directed , ? millions of cells organized and working ondifferent functions to one grand end , ? cooperation , fraternization , division of labor , altruism . The cell was the first invention ; it is the unit of life , ? a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cell till it could combine with its fellows and form the higher animals , seems to have been the aim of the creative energy . First the cell , then combinations of cells , then combinations of combinations , then more and more complex combinations , till the body of man is reached , where endless confraternities of cells , all with different functions , working to build and sustain different organs , ? brain , heart , liver , muscles , nerves , ? yet all working together for one grand end ? the body and mind of man . In their last analysis , all made up of the same cells , their combinations and organization making the different forms . Evolution touches all forms but tarries with few . Many are called but few are chosen , ? chosen to lead the man-impulse upward . Myriads of forms are left ' behind , like driftwood caught in the eddies of a current . The clam has always remained a clam , the oyster remained an oyster . The cockroach is about the same creature to-day that it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so are many other forms of marine life . Often , where old species have gone out and new come in , no progress has been made . Evolution concentrates along certain lines . The biological tree behaves like another tree , branches die and drop off ( species become extinct ) , others mature and remain , while some central shoot pushes upward . Many of the huge reptilian and mammalian branches perished in comparatively late times . As nothing is more evident than that the same measure of life or of vital energy ? power of growth , power of resistance , power of reproduction ? is not meted out equally to all the individuals of a species , or to all species , so it is evident that this power of progressive development is not meted out equally to all races of mankind , or to all of the individuals of the same race . The central impulse of development seems to have come from the East , in historic times at least , and to have followed the line of the Mediterranean , to have culminated in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a few minds ? minds exceptionally endowed . For the most part the barbarian races do not progress . Their exceptional minds or characters do not lead the tribes to higher planes of thought . In all countries we still see these barbarous people which man in his progress has left behind . Our civilization is like a field of light that fades off into shadows and darkness . There is this margin of undeveloped humanity on all sides . Always has it been so in the animal life of the globe , ? the higher forms have been pushed up from the lower , and the lower have remained and continued to multiply unchanged . It seems as if some central and cherished impulse had pushed on through each form , and by successive steps had climbed from height to height , gaining a little here and a little there , intensifying and concentrating as time went on , very vague and diffuse at first , embryonic so to speak , during the first half of the great geologic year , but quickening more and more , differentiating more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt , yet never destroyed , leaving form after form unchanged behind it , till it at last reached its goal in man . After Evolution has done all it can do for us toward solving the mystery of creation , much remains unsolved . Through Evolution we see creation in travail-pains for millions of years to bring forth the varied forms of life as we know them ; but the mystery of the inception of this life , and of the origin of the laws that have governed its development , remains . What lies back of it all ? Who or what planted the germ of the biological tree , and predetermined all its branches ? What determined one branch to eventuate in man , another in the dog , the horse , the bird , or the reptile ? From the finite or human point of view we feel compelled to say , some vaster being or intelligence must have had the thought of all these things from the beginning or before the beginning . It is quite impossible for me to believe that fortuitous variation ? variation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evolution of man . There must have been a predetermined tendency to variation in certain directions . To introduce change into the world is to introduce chaos . No more would the waters of the interiors of the continents find their way to the sea were there not a slant in that direction , than could haphazard variation , though checked and controlled by natural selection , result in the production of the race of man . This view may be only the outcome of our inevitable anthropomorphism , which we can not escape from , no matter how deep we dive or how high we soar .
