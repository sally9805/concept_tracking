IT would be impossible in this short study to discuss exhaustively the style of a play so heavily laden with poetic riches , but there is one famous passage in it which may be briefly analyzed . What the soliloquy on death is to Hamlet the picture of Cleopatra 's barge is to Antony and Cleopatra . It is the popular " purple patch " in the play . It is by no means in the finest mood of the poet , for it is purely pictorial , but it reveals more clearly than almost any other passage the technical method of Shakespeare as an artist in words , and it proves that even our supreme poet was not merely a man of genius , but that 112. was also a very cunning and deliberate artificer who calculated his effects as deliberately as the most artificial maker of triplets and rondeaux . It is well to emphasize this side of Shakespeare . for we are apt to regard his poetry as a spontaneous miracle which owes everything to inspiration and very little to careful and conscious art . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no trace of the file , but we may be sure that in them he used it with the cunning that conceals itself . It may be romantic to revere him as a magician who mated sound and vision , rhythm and emotion , without conscious craft , but it is uncritical , for nothing is more certain than the fact that great poetry is produced by a union of conscious art with natural force . No doubt there is a point in the " fine frenzy " of the poet when his imagination transcends his conscious technique . and he becomes almost wholly unaware of its shaping control . At this point the act of creation in the mind is almost simultaneous with its embodiment in perfect form , the fusion of vision and utterance producing apparent spontaneity . It is probable that great poetry is horn in this supernatural fashion , thought flashing into expression instantaneously ; but we have very lit tle real knowledge of theprocess. for great poets are curiously reticent with regard to the miraculous conception , not because they are reluctant to disclose their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ourselves . A great poet is like a great pianist who has mastered his fingering so completely that he is unconscious of it , but nevertheless the fingering is there . In the picture of the barge the artifice is glaringly visible : " The barge she sat in , like a burnished throne . fiurn 'd on the water : the poop was beaten gold : Purple the sails , and so perfumed that The winds were love-sick with them ; the oars were silver , Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke , and made The water which they beat to follow faster , As amorous of their strokes . " It is obvious that the magic of these lines is due solely to their form , and if we take them to pieces we find that their form is due to deliberate artifice . The alliteration is flagrant . There is a cannonade of " b 's " in " barge , " " burnished , " " hurn 'd , " and " beaten . " A new alliterative bombardment is inaugurated by " poop " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubled " p 's " in " purple , " and then hammered home by another " p " in " perfumed . " Note also the violent effect produced by the vehement stress on the first word in the second line , where the word " burn 'd " flings back the sound of " burnish 'd . " The poet now abandons his alliterative " b 's " and " p 's " for the softer device of alliterative " w 's , " which seem to breathe the languorous swooning sensuousness of the fragrant winds and the charmed water . This trick is less obtrusive. for " winds " is separated from " water , " while the alliteration is sustained by the " w 's " in the quieter word " was . " the two " weres , " " with , " and the two " whiehes . " There are seven " w 's " in four lines , yet they are so skilfully hidden that the ear is hardly conscious of their presence . The part played in the musical scheme by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat , " and is hidden in " burnish 'd . " It creeps out again in the doubled " s " in " sails and in the strongly accentuated " s " in " so . " It is heard in " love-sick , " in " oars , " and in " silver ! ' It is muted and masked by the " t " in " stroke , " and in " flutes " it is a prolonged whisper . It is concealed in " faster , " but it reappears with a rush in the four sibilants of " as , " " amorous , " and " strokes . " Even this does not exhaust the alliterative subtlety of the passage . The dentals are very craftily employed . They begin with the final " t " in " sat : ' There are two buried " t 's in " water " and " beaten . " There is a dance of dentals in the words , " to the tune of flutes kept stroke , " and in the words " water , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ; and the dance ends like a clog-dance with the thud of the strong " t " in " strokes . " The rhythmic value of these alliterative dentals is extremely great ; they set the pace of the verse and whip it into life . The part played by the liquids and labials is very important . The whole passage gurgles with " r 's " and bubbles with " l 's . " The stress upon the " r " in " barge " and the " r " in " burnish 'd " draws out the rich liquid sound which is heard again in " throne . " It is very emphatic in " burri 'd , " and more insidious at the end of " water . " It is boldly stressed in " purple , " and insinuated in " perfumed , " and in the two " weres . " ' It rolls out sonorously in " oars , " and it murmurs at the end of the line in the " silver " which echoes the cadence of the " water " in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sixth line by the reiterated " water , " and the closing word , " faster . " There are three " r 's " in the three words , " amorous , " " their , " " strokes . " Note the beautiful effect of the turning elision in the " r " of " amorous . " The musical value of the labials is as great as that of the liquids . It begins with the " 1 " in " like , " and it sounds luxuriously in the strongly stressed " 1 " of " gold . " in " purple , " " sails , " VOL CXTX ? No 715 ? 73 " love , " and " silver . " It sighs in " flutes , " while in the sixth line the double " l 's " of " follow " carry the labial music to its highest point . Note also the magical use of the " f 's " and " v 's " in " perfumed , " " love , " and " silver , " and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " them , " " made , " and " amorous . " The " n 's " in " burnish 'd , " " burn'cl , " " on , " " beaten , " " winds , " and tune " also play their part . Every other word in the passage contains an open vowel with a full rich stress on it . The wonderful music of the first line is built of hollow " oe 's " and " ae 's " modulated by a muffled " u . " The sound of the " a " in " barge " and the " u " in " burnish 'd " is drawn out deliciously by the liquid " r " which follows them . The " a " in " sat " is less prolonged , and with the half-tone of the " u " in " burnish 'd " it prepares the ear for the gorgeous organ-note of the booming " oe " in " throne . " The muffled " u " sounds again in " burn 'd , " and the long " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leads up to the rolling " oo " in " poop , " which glides into the shrill " ee " in " beaten " that introduces the tremendous open " oe " in " gold , " swooning deliciously into the melting " 1 " that clangs to its close against the dental " d . " Then the muffled " u " sounds again in " purple , " and after the heavy , harsh " ay " sounds in " sails , " there is heard once more the hollow " oe " in " so , " followed by the lingering " oo " in " perfumed , " and the sharp staccato " a " in " that . " There is an onomatopoeic stress on the muted " i " in " winds , " and after five semi-tones in the next five words have rested the ear , the hollow " oe " tolls out again in " oars , " where the " r " prolongs it like the " 1 " in " gold " and the " n " in " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ semi-tones which lead us to the resurgence of the " oo " in " to " and " tune , " where the " n echoes the " n " in " throne .

" After a semi-tone in " kept " the hollow " oe " breaks out again in " stroke , " where the " k " clinches it like the " p " in " poop . " The deep " ay " now sounds again in " made " and the prolonged " aw " in " water . " After two semi-tones the sharp " ee " rings brightly against the " t " in " heat , " which answers reiteratively the " beat " in " beaten , " as the " burn " in " burn 'd " answers the " burn " in " burnish 'd , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It is remarkable that in six and a half lines there . are three of these reiterations , " beat " and " beaten , " " water " and " water , " " stroke " and strokes .

It would be possible to carry this process of analysis farther , and to show that Shakespeare in his more purely imaginative feats of art achieved a far more consummate magic . But I have confined myself to this hackneyed passage because its very triteness enables the reader who is not a metrical student to appreciate the artifice of the poet . It is true that when his imagination cools , Shakespeare falls into fustian , such as " the discandying of this pelleted storm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the words move to the very pace and gait of the emotion , as in the noble pathos of Antony 's foreboding cry : " Haply you shall not see me more ; or if , A mangled shadow . " Of the play itself , little that is new can be said . Shakespeare wrote two great tragedies dealing with the passion of love . He was in the twenties when he wrote Romeo and Juliet ; he was in the forties when he wrote Antony and Cleopatra . The difference between the two plays is the difference between youth and manhood . The passion of love in youth is both less sensual and less intellectual than it is in manhood , for in youth the senses are in an ecstasy of spiritual excitement , and the flesh is hardly aware of itself . Romeo and Juliet are heroic types of youth untainted by desire . Their love is an ethereal rapture that has not been soiled with experience ; it is a cold religious stream which flows innocently out of the flesh . The tragedy of this youthful love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the cruelty of circumstance . We see the pity of young love caught in the machinery of life and driven'upon disaster by irrelevant forces , but there is no glimpse of that deeper pity , the pity of love which destroys itself by its own energy , and which is its own doom . The young Shakespeare had not yet learned the most dreadful lesson of life ? that character is Fate . He was still fascinated by literary conventions ; he still revelled in verbal melody and romantic splendor ; he still frolicked in rhetoric like a colt in a meadow . Intoxicated with wonderful visions , he had not yet begun to pierce below the show of the world . But after sixteen years of fierce mental toil and furious spiritual strife his imagination has become his slave instead of his master ; no longer is he satisfied with the fabrication of poetic witchery for its own sake ; he now watches the mystery of human nature with a graver eye . He has not only achieved complete control over the technique of dramatic expression , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agony of soul and what anguish of mind he has endured we can not guess , but he now writes like a man over whom fife has rolled . His character has been developed by conscience at war with passion ; he has wrestled with his own spirit ; he has confronted the enigma of personality caught in the net of existence . He has travelled far beyond the artificial delights of euphuism and rhetoric . Moral ideas are now to him more interesting than lovely phrases , and the spectacle of man writhing in the folds of his own character has made him forget his literary preciosity . The charm of verbal conceits has ceased to allure him , and his style is now a stern , lean , supple austerity . It is the clothing and not the adornment of his dramatic visions ; it flows over the limbs of his thought as water flows over the swimmer , following with what Coleridge has called a " happy valiancy " every curve and contour of the living body . It is a mistake to regard Antony and Cleopatra as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is also a mistake to regard Cleopatra as a harlot ennobled by a hero . From the moral point of view there is not a pin to choose between them . The one is precisely as good and precisely as bad as the other . Antony is a living man and Cleopatra a living woman . Shakespeare took his plot from Plutarch , but he knew better than to take his psychology from him . Plutarch , like all men of his time and like most men of our time , makes the woman the scapegoat . He says that Cleopatra " did waken and stir up many vices yet hidden " in Antony , and " if any spark of goodness or hope of rising were left in him , Cleopatra quenched it straight and made it worse than before . " This naive psychology is swept away by Shakespeare , and he substitutes for it a tremendous conflict between the two most terrible passions in human nature , the passion of love and the passion of power . His dramatic imagination is so intense that it destroys the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a region where moral by-laws cease to operate . The battle that rages in Antony is not a battle between conventional right and wrong , but a battle between the passion of power and the passion of love , the passion to subjugate and the passion to be subjugated . There are some passions which can tolerate a condominium . The passion of avarice is not incompatible with ambition ; a great man may be a great miser . But the passion of power can not share its throne with the passion of love . The one passion thirsts for conquest , the other thirsts for surrender . There is nothing essentially immoral in the passion of power ; It is a passion of the mind just as hunger is an appetite of the body . Nor is there anything essentially immoral in the passion of love , but as it is a passion of the mind and an appetite of the body fused into one , it is the deadliest rival of the passion of power , which is a passion of the mind alone . The passion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the conflict is one of the most awful that is waged on the battle-field of conscience . In Antony , Shakespeare shows us a man who has dominated his world by the iron unity of his nature . He has grown gray in war and statecraft ; he is master of others because he is master of himself . His cool brain , inured to conqu-st , is an empire without sedition , a king Jm without treachery . Into this domain comes a subtle mischief . Cleopatra is no . : onventional siren ; she is passionate mind throbbing in passionate flesh . Her sensuous beauty is only the envelope of a conquering spirit that is a match for even the great spirit of Antony . Nothing is more inexplicable than the spell which the personality of a woman , apart from physical allurements , can weave round the will of a man . It is this spell which Shakespeare has immortalized in Cleopatra . Like all great enchantresses , Cleopatra is not young ; she is the widow of Ptolemy and the heel-tap of CTsar . Shakespeare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glances obliquely at them , reminding us that Cleopatra is " wrinkled deep in time . " There is a sardonic reference to her " waned lip . " She is not a woman in the April of her bloom , but a seasoned veteran in love to whom Enobarbus pays what we may read as an ironic compliment when he says that " age can not wither her nor custom stale her infinite variety . " She brows every trick of her trade ; she is mistress of every mechanical wile ; " other women cloy the appetites they feed , but she makes hungry where most she satisfies . " It is the subtlety of her brain that wields her beauty . Antony is enslaved by her cunning mind . He calls her his " serpent of old Nile , " and he yields his imperial will to the witchcraft of the genius that weaves her " strong toil of grace . " The pathology of decaying greatness is analyzed with amazing vigor and insight as the action of the play progresses . The character of Antony rots before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asserts that kingdoms are clay compared with " the nobleness of life " and the delights of love . He lays violent hands on his own greatness and insults his own achievements . This mood comes often to the servants of a harsh ideal . It is the unbending the strung bow , the recoil of the soaring mind . It is the temper of a Parnell who sacrifices his ambition to passion , for Antony is a Roman Parnell . Like Antony , Parnell broke the hopes and the of his comrades by abandoning them at the critical moment when his presence was necessary in council . The passion of love cast out the passion of power ; the reproaches and entreaties of his friends were vain . Ireland was evicted from his heart by an Irishwoman . We see in Antony the tragic struggle that rent the spirit of Parnell , for Antony struggles with all his might to escape from the allurements of Cleopatra . In his enslavement " a Roman thought " strikes him . He sees that he must break " these strong Egyptian fetters " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cynical captain , Enobarbus , he cries , " Would I had never seen her ! " He is not the dupe of his passion . for he knows his peril . He realizes that Cleopatra is " cunning past man 's thought ! ' Her cunning is at its height in the scene of farewell , during which she plays upon every string in his character , mixing sarcasm with raillery and persiflage with flattery , until , having maddened him to the verge of revolt , she swiftly acts the part of the Roman matron and bids him be deaf to her " unpitied folly . " She is a consummate actress , and her transitions of mood are swift and supple . Her spiritual iridescence is marvellous , and her vehement caprices " cross and return and reissue " in a dazzling riot of fascinating contradictions . The character of Antony is simple : her character is elaborately complex . She is a thousand women in one , and his masculine directness is easily ensnared by her convoluted duplicity . His honesty is attracted by her dishonesty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a duel of opposites , a battle between the feminine voluptuary who is a jaded hedonist and the masculine ascetic whose manhood had been steeled by physical stoicisms . The passion of Cleopatra for Antony is the last effort of an insatiable courtesan whose vanity spurs her amorous energy to dominate " the demi-Atlas of the earth , the arm and burgonet of men . " Hers is a more selfish passion than Antony 's . It is lashed by her monstrous egoism , and it is devoid of tenderness and commiseration . It is charged with histrionic artifice . Antony also is a poseur , but in him passion is the enemy and not the ally of ambition . He knows that his humiliation is her triumph and that his triumph is her humiliation . He frets against the ignobility of his bondage , while she exults in it . Shakespeare shows us with marvellous skill the noble side of Antony 's character . In the conference with ( ; Tsar he suggests his dignity , his magnanimity , and his statesmanship . The figures of Caesar and Pompey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of policy with Octavia is not emphasized , and we are left in doubt as to his secret resolves , although we divine an infirmity of purpose in his soul . He seems to waver between his desire for power and his desire for Cleopatra . We feel that the , tragic issue is trembling in the balance . Antony appears to be so absolutely master of himself that we forget the fatal queen , and begin to doubt her distant spell ; but Shakespeare at this point restores the equilibrium of the action by interpolating scenes depicting Cleopatra in her most bewitching moods . The superb scene with the messenger shows us the tigress let loose in her , and convinces us that she will not languidly let go her prey . We see also the more human and more pathetic elements in her subtle nature . We are moved by her fierce jealousy , by her savage fury , and by her throbbing cry of hungry loneliness : " Pity me . Cliarmian , But do not speak to me . " In that brief and simple phrase the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are conquered by her grief and despair . Her unlovely vices seem to be purified by her fiery yearning , for when any elemental passion seizes the soul it lifts it far above the petty measurements of morality and arrests our awe . The force that impels human nature in these moments of fierce emotion is the blind force of nature , the thunder and lightning of the soul , and we feel that for the moralist to rebuke its devastating energy is an impertinence . The laws which govern the forces of human nature are more mysterious than the laws which govern the forces of matter , and we do not know whether the human passion is the product of the human will or whether the human will is only a part of the eternal illusion of consciousness . Another device which Shakespeare employs to emphasize the glamour of Cleopatra is the magical speech which he puts into the mouth of the rough old soldier , Enobarbus , who throughout the action plays the part of cynical commentator and sardonic raisonneur . He sees through all the gossamer sophistries of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Enobarbus is neither prig nor puritan , but he is not cheated by Antony 's posturings . He knows his captain 's temper and clearly foresees the inevitable end of his attempt to reconcile things irreconcilable . His grimly dispassionate point ? of view makes his panegyric of Cleopatra convincing . If it had been put into the mouth of Antony we should have attributed its ecstatic poetry to the romantic imagination of the lover . It may be said that the gorgeous verbal magic of these famous lines is not in keeping with the character of the rough old warrior , but Enobarbus is a man of the world as well as a soldier , and a shrewd natural philosopher withal . He is not a dry moralist ; he is a jovial believer in " the nobleness of life . " His soldiership does not prevent him from sleeping day out of countenance and making the night light with drinking . Moreover , his proper pride in his master makes him gild his folly . He has the real swagger and braggadocio of the soldier , and he delights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His loyalty to Antony moves , him to paint the enchantments of his enchantress . He glosses over the coarser traits of Cleopatra 's character , and depicts her with the brush of idealizing romance . Shakespeare takes care throughout the play to keep the vicious and vulgar element of her nature in the background . He allows it to break out here and there , but only often enough to suggest the rich complexity of her personality without alienating our sympathy . The moralist may accuse Shakespeare of romantic falsehood , and complain that by enhancing the grace of vice he masks its grossness . He may censure the poet for turning a strumpet into a passionist whose tragic love dazzles the imagination . But Shakespeare was a dramatist and not a moralist . He moulded the clay of life without troubling about the moral lesson . Moreover , life is as immoral as art . The sinners of history have often outshone the saints , and even in our own day the romantic brilliance of the courtesan puts morality out of countenance in Paris and London and New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can hardly venture to assert that vice is invariably repulsive.
