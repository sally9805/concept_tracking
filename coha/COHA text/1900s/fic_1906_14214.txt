WILL ( Sitting on big table ) Of course . The International , you know , Gypsy  --  Lord 's  --  this afternoon . And he was a trifle smudgy , but he 's walked most of it off .

You hear him ! That was a nice thing to yell , in a London street , in mid-season , was n't it ? Bulwark of  --  I told you he was staring mad ! MALENA Bulwark of  --  Oh , how perfectly joyous !

How long do you suppose I 'm ' going to stand this without hitting out ? p. 7 ELEANOR But his legs  --  are n't his legs just a little  --  young ?

Seventeenth century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  ELEANOR ( Rising ) The real thing , not the romantic costume man , you know , but the everyday big , soldier sort . WILL And I could n't get an all-round model to save my neck . ( Rises . ) MALENA No , when one half of them was right , the other half was so queer ! ELEANOR And you could n't say that anything about Jack was really queer , even though his legs  --  ( Goes up stage . ) ( Re-enter HARRIET R. Ist. ) p. 8 JACK Oh , my legs be  --  ( Turns to HARRIET under impression that he is addressing ELEANOR . ) I say ! Do you see anything particular about my legs ? HARRIET Well , I should say , my dear young man , they looked  --  serviceable ! JACK Oh , I say ! Oh , hang it , you know !

Aunt Harriet , this is Jack Greatorex , Will 's American chum . They used to call them the Anglo-Saxon Alliance at Oxford , you know . Jack , this is my Aunt Harriet Phelps , who got in day before yesterday on the Lucania , and  --  ( HARRIET , moving forward , lurches , as if on ship . JACK catches her and passes her on to MALENA . ) HARRIET And , as you observe , does not yet find the floor consistently horizontal . Thank you !

ELEANOR And the dress  --  the dress is just here in this chest . ( Up stage , begins taking costume from chest . ) JACK Dress ? Do you mean to rig me up like a Guy Fawkes ? You 'll chaff my head off when you see me ! MALENA Never ! We 'll burn incense to your medieval splendor . HARRIET Especially Elspeth . JACK Especially who ? You do n't mean  --   --  MALENA Of course we do ! My pretty little sister Elspeth you 've heard so much about . Came over with Aunt Harriet and  --   --  p. 10 JACK The girl in the copper frame over there ? WILL That 's the girll ( Brings picture from chimney-piece , sets it on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm going to be introduced to that girl , togged out like a matinee idiot from a romantic novel , you  --   --  HARRIET If you care to interest my niece Elpspeth , Mr. Greatorex , you could n't hit a surer way . She simply has a passion for medieval junk . JACK Thank you ! And you think I should pass muster as medieval junk ? WILL Stuff ! If Dolly ever brings Elspeth back  --  which is doubtful  --  you can get into your own kit before she sees you , right enough . Now will you ? Yes or no ? JACK Well , if you 're so awfully keen on the Guy Fawkes question , I  --   --  MALENA Good old Jack ! ELEANOR You magnificent old Bulwark ! WILL It 'll be the jolliest go  --  regular case of all old friends around St. Paul 's ! Jack and Elspeth here , and Adrian Tompkyns promised to look in . JACK Adrian  --  You do n't mean Tubby Tompkyns ? p. 11 WILL He 's dropped the Tub . He 's gone in for Art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in for  --  My Aunt ! Has his uncle gone bankrupt ? ELEANOR No , but he will if Tompkyns paints many more thirty-foot canvases . MALENA And you asked that  --  Oh , Will ! WILL He invited himself , Gypsy , on my honor ! HARRIET You never learned the little song about , " Have courage , my boy , to say no ! " ( Rises , sits again in armchair . ) WILL Old Tompkyns is n't so bad in a crowd . Come , now ! And then Ken Paulton , he said this afternoon too  --   --  ELEANOR Ken Paulton ? ( Comes down , costume in her arms . ) Is he coming to-night ? MALENA ( Aside to WILL ) Now you 've done it ! WILL Well , he thought he might  --  but he may n't , you know  --  and  --  and  --   --  ELEANOR It does n't matter . Here 's the costume , Jack . It 'll be a made fit ! ( Gives costume to JACK . Sits at table R. JACK upstage examines costume. ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you monument of tact ! To warn her that Ken was coming , and give her the chance to  --   --  WILL ( Aside to MALENA ) I did put my foot in it , dear  --  but Eleanor 's a fearful idiot just the same . Poor old Ken ! JACK ( Coming down ) By Jove ! This would n't be a half bad shooting kit . Hold this a minute , Will . ( Gives WILL the belt of costume . ) I did n't know those old duffers ever wore anything so sports-manlike . The only masked ball I ever assisted at , I wore lace ruffles and a plush surtout . HARRIET Why go as a footman ? JACK What ? Oh , I say , ma'am , I was n't a footman . I was a French marquis , and a precious fool I looked ! MALENA Naturally . You never were a French marquis , so of course you could n't wear his clothes . JACK Well , I was n't ever a fighting chap in a leather jerkin , was I ? MALENA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big table . ) HARRIET ( Rising ) Reincarnation ! Dharmas and Karmas and Mahatmas ! I thought marriage would cure you of those flighty notions of yours . Did she ever tell you , nephew , that she was a gypsy three hundred years ago , and lived under a hedge ? ( Sits L. of big table. ) p. 13 WILL Often ! But I do n't mind  --  so long as I was under the hedge with her ! ( MALENA rises , and passing WILL , leans her head back over her shoulder for his kiss . ) JACK If you 're coming to that sort of thing , I will with a blush retire . Give us the belt , Will ! My Aunt ! but a fellow could break a head or two with that . Deuced good leather ! ( Swings belt round head . ) MALENA Oh , Jack ! ELEANOR Be careful ! JACK Where shall I put on the sacrificial garments , eh ? WILL Over across , in the workroom . JACK Right ! ( Exeunt JACK and WILL L @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England . ELEANOR ( Rising ) Dear Miss Phelps ! Let me draw you a cup . MALENA Nonsense , Eleanor ! Norah can brew it . ELEANOR I may send it in by Norah . My head is bothering me again . If you miss me , do n't mind . I shall be trying to sleep it off . ( Exit ELEANOR R. 3d . Stage darkens. ) p. 14 MALENA Poor old Ken ! HARRIET Poor old who ? MALENA Ken  --  Ken Paulton . The best , unluckiest old chap on earth ! HARRIET He 's the headache ? MALENA He 's the headache . ( Folds and replaces costumes in chest . ) HARRIET Hm-m ! She seems a nice girl . Quarrel ? MALENA No . Just  --  queerness . HARRIET Any just cause or impediment ? MALENA None at all . Splendid old estate down in Lincolnshire , and no kith or kin in the world . HARRIET No relations ? And she wo n't marry him ? There 's something wrong with that girl . MALENA There 's something queer with  --  ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost collides with NORAH , who enters with tea-tray ) Norah ! Without knocking ! I wish that you  --   --  NORAH Saints ' fend us , Miss Lena ! Do n't be wishin ' me ill  --  and it Midsummer Eve ! MALENA Why not , if you deserve it ? ( Comes down. ) p. 15 NORAH Because , acushla , wishes wished on Midsummer Eve come true and hold fast  --  ay , year-fast !  --  for you ca n't unwish them till it 's Midsummer Eve again ! ( Sets tray on chest . ) HARRIET More Mahatmas ! ( Re-enter WILL L. 3d . ) WILL Owls ! Where are your lights , Gypsy ? MALENA Light up , Norah ! ( NORAH crosses to table . ) Will , it 's dark  --  it 's positively dark  --  and that child Elspeth  --   --  NORAH The saints forbid Miss Elspeth 's been sayin ' this night o ' nights what she 's forever a-sayin ' ! WILL What 's that ? NORAH That she wishes she was back years in ages when things was bigger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Midsummer Eve  --  may the saints keep us !  --  but it 's she might be takin ' the road to yesterday . MALENA ( Sits R. front ) The road to yesterday ? Why , Norah , I thought that was the one road lost past finding . NORAH And why , Miss Lena ? Have n't we all travelled that road  --  all of us who 've had yesterdays  --  and sure ' a road 's no less a road that it lies behind us ! p. 16 HARRIET That person gives me the creeps ! ( JACK in seventeenth century dress swings noisily into doorway L. 3d . ) Good Heavens ! What 's that ? ( Re-enter JACK L. 3d . ) NORAH Protect us ! ' Twas n't mesilf that wished I was on the road to yesterday . ( Crosses herself . During ensuing scene lights candles on table and chimney-piece . ) JACK What 's the row ? WILL You 're the row . You 're the real thing . By the Lord , Jack , when you came swinging in there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sworn we were out in the open together  --  and the trees there  --  and the wood-smoke  --   --  MALENA ( Going to him ) Will ! WILL ( Passes hand over his eyes ) Right you are , Gypsy ! But is n't he enough to roll back the hands on the big dial ! JACK Do you know , I do n't feel half such an ass as I daresay I look . I feel quite natural and comfy . ( Discusses costume with WILL and MALENA . ) HARRIET It being Midsummer Eve , if I were to wish for tea  --   --  p. 17 NORAH ( Setting tray on big table ) Tea would be at your elbow , ma'am . As ' t is , if you 're plazed to take it . JACK I say ! Did n't I  --  I mean did n't they  --  wear a knife or something just here , under the hand ? WILL Did they ? Go over to the wall there and pick one , then . ( JACK and WILL go to wall R. Ist . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ R.3d . ) HARRIET That woman has got on my nerves . I sha n't know an easy minute till Elspeth comes . MALENA ( Going to door L. 3d ) She is wickedly late ! JACK Oh , skittles ! These knives are all the wrong sort . MALENA How do you know ? JACK Hang it ! How do I know how I know ? Our knives  --  I mean theirs  --  were shaped like  --   --  WILL ( Takes knife from drawing-table , holds it up ) How does this strike you ? MALENA Let me see it ! ( Takes knife . ) Oh , what a ripping old knife ! p. 18 JACK I fancy she did some ripping in her day . See that rust on the blade . Looks like  --   --  HARRIET If you say that , I 'll scream . You 're worse than Elspeth 's novels . You 're nightmares on legs . MALENA Nonsense , Auntie ! It 's a dear knife . JACK It 's the right one . Hand it over . MALENA Not I ! It belongs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Strikes once in air . ) JACK I say ! Who taught you how to handle a dagger ? MALENA Who wants teaching ? There 's only one way to handle it . Trust a gypsy for knowing that way ! Have n't I told you I 'm sure there 's a gypsy roosting somewhere in the branches of our family tree ? HARRIET If there is , he was hanged there ! MALENA Nothing likelier , dear . Where in the world did you pick up this knife , Will ? WILL Junk-shop . Got it for a song . The dealer says it was dredged out , a while ago , from a river bottom , down in Lincolnshire . JACK Anyhow , I do n't stir without it  --  so there goes your Bulwark ! ( Sits L. of drawing-table. ) p. 19 MALENA Selfish pig ! Well , I 'll lend it to you for an hour or two  --  then mind , it comes home to my sash . ( Gives knife to JACK . He puts it in his belt . ) No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the breast of your doublet  --  so ! ( Bends over him , slips knife inside his shirt . ) JACK ( Catching her hand ) I say , Malena !

Elspeth must n't catch you in your togs , and I 'm hammered if you get out of them till I 've a prize sketch of you ! ( Exit WILL L. 3d . ) JACK Have with you ! ( Exit JACK L. 3d . ) HARRIET What did he say that for ? MALENA Why should n't he ? NORAH ( Outside ) Be careful , darlin ' ! MALENA Hush ! HARRIET Gracious ! More nightmares ? MALENA No , no , but there 's somebody on the stairs . I do believe  --  yes  --   --  p. 20 HARRIET You do n't mean  --   --  MALENA It is ! O Auntie ! It 's Elspeth ! It 's Elspeth at last ! HARRIET Is there an ambulance surgeon in attendance ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NORAH and DOLLY seats ELSPETH R. of big table . ) ELSPETH Oh , my only Aunt Maria ! I 've been doing London ! HARRIET London has apparently returned the compliment . You look pretty thoroughly done . MALENA Dolly Foulis , I could box your ears ! DOLLY Nice grateful party you are ! And besides she vowed by all her grandfathers on Bunker Hill that she was n't a shade tired . And then when we got into the hansom she collapsed . ELSPETH I did not collapse . I only shut my eyes and meditated . I preferred to meditate  --  it was all so perfectly beautiful . NORAH Poor lamb ! Sure , she 's walked a hole in her shoe . MALENA If one might inquire what you have been doing ? ELSPETH Oh , such glorious heaps of things ! The Tower , and the Charterhouse , and the Abbey , and St. Giles , and St. Bartholomew , and St. Paul 's , and perfect caravans of other saints , and the Burlington Arcade , and I think it was eleven picture galleries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lincoln 's Inn , and some Dickensy places !

HARRIET Lunched at  --  Is there a homeopathic physician in this neighborhood ? ELSPETH Physician ? Nonsense ! I never was so well and happy in my life ! Everything was ever so much realler and beautifuller than I always knew it was . I 've been living in a seventeenth century play , and I 'm not coming back to commonplace for years .

MALENA Then you are going to put on a neglige and lie down on that divan , and have some tea and toast . ( Goes to divan R. ) ELSPETH Neglige sounds nice . Neglige it is ! Lend a hand , Norah !
