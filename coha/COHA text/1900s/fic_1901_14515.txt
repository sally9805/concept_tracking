Again ! MATTIE Putting on her slipper . You 'd better make her learn another chapter in the Bible , Tom . REV .

You just ask the matron of the Asylum where I used to be . What she do n't know about Purgatory ai n't worth talking about . MATTIE Aghast . Why , Simplicity ! You do n't know what you 're saying . SIMPLICITY JOHNSON Do n't I ? Guess you 'd think so if you 'd been at the Asylum . MATTIE Tom , you punish that child before you begin . It will tone you up . Goes out . REV .

" SIMPLICITY JOHNSON I 've said it once before , to-day , Pops , but it do n't seem to do much good . REV . THOMAS SINGLETON I guess it does as much good as learning a chapter in the Bible , and you can say it quicker . Come on now . SIMPLICITY JOHNSON I 'll try not to tease Miss Mattie any more . REV . THOMAS SINGLETON And try hard ! You try hard ! SIMPLICITY JOHNSON Pops , is Miss Mattie really your sister ? REV . THOMAS SINGLETON No . SIMPLICITY JOHNSON Then what is she ?

Now I must get to work on my sermon . SIMPLICITY JOHNSON Back of MINISTER , with her arms around his neck . Then you 've just given her a home , as you 've taken in Aunt Melissy and Uncle Bill and me , Pops ? REV . THOMAS SINGLETON She says it 's you and Uncle Bill and Aunt Melissy who 've taken me in .

Giggles until she is out of the door . REV . THOMAS SINGLETON Well , now we must fix this somehow for poor Mrs. Woodbridge . How can anyone be angry at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them on the table . Pleasant change from wristlets ! They 'll fit Uncle Bill . Going toward the door , he calls . Mattie ! Gracious ! I must get to work . He sits down once more at his table .

Me and Melissy been for a stroll . Come along . To AUNT MELISSY . The Minister 's here and he can decide for us . AUNT MELISSY says " H-a-y-e ? " UNCLE BILL repeats . REV . THOMAS SINGLETON Raising his voice . Well , Aunt Melissy , you and Uncle Bill have n't been having another argument , have you ? AUNT MELISSY Yes , we have , Minister . I say there 's no such thing as love at first sight , and Mr. William says there is .

I did n't think , Minister , when you asked me to come and live with you , I was going to have the end of my days made miserable by the same questions that turned their beginning topsy-turvy . UNCLE BILL That ai n't the p'int  --  that ai n't the p'int . The p'int is , is there such a thing as love at first sight ? Both going to the MINISTER ; MINISTER scratches his head . MATTIE enters p. 18 MATTIE Now look here , Aunt Melissy and Uncle Bill , you must n't interrupt the Minister . He 's at work on to-morrow 's sermon . She hurries them off . Tom , what do you think ?

Come here , Bridget . Do n't you go ! Miss Mattie will be sure to come around all right tomorrow . You leave her to me . BRIDGET To you , sorr ?

Bring her right in ! BRIDGET starts to go out ; meets MRS . WOODBRIDGE coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Goes out . MRS . HERBERT WOODBRIDGE Good morning , Doctor . REV . THOMAS SINGLETON Wo n't you sit down ? Indicates chair by the table . MRS . HERBERT WOODBRIDGE Mrs. Brown has told you , Doctor ? REV . THOMAS SINGLETON Sitting on the organ bench . Yes , and I want to talk over with you the best way to fix it . MRS . HERBERT WOODBRIDGE First , I want to tell you how it was I came here two years ago . I wanted to leave the city , where all the associations were most painful , and , besides , I thought my little boy might be stronger in the country . My husband  --  I had better be quite frank with you  --  my husband soon after our marriage began to drink heavily  --  then he lost all his money on the horses and  --  what little I had  --  Rises . Did I do wrong to leave him ? p. 20 REV . THOMAS SINGLETON Rising and coming to MRS . WOODBRIDGE . Could you have helped him by holding on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With averted face . That 's what I sometimes ask myself  --  when the old love for my ideal of him comes back with overwhelming force . REV . THOMAS SINGLETON Ah , well ! Each one 's heart and mind is the best court for them to appeal to . MRS . HERBERT WOODBRIDGE I thought I ought at any rate to take the boy away before he grew old enough to understand . He has been baptized in sorrow , and I want his life to be confirmed with joy somewhere , or somehow  --  REV . THOMAS SINGLETON But he 's so much better and brighter already . MRS . HERBERT WOODBRIDGE Joyfully . Oh , do you think so ? Well , that 's my story , except when I came here I never lied . I said I had no husband  --  I did n't think it necessary to explain more . But of course when I was asked whether I was a widow or divorced , to-day , there was nothing to do but to speak the truth , which I did . REV . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm afraid you were n't prepared to find such good people as they are here . Really , you know , so narrow . Were you ? Moving towards her . But I 'm stretching them all I can . p. 21 MRS . HERBERT WOODBRIDGE And perhaps I can be of some use as a wedge ? REV . THOMAS SINGLETON Well  --  to go back to the choir  --  MRS . HERBERT WOODBRIDGE I 'd resign in a minute if it was n't for Dick . I want to make money enough to have him treated . Little lame backs are made whole now-a-days , you know , without miracles . REV . THOMAS SINGLETON I know  --  I was thinking of that the other day , but I believe it will be best to have you resign now , anyway , and let the congregation hear Miss Mealey sing a solo again . We wo n't need much more to get them all on our side . MRS . HERBERT WOODBRIDGE Rising , puts out her hand . How encouraging you are ! Meanwhile , I shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to live in . REV . THOMAS SINGLETON Rises and takes her hand . That 'll be easy enough . MRS . HERBERT WOODBRIDGE So I thought , but on my way here , three ladies with empty third-floors told me they had n't any rooms . REV . THOMAS SINGLETON Well , I 'll tell you what  --  you and Dick come here and live with us . MRS . HERBERT WOODBRIDGE Here ? Oh , no ! We could n't do that . p. 22 REV . THOMAS SINGLETON Why not ? Miss Mattie 'll make it all right . Come now , get Dick and your trunk , and stay . MRS . HERBERT WOODBRIDGE But are you sure you 've room ? REV . THOMAS SINGLETON Oh , yes , yes  --  plenty of room . MRS . HERBERT WOODBRIDGE But you have so many people here now . REV . THOMAS SINGLETON Why , no we have n't  --  no one at all . MRS . HERBERT WOODBRIDGE There 's Miss Mattie and Simplicity  --  I know them  --  REV . THOMAS SINGLETON In thought . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but that 's all . MRS . HERBERT WOODBRIDGE Aunt Melissy ? Perhaps she wo n't like me . REV . THOMAS SINGLETON Oh , yes she will , and you 'll like her , too . She 's a nice old person , a real lady . Lost all her money in a bank that shut up suddenly , and has a perfect horror of dying in the poorhouse , so I told her to come and die here . MRS . HERBERT WOODBRIDGE And did she ? REV . THOMAS SINGLETON Yes , that is , she came here , but I am glad to say she has n't died yet . MRS . HERBERT WOODBRIDGE And who 's Uncle Bill ? p. 23 REV . THOMAS SINGLETON Why , you know Uncle Bill Walters ? MRS . HERBERT WOODBRIDGE Oh , the old man who rings the church bell ? REV . THOMAS SINGLETON Yes . He was living alone and had to do his own cooking  --  could n't make enough money to pay a servant . So I told him just to come and live with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MRS . HERBERT WOODBRIDGE Turns to him . How good of you ! REV . THOMAS SINGLETON Why , no  --  he 's a splendid character . I consider it a privilege to have him  --  he 's sweet on Aunt Melissy . You must n't cut her out now , will you ? MRS . HERBERT WOODBRIDGE Laughing . No , I 'll try not . REV . THOMAS SINGLETON And do n't mind Miss Mattie if she is a little cantankerous at first . She always does that when any woman comes to the house . It will take about seven days for her to find out that you do n't want to marry me . MRS . HERBERT WOODBRIDGE Maybe Miss Mattie wo n't like me on account of my trouble . REV . THOMAS SINGLETON Oh , dear no . Mattie 's the broadest minded , most generous creature in the world . p. 24 MATTIE Outside . Yells . T-o-m ! REV . THOMAS SINGLETON That 's Mattie now . MRS . WOODBRIDGE starts toward the door , frightened . Wait a minute . I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mattie ! MATTIE Entering ; rather shortly . What is it , Tom ? Oh ! Good morning , Mrs. Woodbridge . MRS . HERBERT WOODBRIDGE Good morning , Miss Mattie . REV . THOMAS SINGLETON Timidly , from behind the desk . Mattie , Mrs. Woodbridge is coming to live with us . MATTIE Astounded . What ! MRS . HERBERT WOODBRIDGE Dr. Singleton has asked me to , but I have told him I do n't think I ought to accept his kind offer . REV . THOMAS SINGLETON We 'll feel rather hurt if she does n't  --  now , wo n't we , Mattie ? MATTIE A side to the MINISTER . When is she coming ? REV . THOMAS SINGLETON This evening . MATTIE This evening ! Disgusted. p. 25 MRS . HERBERT WOODBRIDGE Perhaps it will inconvenience you to have Dick and me here ! MATTIE Oh , I suppose I can stand it if the Minister can . REV . THOMAS SINGLETON To MRS . WOODBRIDGE . There , I told you Mattie would be pleased . You must n't mind Mattie 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather I did n't come this evening , Miss Mattie ? MATTIE Well , I must own  --  MRS . WOODBRIDGE walks over to the window . REV . THOMAS SINGLETON To MATTIE , interrupting . That you 'd be disappointed if she did n't  --  eh , Mattie ? Winks at MATTIE . MATTIE Hesitating . No , Tom , that was n't what I was going to say , but I suppose it 's none of my business . Turning to bookcase and arranging books . Goes out . REV . THOMAS SINGLETON To MRS . WOODBRIDGE . Now , you stay right here , and I 'll send Uncle Bill after Dick and your trunk . MRS . HERBERT WOODBRIDGE Do you think I 'd better ? p. 26 REV . THOMAS SINGLETON Yes . MRS . HERBERT WOODBRIDGE Well , thank you ever so much . I 'll tell Uncle Bill . You need n't trouble  --  he 's on the porch . Goes out ; the MINISTER starts to follow . MATTIE Coming back . Now , brother Tom , I would just like to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want me to give up my room ! REV . THOMAS SINGLETON Turning back to Mattie . Why , no , Mattie . She 's to have mine . MATTIE Yours ? Then where will you sleep ? REV . THOMAS SINGLETON Here . I shall do nicely . MATTIE Here ! REV . THOMAS SINGLETON Yes . Looking around , points to the lounge. on the lounge . MATTIE You sleep on that lounge ? What 'll you do with your feet ? REV . THOMAS SINGLETON Laughing . Hang ' em over the end , and then all the blood will rush out of my head , and then I shall sleep splendidly . MRS . WOODBRIDGE re enters , saying : MRS . HERBERT WOODBRIDGE Thank you , Mr. Walters , very much . p. 27 REV . THOMAS SINGLETON Mattie was just saying your room would want a little arranging for you . MRS . HERBERT WOODBRIDGE Taking MATTIE 'S arm . She must let me help her . To MATTIE . Yes , Miss Mattie , I insist . Show me where it is . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ REV . THOMAS SINGLETON Why no , Mattie , it 's the room over the parlor . MATTIE Goes up to the desk , sharply . Now , brother Tom , I think I am the one who takes care of this house , and I say it 's the room over the front porch . MATTIE and MRS . WOODBRIDGE go out together . REV . THOMAS SINGLETON Now , that 's too bad . It 's just like Mattie  --  so unselfish  --  going to give up her own room ! Well , there 's no use arguing with her . Mattie 's bound to have her own way , and I must get to work on my sermon . He sits down at his desk once more . Enter BRIDGET , with her hair done up in curlpapers . BRIDGET If you plaze , sorr , there is such a nice young couple in the hall that wants to get married . p. 28 REV . THOMAS SINGLETON Writing . Actual Purgatory . BRIDGET Astounded , coming down .

BRIDGET Oh , St. Patrick ! Laughing . I thought you was referring to the marriage state . I axes your pardon . There 's a young couple out in the hall on the edge of matrimony , who are wantin ' you to give them a wee bit of a push over . REV . THOMAS SINGLETON Well , send them in , Bridget , and tell them they must be married quickly or , no  --  I mean they must  --  but do n't tell them ,  --  because I really have got to work on my sermon . BRIDGET Sure . She 's a darlin ' bit of a wife . Showing them in at the door . This way , if you plaze . Enter HERBERT WOODBRIDGE , followed by MARY LARKIN . BRIDGET goes out .

The fat boy , passing through last , stops a second and watches the children . The last couple through start back single file through the arbor and circle round the MINISTER , all running off through the schoolhouse .

MARY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In surprise the four women follow , and look in through the window . On seeing the new teacher , cheering from the children is heard , as SCENE : The orchard back of the MINISTER 'S house . A covered porch opens out into the garden . It is an Autumn day ; the ground is strewn with fallen leaves . There is an apple tree with apples on it , and under it a bench . The MINISTER 'S house is to the Left . On the Right , a little path leads up-hill through trees , to a gate . A golden Autumn light pervades everywhere . UNCLE BILL and AUNT MELISSY are discovered sitting on a bench under the apple tree . SIMPLICITY is in the tree , watching them from above . AUNT MELISSY I 'm sure , Mr. Bill , it 's a long time since I 've thought of such a thing as marriage and giving in marriage . UNCLE BILL I ai n't sot much store on it . AUNT MELISSY Holding her hand to her ear . H-a-y-ee ? UNCLE BILL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself for the last forty years . AUNT MELISSY But I must say it 's a bit comfortin ' to an old body like me to hear as there 's someone cares enough for her to want her to change her name . UNCLE BILL Then you think , Melissy dear , you kin trust your life to me ? SIMPLICITY drops autumn leaves on them from above . I guess the wind 's raisin ' . p. 68 AUNT MELISSY And you 'd never let me die in the poorhouse , would you , Mr. Bill ? UNCLE BILL No , siree , Melissa . AUNT MELISSY Ha-a-ye- ? SIMPLICITY drops more leaves on them . UNCLE BILL Looking up . Sort o ' spasmotic breezes ever ' now and then  --  hope ' tai n't goin ' ter rain . AUNT MELISSY It will be more convenient for the Minister , too , havin ' us married , Mr. William . UNCLE BILL Yes , it 'll give him an extra room . AUNT MELISSY H-a-y-e- ? UNCLE BILL Louder . I say it 'll give him an extra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made me ask yer to-day . Thought as how we wus getting sort o ' cramped fur room , in the Parsonage . AUNT MELISSY You must n't say we wus , if I am going to be Mrs. Walters . I 'll have to teach you grammar , Mr. William . UNCLE BILL Then it 's all settled , is it , Melissy ? SIMPLICITY drops an apple on UNCLE BILL 'S head . He picks up the apple . We 're goin ' ter have an all-fired early apple crop . Hev this one with me , Melissy . I 've heard tell of them heathen gods gave Venus a gold apple cas she was a pretty girl . p. 69 AUNT MELISSY H-a-y-e ? UNCLE BILL I say I 've heard tell of one of them heathen gods gave Venus a gold apple cas she was a pretty gal . AUNT MELISSY Now , go ' long , Mr. Bill , I 'm not a pretty girl . UNCLE BILL I did n't say ye wus ; I said Venus wus a pretty gal . AUNT MELISSY Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're married . Come , let us ask the Minister . They start to go to the house as BRIDGET and MR . BROWN come out . BRIDGET You 'll find him in the orchard . BRIDGET goes in again . HOSEA BROWN Hello  --  Uncle Bill  --  is the Minister here ? UNCLE BILL No , sir , he 's to Miss Canning 's . Kin we do anythin ' fur yer ? HOSEA BROWN Well , I du n no . I 've come to warn the Minister , in a friendly way , there 's trouble brewing in the church . ' How is he to-day ? He 's behaved sort o ' absent-minded and curious- like the last few days . AUNT MELISSY To BROWN . The Minister was all put out by the singing in the church Sunday . Said he missed the inspiration of Mis ' Woodbridge 's voice . p. 70 HOSEA BROWN Ah , he owned up , did he ? That was a mistake . Well , the trouble is , most of the congregation take a different view and sez it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the key again in the same old place . AUNT MELISSY H-a-y-e ? HOSEA BROWN Made ' em feel sort o ' comfortable hearing Molly Mealey getting off the key again in the same old place . AUNT MELISSY O-h ! HOSEA BROWN To UNCLE BILL . Mis ' Woodbridge settlin ' down here ter stay ? UNCLE BILL She 's come for good . I guess  --  anyway for a long spell . Her boy was took sick yesterday . HOSEA BROWN That 's too bad ! Things are going against the Minister . They 're all saying he give ' em an old sermon last Sunday . UNCLE BILL He had a new one begun  --  a scorcher  --  I guess . About whether there 's a Purgatory or not . HOSEA BROWN That 's just what they wanted . He ought to have given it to ' em hot . UNCLE BILL I think he took the side of there being no actual place of the kind . HOSEA BROWN There you have it ! Just goin ' contrary to the folks ' wishes . The people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tell the Minister I 've come to tell him there 's a private meeting of the Council will be held pretty soon , and I 'd advise him , as a friend , to happen in , and if he can say as Mis ' Wood- bridge has gone to the City on the 5:30 P.M. train , it 'd be the best thing fur him . During this speech , AUNT MELISSY edges over to BROWN , listening. p. 71 AUNT MELISSY H-a-y-e ? HOSEA BROWN Oh , dog-gon-it  --  you tell her ! Walking up and down . UNCLE BILL Mis ' Woodbridge 's going to the City on the 5:30 train . SIMPLICITY JOHNSON From the tree . Hello , Mr. Brown . HOSEA BROWN Hey ? What ? UNCLE BILL Surprised , looking about . It 's Simplicity . HOSEA BROWN Also looking about . Where is she ? SIMPLICITY JOHNSON In the tree . Here I am , up in the tree . HOSEA BROWN Oh , I thought you were n't allowed to climb the tree ? SIMPLICITY JOHNSON Eating an apple . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . HOSEA BROWN There , that 's just what everyone says  --  he lets the child do as she pleases . UNCLE BILL They 'd better not talk to me about the Minister ! I can tell yer that I have n't been ringing the bell there for twenty years with this arm , without putting some muscle into it . Who bought the bell and give it ter the church ? Why , the Minister . p. 72 AUNT MELISSY Who has n't heard correctly . Yes , indeed , I was a great belle in my day . BROWN looks disgusted and walks away . UNCLE BILL We 're talking about the church bell the Minister gave . The ding , ding , ding dong bell . AUNT MELISSY Oh , yes , indeed , and he just the same as give the church itself . When he first came here , he started right in by lifting the mortgage of three thousand dollars out of his own pocket . SIMPLICITY JOHNSON Yes , siree , and I heard every word you said , Mr. Brown , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what 's right in spite of all the Councils in creation . HOSEA BROWN But Simplicity , the Minister 'd better humor the Council . It 's for them to decide who 's to be in their pulpit . SIMPLICITY JOHNSON I do n't care who decides what . I 'll bet on Pops every time . HOSEA BROWN Well , I 'm his friend , too . I 'm going ter do all I kin . Goes out through the gate . SIMPLICITY JOHNSON Uncle Bill , I 'm awful glad you and Aunt Melissy are going to be married , but you 'd better break it to Miss Mattie first . Pops will be tickled to death , but Mattie will throw a fit . p. 73 AUNT MELISSY To UNCLE BILL . H-a-y-e ? What did she say ? UNCLE BILL She 's offering us her congratulations . AUNT MELISSY Thank you , Simplicity . SIMPLICITY JOHNSON Aunt Melissy , I 'll be your brides- maid . AUNT MELISSY H-a-y-e ? What did she say ? UNCLE BILL She says she wishes she was going ter be married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Simplicity , plenty of time for you . SIMPLICITY JOHNSON Uncle Bill , ai n't you ashamed of yerself , sparkin ' the girls at your age ? UNCLE BILL What 's age got to do with it ? AUNT MELISSY H-a-y-e ? What did she say ? UNCLE BILL She said you look twenty years younger than yer did yesterday . They go into the house laughing . SIMPLICITY JOHNSON Still from the tree . I do n't want ter marry anyone in the world but Pops  --  I 'm goin ' to wait until I 'm grown up fer him . The trouble is , I 'm afraid I 'll never be good enough . The MINISTER has entered through the gate and is going towards the house . SIMPLICITY throws an apple and hits the MINISTER. p. 74 REV . THOMAS SINGLETON Hello , is that you , Simple ? SIMPLICITY JOHNSON Yep . Come along up . REV . THOMAS SINGLETON I climb into that tree ? Why , what would Mattie say ? SIMPLICITY JOHNSON She would n't care unless you tore your pants . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you come down  --  come on  --  or you 'll get into trouble . Look at all the trouble one woman got us into by fooling with an apple tree . The MINISTER takes his hat off and lays it on the bench , going up to the tree . He coaxes SIMPLICITY to come down . REV . THOMAS SINGLETON Come on down  --  come on down . SIMPLICITY JOHNSON No , not unless you come up after me first . REV . THOMAS SINGLETON We 'll see if you wo n't ! The MINISTER , reaching up to her , catches her  --  trying to pull her down by the ankles . SIMPLICITY kicks and laughs . SIMPLICITY JOHNSON Pops , you tickle me ! REV . THOMAS SINGLETON Come down , then . I 'll paddy- whack you  --  that 's what I 'll do , if you don't. p. 75 SIMPLICITY JOHNSON I 'm not afraid . Ouch ! REV . THOMAS SINGLETON Are you coming ? SIMPLICITY JOHNSON No  --  ouch ! REV . THOMAS SINGLETON Yes you are , too . SIMPLICITY loses her hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dress catches on a snag as the MINISTER helps her down . SIMPLICITY JOHNSON Oh , did you hear that ? REV . THOMAS SINGLETON Did it tear ? SIMPLICITY JOHNSON Yes , and you did it too , Pops ! REV . THOMAS SINGLETON By Jupiter  --  what 'll Mattie say ? SIMPLICITY JOHNSON Trying to fix tear . She walloped me yesterday fer doin ' it , with her hair brush . REV . THOMAS SINGLETON Try and keep out of sight until after prayers again . She did n't punish you the other night , did she ? SIMPLICITY JOHNSON No , of course not , after the chapter you read , Pops . I thought it was awful good of you to choose one about being patient with transgressors . She takes an apple out of her waist , and bites it. p. 76 REV . THOMAS SINGLETON I was n't thinking of you , Simple . I read that for Mrs. Woodbridge . SIMPLICITY JOHNSON Throwing down apple . Say , Pops , you 've got to stop that . Mr. Brown has just been here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? To say what ? SIMPLICITY JOHNSON He says the church people are mad as hornets at you . REV . THOMAS SINGLETON Mad at me ? Why ? SIMPLICITY JOHNSON ' Cause you let Mrs. Woodbridge come and live with us . REV . THOMAS SINGLETON What business is that of theirs ? SIMPLICITY JOHNSON There 's a meeting of the Council this afternoon . REV . THOMAS SINGLETON Angry . What ? A church meeting without me ? SIMPLICITY JOHNSON That 's it , Pops . Get mad at them  --  do n't you be afraid ! REV . THOMAS SINGLETON Did he say anything else ? SIMPLICITY JOHNSON Yes . Lots ! They all liked Miss Mealey 's singing . Giggling . REV . THOMAS SINGLETON Laughing . No ? Did he say that , Simple ? Laughs . Oh , that 's too good . The MINISTER and SIMPLICITY both laugh. p. 77 SIMPLICITY JOHNSON And you preached an old sermon day before yesterday . REV . THOMAS SINGLETON Well , I did  --  I did . I could n't get Mary Larkin 's face out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Woodbridge ? Oh , they 're mad  --  you took her in . REV . THOMAS SINGLETON Poor woman ! They 'd hound her out of the village if they could . SIMPLICITY JOHNSON That 's what he said , Pops . It 'd be good for you if you could happen in at the meeting and say that Mrs. Woodbridge was going to the City on the 5:30 train . MATTIE enters from house . REV . THOMAS SINGLETON Angry . I 'll happen into the meeting and tell them she wo n't do any such thing . MATTIE On the steps . What , Tom ? REV . THOMAS SINGLETON Why , there 's trouble in the church over Mrs. Woodbridge . They 've driven her out of the choir and out of her home , and now they want to drive her out of the Parsonage . MATTIE Coming down . Well , I 'd like to see them do it . SIMPLICITY JOHNSON Bully for you ! Running to MATTIE and taking her hand. p. 78 MATTIE Looking at SIMPLICITY 'S hands . For goodness ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filthy ! SIMPLICITY goes , but sits down on the steps . REV . THOMAS SINGLETON She shall stay with me as long as she wants to . The Parsonage belongs to me . I 'm going to give it to the church , but I have n't yet . MATTIE But Tom , dear , the church is n't yours . REV . THOMAS SINGLETON What do you mean , Mattie ? MATTIE The Council have the power to put you out of the church for good . REV . THOMAS SINGLETON Put me out ? Put me  --  why , Mattie  --  how could you ever think of such a thing  --  me ? MATTIE Well , suppose that you did n't satisfy them ? REV . THOMAS SINGLETON Did n't satisfy them ? What do they want ? I 've given them most of my money and all of my time . Why , the bell in that little square tower over there has never rung out once , in all these fifteen years for service , without our gate latching behind me before the third stroke . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? REV . THOMAS SINGLETON They 'd never ask me to resign . Why , they could n't do a cruel thing like that ! They ca n't help knowing that my heart and soul are mortared up in those red brick walls  --  Why , Mattie  --  Mattie  --  how could you ? He goes over to the bench and sits down. p. 79 MATTIE Good gracious , Tom , I did n't want to make you feel this bad  --  REV . THOMAS SINGLETON Oh , well , I guess Simple has been exaggerating a little . MATTIE Simple ! Now I wish I 'd punished her last night for tearing her dress again . Perhaps I will , anyway , when I go in . SIMPLICITY , who has been listening , runs into the house . REV . THOMAS SINGLETON How 's little Dick ? MATTIE ' Bout the same  --  fever high , but the Doctor says there 's no danger . But that is n't my news ! It 's Aunt Melissy . REV . THOMAS SINGLETON Rising . Not dead ? MATTIE Laughing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Married ? Laughing incredulously . MATTIE She and Uncle Bill want your consent . REV . THOMAS SINGLETON Jupiter ! What did you tell them ? MATTIE Never was so stunned in my life ! I was speechless ! REV . THOMAS SINGLETON Speechless !

REV . THOMAS SINGLETON Then I must use my influence , if I have any , against you . HERBERT WOODBRIDGE You 've got a lot of influence . That 's the curse of it ! I 'll tell you what it is  --  I believe you are in love with her . REV . THOMAS SINGLETON I ? HERBERT WOODBRIDGE Yes . Why did you take such an interest in her , and why did you give her a ring off your own hand , and one that you were evidently pretty fond of , too ? And why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course you 're in love with her ! I want to know if you think it 's an honest thing for you to take a man 's wife away from him at the very moment of his marriage ! REV . THOMAS SINGLETON Look here , young man , do you know who you 're talking to ? HERBERT WOODBRIDGE Yes , I do  --  I 'm talking to the Minister whom I asked to marry me , and who , instead of doing so , is amusing himself by casting slurs on my character . A caddish thing to do ! p. 87 REV . THOMAS SINGLETON Cad ! You 'd better take that back . HERBERT WOODBRIDGE No , I wo n't . It was an underhand thing to do . Makes a motion to strike the MINISTER . REV . THOMAS SINGLETON Holding off at arm 's length . Look out ! Preaching is n't the only thing I can do . I 'm the captain of our ball nine , and the Congregationalists did n't knock out the Methodists last Spring for nothing . I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . HERBERT WOODBRIDGE Use them !

HERBERT WOODBRIDGE Shamed , turns from MINISTER . I beg your pardon  --  I did forget myself . REV . THOMAS SINGLETON Why , you 've no muscle ! If you 'd been half as ready to fight the Evil One as you are to pitch into me , you 'd get more strength of one kind , anyway . p. 88 HERBERT WOODBRIDGE You 're right  --  I beg your pardon  --  it is I who am the cad .

HERBERT WOODBRIDGE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THOMAS SINGLETON Because there 's hope for a man who can see he 's been wrong and acknowledges it . You did n't behave right to your wife and boy , did you ? HERBERT WOODBRIDGE No , I did n't , and I 'm sorry for it , too . A year ago I wanted to go to Lucy and ask her to try me again , but my sister told me I 'd be a fool . I had a feeling I 'd like to see the boy . I used to wonder how he looked . I could only remember him as such a little chap . REV . THOMAS SINGLETON With his hands on HERBERT 'S shoulders . Look here , there 's good in you . HERBERT WOODBRIDGE Not much , I guess . REV . THOMAS SINGLETON Yes , there is .

HERBERT WOODBRIDGE Oh , I am tired out  --  I did n't know what I was saying ! I do n't know what you think of me  --  but I love him in spite of everything  --  with all my heart ! REV . THOMAS SINGLETON There , there , come and take a walk under the trees . It will do you good . I 'll go a little way with you . They go out . AUNT MELISSY enters from the house , followed by UNCLE BILL , arguing . AUNT MELISSY No  --  I do n't want anything more to do with you ! UNCLE BILL Look here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so sudden-like . AUNT MELISSY Yes , I must . I could n't look forward to a life of bickering and quarrelling like this  --  UNCLE BILL But if you 'd only just let my grammar alone , Melissy  --  we 'd be all right . AUNT MELISSY Yes , but your grammar would n't be . I hate to say it to you , Mr. Bill , especially in anger , but you must know that some people consider it a misalliance for me to marry you anyway . UNCLE BILL What 's that , Melissy ? p. 92 AUNT MELISSY Marrying beneath my social station . UNCLE BILL tries to interrupt . Not that I think it , goodness knows ! UNCLE BILL Well , then , why not shake hands , kiss and make up ! AUNT MELISSY Puts her hands to her ears and says : H-a-y-e ? UNCLE BILL I say why not shake hands , and kiss and make up ! AUNT MELISSY turns away from UNCLE BILL . AUNT MELISSY No , I ca n't forget your spirit when I corrected your grammar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once , Melissy . AUNT MELISSY Well , you ought n't have given me the chance . UNCLE BILL All right , then  --  if it 's all over  --  it 's over . I did lose my temper , but I 'm likely to do it again . I guess it 's better so . But I ca n't keep these here . Handing her one slipper which he takes from under his vest . You 'll have to take yer present back . Handing her the other slipper . Perhaps you 'll find somebody else that they 'll fit , whose tongue will fit the English language better  --  AUNT MELISSY goes toward the gate . UNCLE BILL watches her until she gets to the gate . Following . Where be yer goin ' , Miss Melissy ? p. 93 AUNT MELISSY H-a-y-e ? UNCLE BILL I say where be yer goin ' ? AUNT MELISSY At the gate . I 'm going down Lovers ' Lane to think . Hope it 'll do me some good . And you need n't wait to take me home after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want yer ! Goes off down the lane . UNCLE BILL In thought at the foot of the steps of house . I know what I 'll do  --  I 'll go and buy one of them spelling grammars first thing in the morning . Goes into the house . SIMPLICITY JOHNSON Rushes out from the house , carrying a milk-pail , MARY LARKIN following her . SIMPLICITY calls . Pops ! The MINISTER comes from orchard . Pops , here 's Miss Larkin come to see you  --  says she brought something of yours back . REV . THOMAS SINGLETON How do you do , Miss Larkin ? MARY LARKIN How do you do , Doctor Singleton ? REV . THOMAS SINGLETON Where are you going , Simple ? SIMPLICITY JOHNSON Oh , you need n't hint , Pops . I know two 's company and three ai n't allowed , but I could n't stay if I wanted . Aunt Mattie found a tear in my dress , and is making me milk the cow for punishment . p. 94 REV . THOMAS SINGLETON I guess you 've worn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next thing I wear out will be that cow . Calling back from the gate . I guess she 'll wish she 'd never been born , before I get through milking her . REV . THOMAS SINGLETON Simple , do n't forget you 're a member of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals . SIMPLICITY JOHNSON Running down to the MINISTER . Pops , when Miss Mattie gave me that there order , I temporarily resigned and stuck my badge on Bridget ! Pops , I wo n't do a thing to that cow ! Runs out . REV . THOMAS SINGLETON Do n't you like Simple ? MARY LARKIN Coming down from the porch . Yes , of course I do . REV . THOMAS SINGLETON She 's an orphan . Nobody could understand her  --  thought she was bad . She was in three asylums in two months , and after a while there was n't one in the State that would have her  --  she 's so sensitive , it hurts her feelings . I took her to live in the Parsonage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LARKIN Going over to the bench under the tree . Doctor , were you ever unkind to anybody ? p. 95 REV . THOMAS SINGLETON Following MARY . I am afraid I was not as kind to Mr. Woodbridge on Saturday as I ought to have been . MARY LARKIN Oh , that reminds me why I came  --  I am afraid you thought it very odd of me coming over here so often  --  now own up , did n't you , Doctor ? REV . THOMAS SINGLETON No , I do n't know as I thought anything . I was just enjoying it without thinking  --  MARY LARKIN Oh , Doctor , may I have an apple ? REV . THOMAS SINGLETON Yes , indeed , you must excuse me for not offering you one before . Looking up the tree , he sees an apple , but it is out of his reach . He jumps for the apple . Here 's a beauty ! MARY LARKIN Yes , but it 's out of your reach . REV . THOMAS SINGLETON Wish it were the only thing out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a trance , and then goes to MARY . MARY LARKIN Nothing ought to be out of your reach , Doctor . And nothing would be if it only knew you wanted it , I 'm sure . Turns her face away . REV . THOMAS SINGLETON Almost about to embrace her . Jupiter , I was forgetting about your apple ! Oh , here 's one . He stands on the bench to reach the apple , and hands it to MARY. p. 96 MARY LARKIN A splendid one  --  have you got a knife ? REV . THOMAS SINGLETON Yes , siree  --  a beauty . The Deacons gave it to me two Christmases ago . MARY LARKIN Handing him the apple . Oh , a splendid one  --  now cut it in half . REV . THOMAS SINGLETON No , I do n't want any . MARY LARKIN Yes , you must eat half with me . The MINISTER digs out the seeds and cuts the apple in half . No , save the seeds , and we 'll wish with them ! REV . THOMAS SINGLETON How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll show you . Oh , you 're so tall I must get up on the bench . She gets on bench to reach him . Now , close your eyes . REV . THOMAS SINGLETON Close my eyes  --  ? MARY LARKIN You 're not afraid , are you ? REV . THOMAS SINGLETON No , but if I do I ca n't see you . MARY LARKIN Never mind that  --  I can see you . Go on , now close them . The MINISTER closes his eyes . Now , are they tight closed  --  so you ca n't see a bit ? The MINISTER nods his head . She leans toward him and throws a kiss . Now , come a little nearer , please . First I put an apple seed on each one of your eyelids . There , now  --  wish ! Short pause . Have you wished ? p. 97 REV . THOMAS SINGLETON Yes , but my nose itches ,  --  may I scratch it ? MARY LARKIN Frightened . No ! that might knock off the seeds . Now , wink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , you 'll get your wish . REV . THOMAS SINGLETON I 've done it  --  are they both off ? MARY LARKIN Jumping down from the bench . No , they 're both on  --  you 'll get your wish ! What was it ? REV . THOMAS SINGLETON I thought it would n't come true if I told you ? MARY LARKIN Well , of course we 're only joking . I 'm afraid you think me a perfect child . REV . THOMAS SINGLETON Perfect ? Yes . MARY LARKIN Serious . What did you wish for ? Something for yourself ? REV . THOMAS SINGLETON No , not for myself  --  it was for you . Taking her hand . I wished that when Spring comes , after all the fruits of the Autumn have been gathered and the dead stalks of the branches have been thrown away , there will come with the new blossoms a new Herbert Woodbridge  --  releases her handgiving you a new love and life worthy of you . And the happiness you crave . p. 98 MARY LARKIN Sadly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have n't told you yet why I came . It was to give you back your ring . REV . THOMAS SINGLETON But I thought you were going to keep it while you waited . MARY LARKIN Yes , but I have told Mr. Woodbridge I can never marry him . REV . THOMAS SINGLETON But you must n't decide that too suddenly  --  I believe I was not quite fair to him yesterday . MARY LARKIN He told me everything ,  --  things I 'd never heard of before . I did n't think him that kind of a man . I thought him good like you . REV . THOMAS SINGLETON Perhaps you can make him good . I 'm afraid I 'm to blame for your feeling this way . Give him one more chance , wo n't you ? MARY LARKIN I ca n't promise to marry him if I ca n't love him when he comes back . REV . THOMAS SINGLETON I do n't want you to do that . Only give him a chance until Spring . MARY LARKIN I will if you wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ REV . THOMAS SINGLETON Well , I will  --  but why ? MARY LARKIN Going toward the house . Because , Dr. Singleton , I know when Herbert comes in the Spring my heart will not beat one bit quicker . p. 99 REV . THOMAS SINGLETON Ah , you must n't be too sure ! It is n't fair to him . MARY LARKIN I ca n't help it  --  I know now I shall never marry . Good-by . She walks toward the porch . REV . THOMAS SINGLETON Following her . And my wish ? MARY LARKIN You see , you told it , so it ca n't come true . Good-by . She goes into the house . REV . THOMAS SINGLETON Good-by . He watches her as she disappears through the door . What am I thinking about  --  I have given my promise to persuade her to wait till the Spring . A pause . SIMPLICITY appears , going slowly . Till Spring  --  He sits on the bench . Till Spring . A bird sings in the tree , and SIMPLICITY creeps up behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not look at her . Is that you , Simple ? SIMPLICITY JOHNSON Half crying . Yes , Pops . I know what 's the matter with you , Pops ! REV . THOMAS SINGLETON There 's nothing the matter with me , Simple . p. 100 SIMPLICITY JOHNSON Crying . Pops , you 're in love with her ! REV . THOMAS SINGLETON What makes you think so , Simple ? SIMPLICITY JOHNSON ' Cause when she went into the house your eyes followed her and  --  Oh , Pops  --  Throwing her arms around him and crying still louder . REV . THOMAS SINGLETON Trying to comforther . Why , Simple , Simple dear . Why , Simple , what is it  --  what is it ? SIMPLICITY JOHNSON Kneeling beside him  --  still louder . I want to marry you myself ! REV . THOMAS SINGLETON Why , she 's going to marry Mr. Woodbridge . Lots of us ca n't marry the people we want to . There , there , dear , I 'm not going to marry anyone at all . Rising . No one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then neither am I  --  I 'll be an old maid like Miss Mattie . REV . THOMAS SINGLETON Now , wipe your eyes and cheer up . I 've got my church to give my life to . I 've got my church to comfort me . A bird sings in the tree , and DEACON STEELE , MR. and MRS . BROWN , MOLLY MEALEY and MRS . STEELE enter through the gate. p. 101 HOSEA BROWN Good evenin ' , Minister . REV . THOMAS SINGLETON Good evening . DEACON STEELE Good evening ! We 've come to see you on a serious business . Ahem ! We  --  perhaps we 'd better go into the house . HOSEA BROWN There 's no harm in staying here  --  it 's pleasant after the close Sunday-school room . REV . THOMAS SINGLETON Yes , I wrote to town this evening for some new ventilators I saw advertised in the Observer . HOSEA BROWN I think , Minister , you 'd better send Simple in . REV . THOMAS SINGLETON Yes , you go in , Simple . Why , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the steps . The cow kicked over the pail and spilt all the milk . REV . THOMAS SINGLETON What have you done with the pail ? SIMPLICITY JOHNSON Left it there . ' Cause I thought like as not Miss Mattie would make me go back and milk her all over again . She goes into the house . BROWN laughs heartily . DEACON STEELE What are you laughing at , Brown ? That child grows worse every day . p. 102 UNCLE BILL Enters from the house . Good evening  --  good evening ! EVERYBODY Good evening . UNCLE BILL Nearly time for evening meeting . And the bell has never rung a second late since old Walters took to ringing it . Goes out . REV . THOMAS SINGLETON I had no idea it was so late . DEACON STEELE Well , Minister , as Mr. Brown told yer , there 's bin a meetin ' of the Council this afternoon  --  REV . THOMAS SINGLETON Yes , and it hurt me a good deal that I was n't wanted . MATTIE Coming out from the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . EVERYBODY Good evening , Miss Mattie . HOSEA BROWN Goin ' to meetin ' pretty early , Miss Mattie . MATTIE Yes , I want to mend our seat cushion before it begins . Simple wiggles so during the sermon , she wears her place out in no time . Goes out . DEACON STEELE To the MINISTER . I guess we 'd better be quick about what we 've come to say , Minister . That Council was called because of the dissatisfaction , ahem  --  the  --  I may say wide-spread dis-sat-isfaction that has  --  ahem  --  that has been felt by your entire congregation ahem for some time . Taking out Resolutions from his pocket . I have been deputed by the Council to see you concerning the facts which they set forth with a  --  ahem  --  great generosity , as follows : You have encouraged beggars by taking in Aunt Melissy and old Bill Walters , and given them  --  ahem  --  a home . You have damaged the char- acter of our county Orphan Asylum by taking in your house a child which it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position the faithful and sweet teacher of our  --  MOLLY weeps silently . MRS . BROWN . encourages her  --  petting herschool to further your own ends . And for fifteen years you have neglected  --  ahem  --  I can put this stronger  --  you have refused to take a helpmate from your congregation , which contains many well-favored women willing to help you in your work . p. 103 HOSEA BROWN Willing ? Anxious ! MRS . BROWN takes MR . BROWN by the arm , and jerks him roughly to her . DEACON STEELE We ai n't satisfied with your laxity and freedom . We do n't want a new doctrine upsettin ' the old order  --  we do n't want a billiard table in the young men 's club . We do n't want playing cards in the social parlors . It 's rumored you 've even written a sermon upholdin ' the new-fangled doctrine of there being no such thing as Fire and Brimstun ! You have harbored in your house a woman who has , of her own free will , sundered her marriage vow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you deny any of these charges ? The choir of the evening meeting is heard singing . REV . THOMAS SINGLETON No . DEACON STEELE It is , then  --  my  --  ahem  --  painful duty to inform you that , unless Mrs. Woodbridge and her child leave your house at once , the Council feels obliged to ask  --  ahem  --  demand  --  your resignation  --  to take effect at once . REV . THOMAS SINGLETON At once ? But it 's time for evening meeting now . DEACON STEELE Taking off his glasses . Deacon Frost has kindly volunteered to lead , if you decide to resign . Will you give us your answer at once ? p. 104 REV . THOMAS SINGLETON Yes . HOSEA BROWN Maybe you 'd like to think it over , Minister . If so , we will go away and come back . He starts to go . MRS . HOSEA BROWN Pulling him back . Oh , no we wo n't ! DEACON STEELE Well , what is it ? All breathless  --  impatient . REV . THOMAS SINGLETON A little while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that little square tower over there has never rung once in all these fifteen years for service without our little gate latching behind me before the third stroke , but if it should ring till midnight to-night , it would n't find me one step nearer than I am now . DEACON STEELE That 's not answering us . REV . THOMAS SINGLETON If I finish the sermon that 's on my desk now , I 'm afraid it would be a plea for Purgatory after all  --  DEACON STEELE To the others . Ah , he 's compromising ! REV . THOMAS SINGLETON You want my answer  --  well , take it . I have wasted my time among you  --  lost my strength  --  and if you were to withdraw every one of your charges now , my answer would still be the same  --  I am ashamed of you all ! p. 105 DEACON STEELE Then your answer is  --  REV . THOMAS SINGLETON My resignation ! The MINISTER stands motionless . They all go off through the gate . MOLLY MEALEY sobs . The church bell rings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starts toward the gate as if to go to church , partly opens it , and walks slowly back . There is a pause , and then he sits down on the bench under the tree in a sort of dream , as SCENE : The orchard . The same set as for Act III , only changed from an Autumn to a Spring morning . The apple tree is in full blossom . An easel and painting-stool , paints , brushes , etc. , are on the lawn . SIMPLICITY discovered by the tree , examining the bark . SIMPLICITY . I 'm sure Pops was cutting something on this tree . I knew it  --  he was cutting her name ! M-a-r-y  --  She tries to scratch the letters from the tree with a knife . There , I wo n't have her name on my apple tree . MATTIE Appears at an upper window of the house , calling . Simple  --  Simple  --  SIMPLICITY hides behind the tree . I guess she 's gone down to the village . Speaking back into the room . Bridget , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  SIMPLICITY climbs up into the tree . I declare to goodness you have n't done a stroke of work to-day . Nobody could have rheumatism a day like this . MARY LARKIN enters from the house . She goes to the easel , arranging paints , etc . It 's only an excuse to get out of your work . Catching sight of MISS LARKIN . Oh , you found your way out , all right . I wish I was n't so over- run with work this morning  --  I 'd sit right here in the window , and you could put me in the picture . p. 107 MARY LARKIN Thank you , but I did n't intend to do the house . I hope I have n't interrupted you too much . I tried to come across the hills through the gate  --  but I could n't ; it was fastened . MATTIE Yes , siree ,  --  when I came home from that meeting last Fall , led by old Deacon Frost , and found out why the Minister was n't there , I nailed up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him , " Nobody goes through that gate again till you do ,  --  back to your rightful place in the pulpit yonder . " MARY LARKIN I do n't blame you , Miss Mattie . You do n't mind my making a sketch of your orchard , do you ? MATTIE Good land , no ! MARY LARKIN You see , I do n't know when I shall ever get here again , and I want a little souvenir of the place . MATTIE It 's a pity you 're leaving the school  --  it 's just them jealous women that 's making your life a burden here . MARY LARKIN Oh , no ! Begins to paint . MATTIE Turning from the window and speaking back into the room . Now , what is it , Bridget ? For the land 's sake , put a hot raisin on it , and tie your cheek up with a hot cloth . But do n't take to having the toothache too often , or I 'll forbid you that , along with the rheumatism . To MARY . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marry , do n't have a cook in poor health . MINISTER enters from the house as MATTIE disappears from the window. p. 108 SIMPLICITY JOHNSON In the tree . Do n't she think she 's smart  --  pretending to come here and paint the orchard . Who ever heard of painting an orchard  --  it 's just an excuse to see Pops ! REV . THOMAS SINGLETON Good morning . At the sound of his voice , SIMPLICITY starts , but recovers quickly . The MINISTER looks over MARY 'S shoulder as she paints . MARY LARKIN Looking up . Good morning , Dr. Singleton . SIMPLICITY JOHNSON In the tree , mocking MARY . Good morning , Dr. Singleton . REV . THOMAS SINGLETON Looking at the picture . Oh , you 're putting us in ? MARY LARKIN Trying to . Do you remember that day ? REV . THOMAS SINGLETON It was just six months ago , yesterday . MARY LARKIN Yesterday  --  and Herbert has n't come . Do you know what I heard in the village this morning ? REV . THOMAS SINGLETON No  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minister 's leaving . p. 109 REV . THOMAS SINGLETON What ! The last one  --  why , he 's only been here a month . MARY LARKIN I know it . But he says he ca n't stand it  --  there 's no pleasing them . I told Mrs. Brown I was glad of it . REV . THOMAS SINGLETON You 'd better look out or she wo n't let you board with her any longer . MARY LARKIN What do you think  --  she agreed with me ! REV . THOMAS SINGLETON No ! MARY LARKIN Yes , she did , and she said it would teach the people a lesson . BRIDGET Coming out of the house with a red flannel cloth tied around her face , as if suffering from toothache . If you plaze , surr , Miss Mattie 's after asking if you 're going to the post office ? REV . THOMAS SINGLETON Yes , I 'm going right away , Bridget . BRIDGET goes back into the house . MARY LARKIN Doctor , will you ask if there are any letters for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know from whom you mean . A letter or he must come to-day . He goes toward the house. p. 110 MARY LARKIN Good-by . The MINISTER turns at the porch . REV . THOMAS SINGLETON Good-by . MARY LARKIN Good-by ! SIMPLICITY JOHNSON In the tree , mockingly . Good- by  --  it 's about time she went back to her own town to live ! Anyhow , I 'm going to get Pops out of her head . Suddenly jumps from the tree , frightening MARY . MARY LARKIN Oh , how you frightened me ! SIMPLICITY JOHNSON Did I  --  what ' cher doing ? Going over to MARY . MARY LARKIN Painting . SIMPLICITY JOHNSON What ? MARY LARKIN The orchard  --  do n't you see ? SIMPLICITY JOHNSON Coming behind her , and looking over MARY 'S shoulder , she rubs her finger on the canvas . What 's that ? MARY LARKIN Oh , please be careful  --  you 'll spoil it . SIMPLICITY JOHNSON Sulkily . ' Scuse me ! p. 111 MARY LARKIN That 's the bench under the tree , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to be by him  --  Mis ' Woodbridge ? MARY LARKIN No , I am on the bench . After a pause . Simple , what made you think it was Mrs. Woodbridge ? SIMPLICITY JOHNSON ' Cause Pops is in love with her . Waiting to see the effect . I say Pops is in love with Mrs. Woodbridge . That 's why he took up for her against the church . I guess they 'll be married soon . MARY LARKIN Rising from the stool . I do n't believe it ! SIMPLICITY JOHNSON Do n't you ? That 's because you 're in love with him yourself . MARY LARKIN How dare you say that  --  how dare you ? You 're a bad , impudent little girl  --  that 's what you are ! SIMPLICITY JOHNSON I thought I 'd make you mad before I got through . Everybody sees you 're in love with him . MARY LARKIN Half crying  --  very angry . You 've no right to say such a thing ! Suppose he had heard you ? I  --  I  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I hate you  --  I hate you ! You 'll see if I love him . She takes her palette knife from the easel , and zig-zags across the picture . There , there , there ! I would n't do that if I loved him ! And you can tell everybody who 's said so that I love Herbert  --  Woodbridge , and that he 's coming to marry me to-day . Oh , you spiteful little thing  --  I hate you  --  I hate you ! She drops the knife and rushes away through the trees. p. 112 SIMPLICITY JOHNSON Watches her out of sight ; then she picks up the camp stool and knocks down the easel . I hate you too  --  I hate you ! I 've separated you and Pops , but I wish I was dead ! She throws herself on the bench and sobs violently . MRS . BROWN , carrying a parasol , and MISS MEALEY appear at the gate , trying to open it , but can not . MISS MOLLY MEALEY I ca n't open it . MRS . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to kill a mosquito . She struggles with the locked gate , but fails to open it . The noise arouses SIMPLICITY . SIMPLICITY JOHNSON You ca n't get in that way  --  Miss Mattie 's nailed Lovers ' Lane up . MRS . HOSEA BROWN From the other side of the gate , very sweetly . Oh , Simplicity , how do you do ? MISS MOLLY MEALEY How do you do ? SIMPLICITY JOHNSON Not moving from the bench . My health 's pretty good , I thank you . You 'll have to go around to the front if you want to get in . MRS . HOSEA BROWN Oh , dear ! We have n't time to do that . p. 113 MISS MOLLY MEALEY Perhaps if Miss Mattie knew what we come for , she 'd let us in this way . SIMPLICITY JOHNSON Well , I 'll call her . Miss Mattie  --  Miss Mattie  --  Miss Mattie ! She runs into the house . MRS . HOSEA BROWN Still outside the gate . Now , Molly Mealey , for Heaven 's sake , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time you were here . Throwing out hints to Dr. Singleton , after being snubbed by everyone of those new preachers ! You ought to begin to see the Lord never intended you for a minister 's wife . MISS MOLLY MEALEY I wish you 'd mind your own business , Mrs. Brown . Just because you 're the mother of seven , you need n't think nobody else can have a chance  --  I 'm something of a flirt , but I 'm not fickle ! MATTIE comes from the house . MRS . HOSEA BROWN At the gate , very pleasantly . Good morning , Miss Mattie . MATTIE Shortly . How do you do ? MRS . HOSEA BROWN We just thought we 'd drop in . MATTIE It 's taken you about six months to think it . p. 114 MISS MOLLY MEALEY Can we get in this way ? MATTIE Yes . MISS MEALEY AND MRS . BROWN Very pleased . O-oh ! MATTIE If you can climb ! MRS . HOSEA BROWN Oh , now , Miss Mattie ! MATTIE No , siree . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it against yourselves too . MRS . HOSEA BROWN But we 've come to open it again for him , now . MATTIE What ? MISS MOLLY MEALEY And we 've come to ask if you 'll let the Sewing Circle meet here next week ? MATTIE Why ? MRS . HOSEA BROWN And the choir wants to know if Mrs. Woodbridge will be willing to sing again , beginning next Sunday ? MATTIE Good land ! MISS MOLLY MEALEY Do let the Sewing Circle meet here , Miss Mattie ! MATTIE Is the world coming to an end ? MRS . HOSEA BROWN And do try and make Mis ' Woodbridge sing ! MATTIE Well , I am  --  Uncle Bill  --  Uncle Bill ! p. 115 UNCLE BILL From the house . Yes ? MATTIE Come here and see if you can open Lovers ' Lane gate . UNCLE BILL Comes out to open the gate . Good day , Mis ' Brown and Miss Mealey . He tries the gate to see how it is nailed . MRS . BROWN AND MISS MEALEY Good morning , Uncle Bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the door . Yes 'm . MATTIE Tell Aunt Melissy to bring a hatchet . BRIDGET All right , marm  --  I will . Goes in . MATTIE Going over to the gate , too . I 'll get the gate open , and then we can talk it over . MRS . HOSEA BROWN We 've come to tell you , too , there 's a Council being held in the Sunday-school room , and Brown told me , confidential , he thought they were going to draw up Resolutions begging Dr. Singleton to come back . AUNT MELISSY comes , bringing the hatchet . She has the slippers also. p. 116 MATTIE Following AUNT MELISSY . UNCLE BILL takes the hatchet from AUNT MELISSY , and works at the gate . It 's about time ! UNCLE BILL The Minister coming back ? He sings " Glory , glory , Hallelujah ! " as the gate gives way . MATTIE Holds the gate open and then all , except UNCLE BILL and AUNT MELISSY , come through on their way to the house . I think we 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MRS . HOSEA BROWN Yes  --  let 's . MISS MOLLY MEALEY Is Dr. Singleton there ? AUNT MELISSY goes over and sits on the bench . MATTIE No  --  he 's gone down to the post office  --  do n't know as he 'll be willing to go back to the church . He feels dreadfully injured at the way he 's been treated . They all , except AUNT MELISSY and UNCLE BILL , go in the house . UNCLE BILL Going to bench , as if to sit down by AUNT MELISSY . Sees no room , so moves around her to the other side . I think I 'll sit down a spell , if there ai n't no objections . p. 117 AUNT MELISSY H-a-y-e  --  UNCLE BILL I say I think I 'll sit down a spell , if there ai n't no objections . Sitting beside her . AUNT MELISSY I 'll be glad to have you , Mr. Bill . UNCLE BILL Opening the grammar .

Rising and walking toward the gate . Come along with me down Lovers ' Lane . I want to find out if it 's true they 're going to ask the Minister to come back . And if it is , I 'm going to ring the old bell for him and for us . HERBERT WOODBRIDGE Enters at the gate . Is Dr. Singleton in ? p. 118 UNCLE BILL No . But he will be , soon . How- somever , this ai n't the front door . AUNT MELISSY rises and follows UNCLE BILL . HERBERT WOODBRIDGE No , but they told me this was a short cut from the depot , and I 'm in a hurry . UNCLE BILL and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Comin ' through the Rye " in discord . HERBERT knocks at the door of the house . BRIDGET Calling from the window above . Who 's down there ?
