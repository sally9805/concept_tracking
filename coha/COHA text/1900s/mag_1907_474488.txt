TO proofs of intelligence in flowers , man 's vanity opposes the traditional objection : yes , they create marvels , but those marvels remain eternally the same . Each species , each variety has its system and , from generation to generation , introduces no perceptible improvement . It is true that , since we have been observing them ? that is to say , during the past fifty years ? we have not seen the Coryantheg Moorantha or the Calasetidar perfect their trap ; that is all we can say ; and it is really not enough . Have we as much as attempted the most elementary experiments ; and do we know what the successive generations of our astonishing bathing Orchid would do at the end of a century , if placed in. different surroundings , among insects to which it was not accustomed ? For the rest , the names which we give to the orders , species and varieties end by deceiving ourselves ; and we thus create imaginary types which we believe to be fixed , whereas they are probably only the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to modify its organs slowly hi accordance with slow circumstances . The flowers came upon our earth before the insects ; they had , therefore , when the latter appeared , to fit an entirely new machinery to the habits of these unexpected collaborators . This geologically incontestable fact alone , amid all that we do not know , is enough to establish evolution ; and does not this somewhat vague word mean , after all , adaptation , modification , intelligent progress ? It would be easy , moreover , without appealing to this prehistoric event , to bring together a large number of facts that would show that the faculty of adaptation and intelligent progress is not reserved exclusively for the human race . Without returning to the detailed chap-ters which I have devoted to this subject in The Life of the Bee , I will simply recall two or three topical details which are there mentioned . The bees , for instance , invented the hive . In the wild anti primitive state and in their country of origin they work in the open air . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave them the idea of seeking a shelter in hollow trees or a , hole in the rooks . This idea of genius restored to the work of looting and the care of the eggs the thousands of bees stationed around the combs to maintain the necessary heat . And it is not uncommon , especially in the south , during exceptionally mild summers , to find the bees reverting to the tropical manners of their ancestors. * Another fact : transported to Australia or California , our black bee completely alters her habits . After one or two years , finding that summer is perpetual and flowers forever abundant , she will live from day to day , content to gather I had just written these lines , when M. E. L. Bouvier made a communication in the Academy of Science Report of the 7th of May , 1906 ) on the subject of two open-air nidiilcations observed in Paris , one in a Sophora Japonica , the other in a chestnut-tree . The latter , which hung from a small branch furnished with two almost contiguous forks , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evident and intelligent adaptation to particularly difficult circumstances , " The bees , " says M. de Parville , in his summary in the science column of the Journal des D4bate of the 31st of May , 1906 , " built consolidating pillars and resorted to really remarkable artifices of protection and ended by transforming the two forks of the chestnut-tree into a solid ceiling . An ingenious human being would certainly not have done so well . . . . " To protect themselves . against the rain , they had installed fences , thickenings and blinds against the sun . One can receive no greater idea of the perfect industry of the bees than by observing the architecture of these two nidifieations , now at the Museum . " the honey and pollen indispensable for the day 's consumption ; and , her recent and thoughtful observation triumphing over hereditary experience , she will cease to make provision for her winter . Biichner mentions an analogous fact , which also proves the bees ' adaptation to circumstances , not slow , secular , unconscious and fatal , but immediate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are in the midst of the refineries , where they find sugar in plenty during the whole year , will entirely abandon their visits to the flowers . Let us lastly recall the amusing curttradiction which the bees gave to two learned English entomologists , Kirby and Spence : " Show us , " said these , " a single case in which , under stress of circumstances , the bees have had the idea of substituting clay or mortar for wax and propolis and we will admit , their reasoning faculties . " Hardly had they expressed this somewhat arbitrary wish , when another naturalist , Andrew Knight , having coated the bark of certain trees with a sort of cement made of wax and turpentine , observed that his bees entirely ceased to gather propolis and used only this new and unknown substance , which they found prepared for them in abundance in the neighborhood of their home . Moreover , in the practice of agriculture , when pollen is scarce , the bee-keeper has but to place at their disposal a few pinches of flour for them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and be turned to the same use as the dust of the anthers , although its taste , smell and color are absolutely different . That which I have just recalled , in the matter of the bees , might , I think , mutatis mutandis , be confirmed in the kingdom of flowers . It would probably suffice if the wonderful evolutionary efforts of the numerous varieties of the Sage , for instance , were subjected to a few experiments and studied more methodically than a layman , such as myself , is capable of doing . Meanwhile , among many other indications which could be easily collected , a curious study by Babinet on the cereals tells us that certain plants , when transported far from their habitual climate , observe the new circumstances and avail themselves of them , exactly as the bees do . Thus , in the hottest regions of Asia , Africa and America , where the winter does not annually kill it , our corn becomes again what it must have been at first , a perennial plant , like grass . It remains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bears ears or grains . When , therefore , from its original and tropical country it came to be acclimatized in our icy regions , it had to upset its habits and to invent a new method of multiplication . As Babinet well says : " The organism of the plant , thanks to an inconceivable miracle , seemed to have a presentiment of the necessity of passing through the grain state , so as not to perish completely during the severe season . " In any ease , to destroy the objection which I mentioned above and which has compelled me to travel so far from my immediate subject , it would be enough to establish an act of intelligent progress , were it but for a single occasion , outside mankind . But , apart from the pleasure which one takes in refuting an . over-vain and out-of-date argument , how little importance , when all is said , attaches to this question of the personal intelligence of the flowers , the insects , or the birds ! Supposing that we say , speaking of the Orchid and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plant or the insect that calculates , combines , adorns , invents and thinks : what interest can this distinction have for us ? A much loftier question and one more worthy of our eager attention prevails over these details . It is a matter of grasping the character , the quality , the habits and perhaps the object of the general intelligence whence emanate all the intelligent acts that are accomplished upon this earth . It is from this point of view that the study of those creatures ? the ants and the bees , among others ? in which , outside the human form , the proceedings and the ideal of that genius are most clearly manifested becomes one of the most curious which it is possible to undertake . It is clear , when all is said , that we have ascertained that those tendencies , those intellectual methods are at least as complex , as advanced , as startling in the Orchids as in the gregarious Hymenoptera , . Let us add that a large number of the motives and a portion of the logic of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , whereas we can grasp with ease all the silent motives , all the wise and stable arguments of the peaceful flower . Now what do we observe when we perceive nature ( ur the general intelligence of the universal genius : the name matters but little ) at work in the Orchid world ? Many things ; and , to mention it only in passing , for the subject would offer facilities for a long study , we begin by ascertaining that her idea of beauty , of gladness , her methods of attraction , her esthetic tastes are very near akin to our own . But , no doubt , it would be more correct to state that ours are congenial with hers . It is , in fact , very uncertain whether we have ever invented a beauty peculiar to ourselves . All our architectural , all our musical motives , all our harmonies of color and light are borrowed directly from nature . Without evoking the sea , the mountains , the skies , the night , the twilight , so as not to wander too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for instance , of the beauty of the trees ? I speak not only of the tree considered in the forest , where it is one of the powers of the earth , perhaps the chief source of our instincts , of our sense of the universe , but of the tree in itself , the solitary tree , whose green old age is laden with a thousand seasons . Among those impressions which , without our knowing it , form the limpid hollow and perhaps the subsoil of happiness and calm of our whole existence , which of us does not preserve the recollection of a few beautiful trees ? When a man has passed mid-life , when he has come to the end of the wondering period , when he has exhausted nigh all the sights that the art , the genius and the luxury of ages and men can offer , after experiencing and comparing many things , he returns to very simple memories . They raise upon the purified horizon two or three innocent , invariable and refreshing images , which he would wish to carry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be true that an image can pass the threshold that separates our two worlds . For myself , I can imagine no paradise nor after-life , however splendid it may be , in which a certain magnificent Oak would be out of place , or a certain Cypress , or a Parasol Pine of Florence or of a charming hermitage near my own house , any one of which will afford to the passer-by a model of all the great movements of necessary resistance , of peaceful courage , of soaring , of gravity , of silent victory and of perseverance . But I am wandering too far afield : I intended only to remark , with reference to the flower , that nature , when she wishes to be beautiful , to please , to delight and to prove herself happy , does almost what we should do had we her treasures at our disposal . I know that , speaking thus , I am speaking a little like the bishop who was astonished that Providence always made the great streams flow close to the big cities ; but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the human point of view . Let us , then , from this point of view , consider that we should know very few signs , very few expressions of happiness , if we did not know the flower . In order well to judge of its power of gladness and beauty , one must live in a part of the country where it reigns undivided , such as that corner of Provence , between the Siagne and the Loup , in which I am writing these lines . Here , truly , the flower is the sole sovereign of the hills and valleys . The peasants have lost the habit of cultivating corn , as though they had now only to provide for the needs of a subtler race of mankind that lived on sweet fragrance and ambrosia . The fields form one great bouquet , which is incessantly renewed , and the perfumes that succeed one another seem to dance their rounds all through the azure year . Anemones , Gilliflowers , Mimosas , Violets , Pinks , Narcissuses , Hyacinths , Jonquils , Mignonette , Jasmine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer , spring and autumn months . But the magnificent hour belongs to the Roses of May . Then , as far as the eye can see , from the slope of the hills to the hollow of the plains , between dikes of Vines and Olive-trees , they flow on every side like a stream of petals whence emerge the houses and the trees , a stream of the color which we allot to youth , health and joy . The aroma , at once warm and fresh , but above all spacious , which opens up the sky , emanates , one would think , directly from the sources of beatitude . The roads , the paths , are carved in the pulp of the flower , in the very substance of Eden . For the first time in one 's life , one seems to have a satisfactory vision of happiness . Still speaking from our human point of view and persevering in the necessary illusion , let us add to our first remark one that is a little more extensive , a little less hazardous and perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earth , which is probably that of the whole world , acts , in the vital struggle , exactly as a man would act . It employs the same methods , the same logic . It attains its aim by the same means that we would use : it gropes , it hesitates , it corrects itself time after time ; it adds , it suppresses , it recognizes and repairs its errors , as we should do in its place . It makes great efforts , it invents with difficulty and little by little , in the manner of the workmen and engineers in our workshops . It struggles like ourselves against the heavy , huge and obscure mass of its being . It knows no more than ourselves where it is going ; it seeks itself and Ends itself gradually . It has an ideal which is often confused , but one in which , nevertheless , we distinguish a host of great lines that rise towards a more ardent , complex , nervous and spiritual form of existence . Materially , it disposes of infinite resources , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know nothing ; but , intellectually , it appears strictly to occupy our sphere : we can not prove that , hitherto , it has exceeded its limits ; and , if it does not endeavor to take anything beyond that sphere , does this not mean that there is nothing beyond it ? Does it not mean that the methods of the human mind are the only possible ones , that man has made no mistake , that he is neither an exception nor a monster , but the being through whom pass , in whom are most intensely manifested the great volitions , the great desires of the universe ? This is an ascertainment that is one of the most reassuring that we could make . We have long taken a rather foolish pride in believing ourselves to be miraculous , unparalleled and marvellously incidental beings , probably fallen from another world , devoid of any certain ties with the rest of life and , in any case , endowed with an unusual , incomparable , monstrous faculty . It is greatly preferable to be less prodigious , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappear in the normal evolution of nature . It is much more consoling to observe that we follow the same road as the soul of this great world , that we have the same ideas , the same hopes , the same trials , and ? were it not for our specific dream of justice and pity ? the same feelings . It is much more tranquilizing to assure ourselves that , to better our lot , to utilize the forces , the occasions , the laws of matter , we employ methods exactly similar to those which it uses to conquer , enlighten and order its unsubjected , unconscious and unruly regions , That there are no other methods , that we are in the midst of truth , that we are in our right place and at home in this universe formed of unknown substances , whose thought , however , is not impenetrable and hostile , but analogous and apposite to our own . If nature knew everything , if she were never mistaken , if everywhere , in all her undertakings , she showed herself at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revealed in all things an intelligence immeasurably superior to our own , then there would be cause to fear and to lose courage . We should feel ourselves the victims and the prey of an extraneous power , which we should have no hope of knowing or measuring . It is much better to be convinced that this power , at least from the intellectual point of view , is closely akin to our own . Our intelligence draws upon the same reserves as that of nature . We belong to the same world , we are almost equals . We are associating not with inaccessible gods , but with veiled , yet fraternal volitions , which it is our business to surprise and to direct . It would not , 1 imagine , be very bold to maintain that there are not any more or less intelligent beings , but a scattered , general intelligence , a sort of universal fluid that penetrates the organisms which it encounters diversely according as they are good or bad conductors of the understanding . Man would then represent , hitherto , upon this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resistance to this fluid , which the religions call divine . Our nerves would be the threads along which this more subtle electricity would spread . The circumvolutions of our brain would , in a manner , form the induction-coil in which the force of the current would be multiplied ; but this current would not he of another nature , would not come from another source than that which passes through the stone , the star , the flower or the animal . But these are mysteries which it were somewhat idle to question , seeing that we do not yet possess the organ that could gather their reply . Let us be satisfied with having observed certain manifestations of this intelligence outside ourselves . All that we observe within ourselves is rightly open to suspicion : we are at once , judge and suitor and we are too greatly interested in peopling our world with magnificent illusions and hopes . But let the slightest external indication be dear and precious to us . Those which the flowers have just offered us are probably quite infinitesimal compared with what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if we could surprise the secrets of their life . Nevertheless , they allow us to presume , with greater assurance , that the spirit that animates all things or emanates from them is of the same essence as that which aid-mates our bodies . If this spirit resembles us , if we thus resemble it , if all that it contains is contained also within ourselves , if it employs our methods , if it has our habits , our preoccupations , our tendencies , our desires for better things , is it illogical for us to hope all that we do hope , instinctively , invincibly , since it is almost certain that it hopes the same ? Is it probable , when we find scattered through life so great a sum total of intelligence , that this life should make no work of intelligence , that is to say , should not pursue an aim of happiness , of perfection , of victory over that which we call evil , death , darkness , annihilation , but which is probably only the shadow of its face or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
