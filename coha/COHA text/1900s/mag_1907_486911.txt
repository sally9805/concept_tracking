The results of the election , falling together with events in the financial world , seem to us to promise a period of more rational politics . The explosive and clamorous politicians have been pretty thoroughly found out and discredited . Hearst le under a large-sized extinguisher . Bryan can not get any posse= ble cheer out of the election returns : his own State went against him again , and his lieutenants in Massachusetts made a magnificent wreck of a great party opportunity . The President , too , is sobered . His political astuteness , if nothing else , may now be counted upon to lead him to come out as the most cautious and healing of statesmen . He may be depended upon to use the great powers of his office to help steady the country 's affairs . The bare official announcement that the President is to make no more public utterances for a month , is , as Carlyle would say , significant of much . - If we are truly to have a reaction from our sensationalized politics of the past few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Few of us have stopped to reflect how the nerves of the nation have been successively racked . By turbulent methods , by loud outcry and the shouting of the captains , we have somehow cone to believe that politics means a continual tour de force . Somebody must be always in the limelight , gesticulating and vociferating . Every ' campaign must be a whirlwind . The people must more and more be driven frantic ; and the gravest political questions must be decided by the larger volume of applause . We will not undertake to apportion the responsibility for this state of things . The sensational press can not escape its share ; but the chief blame lies with those politicians who have sought to keep the masses perpetually agitated , who have thrust one question after another to the front , and insisted that it be settled at once , and that by dint of lung-power rather than the prevailing of the batter reason . This style of political progress , by plunging and squealing like a six-mule team , has been much practised for the past decade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achieved by means of it ; but there are many signs to-day that the people are tired of it , and that we are in for a quieter era . The country has seen the results of ripping things to pieces , and keeping everything in a whirl , and is now looking about for a party and a political leader to do a little of the humdrum work of restoration and construction : There can be little doubt that it is this new attitude of mind which has caused so many people in so many different parts of the country to turn to Gov . Hughes . They have heard his confession of political faith , as made in his address at Columbia University  --  namely , that it should be the great aim to apply reason to public affairs . They have also seen him proving his faith by his works . And the extraordinary and-unforced feeling , manifested so widely , that a man of his type ought to be chosen for the Presidency , is of itself a striking indication that we are passing out of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period . Of Course , when we speak of applying reason to politics , the larger reason is intended . The truly rational politician must take into his reckoning all the facts of political human nature ; must know what things can be done , and what can not be ; must be responsive to the desire for improvement , his effort being to direct it . wisely . Reason is opposed to passion , or vindictiveness , not to progress . Only , the progress must be along tried paths and by sound methods . Out of vague unrest or disturbance , the rational statesman must be able to find a way by deliberate use of sensible remedies for ' public dissatisfaction . The two capital examples that Gov . Hughes has given are in the field of insurance and supervision of corporations . After the excitement and the scandals of the insurance investigation , a new code of well-considered laws emerged . That Mr. Hughes should have been able to ? digest the results of the inquiry in his report to the Legislature , and then not only draft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a competent authority as a great intellectual feat . But it was more than that : it was patient and constructive statesmanship . And of the same kind in planning ( we can not yet pronounce fully upon the results ) was the measure establishing the Public Service Commissions . In either case , what we had was , after the earthquake of investigation , the still small voice of reason : all the facts firmly grasped and dispassionately studied , the necessary changes in the law worked out and put into operation . That is the ideal of rational politics which Gov . Hughes has so well exemplified . Over-zealous friends of Roosevelt speak of the Governor as a " reactionary " ? or , at least , say that those who are talking of him for the Presidency are all " reactionaries . " No mistake could be greater . Steady and sane progress can not be called reaction except in coiatrast , with the mad and blind rushing ahead which ends in the ditch . There is nothing of the rest-and-be-thankful attitude in Gov . Hughes . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are great problems in connection with corporation control which the country is bound to attack . The difference is that he would do it without haste or passion , and by bringing to bear the best collective judgment of the nation . If the people are indeed returning to reason , it is not strange that they are casting about for a reasonable man . Hence the force in the contention that the elections of last week , with their rebuke to agitators and ' hot-heads , have greatly increased Gov . Hughes 's chances of being nominated for the Presidency . THE TARIFF ON PAPER . That the President would sympathize with the American Newspaper Publishers ' Association in its appeal for the abolition of the tariff on press paper , wood-pulp , and all the wood that goes into the manufacture of paper , was to be expected . Perhaps something of Theodore Roosevelt the free-trader of bygone days stirred anew in the Presidential breast . Besides , he would be a rare politician who in these days should - be adamant to the wails of a united and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only to recommend in his annual message to Congress the abolition of the oppressive tariffs , but also to urge the Department of Justice to ascertain if the paper manufacturers are violating the anti-Trust laws . Whether the President was able to control his risibles at the spectacle of representatives of the most determined " stand-pat " newspapers demanding free trade in paper , while insisting that not another hair on the hoary tariff head . should be touched , is not reported . But his sense of humor makes it impossible that he should have failed to appreciate the joke . He is , of course , fully aware that in the new Congress his recommendation will fall on deaf ears . His political legatee , Secretary Taft , has given reasons whyeth.ere should be no tariff changes until after the Presidential election . These every " standpatter " who wishes to keen the tariff on paper can cite as having been directly inspired from the White House . But it is not only the approach of the election which will block the way to this desirable legislation ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single change in the tariff now may endanger the entire structure . Senator Burrows , for iv stance , lamented with all solemnity the other day the inability of his party to alter certain schedules obviously too high until it could go over the whole tariff . Two years hence , however , when the general overhauling will be in order , dozens of statesmen will rise to urge that tariff readjustment , if any , be made by changing only one schedule at a time . By such tactics , revision may be postponed till the Greek kalends . If the Republican party really wanted to end a flagrant wrong , this would be its opportunity . Gladstone attacked the same problem in England in 1860 , in the face of great opposition . Conservatives the country over rose in arms at the suggestion of free paper . It would flood the country with cheap and pernicious newspapers ; it meant the establishment of a " daily propaganda of socialism , communism , red republicanism , blasphemy , bad spelling , and general immorality . " The House of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to its cost . - within a year , Mr. Gladstone had re -- tainted in a way which has ever since tied the hands of the Lords in matters of finance and taxation . He adopted the simple expedient of sending to the Lords in one bill all measures affecting supply and revenue ; " which , " as Mr. Gladstone said , " we knew the Lords would not dare to throw out . " The Republican party could find the way quickly enough to repeal our own " tax on intelligence , " as Mr. Gladstone termed it , did its masters only permit . But thbse protected interests which cowed the vali- ? ant President Roosevelt into suppressing his tariff-reform message are the persons whose word is law  --  not their puppets in Congress . So far as the Paper Trust is concerned , the Department of Justice , if it conducts its investigation with care , will , We believe , find much of interest besides recent disregard of a Federal Court 's orders . The Trust asserts that it owns only two Canadian mills , but a reputable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canada suddenly found that , after he had made all arrangements , the mill was unable to do the work . Subsequently , an agent of the Trust appeared in his office and recounted to him every step in his negotiations with the Canadian mill , and then laughed at his failure to break away from the Trust . ' On the other hand , the International Paper Company insists that the raising of prices is due to the growing scarcity of material . Its net earnings have steadily decreased from $2,138,117.31 in 1905 to $1,985,540.96 in 1906 and $1,623.616.48 in 1907 . Furthermore , it has been forced to sell six million dollars ' worth of bonds during the last four years to provide for new timber lands , pay for alterations , renewals , etc . The stockholders , therefore , can not be said to profit by the increased price of the product . But , in spite of this plea of poverty , the fact seems to be that the Trust is dumping paper-abroad at a lower figure than it obtains here . After the Trust was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . The value of the exports in 1906 was $9,536 , - 065 , and the paper was sold ' in England at less than two cents per pound , as compared with something less than three cents in this country . If the scarcity of wood-pulp is the real reason for the rise in price , the Trust ought to be the first to ask for a lowering of the duty , for there is abundant wood for pulp in Nova Scotia and Newfoundland . And , quite - aside from the question of paper , the senseless deforestation of much of this country has made all /umber scarce and costly . Hence , if the Republican party were really as concerned for the pocket of the workingman as it " pretends to be for the condition of his dinner pail , it would make the repeal of the tariff on lumber a matter second only in importance to a readjustment of our inflexible currency . From one point of view , the sufferings of the publishers may accomplish some good . President Hayes used to tell the story of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which he lived had made of every man in it a foe of slavery . " Hereafter , Mr. Hayes , " said one of his pro-slavery neighbors , " I shall be not only a black Republican , but a donned Abolitionist . " We hope that , so far as the tariff is concerned , the , present object-lesson will make all newspaper publishers damned abolitionists . FRANCHISE BARGAINING . It is an interesting fact that the realization of what a city is able to obtain ' by skilful bargaining with a public-service corporation has come about during the very years when the advocates of complete municipalization have been most eloquent over the peculiar advantages of their own plan . The results that have actually been secured by negotiation are on record for the guidance of the cities which sooner or later will have to approach the same questions . Though it is too early to attempt a final judgment , recent experience  --  teaches that the average municipality is in a much better position for dealing with its public utilities than was formerly supposed . No party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a worse start in this respect than did the average city . Municipal ownership advocates are in the habit of speaking rather disrespectfully of the United States Supreme Court 's decision in the Dartmouth College case , on which franchise properties are so largely based . " Reasonable legislation , " says Frederick C. Howe in one of his books , " would have created a license , revocable at the will of the granting authority , but subject to compensation by the community for the actual ' investment made by the company . Such is the title enjoyed by other wealth . " Be that as it may , " reasonable legislation " had extremely little to do with the early treatment of public-service companies . Some most enlightened franchise ordinances were passed at very early dates , to be sure . The first franchise ever granted in Chicago , for example , safeguarded the city 's interests so well that no capitalist ever built a road under it . But , in general , where the desire of a community to get the benefit of the new and wonderful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they wanted , bribery would . This method of corruption did more than create powerful material monopolies ; it created an attitude of mind on both sides unfavorable to the public interest , It was expressed ? n the attitude of a street-railroad official who once remarked that " the first man who accepted a limited franchise deserved to be shot . " Yet , as it has turned out , the possession of long-term or even perpetual franchises does not make a corporation invulnerable . So long as communities grow , neighborhoods change , and invention progresses , public-service corporations have to seek new licenses and privileges , and every application for extension or modification of the old conditions is a weapon in the city 's hands . Perhaps a traction company wants to lay its tracks across a new bridge , or an electric company to build new conduits . A city often can make a better bargain by securing favorable changes in former grants than by exacting compensation in money . There have even been cases , . we believe , in which companies that had secured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have been made to capitulate before being allowed to use electric power . Concrete instances of recent date show the great strategic importance , so to put it , of these supplementary or expiring grants . Chicago contended for years against traction companies to which the Minors Legislature had granted in 1865 ninety-nine-year extensions of all . franchises . The city never recognized the validity of the act , but even when the companies were insisting most stoutly on their rights , no one supposed for a moment that , because of them , a settlement of the burning question was to be deferred till 1964 . The city made the relinquishment of these ninety-nine-year rights a condition in each of the many solutions proposed from the mayoralty of the first Carter Harrison to that of Dunne . Though in the end these always dubious rights were disposed of by a Supreme Court decision , there Is no practical doubt that the - companies would have had to waive them soon in any event , if the city continued firm . Cleveland , at the present time , illustrates the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5-cent-fare franchises on three-quarters of its lines , with from ten to twenty years aill to run , was ready to surrender all of them if it could get a new twenty-year franchise that would keep its system complete even at a 31/2-cent fare . Detroit and some other Western cities , we believe , have secured almost as favorable arrangements for themselves by making their companies bid for privileges which , if not absolutely indispensable , were at least extremely important to the operation of their systems . Allusion has been made above to the unfortunate atmosphere that used to surround all franchise discussions . The corporations ' own sublime belief in their right to extraordinary and continued privileges communicated itself to some extent throughout our society . It helped to make ordinary citizens indifferent , and officials complaisant and venal . Even the most - casual observer must have . noticed the change in the attitude of both the corporations and the public . The Chicago telephone franchise , for example , is regarded as more favorable to subscribers than any other in the country . It provides for an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon as remarkable a few years ago . Yet even that franchise is under attack now on the ground that it was practically draWn by the company itself , and that the city ought to have done better still . The same point was made in Cleveland . Mr. Burton was attacked as the traction company 's candidate , though his programme would have brought the city better terms than any other has to-day . Mayor Johnson expects to get still better conditions within a month . Nor are Cleveland , Detroit , and Chicago in possession of any magical secrets for corporation taming : Though they began better than New York or Philadelphia , they have only been using in these later stages of development the advantages which time will put in the hands of every city . THE THIRD DUMA . The results of the Russian elections , which are now nearly completed , show , on the face of the returns , an almost absolute majority for the Reactionaries in the new Duma . So confident are the Monarchist , or True Russian leaders , as they call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be called by their opponents , that they have publicly announced their intention of proceeding to St. Petersburg , merely to aid a benevolent Czar in tiding over the present crisis , and then to bring about their own permanent dissolution , leaving Holy Russia safe at rest once more under the cherishing wing of the autocracy . The Empire has evidently travelled fast and far in the two years since the publication of the October manifesto , which gave to Russia its " Constitution . " At that time the world saw an absolutist government in full panic , a people roused to the wildest expectations of political and social reform , the bureaucracy more than ready to go over to the masses , the nationalities within the Empire advancing more or less openly bold-projects of autonomy or separation ? Russia , in short , passing inevitably , it seemed , into revolution and dissolution . To-day , reaction feels itself firmly seated in the saddle , quite free from panic , audacious enough openly to violate its solemn pledges , and seemingly preparing , with supreme irony , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the regeneration of Russia , into a weapon for Russia 's undoing . This is the obviously dark side of the situation . The optimist , to make out his case , would argue somewhat on the following lines ! The ascendency of the absolutist party in the new Duma is by no means a determined fact . The Reactionaries do not quite number one-half of the total membership , and they maY be held in check by a combination of the two other great parties , the Octobrists , or Moderate Right , and the Constitutional Democrats ; the Left is regarded as insignificant in the third Duma . Such a combination between the two parties which stand for the maintenance of the rights acquired under the Constitution of October 30 , 1905 , may possibly be brougat about by the very excesses of the reactionary element : that something like coalition against the absolutists is already under way is reported in recent dispatches . ' In addition , it is the fact that most of the statesmanship and eloquence in the coming Duma will be found on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democrats have succeeded in returning some of their most prominent leaders in the previous parliaments , and a notable gain is to be recorded in the election of Mr. Milyukoff , the virtual leader of the Constitutional Democrats , whom the government kept out of the first and second Dumas . Mr. Milyukoff 's talent for organizing parliamentary niajorities may again come into play , and a " Constitutional " bloc obtain control of the Duma . ? But even if a fairly Liberal majority should get the upper hand , the question still remains , What can the new Duma hope to accomplish ? . That it will once more attempt to deal with the great problems which brought about the two former dissolutions ' is quite improbable . Political amnesty , ministerial responsibility , a . thoroughgoing agrarian law  --  on these the government spoke with finality when it was faced by hostile radical Dumas ; and , naturally , it will not bear contradiction now when it has the power . The Duma , at the present time , is in a position to do only what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aside all remnants of the Constitution by formally abolishing the Duras , it is strong enough , for the present ; to do so . It need not fear an increase of resentment among the ranks of the radical masses , because there the government 's course up to now has already , created a maximum of irreconcilable hatred . That the Czar and his ministers , however , will not go to the extreme of abolishing the Duma , is a practical certainty ; for a distinction must be drawn , to some extent , between the government and its mob of fanatical supporters in the new Duma . The latter , like every parliamentary mob chosen in a period of reaction , is anxious only to please the powers in. control , by foaming- loyalty at the mouth , oblivious of consequences beyond a , single parliamentary session . A government , even if it be the Rus-Sian government , can not but have an eye to the near future , and that future is by no means an unclouded one for the autocracy , The Czar 's government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it can control , will most probably allow it to perform the strictly salutary functions of " adviser " to an omnipotent autocracy , a function contemplated in the original manifesto of August 19 , 1905 . What can the Liberal parties , under such , circumstances , hope to accomplish ? The Constitutional Democrats will probably decide to swallow the bitter pill , to accept the inevitable , and set to work to save what can be saved out of the wreck of Constitutional rights , in the hope of winning back little by little that complete charter of liberties which Russia enjoyed for two or three days after the thirtieth of October of two years ago . But a conciliatory policy on the part of the Constitutional Democrats would be more than playing for small concessions ; it Would be gaining time and opportunity for the recuperation of the working classes , whose efforts , during the last two years have exhausted them , but without whose active participation , events have shown , there can be no real progress in Russia . The revolutionary leaders must reorganize their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war before another upheaval like that of 1905 can be expected . Till then the Liberals in the Duma , acting as a rearguard , will probably try to save what they can out of the rout . POPULARIZING THE BIBLE . In the present effort to quicken interest in the Bible and increase the number of its readers , the argument commonly advanced is that the Bible is very entertaining . This , indeed , is the inference from the title of Senator Beveridge 's last book , " The Bible as - Good Reading . " A generation ' or two ago there was no attempt to sugar-coat the pill . The Bible was the Bible , the inspired word of God and the one key to Heaven . Thus it was that children of five sat down dutifully to their chapter a day  --  long or short , rain or shine . The question whether you enjoyed the Bible was entirely ' irrelevant ; you were not expected to enjoy it . The reading was as inevitable a part of ' daily routine as going to school , chopping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the dogma of verbal inspiration has lost its hold , as the belief has spread that the futere ' of ymir immortal soul does not depend directly upon your knowledge of the Bible , and as learned critics have advanced the opinion that the Bible is merely one of many edifying books , the impelling motive for reading it has weakened . It must take its chances in competition with thousands of other more or less attractive books , with the newspapers and the illustrated magazines . These causes , we take it , fairly explain that deepening ignorance of the Bible which clergymen and also teachers of English so loudly lament . To be sure , the higher critics eagerly assure us that the Bible contains some of the best literature in the world This is the view which Matthew Arnold urged more than - thirty years ago in " Literature and Dogma . " Rejecting much of the current theology of his day , he maintained that the Bible must be approached from the point of view of culture . He insisted , as he says , on " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he thought , " much fruit ' may be got out of the Bible . " And this has been the attitude of many later writers . But , unfortunately , you can not persuade people that culture will save them from the pains of hell ; and thus it is that millions of amiable men and women care nothing about culture , and calmly neglect the Bible and all other great masterpieces of literature in order to read the last popular novel , the " storyettes " in the monthlies , and the vulgarities of the Sunday newspapers , Then , too , the Bible , regarded merely as literature , has suffered because many people have practically held to that motto which Mr. Arnold described as so ingeniously absurd , " The Bible , the whole Bible , and nothing but the Bible ! " We have handed the whole Bible to our children , told them that it contains the most entertaining stories , like those about Joseph and his . brethren and about Samson , and have then been surprised to see the book laid aside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared with the total bulk of the Bible , the amount of matter that is entertaining to the average ' Child is relatively small ; and the amount that is of the highest literary value is also small . A child can not read the Bible for an hour without running upon some pretty dull passages ; and adults who do not read primarily for religious instruction agree in testifying that the Bible can be enjoyed only by one Who knows how ' to skip . - The case of the children was long ago recognized by publishers of books in Which the Bible stories are retold  --  often in words of one syllable . But to read those was not to read the Bible itself ; and the literary style of these books was often extremely crude . A distinct improvement on this method was shown in the volume entitled " The Bible for Children , " arranged from the King lames Version by Mrs. Joseph B. Gilder , and pnbliShed by the Century Company in 1902 . In the introduction to this excellent anthology Bishop Potter himself says : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pertinency ; not all of it is of equal interest or utility The old tradition that to read it through , mechanically and indiscriminatingly , two or three times a year , had of itself some occult and mysterious potency , has come to be recognized as belonging to the kindred tradition that soldiers ' lives have been saved by a New Testament carried in the left breast pocket , . because it was a Testament , whereas any other volume carried in the same place would have stopped the bullet quite as effectually . Of course , the notion of making anthologies of this kind is not exactly new . The Psalms , the Epistles , and the Gospels in the Book of Common Prayer form a small but admirable anthology The American Bible Society itself has printed in separate volumes not only the New Testament , but the Psalms and other portions for which there is special demand . But the importance , indeed the necessity , of presenting the Bible by selections is , IA are glad to observe , becoming more generally understood . This autumn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a growing demand : " The Soul of the Bible , " made up of passages chosen by Ulysses G. B. Pierce , and published by the American Unitarian Association ; and " The Literary Man 's Bible " ( Chapman &; Hall ) , prepared by W. L. Courtney , editor of the Fortnightly Review . Mr. Courtney , in his preface , frankly avows the purr ose of securing for the literary parts of the Bible a heartier appreciation : When so many people seemed to imagine that the Bible had nothing to do with literature , it appeared to me not an unprofitable task to attempt to prove that the Bible containS literary elements of priceless merit . To such treatment the Bible lends itself admirably . It is not a unit : it is a ' collection of Hebrew ? prose and poetry ; and the most pious and orthodox Christian can not object to a volume of selections ' which shall give wider currency to the best of it . For the shortcomings of the rising generation in Biblical knowledge are a topic of perennial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , echoes the complaint . Not long ago , in Figctro , Marcel Prevost complained in an obiter dictum that " the children of the primary school to-day . no longer learn the sacred history ; they are ignorant for the most part of the beautiful story of Joseph sold by his brethren , of the Queen of Sheba , and of the war of the Maccabees " With that sentence as text , E. M. de Vogue has written for Figaro a leading article in which he points out that the philosophies , the literatures , the arts , and the languages themselves of Western civilization have been nourished ( aliment ? ) in large part from the Bible . The Biblical tradition impregnates all our fashions of thinking and ' speaking A man totally unacquainted-with the sacred history would go through the world as if deaf or blind . A people which loses familiarity with . the Bible is exiled from its spiritual and intellectual fatherland , and becomes a tribe of outlaws . To these sentiments men of all creeds or no creed can sub --  , scribe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ James Version , must welcome any anthology that may make the vital parts of it more accessible and popular DRAMATIC CENSORSHIP AGAIN . A storm that has been brewing for some time seems likely to break soon upon the devoted head of George Alexander Redford , the British dramatic censor , or , to give him his legal title , Examiner of Plays . A committee of dramatists , belonging chiefly to what is generally but rather vaguely described as the advanced school , and other interested persons , is in process of formation , with a view to securing either the abolition of his office or a limitb , tion of its authority . It is to be ? noted , however , that the movement , though not uninfluential , appears to be founded upon-a sense of private injury , rather than upon any general public demand . The immediate cause of it is the veto which Mr. Redford has put upon the production of two plays , one , " The Breaking Point , " by Edward Garnett , son of the late Dr. Richard Garnett , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " by Granville Barker , one of the most active and successful champions of the intellectual and imaginative theatre . Of the latter piece not much is yet publicly known , but Mr. Garnett 's play has been published , and few unprejudiced readers will deem its exclusion from the stage an outrage . It is not immoral , but it is uselessly and unnecessarily crude in its references , unpleasant and improbable in its theme , and unnatural in its treatment . In this one instance , then , the censor can make out a good case in Ms own defence . He has not burked a masterpiece or eclipsed the gayety of nations , but the justice or injustice of a single decision on his part is , of ' course , an insignificant matter compared with the general question of the utility , the necessity , or the extent of his jurisdiction . And now that the English-speaking theatre , owing to the syndicate system , is rapidly becoming an international institution , the question is one that is not without interest on this side of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the censor , bases his indict- , merit upon several " axioms . " Among them are the following : ( 1 ) That it is not his function to suppress works of art , ( 2 ) that his sole function is to prevent " gross or prurient indecency , " ( 3 ) that it is not his business to suppress intellectual plays criticising contemporary life or introducing new moral teaching . There are others , but these three will suffice ; - and , if the second is sound , manifestly two of them are superfluous . The first point to decide is what constitutes gross and prurient indecency . If this phrase is to be construed exactly , it can only mean acted obscenity , and that is a matter amply provided for by police regulations , and no specially qualified censor is needdd . But the real danger to be guarded against , of course , is veiled indecency , the artful suggestion that puts a gloss upon vice , disguises vile and morbid passion in specious and alluring form , confuses right and wrong , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beauty , panders to the lower instincts . Nobody can deny that there is a large amount of such insidious poison in the modern European drama , or assert that it is either profitable or hehlthful for a mixed audience . Whether it might be instructive and inspiring to an assemblage of assorted specialists is another matter . To the young of both sexes , it is beyond all questionehighly demoralizing . The question then arises whether it is wiser , ? in a community which professes to set some store upon training and example , to give dramatists a free hand in dealing with such material , without reference either to manner or motive , expecting the consumers to provide their own antidote , or to subject them to some sort of regulation . If the latter plan be adopted , ' it is clear that the regulating authority ought to be endowed with a much larger share of wisdom and discretion than could reasonably be looked for in the average police officer . It is upon this theory , presumably , that the British censorship is still maintained , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practi  --  ally disappeared . That some kind of theatrical supervision and control is desirable , in the interests of literary and dramatic art , as well as of goal morals , most reflecting persons will agree . The great difficulty lies in the selection of a competent triThinal , one that could not be suspected of bigotry , prejudice , favoritism , prudery , or excessive liberality . That the public feel instinctively the need of some such institution is possibly shown by the . development of the unofficial guild of dramatic critics . These gentlemen might constitute a potent censorship , if their numbers , and the lack of recognized standards , did not preclude the possibility ' of their agreement . Experience seems to prove that the only practical censorship must consist of one man , or a very small commission . With us , the problem would be to keep it free from political and other malign bleu. ences ; but there would be an abundance of work for it to do , if only in the suppression of the host of cheap and pestilential melodramas with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which are often a disgrace to our civilization . Against Mr. Redford 's integrity there has been no breath of suspicion . Only his judgment is impugned . Doubtless , he has made some mistakes , but he will not lack for sympathizers in his view that Tolstoy 's " Powers of Darkness , " Ibsen 's " Ghosts , " Brieux 's " Maternite , " Bernard Shaw 's " Mrs. Warren 's Profession , " and " The Breaking Point , " however benevolent they may be in purpose , contain matter that is unsuitable for - popular entertainment . Mr. Garnett and some of his associates are quite sincere , doubtless , in their indignation and protestations ; but there is a vast amount of hypocrisy beneath the pretended zeal of many of the advocates of the advanced drama . It is the prospect of financial gain , rather than any worship of art or intellect , that is too often the true incentive . There is a market for the abnormal and the lewd . Mr. Redford has been fighting honestly and courageously , if not always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an essential characteristic of the best art and good manners . Unfortunately , he can not kill a rank play without advertising it  --  a fact of which American managers take prompt advantage . But if his censorship is ineffective here , that is not his fault
