txt The announcement authoritatively made to-day that the New Haven Road had sold to John L. Billard of Meriden , Conn. , its 110,000 shares of Boston &; Maine stock is variously regarded here . An interview with Mr. Dillard is published in which he says : " I own the stock personally , I understand , but there are others interested . But the stock is all in my name , and I am to vote . " " Then there are others interested with you in this purchase ? " " Well , I suppose so , but it is something I can not talk about . The facts have all been given , and if there was anything more that I could tell you about it I would be glad to do so . " " Have you ever had any experience in railroad matters before , Mr. Billard ? " " No , I have never been interested in railroad matters in any way . I have had no experience in that line whatever . " " How long have you been considering the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Haven ? " " Oh , for some Little time . I had several interviews about It before the deal was closed . " " What led you to make the purchase at this time , if you have not heretofore been interested in railroad matters ? " " That is something I can not discuss . I said I had no experience in railroad matters . I have been for fifty years right here in Meriden , Conn. , and I am President of the Meriden Savings Bank and of the Lyon &; Billard Company , which deals in lumber and coal . " All that I can say in addition to what I have already told you is that the property of the road will be cared for in good shape . " " We understand in Boston that It Is your intention to work in harmony with both the Boston &; Maine and the New Haven . Is that so ? " " Yes , that is true . I shall try to work In harmony with the interests of both roads and for the interests of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tuttle of the Boston &; Maine said to-day : " All I can say with regard to this transaction is that 109,948 shares of Boston &; Maine controlled by the New York , New Haven &; Hartford Railroad were put in for transfer on July 1 . Our transfer agent , the Old Colony ? Trust Company , notified my by telephone that this stock had been presented for transfer and that it had been placed in the name of John L. Billard . " I saw President Mellen a few days later , and he informed me that the stock bad been sold to Mr. Billard , and that it was an actual sale . " Mr. Dillard is a man ' of affairs at Meriden , Conn .. is President of the Meriden Savings Bank , and , so far as I know , is not generally understood to have any particular interest in the affairs of the New Haven Company . " I do not know the price paid for the stock , but I am disposed to believe there has been an actual sale sufficient to satisfy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be presumed that Mr. Billard paid $10,000,000 or $15,000,000 of his own cash for this stock . He may have banking connections which would be glad to finance such a purchase , and if he nas not , the bankers interested in the New Haven road could easily arrange the matter , but whether or not any one else has assisted in the purchase is immateriaL The stock has been bought by Mr. Billard and placed in his name . Just how he nas financed it I have no knowledge , neither is it material to the fact " Despite the fact that Mr. Billiard is the nominal owner of the stock Attorney General Dana Malone says he will press the suit which the State has instituted against the New Haven Road . The writ in the State 's case is returnable the first Monday in August , and the company has thirty days in which to file an aitswer . Until such an answer is forthcoming , the Attorney General and the courts will not have official intimation of the trans-1 fer of the Boston &; Maine stock . Many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Haven Road in reality still maintains its grip on the Massachusetts corporation . The transfer , it is admitted , satisfies all legal requirements but at the same time does not , it is claimed , absolutely prevent the New Haven from dictating the policies of the Boston &; Maine . Louis D. Brandeis , the chief opponent Of the merger . Is however , gratified . Said his I have no right to assume that the road has not sold Its Boston &; Maine shares In good faith . I do ' not wish to assume that there Is any further disposition on the part of the New Haven to defy or evade the law of the Commonwealth . If anything of that sort is involved in this ' latest transaction I have no doubt it will be so much the worse for the road a little later . In either case the action is In line with what we were trying to bring about . What we were working for was to prevent a merger of the New Haven and the Boston &; Maine into one corporation Apparently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sells its trolleys and sells its Boston &; Maine holdings , the suits now pending are made unnecessary , because the public gets what it sues for without waiting for a judgment .
