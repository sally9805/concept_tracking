" Boethius once stayed up all night watching a toad in the hope that it might relinquish its treasure ; but he complained that nothing resulted " to gratify the great pangs of his whole night 's restlessness . " An old Irish legend says that " the stone Adamant in the land of India grows no colder in any wind or snow or ice ; there is no heat in it under burning sods " ( this is such an Hibernian touch ! The peat fuel was the Celtic idea of a heating system ) , " nothing is broken from it by striking of axes and hammers ; there is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lamb at the Mass ; and every king that has taken that stone in his right hand before going into battle , has always gained the victory . " There is also a superstition regarding the stone Hibien , which is said to flame like a fiery candle in the darkness , " it spills out poison before it in a vessel ; every snake that comes near to it or crosses it dies on the moment . " Another stone revered in Irish legend is the Stone of Istien , which is found " in the brains of dragons after their deaths , " and a still more capable jewel seems to be the Stone of Panes , within which it is claimed that the sun , moon , and twelve stars are to be seen . " In the hearts of the dragons it is always found that make their journey under the sea . No one having it in his hand can tell any lie until he has // put it from him ; no race or army could bring it into a house where there is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour of matins it gives out sweet music that there is not the like of under heaven . " Bartholomew , the medieval scientist , tells narratives of the magical action of the sapphire . " The sapphire is a precious stone , " he says , " and is blue in colour , most like to heaven in fair weather and clear , and is best among precious stones , and most apt and able to fingers of kings . And if thou put an addercop in a box , and hold a very sapphire of India at the mouth of the box any while , by virtue thereof the addercop is overcome and dieth , as it were suddenly . And this same I have seen proved oft in many and divers places . " Possibly the fact that the addercop is so infrequent an invader of our modern life accounts for the fact that we are left inert upon reading so surprising a statement ; or possibly our incredulity dominates our awe . The art of the lapidary , or science of glyptics , is a most interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider it for a few moments on its technical side . It is very ancient as an art . In Ecclesiasticus the wise Son of Sirach alludes to craftsmen " that cut and grave seals , and are diligent to make great variety , and give themselves to counterfeit imagery , and watch to finish a work . " Theophilus on glyptics is too delightfully naive for us to resist quoting his remarks . " Crystal , " he announces , " which is water hardened into ice , and the 82 Arts and Crafts in the Middle Ages ice of great age hardened into stone , is trimmed and polished in this manner . " He then directs the use of sandstone and emery , chiefly used by rubbing , as one might infer , to polish the stones , probably en cabochon as was the method in his time ; this style of finish on a . gem was called " tallow cutting . " But when one wishes to sculp crystal , Theophilus informs one : " Take a goat of two or three years . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the position of the heart , and lay in the crystal , so that it may lie in its blood until it grow warm . . . cut what you please in it as long as the heat lasts . " Just how many goats were required to the finishing of a sculptured crystal would be determined by the elaboration of the design ! Unfortunately Animal Rescue Leagues had not invaded the monasteries of the eleventh century . In sculpturing glass , the ingenuous Theophilus is quite at his best . " Artists ! " he exclaims , " who wish to engrave glass in a beautiful manner , I now can teach you , as I have myself made trial . I have sought the gross worms which the plough turns up in the ground , and the art necessary in these things also bid me procure vinegar , and the warm blood of a lusty goat , which I was careful to place under the roof for a short time , bound with a strong ivy plant . After this I infused the worms and vinegar with the warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which being done , I essayed to sculp the glass with the hard stone called the Pyrites . " What a pity good Theophilus had not begun // with the pyrites , when he would probably have made the further discovery that his worms and goats could have been spared . In the polishing of precious stones , he is quite sane in his directions . " Procure a marble slab , very smooth , " he enjoins , " and act as useful art points out to you . " In other words , rub it until it is smooth ! Bartholomew Anglicus is as entertaining as Theophilus regarding crystal . " Men trowe that it is of snow or ice made hard in many years , " he observes complacently . " This stone set in the sun taketh fire , insomuch if dry tow be put thereto , it setteth the tow on fire , " and again , quoting Gregory on Ezekiel I. , he adds , " water is of itself fleeting , but by strength of cold it is turned and made stedfast crystal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purple beads carved into the semblance of human faces may be seen on the Tara brooch ; while also on the same brooch occur little purple daisies . The Cup of the Ptolemies , a celebrated onyx cup in Paris , is over fifteen inches in circumference , and is a fine specimen of early lapidary 's work . It was presented in the ninth century by Charles the Bald to St. Denis , and was always used to contain the consecrated wine when Queens of France were crowned . Henry II . once pawned it to a Jew when he was hard up , and in 1804 it was stolen and the old gold and jewelled setting removed . It was found again in Holland , and was remounted within a century . 84 Arts and Crafts in the Middle Ages In the Treasury of St. Mark 's in Venice are many valuable examples of carved stones , made into cups , flagons , and the like . These were brought from Constantinople in 1204 , when the city was captured by the Venetians . Constantinople was the only place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the early Middle Ages . The Greek artists who took refuge in Italy at that time brought the art with them . There are thirty-two of these Byzantine chalices in St. Mark 's . Usually the mountings are of gold , and precious stones . There are also two beautiful cruets of agate , elaborately ornamented , but carved in curious curving forms requiring skill of a superior order . Two other rock crystal cruets are superbly carved , probably by Oriental workmen , however , as they are not Byzantine in their decorations . One of them was originally a vase , and , indeed , is still , for the long gold neck has no connection with the inside ; the handle is also of gold , both these adjuncts seem to have been regarded as simply ornament . The other cruet is carved elaborately with leopards , the first and taller one showing monsters and foliate forms . Around the neck of the lower of these rock crystal cruets is an inscription , praying for God 's blessing on the " Imam Aziz Billah , " who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gold stand . The handle is cleverly cut in the same piece of crystal , but a band of gold is carried down it to give it extra strength . The forming of this handle in connection with the rest of the work is a veritable tour de force , and we should have // grave doubts whether Theophilus with his goats could have managed it ! Vasari speaks with characteristic enthusiasm of the glyptics of the Greeks , " whose works in that manner may be called divine . " But , as he continues , " many and very many years passed over during which the art was lost " . . . . until in the days of Lorenzo di Medici the fashion for cameos and intaglios revived . In the Guild of the Masters of Wood and Stone in Florence , the cameo-cutters found a place , nevertheless it seems fitting to include them at this point among jewellers , instead of among carvers . The Italians certainly succeeded in performing feats of lapidary art at a later period . Vasari mentions two cups ordered by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lapis lazuli , and the other from an enormous heliotrope , and a crystal galley with gold rigging was made by the Sanachi brothers . In the Green Vaults in Dresden may be seen numerous specimens of valuable but hideous products of this class . In the seventeenth century , the art had run its course , and gave place to a taste for cameos , which in its turn was run into the ground . Cameo-cutting and gem engraving has always been accomplished partly by means of a drill ; the deepest point to be reached in the cutting would be punctured first , and then the surfaces cut , chipped , and ground away until the desired level was attained . This is on much the same principle as that adopted by marble cutters to-day . 86 Arts and Crafts in the Middle Ages Mr. Cyril Davenport 's definition of a cameo is quite satisfactory : " A small sculpture executed in low relief upon some substance precious either for its beauty , rarity , or hardness . " Cameos are usually cut in onyx , the different layers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so that the sculpture appears to be rendered in one colour on another , and sometimes three or four layers are recognized , so that a shaded effect is obtained . Certain pearly shells are sometimes used for cameo cutting ; these were popular in Italy in the fifteenth century . In Greece and Rome the art of cameo cutting was brought to astonishing perfection , the sardonyx being frequently used , and often cut in five different coloured layers . An enormous antique cameo , measuring over nine inches across , maybe seen in Vienna ; it represents the Apotheosis of Augustus , and the scene is cut in two rows of spirited figures . It dates from the first century A. D. It is in dark brown and white . Among the treasures of the art-loving Henry III . was a " great cameo , " in a golden case ; it was worth two hundred pounds . This cameo was supposed to compete with a celebrated work at Ste. Chapelle in Paris , which had been brought by Emperor Baldwin II . from Constantinople . In Paris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cutters , and Engravers of Cameos and Hard Stones , " in the thirteenth century ; glass cutters were included in this body for a time , but after 1584 the revised laws did not permit of any imitative work , so glass // cutters were no longer allowed to join the society . The French work was rather coarse compared with the classic examples . The celebrated Portland Vase is a glass cameo , of enormous proportions , and a work of the first century , in blue and white . There is a quaint legend connected with the famous stone cameo known as the Vase of St. Martin , which is as follows : when St. Martin visited the Martyr 's Field at Agaune , he prayed for some time , and then stuck his knife into the ground , and , was excusably astonished at seeing blood flow forth . Recognizing at once that he was in the presence of the miraculous ( which was almost second nature to mediaeval saints ) , he began sedulously to collect the precious fluid in a couple of receptacles with which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two vases , however , were soon filled , and yet the mystical ruby spring continued . At his wit 's ends , he prayed again for guidance , and presently an angel descended , with a vase of fine cameo workmanship , in which the remainder of the sacred fluid was preserved . This vase is an onyx , beautifully cut , with fine figures , and is over eight inches high , mounted at foot and collar with Byzantine gold and jewelled work . The subject appears to be an episode during the Siege of Troy , ? a whimsical selection of design for an angel . Some apparently mediaeval cameos are in reality antiques recut with Christian characters . A Hercules could easily be turned into a David , while Perseus and Medusa could be transformed quickly into a David and 88 Arts and Crafts in the Middle Ages Goliath . There are two examples of cameos of the Virgin which had commenced their careers , one as a Leda , and the other as Venus ! While a St. John had originally figured as Jupiter with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all branches of gem cutting , and cameos began to improve , and to resemble once more their classical ancestors . Indeed , their resemblance was rather academic , and there was little originality in design . Like most of the Renaissance arts , it was a reversion instead of a new creation . Technically , however , the work was a triumph . The craftsmen were not satisfied until they had quite outdone the ancients , and they felt obliged to increase the depth of the cutting , in order to show how cleverly they could coerce the material ; they even under-cut in some cases . During the Medicean period of Italian art , cameos were cut in most fantastic forms ; sometimes a negro head would be introduced simply to exhibit a dark stratum in the onyx , and was quite without beauty . One of the Florentine lapidaries was known as Giovanni of the Carnelians , and another as Domenico of the Cameos . This latter carved a portrait of Ludovico it Moro on a red balas ruby , in intaglio . Nicolo Avanzi is reported as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the scene of the Nativity . Matteo dal Nassaro , a son of a shoemaker in Verona , developed extraordinary talent in gem cutting . An exotic production is a crucifix cut in a blood-stone by Matteo del Nassaro , where the artist has so utilized // the possibilities of this stone that he has made the red patches to come in suitable places to portray drops of blood . Matteo worked also in Paris , in 1531 , where he formed a school and craft shop , and where he was afterwards made Engraver of the Mint . Vasari tells of an ingenious piece of work by Matteo , where he has carved a chalcedony into a head of Dejanira , with the skin of the lion about it . He says , " In the stone there was a vein of red colour , and here the artist has made the skin turn over . . . and he has represented this skin with such exactitude that the spectator imagines himself to behold it newly torn from the animal ! Of another mark he has availed himself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken for the face and breast . " Matteo was an independent spirit : when a baron once tried to beat him down in his price for a gem , he refused to take a small sum for it , but asked the baron to accept it as a gift . When this offer was refused , and the nobleman insisted upon giving a low price , Matteo deliberately took his hammer and shattered the cameo into pieces at a single blow . His must have been an unhappy life . Vasari says that he " took a wife in France and became the father of children , but they were so entirely dissimilar to himself , that he had but little satisfaction from them . " Another famous lapidary was Valerio Vicentino , who carved a set of crystals which were made into a casket for Pope Clement VII. , while for Paul III . he made a carved crystal cross and chandelier . 90 Arts and Crafts in the Middle Ages Vasari reserves his highest commendation for Casati , called " el Greco , " " by whom every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as in the universality of his productions . " . . . " Nay , Michelangelo himself , looking at them one day while Giovanni Vasari was present , remarked that the hour for the death of the art had arrived , for it was not possible that better work could be seen ! " Michelangelo proved a prophet , in this case surely , for the decadence followed swiftly . CHAPTER III ENAMEL " Oh , thou discreetest of readers , " says Benvenuto Cellini , " marvel not that I have given so much time to writing about all this , " and we feel like making the same apology for devoting a whole chapter to enamel ; but this branch of the goldsmith 's art has so many subdivisions , that it cries for space . The word Enamel is derived from various sources . The Greek language has contributed " maltha , " to melt ; the German " schmeltz , " the old French " esmail , " and the Italian " smalta , " all meaning about the same thing , and suggesting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of all ages , ? its fusibility . For it is always employed in a fluid state , and always must be . Enamel is a type of glass product reduced to powder , and then melted by fervent heat into a liquid condition , which , when it has hardened , returns to its vitreous state . Enamel has been used from very early times . The first allusion to it is by Philostratus , in the year 200 A. D. , where he described the process as applied to the armour of his day . " The barbarians of the regions of the ocean , " 91 92 Arts and Crafts in the Middle Ages ? , e writes , " are skilled in fusing colours on heated brass , rich become as hard as stone , and render the ornament thus produced durable . " Enamels have special characteristics in different periods : in the late tenth century , of Byzantium and , Germany ; in the eleventh century , of Italy ; while most of the later work owes its leading characteristics to the French , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It helps one to understand the differences and similarities in enamelled work , to observe the three general forms in which it is employed ; these are , the cloisonne , the champleve , and the painted enamel . There are many subdivisions of these classifications , but for our purpose these three will suffice . In cloisonne , the only manner known to the Greek , Anglo-Saxon , and Celtic craftsmen , the pattern is made upon a gold ground , by little upright wire lines , like filigree , the enamel is fused into all the little compartments thus formed , each bit being one clear colour , on the principle of a mosaic . The colours were always rather clear and crude , but are the more sincere and decorative on this account , the worker recognizing frankly the limitation of the material ; and the gold outline harmonizes the whole , as it does in any form of art work . A cloisonne enamel is practically a mosaic , in which the separations consist of narrow bands of metal instead of plaster . The enamel was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then fused all together in the furnace . 94 Arts and Crafts in the Middle Ages Champleve enamel has somewhat the same effect as the cloisonne , but the end is attained by different means . The outline is left in metal , and the whole background is cut away and sunk , thus making the hollow chambers for the vitreous paste , in one piece , instead of by means of wires . Often it is not easy to determine which method has been employed to produce a given work . Painted enamels were not employed in the earliest times , but came to perfection in the Renaissance . A translucent enamel prevailed especially in Italy : a low relief was made with the graver on gold or silver ; fine raised lines were left here and there , to separate the colours . Therefore , where the cutting was deepest , the enamel ran thicker , and consequently darker in colour , giving the effect of shading , while in reality only one tint had been used . The powdered and moistened enamel was spread evenly with a spatula @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kiln until it liquefied . Another form of enamel was used to colour gold work in relief , with a permanent coating of transparent colour . Sometimes this colour was applied in several coats , one upon another , and the features painted with a later touch . Much enamelled jewelry was made in this way , figures , dragons , and animal forms , being among the most familiar . But an actual enamel painting ? on the principle of a picture , was rendered in still another way . In preparing the ground for enamel painting , there are two things which have been essentially considered in all times and countries . The enamel ground // must be more fusible than the metal on which it is placed , or else both would melt together . Also the enamel with which the final decoration is executed must be more easily made fluid than the harder enamel on which it is laid . In fact , each coat must of necessity be a trifle more fusible than the preceding one . A very accurate knowledge is necessary to execute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In examining historic examples of enamel , the curious oval set in gold , known as the Alfred Jewel , is among the first which come within our province . It was found in Somersetshire , and probably dates from about the year 878 . It consists of an enamelled figure covered by a thick crystal , set in filigree , around the edge of which runs the inscription , " AELFRED MEC REHT GAVUR CAN " ( Alfred ordered me to be wrought ) . King Alfred was a great patron of the arts . Of such Anglo-Saxon work , an ancient poem in the Exeter Book testifies : " For one a wondrous skill in goldsmith 's art is provided Full oft he decorates and well adorns A powerful king 's nobles . " Celtic enamels are interesting , being usually set in the spaces among the rambling interlaces of this school of goldsmithing . The Cross of Cong is among the most famous specimens of this work , and also the bosses on the Ardagh Chalice . The monk Theophilus describes the process of enamelling in a graphic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crafts in the Middle Ages " adapt their pieces of gold in all the settings in which the glass gems are to be placed " ( by which we see that he teaches the cloisonne method ) . " Cut small bands of exceedingly thin gold , " he continues , " in which you will bend and fashion whatever work you wish to make in enamel , whether circles , knots , or small flowers , or birds , or animals , or figures . " He then admonishes one to solder it with greatest care , two or three times , until all the pieces adhere firmly to the plate . To prepare the powdered glass Theophilus advises placing a piece of glass in the fire , and , when it has become glowing , " throw it into a copper vessel in which there is water , and it instantly flies into small fragments which you break with a round pestle until quite fine . The next step is to put the powder in its destined cloison , and to place the whole jewel upon a thin piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the enamel from the coals , and put it in the most intensely hot part of the fire . " Theophilus recommends that this little iron cover be " perforated finely all over so that the holes may be inside flat and wide , and outside finer and rough , in order to stop the cinders if by chance they should fall upon it . " This process of firing may have to be repeated several times , until the enamel fills every space evenly . Then follows the tedious task of burnishing ; setting the jewel in a strong bit of wax , you are told to rub it on a " smooth hard bone , " until it is polished well and evenly . Benvenuto Cellini recommends a little paper sponge // to be used in smoothing the face of enamels . " Take a clean nice piece of paper , " he writes , " and chew it well between your teeth , ? that is , if you have got any ? I could not do it , because I 've none left ! " A celebrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pala d'Oro at St. Mark 's in Venice . This is a gold altar piece or reredos , about eleven feet long and seven feet high , richly wrought in the Byzantine style , and set with enamels and precious stones . The peculiar quality of the surface of the gold still lingers in the memory ; it looks almost liquid , and suggests the appearance of metal in a fluid state . On its wonderful divisions and arched compartments are no less than twelve hundred pearls , and twelve hundred other precious gems . These stones surround the openings in which are placed the very beautiful enamel figures of saints and sacred personages . St. Michael occupies a prominent position ; the figure is partly in relief . The largest medallion contains the figure of Christ in glory , and in other compartments may be seen even such secular personages as the Empress Irene , and the Doge who was ruling Venice at the time this altar piece was put in place ? the year 1106 . The Pala d'Oro is worked in the champleve process , the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is undoubtedly a Byzantine work ; the Doge Orseolo , in 976 , ordered it to be made by the enamellers of Constantinople . It was not finished for nearly two centuries , arriving in Venice in 1102 , when the portrait of the Doge then 98 Arts and Crafts in the Middle Ages reigning was added to it . The Byzantine range of colours was copious ; they had white , two reds , bright and dark , dark and light blue , green , violet , yellow , flesh tint , and black . These tints were always fused separately , one in each cloison : the Greeks in this period never tried to blend colours , and more than one tint never appears in a compartment . The enlarging and improving of the Pala d'Oro was carried on by Greek artists in Venice in 1105 . It was twice altered after that , once in the fourteenth century for Dandolo , and thus the pure Byzantine type is somewhat invaded by the Gothic spirit . The restorations in 1345 were presided over by Gianmaria Boninsegna . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Crown of Charlemagne , ' which is a magnificent structure of eight plaques of gold , joined by hinges , and surmounted by a cross in the front , and an arch crossing the whole like a rib from back to front . The other cross rib has been lost , but originally the crown was arched by two ribs at the top . The plates of gold are ornamented , one with jewels , and filigree , and the next with a large figure in enamel . These figures are similar to those occurring on the Pala d Oro . The Shrine of the Three Kings in Cologne is decorated both with cloisonne and champleve enamels , ? an unusual circumstance . In Aix la Chapelle the shrine of Charlemagne is extremely like it in some respects , but the only enamels are in champleve . Good examples // of translucent enamels in relief may be seen on several of the reliquaries at Aix la Chapelle . Theophilus gives us directions for making a very ornate chalice with handles , richly embossed and ornamented with niello . Another paragraph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precious stones and pearls . It would be interesting as a modern problem , to follow minutely his directions , and to build the actual chalice described in the eleventh century . To apply the gems and pearls Theophilus directs us to " cut pieces like straps , " which you " bend together to make small settings of them , by which the stones may be enclosed . " These little settings , with their stones , are to be fixed with flour paste in their places and then warmed over the coals until they adhere . This sounds a little risky , but we fancy he must have succeeded , and , indeed , it seems to have been the usual way of setting stones in the early centuries . Filigree flowers are then to be added , and the whole soldered into place in a most primitive manner , banking the coals " in the shape of a small furnace , so that the coals may lie thickly around the circumference , " and when the solder " flows about as if undulating , " the artist is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the fire . Niello , with which the chalice of Theophilus is also to be enriched , stands in relation to the more beautiful art of enamel , as drawing does to painting , and it is well to consider it here . Both the Romans and the 100 Arts and Crafts in the Middle Ages Anglo-Saxons understood its use . It has been employed as an art ever since the sixth and seventh centuries . The term " niello " probably is an abbreviation of the Italian word " nigellus " ( black ) ; the art is that of inlaying an engraved surface with a black paste , which is thoroughly durable and hard as the metal itself in most cases , the only difference being in flexibility ; if the metal plate is bent , the niello will crack and flake off . Niello is more than simply a drawing on metal . That would come under the head of engraving . A graver is used to cut out the design on the surface of the silver , which is simply a polished plane . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , made of lead , lamp black , and other substances , is filled into the interstices , and rubbed in ; when quite dry and hard , this is polished . The result is a black enamel which is then fused into the silver , so that the whole is one surface , and the decoration becomes part of the original plate . The process as described by Theophilus is as follows : " Compose the niello in this manner ; take pure silver and divide it into equal parts , adding to it a third part of pure copper , and taking yellow sulphur , break it very small . . . and when you have liquefied the silver with the copper , stir it evenly with charcoal , and instantly pour into it lead and sulphur . " This niello paste is then made into a stick , and heated until " it glows : then with another forceps , long and thin , hold the niello and rub it all over the places which you wish to make black , until the drawing be full , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smooth with a flat file , until the silver appear . " When Theophilus has finished his directions , he adds : " And take great care that no further work is required . " To polish the niello , he directs us to " pumice it with a damp stone , until it is made everywhere bright . " There are various accounts of how Finiguerra , who was a worker in niello in Florence , discovered by its means the art of steel engraving . It is probably only a legendary narrative , but it is always told as one of the apocryphal stories when the origin of printing is discussed , and may not be out of place here . Maso Finiguerra , a Florentine , had just engraved the plate for his famous niello , a Pax which is now to be seen in the Bargello , and had filled it in with the fluid enamel , which was standing waiting until it should be dry . Then , according to some authorities , a piece of paper blew upon the damp surface , on which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impressed ; others state that it was through the servant 's laying a damp cloth upon it , that the principle of printing from an incised plate was suggested . At any rate , Finiguerra took the hint , it is said , and made an impression on paper , rolling it , as one would do with an etching or engraving . In the Silver Chamber in the Pitti Palace is a Pax , by Mantegna , made in the same way as that by Finiguerra , and bearing comparison with it . The engraving is most delicate , and it is difficult to imagine a better 102 Arts and Crafts in the Middle Ages specimen of the art . The Madonna and Child , seated in an arbour , occupy the centre of the composition , which is framed with jewelled bands , the frame being divided into sixteen compartments , in each of which is seen a tiny and exquisite picture . The work on the arbour of roses in which the Virgin sits is of remarkable quality , as well as the small birds and animals introduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is seen crossing the river with the Christ Child on his back , while in the water a fish and a swan are visible . In Valencia in Spain may be seen a chalice which has been supposed to be the very cup in which Our Saviour instituted the Communion . The cup itself is of sardonyx , and of fine form . The base is made of the same stone , and handles and bands are of gold , adorned with black enamel . Pearls , rubies , sapphires , and emeralds are set in profusion about the stem and base . It is a work of the epoch of Imperial Rome . In England , one of the most perfect specimens of fine , close work , is the Wilton Chalice , dating from the twelfth century . The Warwick Bowl , too , is of very delicate workmanship , and both are covered with minute scenes and figures . One of the most splendid treasures in this line is the crozier of William Wyckham , now in Oxford . It is strictly national in style . The agreement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the building of the chapel of that king in Westminster , is extant . It is bound in velvet and bossed with enamels . It is an interesting fact that some // of the enamels are in the Italian style , while others are evidently English . Limoges was the most famous centre of the art of enamelling in the twelfth century , the work being known as Opus de Limogia , or Labor Limogiae . Limoges was a Roman settlement , and enamels were made there as early as the time of Philostratus . Champleve enamel , while it was not produced among the Greeks , nor even in Byzantine work , was almost invariable at Limoges in the earlier days : one can readily tell the difference between a Byzantine enamel and an early Limoges enamel by this test , when there is otherwise sufficient similarity of design to warrant the question . Some of the most beautiful enamels of Limoges were executed in what was called basse-taille , or transparent enamel on gold grounds , which had been first prepared in bas-relief . Champleve enamel was often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , reliquaries , and larger bits of church furniture . The enamel used on copper is usually opaque , and somewhat coarser in texture than that employed on gold or silver . Owing to their additional toughness , these specimens are usually in perfect preservation . In 1327 , Guillaume de Harie , in his will , bequeathed 800 francs to make two high tombs , to be covered with Limoges enamel , one for himself , and the other for " Blanche d'Avange , my dear companion . " An interesting form of cloisonne enamel was that known as " plique a jour , " which consists of a filigree // setting with the enamel in transparent bits , without any metallic background . It is still made in many parts of the world . When held to the light it resembles minute arrangements of stained glass . Francis I. showed Benvenuto Cellini a wonderful bowl of this description , and asked Cellini if he could possibly imagine how the result was attained . " Sacred Majesty , " replied Benvenuto , " I can tell you exactly how it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the astonished courtiers how the bowl was constructed , bit by bit , inside a bowl of thin iron lined with clay . The wires were fastened in place with glue until the design was complete , and then the enamel was put in place , the whole being fused together at the soldering . The clay form to which all this temporarily adhered was then removed , and the work , transparent and ephemeral , was ready to stand alone . King John gave to the city of Lynn a magnificent cup of gold , enamelled , with figures of courtiers of the period , engaged in the sports of hawking and harehunting , and dressed in the costume of the king 's reign . " King John gave to the Corporation a rich cup and cover , " says Mackarel , " weighing seventy-three ounces , which is preserved to this day and upon all public occasions and entertainments used with some uncommon ceremonies at drinking the health of the King or Queen , and whoever goes to visit the Mayor must drink out of this cup , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enamels which are used as flat values 106 Arts and Crafts in the Middle Ages in backgrounds to the little silver figures , are dark rose , clear blue , and soft green . The dresses of the persons are also picked out in the same colours , varied from the grounds . This cup was drawn by John Carter in 1787 , he having had much trouble in getting permission to study the original for that purpose ! He took letters of introduction to the Corporation , but they appeared to suspect him of some imposture ; at first they refused to entertain his proposal at all , but after several applications , he was allowed to have the original before him , in a closed room , in company with a person appointed by them but at his expense , to watch him and see that no harm came to the precious cup ! The translucent enamels on relief were made a great deal by the Italian goldsmiths ; Vasari alludes to this class of work as " a species of painting united with sculpture . " As enamel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paint , one of the chief charms of the art died . The limits of this art were its strength , and simple straightforward use of the material was its best expression . The method of making a painted enamel was as follows . The design was laid out with a stilus on a copper plate . Then a flux of plain enamel was fused on to the surface , all over it . The drawing was then made again , on the same lines , in a dark medium , and the colours were laid flat inside the dark lines , accepting these lines as if they had been wires around cloisons . All painted enamels had to be enamelled on the back as well , to // prevent warping in the furnace when the shrinkage took place . After each layer of colour the whole plate was fired . In the fifteenth century these enamels were popular and retained some semblance of respect for the limitation of material ; later , greater facility led , as it does in most of the arts , to a decadence in taste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shadows as would appear in an oil painting , resulted . Here and there , where special metallic brilliancy was desired , a leaf of gold was laid under the colour of some transparent enamel , giving a decorative lustre . These bits of brilliant metal were known as paillons . When Limoges had finally become the royal manufactory of enamels , under Francis I. , the head of the works was Leonard Limousin , created " Valet de Chambre du Roi , " to show his sovereign 's appreciation . Remarkable examples of the work of Leonard Limousin , executed in 1547 , are the large figures of the Apostles to be seen in the church of St. Pierre , at Chartres , where they are ranged about the apsidal chapel . They are painted enamels on copper sheets twenty-four by eleven inches , and are in a wonderful state of preservation . They were the gift of Henri II . to Diane de Poictiers and were brought to Chartres from the Chateau d'Anet . These enamels , being on a white ground , have something the effect of paintings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have occasional gold touches . A treatise by William of Essex directs the artist how to prepare a plate for a painted enamel , such as were 108 Arts and Crafts in the Middle Ages used in miniature work . He says " To make a plate for the artist to paint upon : a piece of gold or copper being chosen , of requisite dimensions , and varying from about to of an inch in thickness , is covered with pulverized enamel , and passed through the fire , until it becomes of a white heat ; another coating of enamel is then added , and the plate again fired ; afterwards a thin layer of a substance called flux is laid upon the surface of the enamel , and the plate undergoes the action of heat for a third time . It is now ready for the painter to commence his picture upon . " Leonard Limousin painted from 1532 until 1574 . He used the process as described by William of Essex ( which afterwards became very popular for miniaturists ) , and also composed veritable pictures of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to trace the history of the Limoges enamellers after this period . CHAPTER IV OTHER METALS THE " perils that environ men that meddle with cold iron " are many ; but those who attempt to control hot iron are also to be respected , when they achieve an artistic result with this unsympathetic metal , which by nature is entirely lacking in charm , in colour and texture , and depends more upon a proper application of design than any other , in order to overcome the obstacles to beauty with which it is beset . " Rust hath corrupted , " unfortunately , many interesting antiquities in iron , so that only a limited number of specimens of this metal have come down to us from very early times ; one of the earliest in England is a grave-stone of cast metal , of the date 1350 : it is decorated with a cross , and has the epitaph , " Pray for the soul of Joan Collins . " The process of casting iron was as follows . The moulds were made of a sandy substance , composed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and charcoal . A bed of this sand was made , and into it was pressed a wooden or metal pattern . When this was removed , the imprint remained in the sand . Liquid metal was 109 110 Arts and Crafts in the Middle Ages run into the mould so formed , and would cool into the desired shape . As with a plaster cast , it was necessary to employ two such beds , the sand being firmly held in boxes , if the object was to be rounded , and then the two halves thus made were put together . Flat objects , such as fire-backs , could be run into a single mould . Bartholomew , in his book " On the Properties of Things , " makes certain statements about iron which are interesting : " Though iron cometh of the earth , yet it is most hard and sad , and therefore with beating and smiting it suppresseth and dilateth all other metal , and maketh it stretch on length and on breadth . " This is the key-note to the work of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first , and is still doing . In Spain there have been iron mines ever since the days when Pliny wrote and alluded to them , but there are few samples in that country to lead us to regard it as aesthetic in its purpose until the fifteenth century . For tempering iron instruments , there are recipes given by the monk Theophilus , but they are unfortunately quite unquotable , being treated with mediaeval frankness of expression . St. Dunstan was the patron of goldsmiths and blacksmiths . He was born in 925 , and lived in Glastonbury , where he became a monk rather early in life . He not only worked in metal , but was a good musician and a great scholar , in fact a genuine rounded man of culture . He built an organ , no doubt something like the one which Theophilus describes , which , Bede tells us , r // being fitted with " brass pipes , filled with air from the bellows , uttered a grand and most sweet melody . " Dunstan was a favourite at court , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and they spread the report that Dunstan evoked demoniac aid in his almost magical work in its many departments . It was said that occasionally the evil spirits were too aggravating , and that in such cases Dunstan would stand no nonsense . There is an old verse : " St. Dunstan , so the story goes , Once pulled the devil by the nose , With red hot tongs , which made him roar That he was heard three miles or more ! " The same story is told of St. Eloi , and probably of most of the mediaeval artistic spirits who were unfortunate enough to be human in their temperaments and at the same time pious and struggling . He was greatly troubled by visitations such as persecuted St. Anthony . On one occasion , it is related that he was busy at his forge when this fiend was unusually persistent : St. Dunstan turned upon the demon , and grasped its nose in the hot pincers , which proved a most successful exorcism . In old portraits , St. Dunstan is represented in full ecclesiastical habit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He became Archbishop of Canterbury after having held the Sees of Worcester and London . He journeyed to Rome , and received the pallium of Primate of the Anglo-Saxons , from Pope John XII . Dunstan was a c 112 Arts and Crafts in the Middle Ages righteous statesman , twice reproving the king for evil deeds , and placing his Royal Highness under the ban of the Church for immoral conduct ! St. Dunstan died in 988 . Wrought iron has been in use for many centuries for hinges and other decorations on doors ; a necessity to every building in a town from earliest times . The word " hinge " comes from the Saxon , hengen , to hang . Primitive hinges were sometimes sockets cut in stone , as at Torcello ; but soon this was proved a clumsy and inconvenient method of hanging a door , and hinges more simple in one way , and yet more ornate , came into fashion . Iron hinges were found most useful when they extended for some distance on to the door ; this strengthened the door against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the natural citadel of refuge for the inhabitants of a town , and also held it firmly from warping . At first single straps of iron were clamped on : then the natural craving for beauty prevailed , and the hinges developed , flowering out into scrolls and leaves , and spreading all over the doors , as one sees them constantly in mediaeval examples . The general scheme usually followed was a straight strap of iron flanked by two curving horns like a crescent , and this motive was elaborated until a positive lace of iron , often engraved or moulded , covered the surface of the door , as in the wonderful work of Biscornette at Notre Dame in Paris . Biscornette was a very mysterious worker , and no one ever saw him constructing the hinges . Reports went round that the devil was helping him , that he had sold his soul to the King of Darkness in order to enlist his assistance in his work ; an instance of aesthetic altruism almost commendable in its exotic zeal . Certain jealous artificers even went so far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test it , but with no result ; they could not decide whether it was cast or wrought . Later a legend grew up explaining the reason why the central door was not as ornate as the side doors : the story was that the devil was unable to assist Biscornette on this door because it was the aperture through which the Host passed in processions . It is more likely , however , that the doors were originally uniform , and that the iron was subsequently removed for some other reason . 114 Arts and Crafts in the Middle Ages The design is supposed to represent the Earthly Paradise . Sauval says : " The sculptured birds and ornaments are marvellous . They are made of wrought iron , the invention of Biscornette and which died with him . He worked the iron with an almost incredible industry , rendering it flexible and tractable , and gave it all the forms and scrolls he wished , with a douceur et une gentillesse ' which surprised and astonished all the smiths . " The iron master Gaegart broke off fragments of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever been able to state with certainty just how the work was accomplished . Some think that it is cast , and then treated with the file ; others say that it must have been executed by casting entire , with no soldering . In any case , the secret will never be divulged , for no one was in the confidence of Biscornette . Norman blacksmiths and workers in wrought iron were more plentiful than goldsmiths . They had , in those warlike times , more call for arms and the massive products of the forge than for gaudy jewels and table appointments . One of the doors of St. Alban 's Abbey displays the skill of Norman smiths dealing with this stalwart form of ornament . Among special artists in iron whose names have survived is that of Jehan Tonquin , in 1388 . Earlier than that , a cutler , Thomas de Fieuvillier , is mentioned , as having flourished about 1330 . Elaborate iron work is rare in Germany ; the Germans always excelled rather in bronze than in the sterner // metal . At St. Ursula @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the design and idea are French , and not native . One may usually recognize a difference between French and English wrought iron , for the French is often in detached pieces , not an outgrowth of the actual hinge itself , and when this is found in England , it indicates French work . Ornaments in iron were sometimes cut out of fiat sheet metal , and then hammered into form . In stamping this flat work with embossed effect , the smith had to work while the iron was hot , ? as Sancho Panza expressed it , " Praying to God and hammering away . " Dies were made , after a time , into which the design could be beaten with less effort than in the original method . One of the quaintest of iron doors is at Krems , where the gate is made up of square sheets of iron , cut into rude pierced designs , giving scenes from the New Testament , and hammered up so as to be slightly embossed . The Guild of Blacksmiths in Florence flourished as early as the thirteenth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , . iron , brass , and pewter included . Among the rules of the Guild was one permitting members to work for ready money only . They were not allowed to advertise by street crying , and were fined if they did so . The Arms of the Guild was a pair of furnace tongs upon a white field . Among the products of the forge most in demand were the iron windowgratings so invariable on all houses , and called by 116 Arts and Crafts in the Middle Ages Michelangelo " kneeling windows , " on account of the bulging shape of the lower parts . One famous iron worker carried out the law of the Guild both in spirit and letter to the extent of insisting upon payment in advance ! This was Nicolo Grosso , who worked about 1499 . Vasari calls him the " money grabber . " His specialty was to make the beautiful torch holders and lanterns such as one sees on the Strozzi Palace and in the Bargello . In England there were Guilds of Blacksmiths ; in Middlesex one was started in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worship of St. Eloi . " Members were alluded to as " Brethren and Sisteren , " ? this term would fill a much felt vacancy ! Some of the Guilds exacted fines from all members who did not pay a proper proportion of their earnings to the Church . Another general use of iron for artistic purposes was in the manufacture of grilles . Grilles were used in France and England in cathedrals . The earliest Christian grille is a pierced bronze screen in the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem . In Hildesheim is an original form of grille ; the leaves and rosettes in the design are pierced , instead of being beaten up into bosses . This probably came from the fact that the German smith did not understand the Frankish drawing , and supposed that the shaded portions of the work were intended to be open work . The result , however , is most happy , and a new feature was thus introduced into grille work . // Many grilles were formed by the smith 's taking an iron bar and , under the intense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which should be twisted in a different way . Another method was to use the single slighter bar for the foundation of the design , and welding on other volutes of similar thickness to make the scroll work associated with wrought iron . Some of the smiths who worked at Westminster Abbey are known by name ; Master Henry Lewis , in 1259 , made the iron work for the tomb of Henry III . A certain iron fragment is signed Gilibertus . The iron on the tomb of Queen Eleanor is by Thomas de Leighton , in 1294 . Lead workers also had a place assigned to them in the precincts , which was known as " the Plumbery . " In 1431 Master Roger Johnson was enjoined to arrest or press smiths into service in order to finish the ironwork on the tomb of Edward IV . Probably the most famous use of iron in Spain is in the stupendous " rejas , " or chancel screens of wrought iron ; but these are nearly all of a late Renaissance style , and hardly come within the scope of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for wrought iron screens for all the side chapels , made plenty of work for the iron masters . In fact , the " rejeros , " or iron master , was as regular an adjunct to a cathedral as an architect or a painter . Knockers were often very handsome in Spain , and even nail heads were decorated . An interesting specimen of iron work is the grille that surrounds the tomb of the Scaligers in Verona . It is 118 Arts and Crafts in the Middle Ages not a hard stiff structure , but is composed of circular forms , each made separately , and linked together with narrow bands , so that the construction is flexible , and is more like a gigantic piece of chain mail than an iron fence . Quentin Matsys was known as the " blacksmith of Antwerp , " and is reported to have left his original work among metals to become a painter . This was done in order to marry the lady of his choice , for she refused to join her fate to that of a craftsman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Quentin , therefore , gave up his hammer and anvil , and began to paint Madonnas that he might prosper in his suit . Some authorities , however , laugh at this story , and claim that the specimens of iron work which are shown as the early works of Matsys date from a time when he would have been only ten or twelve years old , and that they must therefore have been the work of his father , Josse Matsys , who was a locksmith . The well-cover in Antwerp , near the cathedral , is always known as Quentin Matsys ' well . It is said that this was not constructed until 1470 , while Quentin was born in 1466 . The iron work of the tomb of the Duke of Burgundy , in Windsor , is supposed to be the work of Quentin Matsys , and is considered the finest grille in England . It is wrought with such skill and delicacy that it is more like the product of the goldsmith 's art than that of the blacksmith . Another object of utility which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handles having the appearance of Gothic tracery . In an old book published in 1795 , there is an account of the miraculous Keys of St. Denis , made of silver , which " they apply to the faces of these persons who have been so unfortunate as to be bitten by mad dogs , and who received certain and immediate relief in only touching them . " A key in Valencia , over nine inches in length , is richly embossed , while the wards are composed of decorative letters , looking at first like an elaborate sort of filigree , but finally resolving themselves into the autographic statement : " It was made by Ahmed Ahsan . " It is a delicate piece of thirteenth or fourteenth century work in iron . Another old Spanish key has a Hebrew inscription round the handle : " The King of Kings will open : the King of the whole Earth will enter , " and , in the wards , in Spanish , " God will open , the King will enter . " The iron smiths of Barcelona formed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regretted that more of their work could not have descended to us . A frank treatment of locks and bolts , using them as decorations , instead of treating them as disgraces , upon the surface of a door , is the only way to make them in any degree effective . As Pugin has said , it is possible to use nails , screws , and rivets , so that they become " beautiful studs and busy enrichments . " Florentine locksmiths were specially famous ; there also was a great fashion for damascened work in that city , and it was executed with much elegance . // In blacksmith 's work , heat was used with the hammer at each stage of the work , while in armourer 's or locksmith 's work , heat was employed only at first , to achieve the primitive forms , and then the work was carried on with chisel and file on the cold metal . Up to the fourteenth century the work was principally that of the blacksmith , and after that , of the locksmith . The mention of arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very slight ; the subject is a vast one , and no effort to treat it with system would be satisfactory in so small a space . But a few curious and significant facts relating to the making of armour may be cited . The rapid decay of iron through rust ? rapid , that is to say , in comparison with other metals ? is often found to have taken place when the discovery of old armour has been made ; so that gold ornaments , belonging to a sword or other weapon , may be found in excavating , while the iron which formed the actual weapon has disappeared . Primitive armour was based on a leather foundation , hence the name cuirass , was derived from cuir ( leather ) . In a former book I have alluded to the armour of the nomadic tribes , which is described by Pausanias as coarse coats of mail made out of the hoofs of horses , split , and laid overlapping each other , making them " something like dragon 's scales , " as Pausanias explains ; adding for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anatomy , " Whoever has not yet seen a dragon , 122 Arts and Crafts in the Middle Ages has , at any rate , seen a pine cone still green . These are equally like in appearance to the surface of this armour . " These horny scales of tough hoofs undoubtedly suggested , at a later date , the use of thick leather as a form of protection , and the gradual evolution may be imagined . The art of the armourer was in early mediaeval times the art of the chain maker . The chain coat , or coats of mail , reached in early days as far as the knees . Finally this developed into an entire covering for the man , with head gear as well ; of course this form of armour allowed of no real ornamentation , for there was no space larger than the links of the chain upon which to bestow decoration . Each link of a coat of mail was brought round into a ring , the ends overlapped , and a little rivet inserted . Warriors trusted to no solder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knightly apparel was concentrated in the surcoat , a splendid embroidered or gem-decked tunic to the knees , which was worn over the coat of mail . These surcoats were often trimmed with costly furs , ermine or vain , the latter being similar to what we now call squirrel , being part gray and part white . Cinderella 's famous slipper was made of " vair , " which , through a misapprehension in being translated " verre , " has become known as a glass slipper . After a bit , the makers of armour discovered that much tedious labor in chain making might be spared , if one introduced a large plate of solid metal on the chest and back . This was in the thirteenth century . 124 Arts and Crafts in the Middle Ages The elbows and knees were also treated in this way , and in the fourteenth century , the principle of armour had changed to a set of separate plates fastened together by links . This was the evolution from mail to plate armour . A description of Charlemagne as he appeared on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given by the Monk of St. Gall , his biographer , and is dramatic . " Then could be seen the iron Charles , helmeted with an iron helmet , his iron breast and broad shoulders protected with an iron breast plate ; an iron spear was raised on high in his left hand , his right always rested on his unconquered iron falchion . . . . His shield was all of iron , his charger was iron coloured and iron hearted . .. . The fields and open spaces were filled with iron ; a people harder than iron paid universal homage to the hardness of iron . The horror of the dungeon seemed less than the bright gleam of iron . Oh , the iron ! woe for the iron ! ' was the confused cry that rose from the citizens . The strong walls shook at the sight of iron : the resolution of young and old fell before the iron . " By the end of the fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries , whole suits of armour were almost invariable , and then came the opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some of the leading artists , especially in Italy , were enlisted in designing and decorating what might be called the armour-de-luxe of the warrior princes ! The armour of horses was as ornate as that of the riders . The sword was always the most imposingly ornaOther // mented part of a knight 's equipment , and underwent various modifications which are interesting to note . At first , it was the only weapon invariably at hand : it was enormously large , and two hands were necessary in wielding it . As the arquebusc came into use , the sword took a secondary position : it became lighter and smaller . And ever since 1510 it is a curious fact that the decorations of swords have been designed to be examined when the sword hangs with the point down ; the earlier ornament was adapted to being seen at its best when the sword was held upright , as in action . Perhaps the later theory of decoration is more sensible , for it is certain that neither a warrior nor his opponent could have occasion to admire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! That the arts should be employed to satisfy the eye in times of peace , sufficed the later wearers of ornamented swords . Toledo blades have always been famous , and rank first among the steel knives of the world . Even in Roman times , and of course under the Moors , Toledo led in this department . The process of making a Toledo blade was as follows . There was a special fine white sand on the banks of the Tagus , which was used to sprinkle on the blade when it was red hot , before it was sent on to the forger 's . When the blade was red hot from being steeped four-fifths of its length in flame , it was dropped point first into a bucket of water . If it was not perfectly straight when it was withdrawn , it was beaten into shape , more sand being first put upon it . 126 Arts and Crafts in the Middle Ages DAMASCENED HELMET After this the remaining fifth of the blade was subjected to the fire , and was rubbed with suet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sword was produced by emery powder on wooden wheels . Damascening was a favourite method of ornamenting choice suits of armour , and was also applied to bronzes , cabinets , and such pieces of metal as lent themselves to decoration . The process began like niello : little // channels for the design were hollowed out , in the iron or bronze , and then a wire of brass , silver , or gold , was laid in the groove , and beaten into place , being afterwards polished until the surface was uniform all over . One great feature of the art was to sink the incision a little broader at , the base than at the top , and then to force the softer metal in , so that , by this undercutting , it was held firmly in place . Cellini tells of his first view of damascened steel blades . " I chanced , " he says , " to become possessed of certain little Turkish daggers , the handle of which together with the guard and blade were ornamented with beautiful Oriental leaves , engraved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of work differed materially from anti which I had as yet practised or attempted , nevertheless I was seized with a great desire to try my hand at it , and I succeeded so admirably that I produced articles infinitely finer and more solid than those of the Turks . " Benvenuto had such a humble opinion of his own powers ! But when one considers the pains and labour expended upon the arts of damascening and niello , one regrets that the workers had not been inspired to attempt dentistry , and save so much unnecessary individual suffering ! On the Sword of Boabdil are many inscriptions , among then , " God is clement and merciful , " and " God is gifted with the best memory . " No two sentiments could be better calculated to keep a conqueror from undue excesses . Mercia was a headquarters for steel and other metals 128 Arts and Crafts in the Middle Ages in the thirteenth century . Seville was even then famous for its steel , also , and in the words of a contemporary writer , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would take too much time to enumerate the delicate objects of every kind which are made in this town . " King Don Pedro , in his will , in the fourteenth century , bequeathes to his son , his " Castilian sword , which I had made here in Seville , ornamented with stones and gold . " Swords were baptized ; they were named , and seemed to have a veritable personality of their own . The sword of Charlemagne was christened " Joyeuse , " while we all know of Arthur 's Excalibur ; Roland 's sword was called Durandel . Saragossa steel was esteemed for helmets , and the sword of James of Arragon in 1230 , " a very good sword , and lucky to those who handled it , " was from Monzon . The Cid 's sword was similar , and named Tizona . There is a story of a Jew who went to the grave of the Cid to steal his sword , which , according to custom , was interred with the owner : the corpse is said to have resented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amazed the Jew that he turned Christian ! // German armour was popular . Cologne swords were great favourites in England . King Arthur 's sword was one of these , ? " For all of Coleyne was the blade And all the hilt of precious stone . " In the British Museum is a wonderful example of a wooden shield , painted on a gesso ground , the subject being a Knight kneeling before a lady , and the motto : " Vous ou la mort . " These wooden shields were used in Germany until the end of Maximilian 's reign . The helmet , or Heaume , entirely concealed the face , so that for purposes of identification , heraldic badges and shields were displayed . Later , crests were also used on the helmets , for the same purpose . Certain armourers were very well known in their day , and were as famous as artists in other branches . William Austin made a superb suit for the Earl of Warwick , while Thomas Stevyns was the coppersmith who worked on the same , and Bartholomew Lambspring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greenwich in the days of Elizabeth , named Jacob : some important arms of that period bear the inscription , " Made by me Jacob . " There is some question whether lie was the same man as Jacob Topf who came from Innsbruck , and became court armourer in England n 1575 . Another famous smith was William Pickering , who made exquisitely ornate suits of what we might call full-dress armour. 130 Arts and Crafts in the Middle Ages Colossal cannon were made : two celebrated guns may be seen , the monster at Ghent , called Mad Meg. and the huge cannon at Edinburgh Castle , Mons Meg , dating from 1476 . These guns are composed of steel coils or spirals , afterwards welded into a solid mass instead of being cast . They are mammoth examples of the art of the blacksmith and the forge . In Germany cannon were made of bronze , and these were simply cast . Cross bows obtained great favour in Spain , even after the arquebuse had come into use . It was considered a safer weapon to the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " It has never been known that a man 's life has been lost by breaking the string or cord , two things which are dangerous , but not to a considerable extent , " . . . and he goes on " once set , its shot is secure , which is not the case with the arquebus , which often misses fire . " There is a letter from Ambassador Salimas to the King of Hungary , in which he says : " I went to Balbastro and there occupied myself in making a pair of cross bows for your Majesty . I believe they will satisfy the desires which were required . . . as your Majesty is annoyed when they do not go off as you wish . " It would seem as though his Majesty 's " annoyance " was justifiable ; imagine any one dependent upon the shot of a cross bow , and then having the weapon fail to " go off ! " Nothing could be more discouraging . There is a contemporary treatise which is full of inOther // terest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his ease when he shall Fight on Foot . " It certainly was a good deal of a contract to render a knight comfortable in spite of the fact that he could see or breathe only imperfectly , and was weighted down by iron at every point . This complete covering with metal added much to the actual noise of battle . Froissart alludes to the fact that in the battle of Rosebeque , in 1382 , the hammering on the helmets made a noise which was equal to that of all the armourers of Paris and Brussels working together . And yet the strength needed to sport such accoutrements seems to have been supplied . Leon Alberti of Florence , when clad in a full suit of armour , could spring with ease upon a galloping horse , and it is related that Aldobrandini , even with his right arm disabled , could cleave straight through his opponent 's helmet and head , down to the collar bone , with a single stroke ! One of the richest suits of armour in the world is to be seen at Windsor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of steel , blued and gilded , with wonderfully minute decorations of damascene and applique work . This most ornate armour was made chiefly for show , and not for the field : for knights to appear in their official capacity , and for jousting at tournaments , which were practically social events . In the days of Henry VIII . a chronicler tells of a jouster who " tourneyed in harneyse all of gilt from the head piece to the sabattons . " Many had " tassels of fine gold " on their suits . 132 Arts and Crafts in the Middle Ages Italian weapons called " lasquenets " were very deadly . In a letter from Albrecht Darer to Pirckheimer , he alludes to them , as having " roncions with two hundred and eighteen points : and if they pink a man with any of these , the man is dead , as they are all poisoned . " Bronze is composed of copper with an alloy of about eight or ten per cent . of tin . The fusing of these two metals produces the brown glossy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them . The art of the bronze caster is a very old and interesting one . The method of proceeding has varied very little with the centuries . A statue to be cast either in silver or bronze would be treated in the following manner . A general semblance of the finished work was first set up in clay ; then over this a layer of wax was laid , as thick as the final bronze was intended to be . The wax was then worked with tools and by hand until it took on the exact form designed for the finished product . Then a crust of clay was laid over the wax ; on this were added other coatings of clay , until quite a thick shell of clay surrounded the wax . The whole was then subjected to fervent heat , and the wax all melted out , leaving a space between the core and the outer shell . Into this space the liquid bronze was poured , and after it had cooled and hardened the outer shell was broken off , leaving the statue in bronze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience in Paris , with an old man // eighty years of age , one of the most famous bronze casters whom he had engaged to assist him in his work for Francis I. Something went wrong with the furnace , and the poor old man was so upset and " got into such a stew " that he fell upon the floor , and Benvenuto picked him up fancying him to be dead : " Howbeit , " explains Cellini , " I had a great beaker of the choicest wine brought him , . . . I mixed a large bumper of wine for the old man , who was groaning away like anything , and I bade him most winning-wise to drink , and said : Drink , my father , for in yonder furnace has entered in a devil , who is making all this mischief , and , look you , we 'll just let him bide there a couple of days , till he gets jolly well bored , and then will you and I together in the space of three hours firing , make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without any exertion at all . ' The old fellow drank and then I brought him some little dainties to eat : meat pasties they were , nicely peppered , and I made him take down four full goblets of wine . He was a man quite out of the ordinary , this , and a most lovable old thing , and what with my caresses and the virtue of the wine , I found him soon moaning away as much with joy as he had moaned before with grief . " Cellini displayed in this incident his belief in the great principle that the artist should find pleasure in his work in order to impart to that work a really satisfactory quality , and did exactly the right thing at the right minute ; instead of trusting to a faltering effort in a disheartened man , he cheered the old bronze founder 134 Arts and Crafts in the Middle Ages up to such a pitch that after a day or two the work was completed with triumph and joy to both . In the famous statue of Perseus , Cellini @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account of this thrilling experience , told in his matchless autobiography , is too long to quote at this point ; an interesting item , however , should be noted . Cellini used pewter as a solvent in the bronze which had hardened in the furnace . " Apprehending that the cause of it was , that the fusibility of the metal was impaired , by the violence of the fire , " he says , " I ordered all my dishes and porringers , whichwere in number about two hundred , to be placed one by one before my tubes , and part of them to be thrown into the furnace , upon which all present perceived that my bronze was completely dissolved , and that my mould was filling , " and , such was the relief that even the loss of the entire pewter service of the family was sustained with equanimity ; the family , " without delay , procured earthen vessels to supply the place of the pewter dishes and porringers , and we all dined together very cheerfully . " Edgecumb Staley , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pewter fattened Perseus : " this is worthy of Carlyle . Early Britons cast statues in brass . Speed tells of King Cadwollo , who died in 677 , being buried " at St. Martin 's church near Ludgate , his image great and terrible , triumphantly riding on horseback , artificially cast in brass , was placed on the Western gate of the city , to the further fear and terror of the Saxons ! " // In 1562 Bartolomeo Morel , who made the celebrated statue of the Giralda Tower in Seville , executed a fifteen branched candelabrum for the Cathedral . It is a rich Renaissance design , in remarkably chaste and good lines , and holds fifteen statuettes , which are displaced to make room for the candles only during the last few days of Lent . A curious form of mediaeval trinket was the perfume ball ; this consisted of a perforated ball of copper or brass , often ornamented with damascene , and intended to contain incense to perfume the air , the balls being suspended . The earliest metal statuary in England was rendered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the exact recipe for which has not survived . The recumbent effigies of Henry III . and Queen Eleanor are made of latten , and the tomb of the Black Prince in Canterbury is the same , beautifully chased . Many of these and other tombs were probably originally covered with gilding , painting , and enamel . The effigies of Richard II . and his queen , Anne of Bohemia , were made during the reign of the monarch ; a contemporary document states that " Sir John Innocent paid another part of a certain indenture made between the King and Nicolas Broker and Geoffrey Prest , coppersmiths of London , for the making of two images , likenesses of the King and Queen , of copper and latten , gilded upon the said marble tomb . " There are many examples of bronze gates in ecclesi136 Arts and Crafts in the Middle Ages astical architecture . The gates of St. Paolo Fuori le Mura in Rome were made in 1070 , in Constantinople , by Stauracius the Founder . Many authorities think that those at St. Mark 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rome are composed of fifty-four small designs , not in relief , but with the outlines of the subjects inlaid with silver . The doors are in Byzantine taste . The bronze doors at Hildesheim differ from nearly all other such portals , in the elemental principle of design . Instead of being divided into small panels , they are simply blocked off into seven long horizontal compartments on each side , and then filled with a pictorial arrangement of separate figures ; only three or four in each panel , widely spaced , and on a background of very low relief . The figures are applied , at scattered distances apart , and are in unusually high modelling , in some cases being almost detached from the door . The effect is curious and interesting rather than strictly beautiful , on the whole ; but in detail many of the figures display rare power of plastic skill , proportion , and action . They are , at any rate , very individual : there are no other doors at all like them . They are the work of Bishop Bernward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any age is the pair of gates by Lorenzo Ghiberti on the Baptistery in Florence . Twenty-one years were devoted to their making , by Ghiberti and his assistants , with the stipulation that all figures in the design were to be personal work of the master , the // assistants only attending to secondary details . The doors were in place in April , 1424 . The competition for the Baptistery doors reads like n romance , and is familiar to most people who know anything of historic art . When the young Ghiberti heard that the competition was open to all , he determined to go to Florence and work for the prize ; in 138 Arts and Crafts in the Middle Ages his own words : " When my friends wrote to me that the governors of the Baptistery were sending for masters whose skill in bronze working they wished to prove , and that from all Italian lands many maestri were coming , to place themselves in this strife of talent , I could no longer forbear , and asked leave of Sig . Malatesta , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competition is // also given in Ghiberti 's words : " The palm of victory was conceded to me by all judges , and by those who competed with me . Universally all the glory was given to me without any exception . " Symonds considers the first gate a supreme accomplishment in bronze casting , but criticizes the other , and usually more admired gate , as " overstepping the limits that separate sculpture from painting , " by " massing together figures in multitudes at three and sometimes four distances . He tried to make a place in bas-relief for perspective . " Sir Joshua Reynolds finds fault with Ghiberti , also , for working at variance with the severity of sculptural treatment , by distributing small figures in a spacious landscape framework . It was not really in accordance with the limitations of his material to treat a bronze casting as Ghiberti treated it , and his example has led many men of inferior genius astray , although there is no use in denying that Ghiberti himself was clever enough to defy the usual standards and rules . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a one at Liege cast by Lambert Patras , which stands upon twelve oxen . It is decorated with reliefs from the Gospels . This artist , Patras , was a native of Dinant , and lived in the twelfth century . The bronze font in Hildesheim is among the most interesting late Romanesque examples in Germany . It is a large deep basin entirely covered with enrichment of Scriptural scenes , and is supported by four kneeling figures , typical of the 140 Arts and Crafts in the Middle Ages four Rivers of Paradise . The conical cover is also m - ered with Scriptural scenes , and surmounted 1 , foliate knob . Among the figures with which the font , is covered are the Cardinal Virtues , flanked by their r patron saints . Didron considers this a most important piece of bronze from an iconographic point of view theologically and poetically . The archaic qualities of the figures are fascinating and sometimes diverting . In the scene of the Baptism of Christ the water is positively trained to flow upwards in pyramidal form , in order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it recedes to the ground level again , ? it has an ingenuous and almost startling suddenness in the rising of its flood ! An interesting comment upon the prevalence of early national forms may be deduced , when one observes that on the table , at the Last Supper , there lies a perfectly shaped pretzel ! The great bronze column constructed by St. Bernward at Hildesheim has the Life of Christ represented in consecutive scenes in a spiral form , like those ornamenting the column of Trajan . Down by Bernward 's grave there is a spring which is said to cure cripples and rheumatics . Peasants visit Hildesheim on saints ' days in order to drink of it , and frequently , after one of these visitations , crutches are found abandoned near by . Saxony was famous for its bronze founders , and work was sent forth , from this country , in the twelfth century , all over Europe . Orcagna 's tabernacle at Or San Michele is , as Symonds // has expressed it , " a monumental jewel , " and " an epitome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it one sees bas-relief carving , intaglios , statuettes , mosaic , the lapidary 's art in agate ; enamels , and gilded glass , and yet all in good taste and harmony . The sculpture is properly subordinated to the architectonic principle , and one can understand how it is not only the work of a goldsmith , but of a painter . Of all bronze workers , perhaps Peter Vischer is the best known and is certainly one of the best deserving of his wide fame . Peter Vischer was born about the same time as Quentin Matsys , between 1460 and 1470 . He was the most important metal worker in Germany . He and Adam Kraft , of whom mention will be made when we come to deal with sculptural carving , were brought up together as boys , and " when older boys , went with one another on all holidays , acting still as though they were apprentices together . " Vischer 's normal expression was in Gothic form . His first design for the wonderful shrine of St. Sebald in Nuremberg was made by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is a pure late-Gothic canopy , and I can not help regretting that the execution was delayed until popular taste demanded more concession towards the Renaissance , and it was resolved in 1507 , " to have the Shrine of St. Sehald made of brass . " Therefore , although the general lines continue to hold a Gothic semblance , the shrine has many Renaissance features . Regret , however , is almost morbid , in relation 142 Arts and Crafts in the Middle Ages to such a perfect work of art . Italian feeling is evident throughout , and the wealth of detail in figures and foliate forms is magnificent . The centre of interest is the little portrait statuette of Peter Vischer himself , according to his biographer , " as he looked , and as he daily went about and worked in the foundry . " Though Peter had not been to Italy himself , his son Hermann had visited the historic land , and had brought home " artistic things that he sketched and drew , which delighted his old father , and were of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three sons , who all followed him in the craft . His workshop must have been an ideal institution in its line . Some remnants of Gothic grotesque fancy are to be seen on the shrine , although treated outwardly with Renaissance feeling . A realistic life-sized mouse may be seen in one place , just as if it had run out to inspect the work ; and the numbers of little tipsy " putti " who disport themselves in all attitudes , in perilous positions on narrow ledges , are full of merry humour . The metal of St. Sebald 's shrine is left as it came from the casting , and owes much of its charm to the lack of filing , polishing , and pointing usual in such monuments . The molten living expression is retained . Only the details and spirit of the figures are Renaissance ; the Gothic plan is hardly disturbed , and the whole monurnent is pleasing in proportion . The figures are exquisite , especially that of St. Peter . A great Renaissance work in Germany was the grille // of the Rathaus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was of bronze , the symmetrical diapered form of the open work part being supported by chaste and dignified columns of the Corinthian order . It was first designed by Peter Vischer the Elder , and revised and changed by the whole family after Hermann 's return from Rome with his Renaissance notions . It was sold in 1806 to a merchant for old metal ; later it was traced to the south of France , where it disappeared . Another famous bronze of Nuremberg is the wellknown " Goose Man " fountain , by Labenwolf . Every traveller has seen the quaint half-foolish little man , as he stands there holding his two geese who politely turn away their heads in order to produce the streams of water ! With the best bronzes , and with steel used for decorative purposes , the original casting has frequently been only for general form , the whole of the surface finishing being done with a shaping tool , by hand , giving the appearance of a carving in bronze or steel . In Japanese bronzes this is particularly felt . The classical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metal . Pliny tells of a bronze figure of a dying woman , who was represented as having changed colour at the extremities , the fusion of the different shades of bronze being disguised by anklets , bracelets , and a necklace ! A curious and very disagreeable work of art , we should say . One sometimes sees in antique fragments ivory or sil ver eyeballs , and hair and eyelashes made separately 144 Arts and Crafts in the Middle Ages in thin strips and coils of metal ; while occasionally the depression of the edge of the lips is sufficient to give rise to the opinion that a thin veneer of copper was applied to give colour . The bronze effigies of Henry M. and Eleanor , at Westminster , were the work of a goldsmith , Master William Torel , and are therefore finer in quality and are in some respects superior to the average casting in bronze . Torel worked at the palace , and the statues were cast in " cire perdue " process , being executed in the churchyard itself . They are considered among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enamel were often used in bronze effigies . Splendid bronzes , cast each in a single flow , are the recumbent figures of two bishops at Amiens ; they are of the thirteenth century . Ruskin says : " They are the only two bronze tombs of her men of the great ages left in France . " An old document speaks of the " moulds and imagines " which were in use for casting effigy portraits , in 1394 . Another good English bronze is that of Richard Beauchamp at Warwick , the work of Thomas Stevens , which has been alluded to . In Westminster Abbey , the effigy of Aymer de Valence , dating from 1296 , is of copper , but it is not cast ; it is of beaten metal , and is enamelled , probably at Limoges . Bells and cannon are among the objects of actual utility which were cast in bronze . Statues as a rule came later . In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries // in England , bronze was used to such an extent , that one authority suggested that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Primitive bells were made of cast iron riveted together : one of these is at the Cologne museum , and the Irish bells were largely of this description . A great bell was presented to the Cathedral of Chartres in 1028 , by a donor named Jean , which affords little clue to his personality . This bell weighed over two tons . There is considerable interest attaching to the subject of the making of bells in the Middle Ages . Even in domestic life bells played quite a part ; it was the custom to ring a bell when the bath was ready and to announce meals , as well as to summon the servitors . Church bells , both large and small , were in use in England by 670 , according to Bede . They were also carried by missionaries ; those good saints , Patrick and Cuthbert , announced their coming like town criers ! The shrine of St. Patrick 's bell has been already described . Bells used to be regarded with a superstitious awe , and were supposed to have the ability to dispel evil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and candle . " The bell of St. Patrick , inside the great shrine , is composed of two pieces of sheet iron , one of which forms the face , and being turned over the top , descends about half-way down the other side , where it meets the second sheet . Both are bent along the edges so as to form the sides of the bell , and they are both secured by rivets . A rude handle is similarly attached to the top . A quaint account is given by the Monk of St. Gall 146 Arts and Crafts in the Middle Ages about a bell ordered by Charlemagne . Charlemagne having admired the tone of a certain bell , the founder , named Tancho , said to him : " Lord Emperor , give orders that a great weight of copper be brought to me that I may refine it , and instead of tin give me as much silver as I need , ? a hundred pounds at least , ? and I will cast such a bell for you that this will seem dumb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of silver to be sent to the founder , who was , however , a great knave . He did not use the silver at all , but , laying it aside for his own use , he employed tin as usual in the bell , knowing that it would make a very fair tone , and counting on the Emperor 's not observing the difference . The Emperor was glad when it was ready to be heard , and ordered it to be hung , and the clapper attached . " That was soon done , " says the chronicler , " and then the warden of the church , the attendants , and even the boys of the place , tried , one after the other , to make the bell sound . But all was in vain ; and so at last the knavish maker of the bell came up , seized the rope , and pulled at the bell . When , lo ! and behold ! down from on high came the brazen mass ; fell on the very head of the cheating brass founder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through his carcass and crashed to the ground . . . . When the aforementioned weight of silver was found , Charles ordered it to be distributed among the poorest servants of the palace . " There is record of bronze bells in Valencia as early as 622 , and an ancient mortar was found near Monzon. , // in the ruins of a castle which had formerly belonged to the Arabs . Round the edge of this mortar was the inscription : " Complete blessing , and ever increasing happiness and prosperity of every kind and an elevated and happy social position for its owner . " The mortar was richly ornamented . At Croyland , Abbot Egebric " caused to be made two great bells which he named Bartholomew and Bethelmus , two of middle size , called Turketul and Tatwyn , and two lesser , Pega and Bega . " Also at Croyland were placed " two little bells which Fergus the brass worker of St. Botolph 's had lately given , " in the church tower , " until better times , " when the monks expressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appointments . Oil that dropped from the framework on which church bells were hung was regarded in Florence as a panacea for various ailments . People who suffered from certain complaints were rubbed with this oil , and fully believed that it helped them . The curfew bell was a famous institution ; but the name was not originally applied to the bell itself . This leads to another curious bit of domestic metal . The popular idea of a curfew is that of a bell ; a bell was undoubtedly rung at the curfew hour , and was called by its name ; but the actual curfew ( or couvre feu ) was an article made of copper , shaped not unlike a deep " blower , " which was used in order to extinguish the fire when the bell rang . There are a few specimens in 148 Arts and Crafts in the Middle Ages England of these curious covers : they stood about ten to fifteen inches high , with a handle at the top , and closed in on three sides , open at the back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearth , and the curfew , with the open side against the back of the chimney , was placed over them , thus excluding all air . Horace Walpole owned , at Strawberry Hill , a famous old curfew , in copper , elaborately decorated with vines and the York rose . The Sanctuary knocker at Durham Cathedral is an important example of bronze work , probably of the // same age as the Cathedral door on which it is fastened . They both date from about the eleventh century . Ever since 740 , in the Episcopate of Cynewulf , criminals were allowed to claim Sanctuary in Durham . When this knocker was sounded , the door was opened , by two porters who had their accommodations always in two little chambers over the door , and for a certain length of time the criminal was under the protection of the Church . In speaking of the properties of lead , the old English Bartholomew says : " Of uncleanness of impure brimstone , lead hath a manner of neshness , and smircheth his hand who toucheth it . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always it is lead , although it seemeth silver . " Weather vanes , made often of lead , were sometimes quite elaborate . One of the most important pieces of lead work in art is the figure of an angel on the chewet of Ste. Chapelle in Paris . Originally this figure was intended to be so controlled by clockwork that it would turn around once in the course of the twenty-four hours , so that his attitude of benediction should be directed to all four quarters of the city ; but this was not practicable , and the angel is stationary . The cock on the weather vane at Winchester was described as early as the tenth century , in the Life of St. Swithin , by the scribe Walstan . He calls it " a cock of elegant form , and all resplendent and shining with gold who occupies the summit of the tower . He regards the world from on high , he commands all the country . Before him 150 Arts and Crafts in the Middle Ages extend the stars of the North , and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he holds the sceptre of the law , and he sees under him all the people of Winchester . The other cocks are humble subjects of this one , whom they see thus raised in mid-air above them : he scorns the winds , that bring the rains , and , turning , he presents to them his back . The terrible efforts of the tempest do not annoy him , he receives with courage either snow or lightning , alone he watches the sun as it sets and dips into the ocean : and it is he who gives it its first salute on its rising again . The traveller who sees him afar off , fixes on him his gaze ; forgetting the road he has still to follow , he forgets his fatigues : he advances with renewed ardour . While he is in reality a long way from the end , his eyes deceive him , and he thinks that he has arrived . " Quite a practical tribute to a weather cock ! The fact that leaden roofs were placed on all churches and monastic buildings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utter destruction in case of fire ; for it is easy to see how impossible it would be to enter a building in order to save anything , if , to the terror of flames , were added the horror of a leaden shower of molten metal proceeding from every part of the roof at once ! If a church once caught fire , that was its end , as a rule . The invention of clocks , on the principle of cog-wheels and weights , is attributed to a monk , named Gerbert , who died in 1013 . He had been instructor to King Robert , and was made Bishop of Rheims , later becoming // Pope Sylvester II . Clocks at first were large affairs in public places . Portable clocks were said to have been first made by Carovage , in 1480 . An interesting specimen of medieval clock work is the old Dijon time keeper , which still performs its office , and which is a privilege to watch at high noon . Twelve times the bell is struck : first by a man , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman , who does the same . This staunch couple have worked 152 Arts and Crafts in the Middle Ages for their living for many centuries . Froissart alludes to this clock , saying : " The Duke of Burgundy caused to be carried away from the market place at Courtray a clock that struck the hours , one of the finest which could be found on either side of the sea : and he conveyed it by pieces in carts , and the bell also , which clock was brought and carted into the town of Dijon , in Burgundy , where it was deposited and put up , and there strikes the twenty-four hours between day and night . " This was in 1382 , and there is no knowing how long the clock may have performed its functions in Courtray prior to its removal to Dijon . The great clock at Nuremberg shows a procession of the Seven Electors , who come out of one door , pass in front of the throne , each turning and doing obeisance , and pass on through another door . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ procession repeated twelve times . The clock is called the Mannleinlauffen . In the Statutes of Francis I. , there is a clause stating that clockmakers as well as goldsmiths were authorized to employ in their work gold , silver , and all other materials . In Wells Cathedral is a curious clock , on which is a figure of a monarch , like Charles I. , seated above the bell , which he kicks with his heels when the hour comes round . He is popularly known as " Jack Blandiver . " This clock came originally from Glastonbury . On the hour a little tournament takes place , a race of little mounted knights rushing out in circles and charging each other vigorously . // Pugin regrets the meaningless designs used by early Victorian clock makers . He calls attention to the fact that " it is not unusual to cast a Roman warrior in a flying chariot , round one of the wheels of which on close inspection the hours may be descried ; or the whole front of a cathedral church reduced to a few inches in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a magnificent rose window ! " This is not overdrawn ; taste has suffered many vicissitudes in the course of time , but we hope that the future will hold more beauty for us in the familiar articles of the household than have prevailed at some periods in the past . CHAPTER V TAPESTRY A STUDY of textiles is often subdivided into tapestry , carpet-weaving , mechanical weaving of fabrics of a lighter weight , and embroidery . These headings are useful to observe in our researches in the mediaeval processes connected with the loom and the needle . Tapestry , as we popularly think of it , in great rectangular wall-hangings with rather florid figures from Scriptural scenes , commonly dates from the sixteenth century or later , so that it is out of our scope to study its manufacture on an extensive scale . But there are earlier tapestries , much more restrained in design , and more interesting and frequently more beautiful . Of these earlier works there is less profusion , for the examples are rare and precious , and seldom come into the market nowadays . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technical facilities increased . But a study of the craft as it began gives one all that is necessary for a proper appreciation of the art of tapestry weaving . The earliest European work with which we have to concern ourselves is the Bayeux tapestry . Although this is really needlework , it is usually treated as tapestry , 154 // and there seems by the Empress Matilda , daughter of Henry I. , while others consider it the achievement of Queen Matilda , the wife of William the Conqueror . She is recorded to have sat quietly awaiting her lord 's coming while she embroidered this quaint souvenir of his prowess in conquest . A veritable mediaeval Penelope , it is claimed that she directed her ladies in this work , which is thoroughly Saxon in feeling and costuming . It is undoubtedly the most interesting remaining piece of needlework of the eleventh century , and it would be delightful if one could believe the legend of its construction . Its attribution to Queen Matilda is very generally doubted by those who have devoted much thought to the subject . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based on a number of arguments too long to quote in this place , that the tapestry was not made by Queen Matilda , but was ordered by Bishop Odo as an ornament for the nave of Bayeux Cathedral , and was executed by Norman craftsmen in that city . Dr. Rock also favours the theory that it was worked by order of Bishop Odo . Odo was a brother of William the Conqueror and might easily have been interested in preserving so important a record of the Battle of Hastings . Dr. Rock states that the tradition that Queen Matilda executed the tapestry did not arise at all until 1730 . The work is on linen , executed in worsteds . Fowke gives the length as two hundred and thirty feet , while L58 Arts and Crafts in the Middle Ages Soon after the Crowning of Harold , may be seen a crowd of people gazing at an astronomic phenomenon which has been described by an old chronicler as a " hairy star . " It is recorded as " a blazing starre " such as " never appears but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as " dreadful to be seen , with bloudie haires , and all over rough and shagged at the top . " Another author complacently explains that comets " were made to the end that the ethereal regions might not be more void of monsters than the ocean is of whales and other great thieving fish ! " A very literal interpretation of this " hairy star " has been here embroidered , carefully fitted out with cob wheels and all the paraphernalia of a conventional mediæval cornet . In the scenes dealing with the preparation of the army and the arrangement of their food , there occurs the lassooing of an ox ; the amount of action concentrated in this group is really wonderful . The ox , springing clear of the ground , with all his legs gathered up under him , turns his horned head , which is set on an unduly long neck , for the purpose of inspecting his pursuers . No better origin for the ancient tradition of the cow who jumped over the moon could be adduced . And what shall we say of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deaths in battle ? These warriors are turning elaborate handsprings in their last moments , while horses are represented as performing such somersaults that they are practically inverted . In the border of this part of the tapestry , so'diers are // seen stripping off the coats of mail from the dead warriors on the battle-field ; this they do by turning the tunic inside out and pulling it off at the head , and the resulting attitudes of the victims are quaint and realistic in the extreme ! The border has been appropriately described as " a layer of dead men . " In the tenth and eleventh centuries one of the regular petitions in the Litany was " From the fury of the Normans Good Lord Deliver us . " The Bayeux Tapestry was designated , in 1746 , as " the noblest monument in the world relating to our old English History . " It has passed through most trying vicissitudes , having been used in war time as a canvas covering to a transport wagon , among other experiences . For centuries this precious treasure was neglected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ducarel states : " The priests . . . to whom we addressed ourselves for a sight of this remarkable piece of antiquity , knew nothing of it ; the circumstance only of its being annually hung up in their church led them to understand what we wanted , no person then knowing that the object of our inquiries any ways related to the Conqueror . " This was in the nineteenth century . Anglo-Saxon women spent much of their time in embroidering . Edith , Queen of Edward the Confessor , was quite noted for her needlework , which was sometimes used to decorate the state robes of the king . Formerly there existed at Ely Cathedral a work very like the Bayeux Tapestry , recording the deeds of the 160 Arts and Crafts in the Middle Ages heroic Brihtnoth , the East Saxon , who was slain in 991 , fighting the Danish forces . His wife rendered his history in needlework , and presented it to Ely . Unhappily there are no remains of this interesting monument now existing . The nearest thing to the Bayeux Tapestry in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Cathedral at Gerona , a little over four yards square , which is worked in crewels on linen , and is ornamented with scenes of an Oriental and primitive character , taken mainly from the story of Genesis . These tapestries come under the head of needlework . The tapestries made on looms proceed upon a different principle , and are woven instead of embroidered . Two kinds of looms were used under varying conditions in different places ; high warp looms , or Haute Lisse , and low warp looms , known as Basse Lisse . The general method of making tapestries on a high warp loom has been much the same for many centuries . The warp is stretched vertically in two sets , every other thread being first forward and then back in the setting . M. Lacordaire , late Director of the Gobelins , writes as follows : " The workman takes a spindle filled with worsted or silk . . . he stops off the weft thread and fastens it to the warp , to the left of the space to be occupied by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passing his left hand between the back and the front threads , he separates those that are to be covered with colours ; with his right band , having passed it through the same threads , he reaches to the left side , for the spindle which // he brings back to the right ; his left hand , then , seizing hold of the warp , brings the back threads to the front , while the right hand thrusts the spindle back to the point whence it started . " When a new colour is to be introduced , the artist takes a new shuttle . He fastens his thread on the wrong side of the tapestry ( the side on which he works ) and repeats the process just described on the strings stretched up and down before him , like harp strings ; the work is commenced at the lower part , and worked upwards , so that , when this strictly " hand weaving " is accomplished , it may be crowded down into place by means of a kind of ivory comb , so adjusted that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weaving , the warp could be of any inferior but strong thread , for , by the nature of the work , only the woof was visible , the warp being quite hidden and incorporated into the texture under the close lying stitches which met and dove-tailed over it . The worker on a low loom does not see the right side of the work at all , unless he lifts the loom , which is a difficult undertaking . On a high loom , it is only necessary for the worker to go around to the front in order to see exactly what he is doing . The design is put below the work , however , in a low loom , and the work is thus practically traced as the tapestry proceeds . On account of the limitations of the human arm in reaching , the low warp tapestry requires more seams than does that made on the " haute lisse " loom , the pieces being individually smaller . One whole division 162 Arts and Crafts in the Middle Ages of the workmen in tapestry establishments used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole duty was to join the different pieces together , and also to repair worn tapestries , inserting new stitches for restorations . Tapestry repairing was a necessary craft ; at Rheims some tapestries were restored by Jacquemire de Bergeres ; these hangings had been " much damaged by dogs , rats , mice , and other beasts . " It is not stated where they had been hung ! High warp looms have been known in Europe certainly since the ninth century . There is an order extant , from the Bishop of Auxerre , who died in 840 , for some " carpets for his church . " In 890 the monks of Saumur were manufacturing tapestries . Beautiful textiles had been used to ornament the Church of St. Denis as early as 630 , but there is no proof that these were actually tapestries . There is a legend that in 732 a tapestry establishment existed in the district between Tours and Poitiers . At Beauvais , too , the weavers of arras were settled at the time of the Norman ravages . King Dagobert was a mediaeval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of St. Denis ( which he built ) hung with rich tapestries set with pearls and wrought with gold . At the monastery of St. Florent , at Saumur in 985 , the monks wove tapestries , using floral and animal forms in their designs . At Poitiers there was quite a flourishing factory as early as 1025 . Tapestry was probably first made in France , to any considerable extent , then , in the ninth century . The historian // of the monastery of Saumur tells us an interesting incident in connection with the works there . The Abbot of St. Florent had placed a magnificent order for " curtains , canopies , hangings , bench covers , and other ornaments , . . . and he caused to be made two pieces of tapestry of large size and admirable quality , representing elephants . " While these were about to be commenced , the aforesaid abbot was called away on a journey . The ecclesiastic who remained issued a command that the tapestries should be made with a woof different from that which they habitually used . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the good abbot we will not discontinue our employment ; but as you thwart us , we shall make quite a different kind of fabric . " So they deliberately set to work to make square carpets with silver lions on a red ground , with a red and white border of various animals ! Abbot William was fortunately pleased with the result , and used lions interchangeably with elephants thereafter in his decorations . At the ninth century tapestry manufactory in Poitiers , an amusing correspondence took place between the Count of Poitou and an Italian bishop , in 1025 . Poitou was at that time noted for its fine breed of mules . The Italian bishop wrote to ask the count to send him one mule and one tapestry , ? as he expressed it , " both equally marvellous . " The count replied with spirit : " I can not send you what you ask , because for a mule to merit the epithet marvellous , he would have to have horns , or three tails , or five legs , and this I should not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find . I shall have to content myself with sending you the best that I can procure ! " In 992 the Abbey of Croyland , in England , owned " two large foot cloths woven with lions , to be laid before the high altar on great festivals , and two shorter ones trailed all over with flowers , for the feast days of the Apostles . " Under Church auspices in the twelfth century , the tapestry industry rose to its most splendid perfection . When the secular looms were started , the original beauty of the work was retained for a considerable time ; in the tenth century German craftsmen worked as individuals , independently of Guilds or organizations . In the thirteenth century the work was in a flourishing condition in France , where both looms were in use . The upright loom is still used at the Gobelin factory . As an adjunct to the stained glass windows in churches , there never was a texture more harmonious than good mediaeval tapestry . In 1260 the best tapestries in France were made by the Church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magnificent tapestry in twenty-seven subjects representing the Apocalypse , to " the church of Monsieur St. Maurice , " at Angers . Although tapestry was made in larger quantities during the Renaissance , the mediaeval designs are better adapted to the material . The royal chambers of the Kings of England were hung with tapestry , and it was the designated duty of the Chamberlain to see to such adornment . In 1294 // there is mention of a special artist in tapestry , who lived near Winchester ; his name was Sewald , and he was further known as " le tapenyr , " which , according to M. G. Thomson , signifies tapestrier . One is led to believe that tapestries were used as church adornments before they were introduced into dwellings ; for it was said , when Queen Eleanor of Castile had her bedroom hung with tapestries , that " it was like a church . " At Westminster , a writer of 1631 alludes to the " cloths of Arras which adorn the choir . " Sets of tapestries to hang entire apartments were known as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charles V. was one " worked with towers , fallow bucks and does , to put over the King 's boat . " Among early recorded tapestries are those mentioned in the inventory of Philip the Bold , in 1404 , while that of Philip the Good tells of his specimens , in 1420 . Nothing can well be imagined more charming than the description of a tapestried chamber in 1418 ; the room being finished in white was decorated with paroquets and damsels playing harps . This work was accomplished for the Duchess of Bavaria by the tapestry maker , Jean of Florence . Flanders tapestry was famous in the twelfth and fourteenth centuries . Arras particularly was the town celebrated for the beauty of its work . This famous manufactory was founded prior to 1350 , as there is mention of work of that period . Before the town be166 Arts and Crafts in the Middle Ages came known as Arras , while it still retained its original name , Nomenticum , the weavers were famous who worked there . In 282 A. D. the woven cloaks of Nomenticum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of genuine Arras tapestry occurs in an order from the Countess of Artois in 1313 , when she directs her receiver " de faire faire six tapis a Arras . " Among the craftsmen at Arras in 1389 was a Saracen , named Jehan de Croisetes , and in 1378 there was a worker by the name of Huwart Wallois . Several of its workmen emigrated to Lille , in the fifteenth century , among them one Simon Lamoury and another , Jehan de Rausart . In 1419 the Council Chamber of Ypres was ornamented with splendid tapestries by Francois de Wechter , who designed them , and had them executed by Arras workmen . The Van Eycks and Memlinc also designed tapestries , and there is no doubt that the art would have continued to show a more consistent regard for the demands of the material if Raphael had never executed his brilliant cartoons . The effort to be Raphaelesque ruined the effect of many a noble piece of technique , after that . In 1302 a body of ten craftsmen formed a Corporation in Paris . The names of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In 1318 Jehan Orghet is recorded , and in 1368 , Willaume , a high-warp worker . Penalties for false work were extreme . One of the best known workers in France was Bataille , who was closely followed by one Dourdain. // A famous Arras tapestry was made in 1386 by a weaver of the name of Michel Bernard . It measured over two hundred and eighty-five square yards , and represented the battle of Roosebecke . At this time a tapestry worker lived , named Jehanne Aghehe , one of the first attested women 's names in connection with this art . In the Treasury of the church of Douai there is mention of three cushions made of high loom tapestry presented in 1386 by " la demoiselle Englise . " It is not known who this young lady may have been . France and Flanders made the most desirable tapestries in the fourteenth century . In Italy the art had little vogue until the fifteenth . Very little tapestry was made in Spain in the Middle Ages , ? the earliest well known maker was named Gutierrez @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Velasquez , known as " The Weavers , " represents the interior of his manufactory . A table cloth in medieval times was called a " carpett : " these were often very ornate , and it is useful to know that their use was not for floor covering , for the inventories often mention " carpetts " worked with pearls and silver tissue , which would have been singularly inappropriate . The Arabs introduced the art of carpet weaving into Spain . An Oriental , Edrisi , writing in the twelfth century , says that such carpets were made at that time in Alicante , as could not be produced elsewhere , owing to certain qualities in both air and water which greatly benefited the wool used in their manufacture . 168 Arts and Crafts in the Middle Ages In the Travels of Jean Lagrange , the author says that all carpets of Smyrna and Caramania are woven by women . As soon as a girl can hold a shuttle , they stretch cords between two trees , to make a warp , and then they give her all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devices . They tell her , " It is for you to make your own dowry . " Then , according to the inborn art instinct of the child , she begins her carpet . Naturally , traditions and association with others engaged in the same pursuit assist in the scheme and arrangement ; usually the carpet is not finished until she is old enough to marry . " Then , " continues Lagrange , " two masters , two purchasers , present themselves ; the one carries off a carpet , and the other a wife . " Edward II . of England owned a tapestry probably of English make , described as " a green hanging of wool wove with figures of Kings and Earls upon it . " There was a roistering Britisher called John le Tappistere , who was complained of by certain people near Oxford , as having seized Master John of Shoreditch , and assaulted and imprisoned him , confiscating his goods and charging him fifty pounds for ransom . It is not stated what the gentleman from Shoreditch had done thus to bring down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weavers had rather the reputation of being fighters : in 1340 one George le Tapicier murdered John le Dextre of Leicester ; while Giles de la Hyde also slew Thomas Tapicier in 1385 . Possibly these rows occurred on account of a practical infringement upon the man- // ufacturing rights of others as set down in the rules of the Company . There was a woman in Finch Lane who produced tapestry , with a cotton back , " after the manner of the works of Arras : " this was considered a dishonest business , and the work was ordered to be burnt . Roger van der Weyden designed a set of tapestries representing the History of Herkinbald , the stern uncle who , with his own hand , beheaded his nephew for wronging a young woman . Upon his death-bed , Herkinbald refused to confess this act as a sin , claiming the murder to have been justifiable and a positive virtue . Apparently the Higher Powers were on his side , too , for , when the priest refused the Eucharist to the impertinent Herkinbald , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lips of the dying man . A dramatic story , of which van der Weyden made the most , in designing his wonderfully decorative tapestries . The originals were lost , but similar copies remain . As early as 1441 tapestries were executed in Oudenardes ; usually these were composed of green foliage , and known as " verdures . " In time the names " verdure " and " Oudenarde " became interchangeably associated with this class of tapestry . They represented woodland and hunting scenes , and were also called " Tapestry verde , " and are alluded to by Chaucer . Curious symbolic subjects were often used : for instance , for a set of hangings for a banquet hall , what could be more whimsically appropriate than the repre170 Arts and Crafts in the Middle Ages sentation of " Dinner , " giving a feast to " Good Company , " while " Banquet " and " Maladies " attack the guests ! This scene is followed by the arrest of " Souper " and " Banquet " by " Experience , " who condemns them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! There is an old poem written by a monk of Chester , named Bradshaw , in which a large hall decorated with tapestries is described as follows : " All herbs and flowers , fair and sweet , Were strawed in halls , and layd under their feet ; Cloths of gold , and arras were hanged on the wall , Depainted with pictures and stories manifold Well wrought and craftely . " A set of tapestries was made by some of the monks of Troyes , who worked upon the high loom , displaying scenes from the Life of the Magdalen . This task was evidently not devoid of the lighter elements , for in the bill , the good brothers made charge for such wine as they drank " when they consulted together in regard to the life of the Saint in question ! " Among the most interesting tapestries are those representing scenes from the Wars of Troy , in South Kensington . They are crowded with detail , and in this respect exhibit most satisfactorily the beauties of the craft , which is enhanced by small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ masses of unrelieved woven colour . Another magnificent set , bearing similar characteristics , is the History of Clovis at Rheims. // There is a fascinating set of English tapestries representing the Seasons , at Hatfield : these were probably woven at Barcheston . The detail of minute animal and vegetable forms ? the flora and fauna , as it were in worsted ? are unique for their conscientious finish . They almost amount to catalogues of plants and beasts . The one which displays Summer is a herbal and a Noah 's Ark turned loose about a full-sized Classical Deity , who presides in the centre of the composition . Among English makers of tapestries was a workman named John Bakes , who was paid the magnificent sum of twelve pence a day , while in an entry in another document he is said to have received only fourpence daily . The Hunting Tapestries belonging to the Duke of Devonshire are as perfect specimens as any that exist of the best period of the art . They are represented in colour in W. G. Thomson 's admirable work on Tapestries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ li public collection . Another splendidly decorative specimen is at Hampton Court , being a series of the Seven Deadly Sins . They measure about twenty-five by thirteen feet each , and are worked in heavy wools and silks . As technical facility developed , certain weaknesses began to show themselves . Tapestry weavers had their favourite figures , which , to save themselves trouble , they would often substitute for others in the original design . Arras tapestries were no longer made in the six172 Arts and Crafts in the Middle Ages teenth century , and the best work of that time was accomplished in the Netherlands . About 1540 Brussels probably stood at the head of the list of cities famous for the production of these costly textiles . The Raphael tapestries were made there , by Peter van Aelst , under the order of Pope Leo X. They were executed in the space of four years , being finished in 1519 , only a year before Raphael 's death . In the sixteenth century the Brussels workers began to make certain " short cuts " not quite legitimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touching up the faces with liquid dyes , and using the same to enhance the effect after the work was finished . A law was passed that this must not be done on any tapestry worth more than twelve pence a yard . In spite of this trickery , the Netherlandish tapestries led all others in popularity in that century . It was almost invariable , especially in Flemish work , to treat Scriptural subjects as dressed in the costume of the period in which the tapestry happened to be made . When one sees the Prodigal Son attired in a delightful Flemish costume of a well-appointed dandy , and Adam presented to God the Father , both being clothed in Netherlandish garments suitable for Burgomasters of the sixteenth century , then we can believe that the following description , quoted by the Countess of Wilton , is hardly overdrawn . " In a corner of the apartment stood a bed , the tapestry of which was enwrought with gaudy colours , representing Adam and Eve in the Garden // of Eden .. . . Adam was presenting our first mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scarcely reached his knee . . . To the left of Eve appeared a church , and a dark robed gentleman holding something in his hand which looked like a pin cushion , but doubtless was intended for a book ; he seemed pointing to the holy edifice , as if reminding them that they were not yet married ! On the ground lay the rib , out of which Eve , who stood a head higher than Adam , had been formed : both of them were very respectably clothed in the ancient Saxon costume ; even the angel wore breeches , which , being blue , contrasted well with his flaming red wings . " In France , the leading tapestry works were at Tours in the early sixteenth century . A Flemish weaver , Jean Duval , started the work there in 1540 . Until 1552 he and his three sons laboured together with great results , and they left a large number of craftsmen to follow in their footsteps . In Italy the art had almost died out in the early sixteenth century , but revived in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rene of Anjou collected tapestries so assiduously that the care and repairing of them occupied the whole time of a staff of workers , who were employed steadily , living in the palace , and sleeping at night in the various apartments in which the hangings were especially costly . Queen Jeanne , the mother of Henri IV. , was a skilled 174 Arts and Crafts in the Middle Ages worker in tapestry . To quote Miss Freer in the Life of Jeanne d'Albret , " During the hours which the queen allowed herself for relaxation , she worked tapestry and discoursed with some one of the learned men whom she protected . " This queen was of an active mental calibre and one to whom physical repose was most repugnant . She was a regular and pious attendant at church , but sitting still was torture to her , and listening to the droning sermons put her to sleep . So , with a courage to be admired , Jeanne " demanded permission from the Synod to work tapestry during the sermon . This request was granted ; from thenceforth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and busy with her needle , gave due attention . " The Chateau of Blois , during the reign of Louis XII . and Ann of Brittany , is described as being regally appointed with tapestries : " Those which were hung in the apartments of the king and queen , " says the chronicler , " were all full of gold ; and the tapestries and embroideries of cloth of gold and of silk had others beneath them ornamented with personages and histories as those were above . Indeed , there was so great a number of rich tapestries , velvet carpets , and bed coverings , of gold and silk , that there was not a chamber , hall , or wardrobe , that was not full . " In an inventory of the Princess of Burgundy there occurs this curious description of a tapestry : " The three tapestries of the Church Militant , wrought in gold , whereon may be seen represented God Almighty seated // in majesty , and around him many cardinals , and below him many princes who present to him a church . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writer in 1586 : " In noblemen 's houses , " he says , " it is not rare to see abundance of arras , rich hangings , of tapestrie . . . Turkie wood , pewter , brasse , and fine linen . . . . In times past the costly furniture stayed there , whereas now it is discarded yet lower , even unto the inferior artificers , and many farmers . . . have for the most part learned to garnish their beds with tapestries and hangings , and their tables with carpetts and fine napery . " Henry VIII . was devoted to tapestry collecting , also . An agent who was buying for him in the Netherlands in 1538 , wrote to the king : " I have made a stay in my hands of two hundred ells of goodly tapestry ; there bath not been brought this twenty year eny so good for the price . " Henry VIII . had in his large collection many subjects , among them such characteristic pieces as : " ten peeves of the rich story of King David @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , " seven peeces of the Stories of Ladies , " " A peece with a man and woman and a flagon , " " A peece of verdure . . . having poppinjays at the nether corners , " " One peece of Susannah , " " Six fine new tapestries of the History of Helena and Paris . " A set of six " verdure " tapestries was owned by Cardinal Wolsey , which " served for the hanging of Durham Hall of inferior days . " The hangings in a hall 176 Arts and Crafts in the Middle Ages in Chester are described as depicting " Adam , Noe , and his Shyppe . " In 1563 a monk of Canterbury was mentioned as a tapestry weaver . At York , Norwich , and other cities , were also to be found " Arras Workers " during the sixteenth century . There was an amusing law suit in 1598 , which was brought by a gentleman , Charles Lister , against one Mrs. Bridges , for accepting from him , on the miderstanding of an engagement in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He sued for the return of his gifts ! Among the State Papers of James I. , there is a letter in which the King remarks " Sir Francis Crane desires to know if my baby will have him to hasten the making of that suite of tapestry that he commanded him . " In Florence , the art flourished under the Medici . In 1546 a regular Academy of instruction in tapestry weaving was set up , under the direction of Flemish masters . All the leading artists of the Golden Age furnished designs which , though frequently inappropriate for being rendered in textile , were fine pictures , at any rate . In Venice , too , there were work shops , but the influence of Italy was Flemish in every case so far as technical instruction was concerned . The most celebrated artists of the Renaissance made cartoons : Raphael , Giulio Romano , Jouvenet , Le Brun , and numerous others , in various countries . The Gobelins work in Paris was inaugurated in the fifteenth century under Jean Gobelins , a native of Rheims . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ants persevered steadily at the work ; the art prospered under Francis I. , the whole force of tapestry weavers being brought together at Fontainebleau , and under Henry IL , the direction of the whole was given to the celebrated artist Philibert Delorme . In 1630 the Gobelins was fully established as a larger plant , and has never made another move . The work has increased ever since those days , on much the same general lines . Celebrated French artists have designed tapestries : Watteau , Boucher , and others were interpreted by the brilliant manager whose signature appears on the works , Cozette , who was manager from 1736 until 1792 . With this technical perfection came the death of the art of tapestry : the pictures might as well have been painted on canvas , and all feeling for the material was lost , se that the naive charm of the original workers ceased to be a part of the production . Among European collections now visible , the best is in Madrid , where over six hundred tapestries may be seen , chiefly Flemish , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pitti Palace in Florence comprises six hundred , while in the Vatican are preserved the original Raphael tapestries . South Kensington Museum , too , is rich in interesting examples of various schools . It is a very helpful collection to students especially , although not so large as some others . In 1663 , " two well intended statutes " were introduced dealing with curiously opposite matters : ow was to encourage linen and tapestry manufacture ii 178 Arts and Crafts in the Middle Ages England , and the other was " for regulating the packing of herrings ! " The famous English Mortlake tapestry manufactory was not established until the seventeenth century , and that is rather late for us . The progress of craftsmanship has been steady , especially at the Gobelins in France . Many other centres of industry developed , however , in various countries . The study of modern tapestry is a branch by itself with which we are unable to concern ourselves now . CHAPTER VI EMBROIDERIES THE materials used as groundwork for mediaeval embroideries were rich in themselves . Samit was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold wire . Ciclatoun was also a brilliant textile , as also was Cendal . Cendal silk is spoken of by early writers . The first use of silk is interesting to trace . A monopoly , a veritable silk trust , was established in 533 , in the Roman Empire . Women were employed at the Court of Justinian to preside over the looms , and the manufacture of silk was not allowed elsewhere . The only hindrance to this scheme was that the silk itself had to be brought from China . But in the reign of Justinian , two monks who had been travelling in the Orient , brought to the emperor , as curiosities , some silkworms and cocoons . They obtained some long hollow walking sticks , which they packed full of silkworms ' eggs , and thus imported the producers of the raw material . The European silk industry , in fabrics , embroideries , velvets , and such commodities , may owe its origin to this bit of monastic enterprise in 550 . Silk garments were very costly , however , and it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every lady in early times who could have such luxuries . It is said that even the Emperor Aurelian refused his wife her request for just one single cloak of silk , saying : " No , I could never think of buying such a thing , for it sells for its weight in gold ! " Fustian and taffeta were less costly , but frequently used in important work , as also were sarcenet and camora . Velvet and satin were of later date , not occurring until the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries . Baudekin , a good silk and golden weave , was very popular . Cut velvets with elaborate patterns were made in Genoa . The process consisted in leaving the main ground in the original fine rib which resulted from weaving , while in the pattern these little ribs were split open , making that part of a different ply from the rest of the material , in fact , being the finished velvet as we now know it , while the ground remained uncut , and had more the appearance of silk reps . Velvet is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier on the Continent . Both Roger de Wendover and Matthew Paris mention a stuff called " imperial : " it was partly gold in weave , but there is some doubt as to its actual texture . Baudekin was a very costly textile of gold and silk which was used largely in altar coverings and hangings , such as dossals ; by degrees the name became synonymous with " baldachin , " and in Italy the whole altar canopy is still called a baldachino. // During Royal Progresses the streets were always hung with rich cloth of gold . As Chaucer makes allusion to streets " By ordinance throughout the city large Hanged with cloth of gold , and not with serge , " so Leland tells how the Queen of Henry VII . was conducted to her coronation and " all the stretes through which she should pass were clenely dressed . . . with cloths of tapestry and Arras , and some stretes , as Cheepe , hanged with rich cloths of gold , velvetts , and silks . " And in Machyn 's Diary , he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London , was hangyd with cloth of gold and with rich Arras . " The word " satin " is derived from the silks of the Mediterranean , called " aceytuni , " which became " zetani " in Italian , and gradually changed through French and English influence , to " satin . " The first mention of it in England is about 1350 , when Bishop Grandison made a gift of choice satins to Exeter Cathedral . The Dalmatic of Charlemagne is embroidered on blue satin , although this is a rare early example of the material . At Constantinople , also , as early as 1204 , Baldwin II . wore satin at his coronation . It was nearly always made in a fiery red in the early days . It is mentioned in a Welsh poem of the thirteenth century . Benjamin of Tudela , a traveller who wrote in 1161 , mentions that the Jews were living in great numbers in Thebes , and that they made silks there at that time . 182 Arts and Crafts in the Middle Ages There is record that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Apulia a quantity of heavy and fine silk , from which four copes were made . French silks were not remarkable until the sixteenth century , while those of the Netherlands led all others as early as the thirteenth . Shot silks were popular in England in the sixteenth century . York Cathedral possessed , in 1543 , a " vestment of changeable taffety for Good Friday . " St. Dunstan is reported to have once " tinted " a sacerdotal vestment to oblige a lady , thus departing from his regular occupation as goldsmith to perform the office of a dyer of stuff . Many rich mediaeval textiles were ornamented by designs , which usually show interlaces and animal forms , and sometimes conventional floral ornament . Patterns originated in the East , and , through Byzantine influence , in Italy , and Saracenic in Spain , they were adopted and modified by Europeans . In 1295 St. Paul 's in London owned a hanging " patterned with wheels and twoheaded birds . " Sicilian silks , and many others of the contemporary textiles , display variations of the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little conventional shrub , sometimes hardly more than a " budding rod , " with two birds or animals advancing vis-a-vis on either side . Sometimes these are two peacocks ; often lions or leopards and frequently griffins and various smaller animals . Whenever one sees a little tree or a single stalk , no matter how conventionally treated , with a // couple of matched animals strutting up to each other on either side , this pattern owes its origin to the old tradition of the decorative motive usual in Persia and in Byzantium , the Tree of Life , or Horu . The origin of patterns does not come within our scope , and has been excellently treated in the various books of Lewis Day , and other writers on this subject . Textiles of Italian manufacture may be seen represented in the paintings of the old masters : Orcagna , Francia , Crivelli , and others , who delighted in the rendering of rich stuffs ; later , they abound in the creations of Veronese and Titian . A " favourite Italian vegetable , " as Dr. Rock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often , set in oval forms , is either outlined or worked solidly in the fabric . Almeria was a rich city in the thirteenth century , noted for its textiles . A historian of that period writes : " Christians of all nations came to its port to buy and to sell . From thence . . . they travelled to other parts of the interior of the country , where they loaded their vessels with such goods as they wanted . Costly silken robes of the brightest colours are manufactured in Almeria . " Granada was famous too , a little later , for its silks and woven goods . About 1562 Navagiero wrote : " All sorts of cloth and silks are made there : the silks made at Granada are much esteemed all over Spain ; they are not so good as those that come from Italy . There are several looms , but they do not yet know how to work them well . They make good taffetas , sarcenet , 184 Arts and Crafts in the Middle Ages and silk serges . The velvets are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are better in quality . " Marco Polo says of the Persians in certain sections ; " There are excellent artificers in the cities , who make wonderful things in gold , silk , and embroidery ... . In veins of the mountains stones are found , commonly called turquoises , and other jewels . There also are made all sorts of arms and ammunition for war , and by the women excellent needlework in silks , with all sorts of creatures very admirably wrought therein . " Marco Polo also reports the King of Tartary as wearing on his birthday a most precious garment of gold , while his barons wore the same , and had given them girdles of gold and silver , and " pearls and garments of great price . " This Khan also " has the tenths of all wool , silk , and hemp , which he causes to be made into clothes , in a house for that purpose appointed : for all trades are bound one day in the week to serve him . " He clothed his armies with this tythe wool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thin flat strips of pure gold was used ; sometimes the flat metal was woven on a warp of scarlet silk threads . Later strips of gilded parchment were fraudulently substituted for the genuine flat metal thread . Often the woof of gold strips was so solid and heavy that it was necessary to have a silk warp of six strands to support its wear . Gold cloth was of varying excellence , however : among the items in an inventory for the Earl of Warwick in // the time of Henry VI. , there is allusion to " one coat for My Lord 's body , beat with fine gold ; two coats for heralds , beat with demi-gold . " It is generally assumed that the first wire-drawing machines were made about 1360 in Germany ; they were not used in England until about 1560 . Theophilus , however , in the eleventh century , tells " Of the instruments through which wires are drawn , " saying that they consist of " two irons , three fingers in breadth , narrow above and below , everywhere thin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which holes wires are drawn . " This would seem to be a primitive form of the more developed instrument . Wire drawing was introduced into England by Christian Schutz about 1560 . In 1623 was incorporated in London , " The Worshipful Company of Gold and Silver Wire-Drawers . " The preamble of their charter reads thus : " The Trade Art of Drawing and flattening of gold and silver wire , and making and spinning of gold and silver thread and stuffe . " It seems as though there were some kind of work that corresponded to wire-drawing , earlier than its supposed introduction , for a petition was sent to King Henry VI . in 1423 , by the " wise and worthy Communes of London , &; the Wardens of Broderie in the said Citie , " requesting protection against " deceit and default in the work of divers persons occupying the craft of embroidery ; " and in 1461 " An act of Common Council was passed respecting the gold-drawers , " showing that the art was known to some extent and 186 Arts and Crafts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reign of George II. , in 1742 , " An . act to prevent the counterfeiting of gold and silver lace and for the settling and adjusting the proportions of fine silver and silk , and for the better making of gold and silver lace , " was passed . Ecclesiastical vestments were often trimmed with heavy gold fringe , knotted " fretty wise , " and the embroideries were further enriched with jewels and small plaques of enamel . Matthew Paris relates a circumstance of certain garments being so heavily weighted with gold that the clergy could not walk in them , and , in order to get the solid metal out again , it was necessary to burn the garments and thus melt the gold . Jewelled robes were often seen in the Middle Ages ; a chasuble is described as having been made for the Abbot of St. Albans , in the twelfth century , which was practically covered with plaques of gold and precious stones . Imagine the unpleasant physical sensation of a bishop in 1404 , who was obliged to wear a golden mitre of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with balas rubies , and sapphires , and trimmed with indefinite extra pearls ! The body of St. Cecilia , who was martyred in 230 , was interred in a garment of pure woven gold . The cloth of solid gold which was used for state occasions was called " tissue ; " the thin paper in which it was wrapped when it was laid away was known as tissue paper , and Mr. William Maskell states that the name // has clung to it , and that is why thin paper is called " tissue paper " to-day . St. Peter 's in Rome possessed a great pair of silver curtains , which hung at the entrance to the church , given by Pope Stephen IV . in the eighth century . Vitruvius tells how to preserve the gold in old embroidery , or in worn-out textiles where the metal has been extensively used . He says : " When gold is embroidered on a garment which is worn out , and no longer fit for use , the cloth is burnt over the fire in earthen pots . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . This collects all particles of gold , and unites with them . The water is then poured off , and the residuum placed in a cloth , which , when squeezed with the hands suffers the liquid quicksilver to pass through the pores of the cloth , but retains the gold in a mass within it . " An early allusion to asbestos woven as a cloth is made by Marco Polo , showing that fire-proof fabrics were known in his time . In the province of Chinchintalas , " there is a mountain wherein are mines of steel . . . and also , as was reported , salamanders , of the wool of which cloth was made , which if cast into the fire , can not burn . But that cloth is in reality made of stone in this manner , as one of my companions a Turk , named Curifar , a man endued with singular industry , informed me , who had charge of the minerals in that province . A certain mineral is found in that mountain which yields threads not unlike wool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Middle Ages in the sun , are bruised in a brazen mortar , and afterwards washed , and whatsoever earthy substance sticks to them is taken away . Lastly , these threads are shun like ordinary wool , and woven into cloth . And when they would whiten those cloths , they cast them into the fire for an hour , and then take them out unhurt whiter than snow . After the same manner they cleanse them when they have taken any spots , for no other washing is used to them , besides the fire . " In the Middle Ages it would have been possible , as Lady Alford suggests , to play the game " Animal , Vegetable , or Mineral " with textiles only ! Between silk , hemp , cotton , gold , silver , wool , flax , camel 's hair , and asbestos , surely the three elements all played their parts . Since the first record of Eve having " sewn fig leaves together to make aprons , " women have used the needle in some form . In England , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an Indian , in 1545 , before which time they were imported . The old play , " Gammer Gurton 's Needle , " is based upon the extreme rarity of these domestic implements , and the calamity occasioned in a family by their loss . There is a curious old story about a needle , which was supposed to possess magic powers . This needle is reported to have worked at night while its owner was resting , saving her all personal responsibility about her mending . When the old lady finally died , another owner claimed this charmed needle , and began at once to test its powers . But , do // what she would , she was unable to force a thread through its obst inate eye . At last , after trying all possible means thread the needle , she took a magnifying glass to line and see what the impediment was , and , lo ! eye of the needle was filled with a great tear , ? it weeping for the loss of its old mistress , and no one ever able to thread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman 's craft , but in the Middle Ages the leading needleworkers were often men . The old list of names given by Louis Farcy has almost an equal proportion of workers of both sexes . But the finest work was certainly accomplished by the conscientious dwellers in cloisters , and the nuns devoted their vast leisure in those days to this art . Fuller observes : " Nunneries were also good sheeschooIs , wherein the girls of the neighbourhood were taught to read and work . . . that the sharpnesse of their wits and suddennesse of their conceits ( which even their enemies must allow unto them ! ) might by education be improved into a judicious solidity . " In some of these schools the curriculum included " Reading and sewing , threepence a week : a penny extra for manners . " An old thirteenth century work , called the " Kleine ) II . Heldenbuch , " contains a verse which may be thus " Who taught me to embroider in a frame with silk ? And to draw and design the wild and tame Beasts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plain surface : 190 Arts and Crafts in the Middle Ages Round about to place golden borders , A narrow and a broader one , With stags and hinds lifelike . " A study of historic embroidery should be preceded b : a general knowledge of the principle stitches employed . One of the simplest forms was chain stitch , in which one stitch was taken through the loop of the still just laid . In the Middle Ages it was often used . Somme times , when the material was of a loose weave , it was executed by means of a little hook ? the probable origin of crochet . . Tapestry stitch , of which one branch is cross-stitch , was formed by laying close single stitches of uniform size upon a canvas specially prepared for this work . Fine embroidery in silk was usually executed in long smooth stitches of irregular length , which merged into each other . This is generally known as satin stitch , for the surface of the work is that of a satin texture when the work is completed . This was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire surface had beer hidden by the close silk stitches , it was cut out and tran ferred on a brocade background , this style of rendering being known as applique . Botticelli recommended this work as most durable and satisfactory : it is oftenest associated with church embroidery . A simple applique was also done by cutting out pieces of one material and applying them to another , hiding the edge-joinings by couching on a cord . As an improvement upon painted banners to be used in processions , Botticelli introduced // this method of cutting out and resetting colours upon a different ground . As Vasari says : " This he did that the colors might not sink through , showing the tint of the cloth on each side . " But Dr. Rock points out that it is hardly fair to earlier artificers to give the entire credit for this method of work to Botticelli , since such cut work or applique was practised in Italy a hundred years before Botticelli was born ! Sometimes solid masses of silk or gold thread were laid in ordered flatness upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or short stitches at right angles . This is known as couching , and is a very effective way of economizing material by displaying it all on the surface . As a rule , however , the surface wears off somewhat , but it is possible to execute it so that it is as durable as embroidery which has been rendered in separate stitches . In Sicily it was a common practice to use coral in embroideries as well as pearls . Coral work is usually called Sicilian work , though it was also sometimes executed in Spain . The garments worn by the Byzantines were very ornate ; they were made of woven silk and covered with elaborate devices . In the fourth century the Bishop of Amasia ridiculed the extravagant dress of his contemporaries . " When men appear in the streets thus dressed , " he says , " the passers by look at them as at painted walls . Their clothes are pictures , which little children point out to one another . The saintlier sort wear likenesses of Christ , the Marriage of Galilee , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the dead . " Allusion was made in a sermon : " Persons who arrayed themselves like painted walls " " with beasts and flowers all over them " were denounced ! In the early Dark Ages there was some prejudice against these rich embroideries . In the sixth century the Bishop St. Cesaire of Arles forbade his nuns to embroider robes with precious stones or painting and flowers . King Withaf of Mercia willed to the Abbey of Croyland " my purple mantle which I wore at my Coronation , to be made into a cope , to be used by those who minister at the holy altar : and also my golden veil , embroidered with the Siege of Troy , to be hung up in the Church on my anniversary . " St. Asterius preached to his people , " Strive to follow in your lives the teachings of the Gospel , rather than have the miracles of Our Redeemer embroidered on your outward dress ! " This prejudice , however , was not long lived , and the embroidered vestments and garments continued to hold their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It has been said on grave authority that " Woman is an animal that delights in the toilette , " while Petrarch , in 1366 , recognized the power of fashion over its votaries . " Who can see with patience , " he writes , " the monstrous fantastical inventions which people of out times have invented to deform rather than adorn their persons ? Who can behold without indignation their long pointed shoes , their caps with feathers , their hair // twisted and hanging down like tails , . . . their bellies so cruelly squeezed with cords that they suffer as much pain from vanity as the martyrs suffered for religion ! " And yet who shall say whether a " dress-reform " Laura would have charmed any more surely the eye of the poet ? Chaucer , in England , also deplores the fashions of his day , alluding to the " sinful costly array of clothing , namely , in too much superfluity or else indisordinate scantiness ! " Changing fashions have always been the despair of writers who have tried to lay down rules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says Harrison , " endeavouring some time to write of our attire . . . when he saw what a difficult piece of work he had taken in hand , he gave over his travail , and onely drue a picture of a naked man unto whom he gave a pair of shears in the one hand and a piece of cloth in the other , to the end that he should shape his apparel after such fashion as himself liked , sith he could find no garment that could please him any while together : and this he called an Englishman . " Edward the Confessor wore State robes which had been beautifully embroidered with gold by his accomplished wife , Edgitha . In the Royal Rolls of Edward III. , in 133 , we find allusion to two vests of green velvet embroidered respectively with sea sirens and coats of arms . The tunics worn over armour offered great opportunities to the needleworker . They were richly embroidered , usually in heraldic style . When Symon , 194 Arts and Crafts in the Middle Ages Bishop of Ely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the royal dame bestowed upon him the gown which she wore on that occasion ; it is described as a murrey-coloured velvet , powdered with golden squirrels , and was of such voluminous pattern that it was cut over into three copes ! Bridal gowns were sometimes given to churches , as well . St. Louis of France was what might be called temperate in dress . The Sire de Joinville says he " never saw a single embroidered coat or ornamented saddle in the possession of the king , and reproved his son for having such things . I replied that he would have acted better if he had given them in charity , and had his dress made of good sendal , lined and strengthened with his arms , like as the king his father had done ! " At the marriage of the Lord of Touraine in 1389 , the Duke of Burgundy presented magnificent habits and clothing to his nephew the Count of Nevers : among these were tunics , ornamented with embroidered trees conventionally displayed on their backs , fronts , and sleeves ; others showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with balas rubies set in pearls , alternating with suns of solid gold with great solitaire pearls as centres . Again , in 1390 , when the king visited Dijon , he presented to the same nephew a set of harnesses for jousting . Some of them were composed largely of sheets of beaten gold and silver . In some gold and silver marguerites were introduced also . Savonarola reproved the Florentine nuns for employ- // ing their valuable time in manufacturing " gold laces with which to adorn persons and houses . " The Florentine gold lace was very popular in England , in the days of Henry VIII. , and later the art was taken up by the " wire-drawers " of England , and a native industry took the place of the imported article . Among prohibited gowns in Florence was one owned by Donna Francesca degli Albizi , " a black mantle of raised cloth : the ground is yellow , and over it are woven birds , parrots , butterflies , red and white roses , and many figures in vermilion and green , with pavilions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and many other figures of various colours , the whole lined with cloth in hues of black and vermilion . " As one reads this description , it seems as though the artistic sense as much as conscientious scruples might have revolted and led to its banishment ! Costumes for tournaments were also lavish in their splendour . In 1467 Benedetto Salutati ordered made for such a pageant all the trappings for two horses , worked in two hundred pounds of silver by Pollajuolo ; thirty pounds of pearls were also used to trim the garments of the sergeants . No wonder Savonarola was enthusiastic in his denunciation of such extravagance . Henry VIII . had " a pair of hose of purple silk and Venice gold , woven like a caul . " For one of his favoured lady friends , also , there is an item , of a certain sum " paid , for one pound of gold for embroidering a nightgown. " 196 Arts and Crafts in the Middle Ages The unrivalled excellence of English woollen cloths was made manifest at an early period . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a law was passed prohibiting monks from wearing it , the reason being that it was considered " smart enough for military men ! " This was in 1422 . The name of Worsted was given to a certain wool because it was made at Worsted , a town in Norfolk ; later the " worsted thread " was sold for needleworkers . Ladies made their own gold thread in the Middle Ages by winding a fine flat gold wire , scarcely of more body than a foil , around a silk thread . Patches were embroidered into place upon such clothes or vestments as were torn : those who did this work were as well recognized as the original designers , and were called " healers " of clothes ! Embroidered bed hangings were very much in order in mediaeval times in England . In the eleventh century there lived a woman who had emigrated from the Hebrides , and who had the reputation for witchcraft , chiefly based upon the unusually exquisite needlework on her bed curtains ! The name of this reputed sorceress was Thergunna . Bequests in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people of position . The Fair Maid of Kent left to her son her " new bed curtains of red velvet , embroidered with ostrich feathers of silver , and heads of leopards of gold , " while in 1380 the Earl of March bequeathed his " large bed of black satin embroidered with white // lions and gold roses , and the escutcheons of the arms of Mortimer and Ulster . " This outfit must have resembled a Parisian " first class " funeral ! The widow of Henry II . slept in a sort of mourning couch of black velvet , which must have made her feel as if she too were laid out for her own burial ! A child 's bedquilt was found mentioned in an inventory of furniture at the Priory of Durham , in 1446 , which was embroidered in the four corners with the Evangelistic symbols . In the " Squier of Lowe Degree , " a fifteenth century romance , there is allusion to a bed , of which the head sheet is described " with diamonds set and rubies bright . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a letter , to " a bed of gold cloth . " Wall hangings in bedrooms were also most elaborate , and the effect of a chamber adorned with gold and needlework must have been fairly regal . An embroiderer named Delobel made a set of furnishings for the bedroom of Louis XIV . the work upon which occupied three years . The subject was the Triumph of Venus . In South Kensington Museum there is a fourteenth century linen cloth of German workmanship , upon which occurs the legend of the unicorn , running for protection to a maiden . An old Bestiary describes how the unicorn , or as it is there called , the " monocerus , " " is an animal which has one horn on its head : it is caught by means of a virgin . " The unicorn and virgin , with a hunter in pursuit , is quite a favourite bit of symbolism in the middle ages . 198 Arts and Crafts in the Middle Ages Another interesting piece of German embroidery in South Kensington is a table cloth , worked on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embellish the corners . A liberal translation of these verses is given by Dr. Rock , some of the sentences being quaint and interesting to quote . Evidently the embroideress indulged in autobiography in the following : " And she , to honour the esquire her husband , wished to adorn and increase his house furniture , and there has worked , with her own hand , this and still many other pretty cloths , to her memory . " And in another corner , " Now follows here my own birthday . When one wrote 1565 my mother 's heart was gladdened by my first cry . In the year 1585 I gave birth my self to a daughter . Her name is Emilia Catharina , and she has been a proper and praiseworthy child . " Then , to her children the following address is directed : " Do not forget your prayers in the morning . And be temperate in your pleasures . And make yourselves acquainted with the Word of God . . . . I beseech you to be sincere in all matters . That will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his station : it will make you honourably known . You , my truly beloved sons , beware of fiery wines . . . you , my truly beloved daughters , preserve and guard your honour , and reflect before you do anything : many have been led into evil by acting first and thinking afterwards . " In another compartment , a lament goes up in which she deplores the death of her husband . " His age was sixty and eight // years , " she says . " The dropsy has killed him . I , his afflicted Anna Blickin von Licchtenperg who was left behind , have related it with my hand in this cloth , that might be known to my children this greater sorrow which God has sent me . " The cloth is a naive and unusual record of German home life . Ecclesiastical embroidery began in the fourth century . In earliest days the work was enhanced with quantities of gold thread . The shroud in which St. Cuthbert 's body was wrapped is a mass of gold : a Latin inscription on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus translated : " Queen to Alfred 's son and successor , Edward the Elder , was one Aelflaed , who caused this stole and maniple to be made for a gift to Fridestan consecrated Bishop of Winchester , A. D. 905 . " The maniple is of " woven gold , with spaces left vacant for needlework embroidery . " Such garments for burial were not uncommon ; but they have as a rule perished from their long residence underground . St. Cuthbert 's vestments are splendid examples of tenth century work in England . After the death of King Edward II. , and his wife Aelflaed , Bishop Frithestan also having passed away , Athelstan , as King , made a pilgrimage to the shrine of St. Cuthbert and bestowed these valuable embroideries there . They were removed from the body of the saint in 1827 . The style of the work inclines to Byzantine . The Saxon embroideries must have been very decorative : a robe is described by Aldhelme in 709 , as " of a most delicate thread of purple , adorned with 200 Arts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " At the church at Croyland some vestments were decorated with birds of gold cut out and applique and at Exeter they had " nothing about them but true needlework . " In the " Liber Eliensis , " in the Muniment room at Ely , is an account of a gift to the church by Queen Emma , the wife of King Knut , who " on a certain day came to Ely in a boat , accompanied by his wife the Queen Emma , and the chief nobles of his kingdom . " This royal present was " a purple cloth worked with gold and set with jewels for St. Awdry 's shrine , " and the Monk Thomas assures us that " none other could be found in the kingdom of the English of such richness and beauty of workmanship . " The various stitches in English work had their several names , the opus plumarium , or straight overlapping stitches , resembling the feathers of a bird ; the opus pluvarium , or cross stitch , and many others . A great deal of work was accomplished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes the ground was painted , as has already been described in Italian work . In the year 1246 Matthew Paris writes : " About this time the Lord Pope , Innocent IV. , having observed that the ecclesiastical ornaments of some Englishmen , such as choristers ' copes and mitres , were embroidered in gold thread , after a very desirable fashion , asked where these works were made , and received in answer , England . ' Then , " said the Pope , " England is surely a garden of delight for us ; it is truly a never failing Spring , and // there where many things abound much may be extorted . " This far sighted Pope , with his semi-commercial views , availed himself of his discovery . In the days of Anastatius , ecclesiastical garments were spoken of by name according to the motive of their designs : for instance , the " peacock garment , " the " elephant chasuble , " and the " lion cope . " Fuller tells of the use of a pall as an ecclesiastical vestment , remarking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wool and superstition . " Mediaeval embroiderers in England got into certain habits of work , so that there are some designs which are almost as hall-marks to English work ; the Cherubim over the wheel is especially characteristic , as is also the vase of lilies , and various heraldic devices which are less frequently found in the embroidered work of European peoples . The Syon Cope is perhaps the most conspicuous example of the mediaeval embroiderer 's art . It was made by nuns about the end of the thirteenth century , in a convent near Coventry . It is solid stitchery on a canvas ground , " wrought about with divers colours " on green . The design is laid out in a series of interlacing square forms , with rounded and barbed sides and corners . In each of these is a figure or a scriptural scene . The orphreys , or straight borders which go down both fronts of the cope , are decorated with heraldic charges . Much of the embroidery is raised , and wrought in the stitch known as Opus Anglicanum . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced by pressing a heated metal knob into the work at such points as were to be raised . The real embroidery was executed on a flat surface , and then bossed up by this means until it looked like bas-relief . The stitches in every part run in zig-zags , the vestments , and even the nimbi about the heads , are all executed with the stitches slanting in one direction , from the centre of the cope outward , without consideration of the positions of the figures . Each face is worked in circular progression outward from the centre , as well . The interlaces are of crimson , and look well on the green ground . The wheeled Cherubim is well developed in the design of this famous cope , and is a pleasing decorative bit of archaic ecclesiasticism . In the central design of the Crucifixion , the figure of the Lord is rendered in silver on a gold ground . The anatomy is according to the rules laid down by an old sermonizer , in a book entitled " The Festival , " wherein it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cross as a skin of parchment on a harrow , so that all his bones might be told . " With such instruction , there was nothing left for the medieval embroiderers but to render the figure with as much realistic emaciation as possible . The heraldic ornaments on the Syon Cope are especially interesting to all students of this graceful art . It is not our purpose ' here to make much allusion to this aspect of the work , but it is of general interest to know that on the orphreys , the devices of most of the noble families of that day appear . // English embroidery fell off greatly in excellence during the Wars of the Roses . In the later somewhat degenerate raised embroidery , it was customary to represent the hair of angels by little tufted curls of auburn silk ! Many of the most important examples of ancient ecclesiastical embroidery are in South Kensington Museum . A pair of orphreys of the fifteenth century , of German work ( probably made at Cologne ) , shows a little choir of angels playing on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on crimson silk , in what was called " cut work . " This differed entirely from what modern embroiderers mean by cut work , as has been explained . The Dalmatic of Charlemagne is given by Louis Farcy to the twelfth century . He calls it the Dalmatic of Leo III . But Lady Alford claims for this work a greater antiquity . Certainly , as one studies its details , one is convinced that it is not quite a Gothic work , nor yet is it Byzantine ; for the figures have all the grace of Greek work prior to the age of Byzantine stiffness . It is embroidered chiefly in gold , on a delicate bluish satin ground , and has not been transferred , although it has been carefully restored . The central ornament on the front is a circular composition , and the arrangement of the figures both here and on the back suggests that Sir Edward Burne Jones must have made a study of this magnificent dalmatic , from which it would seem i hat much of his inspiration might have been drawn . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Middle Ages The little black outlines to the white silk faces , anal to the glowing figures , give this work a peculiarly decorative quality , not often seen in other embroideries of the period . It is unique and one of the most valuable examples of its art in the world . It is now in the Treasury of the Vatican . When Charlemagne sang the Gospel at High Mass on the day of his Coronation , this was his vestment . It must have been a strangely gorgeous sight when Cola di Rienzi , according to Lord Lindsay , took this dalmatic , and placed it over his armour , and , with his crown and truncheon , ascended to the palace of the Popes ! A very curious Italian piece of the fourteenth century is an altar frontal , on which the subjects introduced are strange . It displays scenes from the life of St. Ubaldo , with some incidents also in that of St. Julian Hospitaler . St. Ubaldo is seen forgiving a mason who , having run a wall across his private grounds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows the death bed of the saint , and the conversion of a possessed man at the foot of the bed : a lady is throwing her arms above her head in astonishment while the evil spirit flies from its victim into the air . Later , the saint is seen going to the grave in a cart drawn by oxen . The peacock was symbolical both of knightly vigilance and of Christian watchfulness . An old Anglo-Norman , Osmont , writes : " The eye-speckled feathers should warn a man that never too often can he have his eyes wide open , and gaze inwardly upon his own heart . " These // dear people were so introspective and self-conscious , always looking for trouble ? in their own motives , even ? that no doubt many good impulses perished unnoticed , while the originator was chasing mental phantoms of heresy and impurity . Painting and jewelry were sometimes introduced in connection with embroideries . In the celebrated Cope of St. John Lateran , the faces and hands of the personages are rendered in painting ; but this method was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when sincerity counted for less than effect , and when genuine religious fervour for giving one 's time and best labour to the Lord 's service no longer dominated the workers . , Gold thread was used extensively in English work , and spangles were added at quite an early period , as well as actual jewels set in floral designs . The finest work was accomplished in the Gothic period , before the Renaissance came with its aimless scrolls to detract from the dignity of churchly ornament . In the sixteenth century the winged angels have often a degenerate similitude to tightly laced coryphees , who balance themselves upon their wheels as if they were performing a vaudeville turn . They are not as dignified as their archaic predecessors . Very rich funeral palls were in vogue in the sixteenth century . A description of Prince Arthur 's burial in 1:02 relates how numerous palls were bestowed , apparently much as friends would send wreaths or im206 Arts and Crafts in the Middle Ages portant floral tributes to-day . " The Lord Powys went to the Queere Doore , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a riche pall of cloth of gould of tissue , which he offered to the corpse , where two Officers of the Armes received it , and laid it along the corpse . The Lord Dudley in like manner offered a pall . . . the Lord Grey Ruthen offered another , and every each of the three Earls offered to the corpse three palls of the same cloth of gould . . . all the palls were layd crosse over the corpse . " The account of the obsequies of Henry VII . also contains mention of these funeral palls : the Earls and Dukes came in procession , from the Vestry , with " certain palls , which everie of them did bring solemnly between their hands and coming in order one before another as they were in degree , unto the said herse , they kissed their said palls . . . and laid them upon the King 's corpse . " At Ann of Cleves ' burial the same thing was repeated , in 1557 . Finally these rich shimmering hangings came to be known in England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used for funerals or coronations , for bridals or pageants . The London City Guilds possessed magnificent palls ; especially well known is that of the Fishmongers , with its kneeling angels swinging censers ; this pall is frequently reproduced in works on embroidery . It is embroidered magnificently with angels , saints , and strange to say , mermaids . The peacock 's wings of the angels make a most decorative feature in this famous // piece of old embroidery . The Arms of the Company are also emblazoned . French embroiderers are known by name in many instances ; in 1299 allusion was made to " Clement le Brodeur , " who furnished a cope for the Count of Artois , and in 1316 a magnificent set of hangings was made for the Queen , by one Gautier de Poulleigny . Nicolas Waquier was armourer and embroiderer to King John in 1352 . Among Court workers in 1384 were Perrin Gale , and Henriet Gautier . In the " Book of Rules " by Etienne Boileau , governing the " Embroiderers and embroideresses of the City of Paris , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be permitted in the evening , " because the work of the night can not be so good or so satisfactory as that accomplished in the day . " When one remembers the facilities for evening lighting in the middle ages , one fully appreciates the truth of this statement . Matthew Paris , in his Life of St. Alban , tells of an excellent embroideress , Christine , Prioress of Margate , who lived in the middle of the twelfth century . In the thirteenth century several names occur . Adam de Bazinge made , in 1241 , by order of Henry III . of England , a cope for the Bishop of Hereford . Cunegonde , Abbess of Goss , in Styria , accomplished numerous important works in that period . Also , Henry III . employed Jean de Sumercote to make jewelled robes of state . On a certain thirteenth century chasuble are the words 208 Arts and Crafts in the Middle Ages " Penne fit me " ( Penne made me ) , pointing to the existence of a needleworker of that name . Among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bruceles , Renier de Treit , Gautier de Poulogne , and Jean de Laon , while Jean Harent of Calais is recorded as having worked , for Mme. d'Artois , in 1319 , a robe decorated " a bestelettes et a testes . " These names prove that the art had been taught in many cities and countries : Ogier de Gant , Jean de Savoie , Etienne le Hongre , and Roger de Varennes , all suggest a cosmopolitan and dispersed number of workers , who finally all appeared in Paris . Rene d'Anjou had in his employ a worker in embroidery , named Pierre du Villant . This artist executed a set of needlework pieces for the Cathedral of Angers , of such important proportions that they were known collectively as " La Grande Broderie . " In 1462 , when they were put in place , a special mass was performed by way of a dedication . The letter which accompanied this princely donation contained the following sentences : " We , Rene , by the Grace of God . . . give . . . to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ composd of golden embroidery , comprising five pieces " ( which are enumerated ) " and an altar cloth illustrated with scenes from the Passion of Our Saviour . . . . Given in our castle in Angers , the fourth day of March , 1462 . Rene . " In 1479 another altar frontal was presented . Two other rich chapels were endowed by Rene : one was // known as La Chapelle Joyeuse , and the other as La Grande Chapelle des Trepasses . It is likely that the same embroiderer executed the pieces of all these . A guild of embroiderers was in standing in Seville in 1433 , where Ordinances were enforced to protect from fraud and otherwise to regulate this industry . The same laws were in existence in Toledo . One of the finest and largest pieces of embroidery in Spain is known as the Tent of Ferdinand and Isabella . This was used in 1488 , when certain English Ambassadors were entertained . The following is their description of its use . " After the tilting was over , the majesties returned to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entered a large room . . . and there they sat under a rich cloth of state of crimson velvet , richly embroidered , with the arms of Castile and Aragon . " A curious effect must have been produced by a piece of embroidery described in the inventory of Charles V. , as " two little pillows with savage beasts having the heads of armed men , and garnished with pearls . " After the Reformation it became customary to use ecclesiastical ornaments for domestic purposes . Heylin , in his " History of the Reformation , " makes mention of many " private men 's parlours " which " were hung with altar cloths , and their tables and beds covered with copes instead of carpetts and coverlids . " Katherine of Aragon , while the wife of Henry VIII. , consoled herself in her unsatisfactory life by needlework : it is related that she and her ladies " occupied themselves 210 Arts and Crafts in the Middle Ages working with their own hands something wrought in needlework , costly and artificially , which she intended to the honour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Aragon was such a devoted needlewoman , in fact , that on one occasion Burnet records that she stepped out to speak to two ambassadors , with a skein of silk about her neck , and explained that she had been embroidering with her ladies when they were announced . In an old sonnet she is thus commemorated : " She to the eighth king Henry married was And afterwards divorced , when virtuously , Although a queen , yet she her days did pass In working with the needle curiously . " Queen Elizabeth was also a clever embroiderer ; she worked a book-cover for Katherine Parr , bearing the initials K. P. , and it is now in the Bodleian Library at Oxford . Mary Queen of Scots was also said to be skilful with her needle ; in fact it seems to have been the consolation of most queens in their restricted existence in those centuries . Dr. Rock considers that the " corporal " which Mary Queen of Scots had bound about her eyes at the time of her execution , was in reality a piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Knight , in describing the scene in his " Picturesque History of England , " says : " Then the maid Kennedy took a handkerchief edged with gold , in which the Eucharist had formerly been enclosed , and fastened it // over her eyes ; " so accounts differ and traditions allow considerable scope for varied preferred interpretation . It is stated that Catherine de Medicis was fond of needlework , passing her evenings embroidering in silk " which was as perfect as was possible , " says Brantome . Anne of Brittany instructed three hundred of the children of the nobles at her court , in the use of the needle . These children produced several tapestries , which were presented by the queen to various churches . The volatile Countess of Shrewsbury , the much married " Bess of Hardwick , " was a good embroideress , who worked , probably , in company with the Queen of Scots when that unfortunate woman was under the guardianship of the Earl of Shrewsbury . One of these pieces is signed E. S. , and dated 1590 . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ linen was executed in Spain in the sixteenth century , and was known as " black work . " Viscount Falkland owns some important specimens of this curious work . It was introduced into England by Katherine of Aragon , and became very popular , being exceedingly suitable and serviceable for personal adornment . The black was often relieved by gold or silver thread . The Petit Point , or single square stitch on canvas , became popular in England during the reign of Elizabeth . It suggested Gobelins tapestry , on a small scale , when finished , although the method of execution is quite different , being needlework pure and simple . In Elizabeth 's time was incorporated the London 212 Arts and Crafts in the Middle Ages Company of Broderers , which flourished until about the reign of Charles I. , when there is a complaint registered that " trade was so much decayed and grown out of use , that a great part of the company , for want of employment , were much impoverished .

Decided changes and developments took place in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries , in all forms of embroidery , but these are not for us to consider at present . A study of historic samples alone is most tempting , but there is no space for the intrusion of any subject much later than the Renaissance . CHAPTER VII SCULPTURE IN STONE ( France and Italy ) SCULPTURE is not properly speaking the " plastic art , " as is often understood . The real meaning of sculpture is work which is cut into form , whereas plastic art is work that is moulded or cast into form . Terra cotta , which is afterwards baked , is plastic ; and yet becomes hard ; thus a Tanagra figurine is an example of plastic art , while a Florentine marble statuette is a product of sculpture . The two are often confounded . We shall allude to them under different heads , taking for our consideration now only such sculpture as is the result of cutting in the stone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treated as sculpture in this book . Luca Della Robbia is a worker in plastic art , while Adam Kraft , hewing directly at the stone , is a sculptor . We have no occasion to study the art of the sculptor who produces actual statues ; only so far as sculpture is a companion to architecture , and a decorative art , does it come within the scope of the arts and crafts . Figure sculpture , then , is only considered when strictly of a monumental character . 213 214 Arts and Crafts in the Middle Ages In attacking such a subject as sculpture in the Middle Ages it is impossible to do more than indicate the general tendencies in different countries . But there are certain defined characteristics an observance of which will make clear to any reader various fundamental principles by which it is easy to determine the approximate age and style of works . In the first place , the great general rule of treatment of stone in the North and in the South is to be mentioned . In the Northern countries , France , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for buildings and their decorations was obtainable in large blocks and masses ; it was what , for our purposes , we will call ordinary stone , and could be used in the solid ; therefore it was possible for carving in the North to be rendered as deeply and as roundly as the sculptor desired . In Southern countries , however , and chiefly in Italy , the stone used for building was not ordinary , but semiprecious stone . Marble , porphyry , and alabaster were available ; and the use of such material led to a different ideal in architecture and decoration , ? that of incrustation instead of solid piling . These valuable stones of Italy could not be used , generally speaking , in vast blocks , into which the chisel was at liberty to plough as it pleased ; when a mass of marble or alabaster was obtained , the aesthetic soul of the Italian craftsman revolted against shutting up all that beauty of veining and texture in the confines of a solid square , of which only the two sides should ever be visible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his precious block into slices : made slabs and shallow surfaces of it , and these he laid , as an outward adornment to his building , upon a substructure of brick or rubble . It is easy to perceive , then , the difference of the problem of the sculptors of the North and the South . The plain , solid Northern building was capable of unlimited enrichment by carving ; this carving , when deeply cut , with forcible projection , acted as a noble embellishment in which the principal feature was a varied play of light and shade ; the stone having little charm of colour or texture in itself , depended for its beauty entirely upon its bold relief , its rounded statuary , and its well shaped chiselled ornament . The shallow surface , already beautiful , both in colour and texture , in the Southern building material , called only for enrichment in low relief : ornament only slightly raised from the level or simply perforating the thin slab of glowing stone on which it was used was the more usual choice of the Italian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to general principles of the art of sculpture ; there is some flat basrelief in the North , and some rounded sculpture in the South : but as a rule the tendencies are as they have just been outlined . Another difference between sculpture in the North and South is due to the fact that in Italy the work was individual , as a rule , and in France it was the labour of a Guild or company . In Italy it is usually known who 216 Arts and Crafts in the Middle Ages was the author of any striking piece of sculpture , while in France it is the exception when a work is signed , or the names of artisans recorded . In Italy , then , each piece was made more with a view to its own display , than as a part of a building , while in France statuary was regarded as an integral part of the architecture , and rows of figures were used as commonly as rows of columns in Italy . It is tragic to think of the personal skill and brilliancy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reputation , while there were undoubtedly among them great art personalities who would have stood equally with the Pisani if they had been recognized . A good deal of flat carving , especially in the interlace and acanthus of Ravenna , was accomplished by commencing with a series of drilled holes , which were afterwards channelled into each other and formed patterns . When the subsequent finish is not particularly delicate , it is quite easy to detect these symmetrical holes , but the effect , under the circumstances , is not objectionable . The process of cutting a bas-relief was generally to outline the whole with an incision , and then cut away the background , leaving the simple elevated flat value , the shape of the proposed design . The modelling was then added by degrees , until the figure looked like half of a rounded object . While it is often unpractical to refer one 's readers to examples of work in far and various countries , and advise them instantly to examine them , it is frequently possible to call attention to well-pro218 Arts and Crafts in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are in nearly every public library . To understand thoroughly the use of the drill in flat sculpture , I wish my readers would refer to Fig. 121 in Mr. Russell Sturgis 's " Artist 's Way of Working , " Vol . II . In a quaint treatise on Belles Lettres in France nearly two centuries ago , by Carlencas , the writer says : " It is to no great purpose to speak of the Gothick sculptures : for everybody knows that they are the works of a rude art , formed in spite of nature and rules : sad productions of barbrous and dull spirits , which disfigure our old churches . " Fie on a Frenchman who could so express himself ! We recall the story of how Viollet le Duc made the people of Paris appreciate the wonderful carvings on Notre Dame . All the rage in France was for Greek and Roman remains , and the people persisted in their adoration of the antique , but would not deign to look nearer home , at their great mediaeval works of art . So the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cathedral , and these were treated so as to look like ancient marble statues ; he then opened an exhibition , purporting to show new discoveries and excavations among antiques . The exhibition was thronged , and every one was deeply interested , expressing the greatest admiration for the marvellously expressive sculptures . Viollet le Duc then admitted what he had done , and confessing that these treasures were to be found in their native city , advised them to pay more attention to the beauties of Gothic art in Paris . // We will not enter into a discussion of the relative merits of Northern and Southern art ; whether the great revival really originated in France or Italy ; but this is certain : Nicolo Pisano lived in the latter half of the thirteenth century , while the great sculptures of Notre Dame , Paris , and those of Chartres , were executed half a century earlier . But prior to either were the Byzantine and Romanesque sculptures in Italy and Southern France . Our attention must first be turned to them . Charles Eliot Norton 's definition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be instanced : " It very nearly corresponds to the term of Romance as applied to language . It signifies the derivation of the main elements , both in plan and construction , from the works of the later Roman Empire . But Romanesque architecture " ( and this applies equally to sculpture ) " was not , as it has been called , a corrupted imitation of the Roman architecture , any more than the Provencal or the Italian language was a corrupted imitation of the Latin . It was a new thing , the slowly matured product of a long period of many influences . " All medieval carving was subordinate to architecture , therefore every piece of carving was designed with a view to being suitable to appear in some special place . The most striking difference between mediaeval and later sculpture is that the latter is designed as a thing apart , an object to be stood anywhere to be admired for its intrinsic merit , instead of being a functional corn220 Arts and Crafts in the Middle Ages ponent in a general scheme for beautifying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all primitive arts is very interesting . It undoubtedly began in an unconscious imitation of local architecture . For instance , in the British Isles , the building in earliest times was with wattles : practically walls of basket work . William of Malmsbury says that Glastonbury was " a mean structure of wattle work , " while of the Monastery of Iona , it is related that in 563 , Columba " sent forth his monks to gather twigs to build his hospice . " British baskets were famous even so far away as Rome . So the first idea of ornament was to copy the interlacing forms . The same idea was worked out synchronously in metal work , and in illuminated books . Carving in stone , wood , and ivory , show the same influence . Debased Roman sculptural forms were used in Italy during the fourth and fifth centuries . Then Justinian introduced the Byzantine which was grafted upon the Roman , producing a characteristic and fascinating though barbaric combination . This was the Romanesque , or Romano-Byzantine , in the North of Italy generally being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period , from the fifth to the thirteenth century , are blunt and heavy , but full of quaint expression due to the elemental and immature conditions of the art . Many of the old Byzantine carvings are to be seen in Italy . The Lombards , when invading Northern Italy , // brought with them a mighty smith , Paul the Deacon , who had much skill with the hammer . When these rude Norsemen , found themselves among the aesthetic treasures of Byzantium , and saw the fair Italian marbles , and the stately work of Theodoric and Justinian , they were inflamed with zeal for artistic expression , and began to hew and carve rough but spirited forms out of the Pisan and Carrara stones . The animals which they sculptured were , as Ruskin has said , " all alive : hungry and fierce , wild , with a life-like spring . " The Byzantine work was quiescent : the designs formal , decent , and monumental . But the Lombards threw into their work their own restless energy , and some of their cruelty and relentlessness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encouraged the arts ; it was because of her appreciative comprehension of such things that St. Gregory sent her the famous Iron Crown , of which a description has been given , on the occasion of the baptism of her son . Under the influence of these subsequently civilized barbarians many of the greatest specimens of carving in North Italy came into being . The most delightful little stumpy saints and sacred emblems may be found on the facade of St. Michele at Pavia , and also at Lucca , and on the Baptistery at Parma . The sculptor who produced these works at Parma was a very interesting craftsman , named Antelami . His Descent from the Cross is one of the most striking pieces of early sculpture before the Pisani . Ile lived in the twelfth century . The figures are of 222 Arts and Crafts in the Middle Ages Byzantine proportions and forms , but have a good deal of grace and suggestion of movement . Among the early names known in Italy is that of Magister Orso , of Verona . Another , in the ninth century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came Guglielmus , who carved the charming naive wild hunting scenes on the portal of St. Zeno of Verona . These reliefs represent Theodoric on horseback , followed by an able company of men and horses which , according to legend , were supplied by the infernal powers . The eyes of these fugitives have much expression , being rendered with a drill , and standing out in the design as little black holes ? fierce and effective . There is a fine round window at St. Zeno at Verona , designed and executed by one Briolottus , which , intended to represent the Wheel of Fortune , is decorated all over with little clinging figures , some falling and some climbing , and has the motto : " I elevate some mortals and depose others : I give good or evil to all : I clothe the naked and . strip the . clothed in me if any one trust he will be turned to derision . " Perhaps the most wonderful carvings on the church of St. Zeno at " Verona are over ' " the arched entrance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are signed by Adaminus . Among the humourous little conceits is a couple of strutting cocks carrying between them a dead fox slung on a rod . Ruskin has characterized the carvings at Verona , especially those on the porch , as being among the best examples of the true function // of flat decorative carving in stone . He says : " The primary condition is that the mass shall be beautifully rounded , and disposed with due discretion and order ; .. sculpture is essentially the production of a pleasant bossiness or roundness of surface . The pleasantness of that boss condition to the eye is irrespective of imitation on one side , and of structure on the other . " The more one considers this statement , the more he is convinced of its comprehensiveness . If the lights and shadows fall pleasantly , how little one stops to inquire , " What is the subject ? Do I consider that horse well proportioned , or do I not ? Is that woman in good drawing ? " Effectiveness is almost independent of detail , except as that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degrees of relief : from flat ( where the ornament is hardly more than incised , and the background planed away ) to a practically solid round figure cut almost entirely free of its ground . In Venice , until the revival in the thirteenth century , the Greek Byzantine influence was marked . There is no more complete storehouse of the art of the East adapted to mediaeval conditions than the Church of St. Mark 's . If space permitted , nothing could be more delightful than to examine in detail these marvellous capitals and archivolts which Ruskin has so lovingly immortalized for English readers . Of all decorative sculpture there is none more satisfying from the ornamental point of view than the Byzantine interlace and vine forms so usual in Venice . The only place where 224 Arts and Crafts in the Middle Ages these may be seen to even greater advantage is Ravenna . The pierced marble screens and capitals , with their restful combinations of interlacing bands and delicate foliate forms , are nowhere surpassed . The use of the acanthus leaf conventionalized in a strictly primitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With these are combined delightful stiff peacocks , and curious bunches of grapes , rosettes , and animal forms of quaint grotesqueness . Such work exemplifies specially what has been said regarding the use of flat thin slabs for sculptural purposes in the South of Europe . Nearly all these carvings are executed in fine marbles and alabasters . The chief works of this period in the round are lions and gryphons supporting columns as at Ancona and Perugia , and many other Italian cities . In Rome there were several sculptors of the name of Peter . One of them , Peter Amabilis , worked about 1197 ; and another , Peter le Orfever , went to England and worked on the tomb of Edward the Confessor at Westminster . In Bologna is an interesting crucifix probably carved in the eighth or ninth century . Christ 's figure is upon the cross and that of his mother stands near . The sculptor was Petrus Albericus . On the cross is an inscription in the form of a dialogue : " My son ? " " What , Mother ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Why do you hang on the cross ? " " That Mankind may not perish . " The Masters of Stone and Wood were among the early Guilds and Corporations of Florence . Charlemagne // patronized this industry and helped to develop it . Of craftsmen in these two branches exclusive of master builders , and recognize artists , there were , in 1299 , about a hundred and for ? - six members of the Guild . Italy was backward for a good while in the progress of art , for while great activities were going on in the North , the Doge of Venice in 976 was obliged to import artists from Constantinople to decorate St. Mark 's church . The tombs of this early period in Italy , as elsewhere , are significant and beautiful . Recumbent figures , with their hands devoutly pressed together , are usually seen , lying sometimes on couches and sometimes under architectural canopies . The first great original Italian sculptor of the Renaissance was Nicola Pisano . He lived through almost the whole of the thirteenth century , being born about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early influences of Nicola Pisano , that helped to make him so much more more modern , more truly classic , than any of his age ? In the first place , he was born at the moment when interest in ancient art was beginning to awaken ; the early thirteenth century . In the Campo Santo of Pisa may be seen two of the most potent factors in his aesthetic education , the Greek sarcophagus on which was carved the Hunting of Meleager , and the Greek urn with Bacchic figures wreathing it in classic symmetry . With his mind tuned to the beautiful , the boy Nicola gazed at the work of genuine pagan Greek artists , 226 Arts and Crafts in the Middle Ages who knew the sinuousness of the human form and the joy of living with no thought of the morrow . These joyous pagan elements , grafted on solemn religious surroundings and influences , combined to produce his peculiar genius . Basing his early endeavours on these specimens of genuine classical Greek art , there resulted his wonderful pulpits at Pisa and Siena , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beauty . His work was a marked departure from the Byzantine and Romanesque work which constituted Italian sculpture up to that period . An examination of his designs and methods proves his immense originality . By profession he was an architect . Of his pulpit in Siena Charles Eliot Norton speaks with much appreciation . Alluding to the lions used as bases to its columns , he says : " These are the first realistic representations of living animals which the mediaeval revival of art has produced ; and in vivacity and energy of rendering , and in the thoroughly artistic treatment of leonine spirit and form , they have never been surpassed . " It is usually claimed that one may learn much of the rise of Gothic sculpture by studying the models in the South Kensington Museum . In a foot-note to such a statement in a book edited by Ruskin , the indignant editor has observed , " You can not do anything of the kind . Pisan sculpture can only be studied in the original marble : half its virtue is in the chiselling ! " Nicola @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dominic at Bologna by one Fra Guglielmo Agnelli , a monk of // a very pious turn , who , nevertheless , committed a curious theft , which was never discovered until his own death-bed confession . Ile absconded with a bone of St. Dominic , which he kept for private devotions all his subsequent life ! An old chronicler says , naively : " If piety can absolve from theft , Fra Guglielmo is to be praised , though never to be imitated . " Andrea Pisano was Nicola 's greatest scholar , though not his son . He took the name of his piaster after the medieaval custom . His work was largely ill bronze , and the earlier gates of the Baptistery in Florence are by him . We have already alluded to the later gates by Ghiberti , when speaking of bronze . Andrea had the honour to teach the celebrated Orcagna , ? more painter than sculptor , ? whose most noted work in this line was the Tabernacle at Or San Michele . Among the loveliest of the figures sculptured by the Pisani are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pulpit at Pistoja , the work of Giovanni . Among Nicola 's pupils were his son Giovanni , Donatello , Arnolfo di Cambio , and Lorenzo Maitani , who executed the delightful sculptures on the facade of the Cathedral of Orvieto , ? perhaps the most interesting set of bas-reliefs in detail of the Early Renaissance , although in general symmetrical " bossiness " of effect , so much approved by Ruskin , they are very uneven . In this respect they come rather under the head of realistic than of decorative art . Lorenzo Maitani was a genuine leader of his guild of craftsmen , and superintended the large body of architects 228 Arts and Crafts in the Middle Ages who worked at Orvieto , stone masons , mosaicists , bronze founders , painters , and minor workmen . He lived until 1330 , and practically devoted his life to Orvieto . It is uncertain whether any of the Pisani were employed in any capacity , although for a time it was popularly supposed that the four piers on the facade were their work . An iconographic description of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one or two features of special interest should be noted : the little portrait relief of the master Maitani himself occurs on the fourth pier , among the Elect in heaven , wearing his workman 's cap and carrying his architect 's square . Only his head and shoulders can be seen at the extreme left of the second tier of sculptures . In accordance with an early tradition , that Virgil was in some wise a prophet , and that he had foretold the coming of Christ , he is here introduced , on the second pier , near the base , crowned with laurel . The incident of the cutting off of the servant 's ear , by Peter , is positively entertaining . Peter is sawing away industriously at the offending member ; a fisherman ought to understand a more deft use of the knife ! In the scenes of the Creation , depicted on the first pier , Maitani has proved himself a real nature lover in the tender way he has demonstrated the joy of the birds at finding the use of their wings . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was rather a process than an art to decorate a building with carvings as the Gauls did ! But the latent race talent was there ; as soon as the Romanesque and // Byzantine influences were felt , a definite school of sculpture was formed in France ; almost at once they seized on the best elements of the craft and abandoned the worthless , and the great note of a national art was struck in the figures at Chartres , Paris , Rheims , and other cathedrals of the Ile de France . Prior to this flowering of art in Northern France , the churches of the South of France developed a charming Romanesque of their own , a little different from that in Italy . A monk named Tutilon , of the monastery of St. Gall , was among the most famous sculptors of the Romanesque period . Another name is that of Hughes , Abbot of Montier-en-Der . At the end of the tenth century one Morard , under the patronage of King Robert , built and ornamented the Church of St. Germain des Pres , Paris , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the head of the works of forty monasteries . Guillaume probably had almost as wide an influence upon French art as St. Bernward had on the German , or Nicola Pisano on that of Italy . In Metz were two noted architects , Adelard and Gontran , who superintended the building of fourteen churches , and an early chronicler says that the expense was so great that " the imperial treasury would scarce have sufficed for it . " At Arles are two of the most famous monuments of Romanesque art , the porches of St. Trophime , and of St. Gilles . The latter exhibits almost classical feeling and influence ; the former is much blunter and more Byzantine ; both are highly interesting for purposes 230 Arts and Crafts in the Middle Ages of study , being elaborately ornamented with figure sculptures and other decorative motives . Abbot Suger , the art-craftsman par excellence of the Ile de France , was the sculptor in chief of St. Denis from 1137 to 1180 . This magnificent facade is harmonious in its treatment , betokening plainly that one brain conceived and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the minor architects and sculptors who were employed , but doubtless they were the scholars and followers of Suger , and rendered work in a similar manner . There are some names which have been handed down from early times in Normandy : one Otho , another Gamier , and a third , Anquetil , while a crucifix carved by Auquilinus of Moissac was popularly believed to have been created by divine means . If one will compare the statues of St. Trophime of Arles with those at St. Denis , it will be found that the latter are better rounded , those at St. Trophime being coarsely blocked out ; although at first glance one would say that there was little to choose between them . The old font at Amiens is very ancient , older than the church . It is seven feet long , and stands on short square piers : it resembles a stone coffin , and was apparently so made that a grown person might be baptized by immersion , by lying at full length . Angels holding scrolls are carved at its four corners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancient Byzantine crucifix at Amiens , on which the figure of Our Lord is fully draped , and on his // head is a royal crown instead of thorns . The figure , too , is erect , as if to invite homage by its outstretched arms , instead of suggesting that the arms had to bear the weight of the body . Indeed , it is a Christ triumphant and regnant though crucified ? a very unusual treatment of the subject in the Middle Ages . It was brought from the East , in all probability , by a returning warrior from the Crusades . The foundation of Chartres was very early : the first Bishop St. Aventin occupied his see as early as 200 A. D. The early Gothic type in figure sculpture is always characterized by a few features in common , though different districts produced varying forms and facial expressions . The figures are always narrow , and much elongated , from a monumental sentiment which governed the design of the period . The influence of the Caryatid may have remained in the consciousness of later artists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as expedient to the proportions of the columns which stood behind them and supported them . In any case , it was considered an indispensable condition that these proportions should be maintained , and has come to be regarded as an architectural necessity . As soon as sculptors began to consider their figures as realistic representations of human beings instead of ornamental motives in their buildings , the art declined , and poor results followed . The west porch of Chartres dates from the twelfth century . The church was injured by fire in 1194 . In 232 Arts and Crafts in the Middle Ages 1226 certain restorations were made , and an old chronicle says that at that time it was quite fire-proof , remarking : " It has nothing to fear from any earthly fire from this time to the day of Judgment , and will save from fires eternal the many Christians who by their alms have helped in its rebuilding . " The whole edifice was consecrated by St. Louis on Oct. 17 , 1260 . The King gave the north porch , and several of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this impressive function . About the time of William the Conqueror it became customary to carve effigies on tombstones , at first simple figures in low relief lying on flat slabs : this idea being soon elaborated , however , into canopied tombs , which grew year by year more ornate , until Gothic structures enriched with finials and crockets began to be erected in churches to such an extent that the interior of the edifice was quite filled with these dignified little buildings . In many instances it is quite impossible to obtain ar ; view of the sanctuary except looking directly down the central aisle ; the whole ambulatory is often one continuous succession of exquisite sepulchral monuments . Perhaps the most satisfying monument of French Gothic style is the tomb of the elder son of St. Louis at St. Denis . The majesty of the recumbent figure is striking , but the little procession of mourners about the main body of the tomb is absolutely unrivalled in art of this character . The device of little weeping figures // surrounding the lower part of a tomb is also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aymer de Valence in Westminster . Some interesting saints are carved on the north portal of Amiens , among others , St. Ulpha , a virgin who is chiefly renowned for having lived in a chalk cave near Amiens , where she was greatly annoyed by frogs . Undaunted , she prayed so lustily and industriously , that she finally succeeded in silencing there ! The thirteenth century revival in France was really a new birth ; almost more than a Renaissance . It is a question among archaeologists if France was not really more original and more brilliant than Italy in this respect . A glance at such figures as the Virgin from the Gilded Portal at Amiens , and another Virgin from the same cathedral , will show the change which came over the spirit of art in that one city during the thirteenth century . The figure on the right door of the western facade is a work of the early part of the century . She is grave and dignified in bearing , her hand extended in favour , while the Child gives the blessing in calm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receiving homage , and bestowing grace : it is conventional and monumental . The Virgin from the Gilded Portal is of a later generation . Her attention is given to the Child , and her aspect is human and spirited , ? almost merry . It may be said to be less religious than the other statue , but it is filled with more modern grace and charm , and glorifies the idea of happy maternity : every angle and 234 Arts and Crafts in the Middle Ages fold of the drapery is full of life and action without being over realistic . There is much in common between this pleasing statue and the Virgins of the Pisani in Italy . Professor Moore considers the statue of the Virgin on the Portal of the Virgin at the west end of Notre Dame in Paris as about the best example of Gothic figure sculpture in France . He says further that the finest statues in portals of any age are those of the north porch at Paris . The Virgin here is marvellously fine also . It combines the dignity and monumental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the living buoyancy of the Virgin on the Gilded Portal . It is the clear result of a study of nature grafted on Byzantine traditions . It dates from 1250 . While sculpture was practised chiefly by monastic artists , it retained the archaic and traditional elements . When trained carvers from secular life began to take the chisel , the spirit of the world entered in . For a time this was a marked improvement : later the pendulum swung too far , and decadence set in . A favourite device on carved tympana above portals was the Last Judgment . Michael with the scales , engaged in weighing souls , was the tall central figure , and the two depressed saucers of the scales help considerably in filling the triangular space usually left over a Gothic doorway . At Chartres , there is an example of this subject , in which Mortal Sin , typified by a devil and two toads , are being weighed against the soul of a departed hero . As is customary in such compositions , // a little devil is seen pulling on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested ! One of the most cheerful and delightful figures at Chartres is that of the very tall angel holding a sun dial , on the corner of the South tower . A certain optimistic inconsequence is his chief characteristic , as if he really believed that the hours bore more of happiness than of sorrow to the world . There is no limit to the originality and the symbolic messages of the Gothic grotesques . Two whole books might be written upon this subject alone to do it justice ; but a few notable instances of these charming little adornments to the stern structures of the Middle Ages must be noticed here . The little medallions at Amiens deserve some attention . They represent the Virtues and Vices , the Follies , and other ethical qualities . Some of them deal with Scriptural scenes . " Churlishness " is figured by a woman kicking over her cup-bearer . Apropos of her attitude , Ruskin observes that the final forms of French churlishness are to be discovered in the feminine gestures in the can-can . He adds : " See the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed little ! One of these Amiens reliefs , signifying " Rebellion , " is that of a man snapping his fingers at his bishop ! Another known as " Atheism " is variously interpreted . A man is seen stepping out of his shoes at the church porch . Ruskin explains this as meaning that the infidel is shown in contradistinction to the faithful who is su Arts and Crafts in the Middle Ages posed to have " his feet shod with the preparation of the Gospel of Peace ; " but Abbe Roze thinks it more likely that this figure represents an unfrocked monk abandoning the church . One of these displays the beasts in Nineveh , and a little squat monkey , developing into a devil , is wittily characterized by Ruskin as reversing the Darwinian theory . The statues above these little quatrefoils are over seven feet in height , differing slightly , and evidently portrait sculptures inspired by living models , adapted to their more austere use in this situation . A quiet and inconspicuous example of exquisite refinement in Gothic bas-relief is to be seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cathedral in Rouen . This doorway was built in 1278 by Jean Davi , who must have been one of the first sculptors of his time . The medallions are a series of little grotesques , some of them ineffably entertaining , and others expressive of real depth of knowledge and thought . Ruskin has eulogized some of these little figures : one as having in its eye " the expression which is never seen but in the eye of a dog gnawing something in jest , and preparing to start away with it . " Again , he detects a wonderful piece of realism and appreciative work in the face of a man who leans with his head on his hand in thought : the wrinkles pushed up under his eye are especially commended . In the south transept at Amiens is a piece of elaboSculpture // rate sculpture in four compartments , which are the figures of many saints . There is a legend in connection with those figures : when the millers were about to select a patron saint , they agreed to choose the saint on whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should alight ; but as the bird elected to settle on the head of a demon , they abandoned their plan ! The figures in these carvings are almost free of the ground ; they appear to be a collection of separate statuettes , the scenes being laid in three or four planes . It is not restrained bas-relief ; but the effect is extremely rich . The sculptures in high relief , but in more conventional proportion than these , which occur on the dividing wall between the choir and the north aisle , are thoroughly satisfactory . They are coloured ; they were executed in 1531 , and they represent scenes in the life of the Baptist . In the panel where Salome is portrayed as dancing , a grave little monkey is seen watching her from under the table . The similar screen surrounding the sanctuary at Paris was the work of the chief cathedral architect , Jean Renoy , with whom worked his nephew , Jehan le Bouteiller . These stone carved screens are quite usual in the Ile de France . The finest are at Chartres @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole choir being fenced in , as it were , about the apse , by this exquisite work . This screen is more effective , too , for being left in the natural colour of the stone : where these sculptures are painted , as they usually are , they suggest wood carvings , and have 238 Arts and Crafts in the Middle Ages not as much dignity as when the stone is fully recognized . The Door of St. Marcel has the oldest carving on Notre Dame in Paris . The plate representing the iron work , in Chapter IV. , shows the carving on this portal , which is the same that has Biscornette 's famous hinges . The central figure of St. Marcel himself presents the saint in the act of reproving a naughty dragon which had had the indiscretion to devour the body of a rich but wicked lady . The dragon is seen issuing from the dismantled tomb of this unfortunate person . The dragon repented his act , when the saint had finished admonishing him , and showed his attachment and gratitude for thus being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for four miles , apparently walking much as a seal would walk , beseeching the saint to forgive him . But Marcel was firm , and punished the serpent , saying to him : " Go forth and inhabit the deserts or plunge thyself into the sea ; " and , as St. Patrick rid the Celtic land of snakes , so St. Marcel seems to have banished dragons from fair France . At Chartres there are eighteen hundred statues , and almost as many at Amiens and at Rheims and Paris . One reason for the superiority of French figure sculpture in the thirteenth century , over that existing in other countries , is that the French used models . There has been preserved the sketch book of a mediaeval French architect , Vilard de Honcourt , which is filled // with studies from life : and why should we suppose him to be the only one who worked in this way ? Rheims Cathedral is the Mecca of the student of mediaeval sculpture . The array of statues on the exterior is amazing , and a walk around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other grotesques , hidden at all heights , each a veritable work of art , repaying the closest study , and inviting the enthusiast to undue extravagance at a shop in the vicinity , which advertises naively , that it is an " Artistical Photograph Laboratory . " On the door of St. Germain l'Auxerrois in Paris , there is a portrait statue of St. Genevieve , holding a lighted candle , while " the devil in little " sits on her shoulder , exerting himself to blow it out ! It is quite a droll conceit of the thirteenth century . Of the leaf forms in Gothic sculpture , three styles are enough to generalize about . The early work usually represented springlike leaves , clinging , half-developed , and buds . Later , a more luxuriant foliage was attempted : the leaves and stalks were twisted , and the style was more like that actually seen in nature . Then came an overblown period , when the leaves were positively detached , and the style was lost . The foliage was no longer integral , but was applied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exploited in dealing with the sculptors in the Middle Ages . Until the days of the Renaissance individual artists were scarcely recognized ; master masons employed " ; m240 Arts and Crafts in the Middle Ages agers " as casually as we would employ brick-layers or plasterers ; and no matter how brilliant the work , it was all included in the general term " building . " The first piece of signed sculpture in France is a tympanum in the south transept at Paris , representing the Stoning of Stephen . It is by Jean de Chelles , in 1257 . St. Louis of France was a patron of arts , and took much interest in his sculptors . There were two Jean de Montereau , who carved sacred subjects in quite an extraordinary way . Jean de Soignoles , in 1359 , was designated as " Macon et Ymageur . " One of the chief " imageurs , " as they were called , was Jacques Haag , who flourished in the latter half of the fifteenth century , in Amiens . This artist was imprisoned for sweating coin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ executed large statues for the city gates , of St. Michael and St. Firmin , in 1464 and 1489 . There was a sculptor in Paris in the fourteenth century , one Hennequin de Liege , who made several tombs in black and white marble , among them that of Blanche de France , and the effigy of Queen Philippa at Westminster . It was customary both in France and England to use colour on Gothic architecture . It is curious to realize that the facade of Notre Dame in Paris was originally a great colour scheme . A literary relic , the " Voyage of an Armenian Bishop , " named Martyr , in the year 1490 , alludes to the beauty of this cathedral of Paris , as being ablaze with gold and colour . An old record of the screen of the chapel of St. Andrew
