txt The Grand Jury of Hancock County to-day brought in 939 indictments against the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey , the Ohio Oil Company , the Solar Refining Company . the Buckeye Pipe Line Company , the Manhattan Oil Company , the Standard Oil Company of Ohio , John D. Rockefeller , William Rockefeller . Henry H. Rogers , John D. Archbold . Wesley H. Tilford , Frank Q. Barstow , and F. T. Cuthbert . The indictments charge them with being members of a trust for the following pur-poses : " To prevent competition in the manufacturing , making , transportation , sale , and purchase of petroleum and its products within the County of Hancock aforesaid , to fix at a certain common standard figure the price of said commodity and its products , whereby its price to the consumer is controlled and established in such a manner as to directly preclude a free and unrestrained competition among themselves in transporting , selling , purchasing , manufacturing , and making petroleum and its products within the County of Hancock aforesaid contrary to law . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cases now being brought against the Standard Oil Company . The fines and costs involved exceed $6O,000,00 . The bringing of these cases has been in Prosecutor David 's mind ? for several months . He said to-night that the preceding t ases had been skirmishes ' to find where he was at . Cases of this description are new in Ohio procedure , and there are no precedents to go , by . Prosecutor David was anxious to get started right before the cases were carried to the highest tribunal in Ohio , the Supreme Court . Another reason he assigns for holding off until this time is on account of the new salary law . Under the old practice the costs , if the State is victorious , would have gone to county officials , principally Clerk Alspach and Sheriff Groves . Under the new law the costs will go to the county . The officials are now-under a salary and get no more for the extra work Foreman Daniel Jackson and Prosecutor David have been busy for the past two days signing the indictments . There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 492,975 words in the 939 Indictments . The serving of the papers will be started to-morrow by Sheriff Groves and Deputy Johns . It is thought that the men indicted will come to Findlay voluntarily and not evade arrest , as in the last case . John . D. Rockefeller has already given his word to come to Findlay when wanted for trial . Nearly every member of the Grand Jury was a wealthy man , either a farmer or a merchant , and it is said that there was no hesitancy ' on the part of any member in voting for the indictments . The case was brought before the jury on Jan. 9 , and was under consideration for two days . Much more is involved in these cases than in any of the preceding ones , and new defendants are brought into the case , including the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey and the New York officials . Prosecutor David nollied the indictments brought by the last Grand Jury on account of an alleged technicality set up by tae Standard Oil Company 's attorneys . Prosecutor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ease goes to the jury , to have every deal or the papers correct , so that the cases can be tried on their merits , and not be thrown down on account of some minor irregularity . I do not know whether the point raised by the Standard attorneys would have bgen upheld or not , but I determined to risk no delay or loss to the county by having the cases decided adversely . " In regard to the indictments returned to-day the Standard attorneys at the trial claimed that the cases could not be brought before the Probate Court on Information . but must be brought before the Common Pleas Court on Indictments ; also that each day constituted a separate offense , and not one single offense could be claimed as extending over the entire term . claiming that the company and its officers could not be charged with a continuous crime . I have accommodated them in every particular . I have brought the case before the Common Pleas Court . and . instead of making one case cover the matter with a few thousand in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to oblige them with fines and costs that if found guilty will aggregate over $60 , - 000.000. ' - Prosecutor David wants the cases brought to trial immediately , and it is probable that the trials will begin some time in February . although that is problematical , as the defendants ' attorneys may impose some objections that will cause delay .
