txt WASHINGTON , April ** the close of a long day spent on District of Columbia matters the House took up a bill to which there were many amendments . Some of them aroused opposition , and at last Mr. Fitzgerald raised the point of no quorum just as the Speaker was about to call for a vote . Several appeals were made to him to withhold his point until certain particular things could be done , and finally he withdrew it altogether . Then Uncle Joe put the question on the pending amendment . There was a chorus of ayes and one or two noes . " The ayes seem to have it , " said Uncle Joe , " the ayes have it and the amendment is not agreed to . " A ripple of laughter ran around the House , and the desk clerk told the Speaker what he had said . Bang went the gavel , and Uncle Joe made this explanation : " The Chair , as is usual when he do n't guard his tongue , has got the wrong horse before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity for John Wesley Gaines . He flourished like a green bay tree to-day , and butted in every other two minutes for three or four hours on end . At last he enunciated a proposition worthy of the esteemed Mr. Euclid himself . He was objecting to the proposal to permit juries for the condemnation of property for public uses to consist of less than twelve men . " I say in all candor and with as much seriousness as I can command , " he shouted , shaking his clenched fists at the lofty ceiling , " that if there is any virtue in twelve It is twelve times more than one . " The bill was up extending to the Capitol the provisions of the . law prohibiting child labor in the District , and Mr. Madden of Chicago was advocating it . His colleague , Mr. Wharton , also of Chicago , the youthful member to whom John Sharp Williams explained on the first day of the session what he meant by the " kids " of the House , was much interested , and kept moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he got fairly in front of his white-haired friend who was speaking . Just then Mr. Madden said : " I believe that many of the children on the floor of this House ought to be under the guardianship of their parents . " Thereupon Wharton lost interest and departed to the cloakroom . The Superior English Girl . Dr. WinnIngton-Jugram , in addressing the Girls ' Diocesan Association in London the other day , said that there were three reasons why the English girl was superior to her foreign sisters , which , according to the report of the address in The London Express , were as follows : " It is to the sister that a boy turns in trouble , and the whole world would be disappointed If it went to girls and found them without faith . " Secondly , the world looks to my hearers to find hope in them . Hope is one of the strongest influences in the world , and hopeful people can change life for many men and women . Closely connected with hope is purity of character . If a girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or that man to whom she isIthe ideal of what a woman sDould be , then cral3h go all their hope and strength and inspiration . " Thirdly , girls , concluded the Bishop , were looked to to produce the fruits of love  --  the love which would take in the unattractive and the ugly , and which would brave sordid surroundings .
