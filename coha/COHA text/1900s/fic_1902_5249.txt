KINGSLEY Registered at Stationers ' Hall , London , England PRINTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA Hour-Glass Stories Edition . Published March , 1902 * * * * * CHAPTER ONE Miss Philura Rice tied her faded bonnet-strings under her faded chin with hands that trembled a little ; then she leaned forward and gazed anxiously at the reflection which confronted her . A somewhat pinched and wistful face it was , with large , light-lashed blue eyes , arched over with a mere pretense at eyebrows . More than once in her twenties Miss Philura had ventured to eke out this scanty provision of Nature with a modicum of burned match stealthily applied in the privacy of her virgin chamber . But the twenties , with their attendant dreams and follies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one knew exactly  --  Miss Philura never informed the curious on this point . As for the insufficient eyebrows , they symbolized , as it were , a meagre and restricted life , vaguely acknowledged as the dispensation of an obscurely hostile but consistent Providence ; a Providence far too awful and exalted  --  as well as hostile  --  to interest itself benignantly in so small and neutral a personality as stared back at her from the large , dim mirror of Cousin Maria Van Deuser 's third-story back bedroom . Not that Miss Philura ever admitted such dubious thoughts to the select circle of her conscious reflections ; more years ago than she cared to count she had grappled with her discontent , had thrust it resolutely out of sight , and on the top of it she had planted a big stone marked Resignation . Nevertheless , at times the stone heaved and trembled ominously. * * * * * At sound of a brisk tap at her chamber door the lady turned with a guilty start to find the fresh-colored , impertinent face of the French maid obtruding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " announced this individual , and with a coldly comprehensive eye swept the small figure from head to foot . " Yes , yes , my dear , I am quite ready  --  I am coming at once ! " faltered Miss Philura , with a propitiatory smile , and more than ever painfully aware that the skirt of her best black gown was irremediably short and scant , that her waist was too flat , her shoulders too sloping , her complexion faded , her forehead wrinkled , and her bonnet unbecoming . As she stepped uncertainly down the dark , narrow stairway she rebuked herself severely for these vain and worldly thoughts . " To be a church member , in good and regular standing , and a useful member of society , " she assured herself strenuously , " should be and is sufficient for me . " Ten minutes later , Miss Philura , looking smaller and more insignificant than usual , was seated in the carriage opposite Mrs. J. Mortimer Van Deuser  --  a large , heavily upholstered lady of majestic deportment , paying diligent heed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her hostess and kinswoman . " During your short stay in Boston , " that lady was remarking impressively , " you will , of course , wish to avail yourself of those means of culture and advancement so sadly lacking in your own environment . This , my dear Philura , is pre-eminently the era of progressive thought . We can have at best , I fear , but a faint conception of the degree to which mankind will be able , in the years of the coming century , to shake off the gross and material limitations of sense . " Mrs. Van Deuser paused to settle her sables preliminary to recognizing with an expansive smile an acquaintance who flashed by them in a victoria ; after which she adjusted the diamonds in her large , pink ears , and proceeded with unctuous tranquillity . " On this occasion , my dear Philura , you will have the pleasure of listening to an address by Mrs. B. Isabelle Smart , one of our most advanced thinkers along this line . You will , I trust , be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire trend of your individual experience . " " Where  --  in what place will the lady speak  --  I mean , will it be in the church ? " ventured Miss Philura in a depressed whisper . She sighed apprehensively as she glanced down at the tips of her shabby gloves . " The lecture will take place in the drawing-room of the Woman 's Ontological Club , " responded Mrs. Van Deuser , adding with austere sweetness of tone : " The club deals exclusively with those conceptions or principles which lie at the base of all phenomena ; including being , reality , substance , time , space , motion , change , identity , difference , and cause  --  in a word , my dear Philura , with ultimate metaphysical philosophy . " A majestic and conclusive sweep of a perfectly gloved hand suggested infinity and reduced Miss Philura into shrinking silence . * * * * * When Mrs. B. Isabelle Smart began to speak she became almost directly aware of a small , wistful face , with faded blue eyes and a shabby , unbecoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sides by tossing plumes , rich velvets and sparkling gems , with their accompaniments of full-fleshed , patrician countenances , took to itself a look of positive distinction . Mrs. Smart 's theme , as announced by the President of the Ontological Club , was Thought Forces and the Infinite , a somewhat formidable-sounding subject , but one which the pale , slight , plainly dressed but singularly bright-eyed lady , put forward as the speaker of the afternoon , showed no hesitancy in attacking . Before three minutes had passed Miss Philura Rice had forgotten that such things as shabby gloves , ill-fitting gowns , unbecoming bonnets and superfluous birthdays existed . In ten minutes more she was leaning forward in breathless attention , the faded eyes aglow , the unbecoming bonnet pushed back from a face more wistful than ever , but flushed with a joyful excitement . * * * * * " This unseen Good hems us about on every side , " the speaker was saying , with a comprehensive sweep of her capable-looking hands . " It presses upon us , more limitless , more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Out of it every need , every want , every yearning of humanity can be , must be , supplied . To you , who have hitherto led starved lives , hungering , longing for the good things which you believe a distant and indifferent God has denied you  --  to you I declare that in this encircling , ever-present , invisible , exhaustless Beneficence is already provided a lavish abundance of everything which you can possibly want or think ! Nay , desire itself is but God  --  Good  --  Love , knocking at the door of your consciousness . It is impossible for you to desire anything that is not already your own ! It only remains for you to bring the invisible into visibility  --  to take of the everlasting substance what you will ! " And how must you do this ? Ask , and believe that you have ! You have asked many times , perhaps , and have failed to receive . Why ? You have failed to believe . Ask , then , for what you will ! Ask , and at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asking and believing is the thing itself made manifest . Declare that it is yours ! Expect it ! Believe it ! Hold to it without wavering  --  no matter how empty your hands may seem ! It is yours , and God 's infinite creation shall lapse into nothingness ; His stars shall fall from high Heaven like withered leaves sooner than that you shall fail to obtain all that you have asked ! " When , at the close of the lecture , Mrs. B. Isabelle Smart became the center of a polite yet insistent crush of satins , velvets and broadcloths , permeated by an aroma of violets and a gentle hum of delicate flattery , she was aware of a timid hand upon her arm , and turned to look into the small , eager face under the unfashionable bonnet . " You  --  you meant religious gifts , did you not ? " faltered the faint , discouraged voice ; " faith , hope and  --  and  --  the  --  the being resigned to God 's will , and  --  and endeavoring to bear the cross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I meant everything that you want , " answered the bright-eyed one with deliberate emphasis , the bright eyes softening as they took in more completely the pinched outlines and the eager child 's look shining from out the worn and faded woman 's face . " But  --  but there is so much ! I  --  I never had anything that I really wanted  --  things , you know , that one could hardly mention in one 's prayers . " " Have them now . Have them all . God is all . All is God . You are God 's . God is yours ! " Then the billowing surges of silk and velvet swept the small , inquiring face into the background with the accustomed ease and relentlessness of billowing surges . Having partaken copiously of certain " material beliefs " consisting of salads and sandwiches , accompanied by divers cups of strong coffee , Mrs. J. Mortimer Van Deuser had become pleasantly flushed and expansive . " A most unique , comprehensive and uplifting view of our spiritual environment , " she remarked to Miss Philura @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her best society smile still lingered blandly about the curves and creases of her stolid , high-colored visage ; the dying violets on her massive satin bosom gave forth their sweetest parting breath . The little lady on the front seat of the carriage sat very erect ; red spots glowed upon her faded cheeks . " I think , " she said tremulously , " that it was just  --  wonderful ! I  --  I am so very happy to have heard it . Thank you a thousand times , dear Cousin Maria , for taking me . " Mrs. Van Deuser raised her gold-rimmed glasses and settled them under arching brows , while the society smile faded quite away . " Of course , " she said coldly , " one should make due and proper allowance for facts  --  as they exist . And also  --  er  --  consider above all what interpretation is best suited to one 's individual station in life . Truth , my dear Philura , adapts itself freely to the needs of the poor and lowly as well as to the demands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and position ; our dear Master Himself spoke of the poor as always with us , you will remember . A lowly but pious life , passed in humble recognition of God 's chastening providence , is doubtless good and proper for many worthy persons . " * * * * * Miss Philura 's blue eyes flashed rebelliously for perhaps the first time in uncounted years . She made no answer . As for the long and presumably instructive homily on the duties and prerogatives of the lowly , lasting quite up to the moment when the carriage stopped before the door of Mrs. Van Deuser 's residence , it fell upon ears which heard not . Indeed , her next remark was so entirely irrelevant that her august kinswoman stared in displeased amazement . " I am going to purchase some  --  some necessaries to-morrow , Cousin Maria ; I should like Fifine to go with me . " Miss Philura acknowledged to herself , with a truthfulness which she felt to be almost brazen , that her uppermost yearnings were of a wholly mundane character . During a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desires ; by bedtime she had even ventured  --  with the aid of a stubbed lead-pencil  --  to indite the most immediate and urgent of these wants as they knocked at the door of her consciousness . The list , hidden guiltily away in the depths of her shabby purse , read something as follows : " I wish to be beautiful and admired . I want two new dresses ; a hat with plumes , and a silk petticoat that rustles . I want some new kid gloves and a feather boa ( a long one made of ostrich feathers ) . I wish  --   --  " The small , blunt pencil had been lifted in air for the space of three minutes before it again descended ; then , with cheeks that burned , Miss Philura had written the fateful words : " I wish to have a lover and to be married . " " There , I have done it ! " she said to herself , her little fingers trembling with agitation . " He must already exist in the encircling Good . He is mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment ! " To lay this singular memorandum before her Maker appeared to Miss Philura little short of sacrilegious ; but the thought of the mysterious Abundance of which the seeress had spoken , urging itself , as it were , upon her acceptance , encouraged her . She arose from her evening orisons with a glowing face . " I have asked , " she said aloud , " and I believe I shall have . " * * * * * Mademoiselle Fifine passed a very enjoyable morning with Miss Philura . To choose , to purchase , and above all to transform the ugly into the beautiful , filled the French woman 's breast with enthusiasm . Her glance , as it rested upon her companion 's face and figure , was no longer coldly critical , but cordially appreciative . " Ze madame , " she declared , showing her white teeth in a pleasant smile , " has very many advantage . Voila , ze hair  --  c'est admirable , as any one may perceive ! Pardon , while for one little minute I arrange ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The two were at this moment in a certain millinery shop conducted by a discreet and agreeable compatriot of Fifine 's . This individual now produced a modest hat of black , garnished with plumes , which , set lightly on the loosened bands of golden-brown hair , completed the effect " delicieusement ! " declared the French women in chorus . With a beating heart Miss Philura stared into the mirror at her changed reflection . " It is quite  --  quite true ! " she said aloud . " It is all true . " Fifine and the milliner exchanged delighted shrugs and grimaces . In truth , the small , erect figure , in its perfectly fitting gown , bore no resemblance to the plain , elderly Miss Philura of yesterday . As for the face beneath the nodding plumes , it was actually radiant  --  transfigured  --  with joy and hope . Mrs. J. Mortimer Van Deuser regarded the apparition which greeted her at luncheon with open disapproval . This new Miss Philura , with the prettily flushed cheeks , the bright eyes , the fluff of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fragrant violets at her breast , had given her an unpleasant shock of surprise . " I am sure I hope you can afford all this , " was her comment , with a deliberate adjustment of eyebrows and glasses calculated to add mordant point and emphasis to her words . " Oh , yes , " replied Miss Philura tranquilly , but with heightened color ; " I can afford whatever I like now . " Mrs. Van Deuser stared hard at her guest . She found herself actually hesitating before Philura Rice . Then she drew her massive figure to its full height , and again bent the compelling light of her gold-rimmed glasses full upon the small person of her kinswoman . " What  --  er  --  I do not understand , " she began lamely . " Where did you obtain the money for all this ! " Miss Philura raised her eyebrows ever so little  --  somehow they seemed to suit the clear blue eyes admirably today . " The money ? " she repeated , in a tone of surprise . " Why , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that she had drawn out and expended in a single morning nearly the whole of the modest sum commonly made to supply her meager living for six months Miss Philura bestowed but a single thought . " In the all-encircling Good , " she said to herself serenely , " there is plenty of money for me ; why , then , should I not spend this ? " CHAPTER TWO The village of Innisfield was treated to a singular surprise on the Sunday morning following , when Miss Philura Rice , newly returned from her annual visit to Boston , walked down the aisle to her accustomed place in the singers ' seat . Whispered comment and surmise flew from pew to pew , sandwiched irreverently between hymn , prayer and sermon . Indeed , the last-mentioned portion of the service , being of unusual length and dullness , was utilized by the female members of the congregation in making a minute inventory of the amazing changes which had taken place in the familiar figure of their townswoman . " Philury 's had money left her , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's been fixin ' her up ; " " She 's a-goin ' to be married ! " were some of the opinions , wholly at variance with the text of the discourse , which found their way from mouth to mouth . Miss Electa Pratt attached herself with decision to her friend , Miss Rice , directly the service was at an end . " I 'm just dying to hear all about it ! " she exclaimed , with a fond pressure of the arm linked within her own  --  this after the two ladies had extricated themselves from the circle of curious and critical faces at the church door . Miss Philura surveyed the speaker with meditative eyes ; it seemed to her that Miss Pratt was curiously altered since she had seen her last . " Have you had a fortune left you ? " went on her inquisitor , blinking enviously at the nodding plumes which shaded Miss Philura 's blue eyes . " Everybody says you have ; and that you are going to get married soon . I 'm sure you 'll tell me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I have n't exactly had money left me , " she began ; then her eyes brightened . " I have all that I need , " she said , and straightened her small figure confidently . " And are you going to be married , dear ? " " Yes , " said Miss Philura distinctly . " Well , I never  --  Philura Rice ! " almost screamed her companion . " Do tell me when ; and who is it ? " " I can not tell you that  --  now , " said Miss Philura simply . " He is in  --   --  " She was about to add " the encircling Good , " but she reflected that Miss Pratt might fail to comprehend her . " I will introduce you to him  --  later , " she concluded with dignity . To follow the fortunes of Miss Philura during the ensuing weeks were a pleasant though monotonous task ; the encircling Good proved itself wholly adequate to the demands made upon it . Though there was little money in the worn purse , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to spend the day , from hosts of friends who had suddenly become warm , affectionate , and cordially appreciative ; and not even the new Methodist minister 's wife could boast of such lavish donations , in the shape of new-laid eggs , frosted cakes , delicate biscuit , toothsome crullers and choice fruits as found their way to Miss Philura 's door . * * * * * The recipient of these manifold favors walked , as it were , upon air . " For unto every one that hath shall be given , " she read in the privacy of her own shabby little parlor , " and he shall have abundance . " " Everything that I want is mine ! " cried the little lady , bedewing the pages of Holy Writ with happy tears . The thought of the lover and husband who , it is true , yet lingered in the invisible , brought a becoming blush to her cheek . " I shall see him soon , " she reflected tranquilly . " He is mine  --  mine ! " At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awe-inspiring reception-room of Mrs. J. Mortimer Van Deuser 's residence in Beacon Street . The two ladies were engaged in earnest conversation . * * * * * " What you tell me with regard to Philura fills me with surprise and alarm , " Mrs. Van Deuser was remarking with something more than her accustomed majesty of tone and mien . " Philura Rice certainly did not become engaged to be married during her stay in Boston . Neither has she been the recipient of funds from myself , nor , to the best of my knowledge , from any other member of the family . Personally , I have always been averse to the encouragement of extravagance and vanity in those destined by a wise Providence to pass their lives in a humble station . I fear exceedingly that Philura 's visits to Boston have failed to benefit her as I wished and intended . " " But she said that she had money , and that she was going to get married , " persisted Miss Pratt . " You do n't suppose "  --  lowering her strident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is going crazy ? " * * * * * Mrs. Van Deuser had concentrated her intellectual and penetrating orbs upon a certain triangular knob that garnished the handle of her visitor 's umbrella ; she vouchsafed no reply . When she did speak , after the lapse of some moments , it was to dismiss that worthy person with a practiced ease and adroitness which permitted of nothing further , either in the way of information or conjecture . " Philura is , after all , a distant relative of my own , " soliloquized Mrs. Van Deuser , " and as such is entitled to consideration . " Her subsequent cogitations presently took shape to themselves and became a letter , dispatched in the evening mail and bearing the address of the Rev. Silas Pettibone , Innisfield . Mrs. Van Deuser recalled in this missive Miss Philura 's " unfortunate visit " to the Ontological Club , and the patent indications of its equally unfortunate consequences . " I should be inclined to take myself severely to task in the matter , " wrote the excellent and conscientious lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain at length , in the hearing of my misguided relative , the nature and scope of God 's controlling providence , as signally displayed in His dealings with the humbler classes of society . As an under-shepherd of the lowly flock to which Miss Rice belongs , my dear Mr. Pettibone , I lay her spiritual state before you , and beg that you will at once endeavor to set right her erroneous views of the overruling guidance of the Supreme Being . I shall myself intercede for Philura before the Throne of Grace . " * * * * * The Rev. Silas Pettibone read this remarkable communication with interest ; indeed , after returning it to its envelope and bestowing it in his most inaccessible coat-pocket , the under-shepherd of the lowly flock of Innisfield gave himself the task of resurrecting and reperusing the succinct yet weighty words of Mrs. Van Deuser . If the Rev. Silas had been blessed with a wife , to whose nimbler wits he might have submitted the case , it is probable that he would not have sat for so long a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the violet-tinted envelope from Boston . But unfortunately the good minister had been forced to lay his helpmate beneath the rough sods of the village churchyard some three years previous . Since this sad event , it is scarcely necessary to state , he had found it essential to his peace of mind to employ great discretion in his dealings with the female members of his flock . He viewed the matter in hand with vague misgivings . Strangely enough , he had not heard of Miss Philura 's good fortune , and to his masculine and impartial vision there had appeared no especial change in the aspect or conduct of the the little woman . " Let me think , " he mused , passing his white hand through the thick , dark locks , just touched with gray , which shaded his perplexed forehead . He was a personable man , was the Rev. Silas Pettibone . " Let me think : Miss Philura has been very regular in her attendance at church and prayer-meeting of late . No , I have observed nothing wrong  --  nothing blameworthy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these  --  ah  --  clubs . " He again cast his eye upon the letter . " Ontology , now , is certainly not a fit subject for the consideration of the female mind . " * * * * * Having delivered himself of this sapient opinion , the reverend gentleman made ready for a round of parochial visits . Foremost on his list appeared the name of Miss Philura Rice . As he stood upon the door-step , shaded on either side by fragrant lilac plumes , he resolved to be particularly brief , though impressive , in his pastoral ministrations . If this especial member of his flock had wandered from the straight and narrow way into forbidden by-paths , it was his manifest duty to restore her in the spirit of meekness ; but he would waste no unnecessary time or words in the process . The sunshine , pleasantly interrupted by snowy muslin curtains , streamed in through the open windows of Miss Philura 's modest parlor , kindling into scarlet flame the blossoms of the thrifty geranium which stood upon the sill , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the house , seated with her sewing in a favorite rocking-chair . Miss Philura was unaffectedly glad to see her pastor . She told him at once that last Sunday 's sermon was inspiring ; that she felt sure that after hearing it the unconverted could hardly fail to be convinced of the error of their ways . The Rev. Silas Pettibone seated himself opposite Miss Philura and regarded her attentively . The second-best new dress was undeniably becoming ; the blue eyes under the childish brows beamed upon him cordially . " I am pleased to learn  --  ah  --  that you can approve the discourse of Sabbath morning , " he began in somewhat labored fashion . " I have had occasion to  --  that is  --  er , my attention has been called of late to the fact that certain members of the church have  --  well , to put it briefly , some have fallen grievously away from the faith . " Miss Philura 's sympathy and concern were at once apparent . " I do not see , " she said simply , " how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so beautiful to believe ! " * * * * * The small , upturned face shone with so sweet and serene a light that the under-shepherd of the Innisfield flock leaned forward and fixed his earnest brown eyes on the clear blue eyes of the lady . In treatises relating to the affections this stage of the proceedings is generally conceded to mark a crisis . It marked a crisis on this occasion ; during that moment the Rev. Silas Pettibone forgot at once and for all time the violet-tinted envelope in his coat-tail pocket . It was discovered six month 's later and consigned to oblivion by  --  but let us not anticipate . " God is so kind , so generous ! " pursued Miss Philura softly . " If we once know Him as our Father we can never again be afraid , or lonely , or poor , or lacking for any good thing . How is it possible to fall away ? I do not understand . Is it not because they do not know Him ? " It is altogether likely that the pastor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state of Miss Philura which necessitated earnest and prolonged admonition ; at all events , the sun was sinking behind the western horizon when the reverend gentleman slowly and thoughtfully made his way toward the parsonage . Curiously enough , this highly respectable domicile had taken on during his absence an aspect of gloom and loneliness unpleasantly apparent . " A scarlet geranium in the window might improve it , " thought the vaguely dissatisfied proprietor , as he put on his dressing-gown and thrust his feet into his newest pair of slippers . ( Presented by Miss Electa Pratt " to my pastor , with grateful affection . " ) " I believe I failed to draw Miss Philura 's attention to the obvious relation between faith and works , " cogitated the reverend Silas , as he sat before his lonely hearth , placidly scorching the soles of his new slippers before the cheerful blaze . " It will be altogether advisable , I think , to set her right on that point without delay . I will  --  ah  --  just look in again for a moment to-morrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's purposes will ripen fast , Unfolding every hour . The bud may have a bitter taste , But sweet will be the flower ! " sang the choir of the Innisfield Presbyterian Church one Sunday morning a month later . And Miss Philura Rice  --  as was afterward remarked  --  sang the words with such enthusiasm and earnestness that her high soprano soared quite above all the other voices in the choir , and this despite the fact that Miss Electa Pratt was putting forth her nasal contralto with more than wonted insistence . The last-mentioned lady found the sermon  --  on the text , her own subsequent spiritual state in such an agitated condition , that she took occasion to seek a private conversation with her pastor in his study on that same Sunday afternoon . " I do n't know when I 've been so wrought up ! " declared Miss Pratt , with a preliminary display of immaculate handkerchief . " I cried and cried after I got home from church this morning . Ma she sez to me , sez she , ' What ails you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I , ' Ma , it was that blessed sermon . I do n't know when I ever heard anything like it ! That dear pastor of ours is just ripening for a better world ! ' " Miss Electa paused a moment to shed copious tears over this statement . " It does seem to me , dear Mr. Pettibone , " she resumed , with a tender glance and a comprehensive sniff , " that you ai n't looking as well as usual . I said so to Philura Rice as we was coming out of church , and I really hate to tell you how she answered me ; only I feel as though it was my duty . ' Mr. Pettibone is perfectly well ! ' she says , and tossed those feathers of hers higher'n ever . Philura 's awful worldly , I do grieve to say  --  if not worse . I 've been a-thinking for some time that it was my Christian duty ( however painful ) to tell you what Mis ' Van Deuser , of Boston , said about  --   --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought down his closed fist upon his open Bible with forensic force and suddenness . " Miss Philura Rice , " he said emphatically , " is one of the most spiritual  --  the most lovely and consistent  --  Christian characters it has ever been my privilege to know . Her faith and unworldliness are absolutely beyond the comprehension of  --  of  --  many of my flock . I must further tell you that I hope to have the great happiness of leading Miss Rice to the matrimonial altar in the near future . " Miss Electa Pratt sank back in her chair petrified with astonishment . " Well , I must say ! " she gasped . " And she was engaged to you all this time and I never knew it ! " The Rev. Pettibone bent his eyes coldly upon his agitated parishioner . " I am at a loss to comprehend your very strange comment , Miss Pratt , " he said ; " the engagement has been of such very short duration that I can not regard it as surprising that you should not have heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yesterday . " Miss Electa straightened her angular shoulders with a jerk . " Yesterday ! " she almost screamed . " Well ! I can tell you that Philura Rice told me that she was engaged to be married more than three months ago ! " " You are certainly mistaken , madam , " began the minister in a somewhat perturbed tone , which did not escape the notice of the now flushed and triumphant spinster . " More than three months ago ! " she repeated with incisive emphasis . " Now maybe you 'll listen to me while I tell you what I know about Philura Rice ! " But the lady had reckoned without her host . The Rev. Silas arose to his feet with decision . " I certainly will not listen to anything derogatory to Miss Rice , " he said sternly . " She is my promised wife , you will remember . " With that the prudent minister beat a hasty retreat , to entrench himself without apology or delay in the inner fastnesses of the parsonage . * * * * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of learning with a thoughtful smile . " If Philura Rice ai n't crazy , " she said aloud ; " an ' I guess she ai n't far from it . She 's told a wicked lie ! In either case , it 's my Christian duty to see this thing put a stop to ! " That evening after service Miss Philura , her modest cheeks dyed with painful blushes , confessed to her promised husband that she had indeed announced her intentions of matrimony some three months previous . " I wanted somebody to  --  to love me , " she faltered ; " somebody in particular , you know ; and  --  and I asked God to give me  --  a  --  a husband . After I had asked , of course I believed that I had . He  --  he was already in the encircling Good , you know , or I should not have wanted him ! When Electa asked me point blank , what could I say without  --  without denying  --  God ? " The brave voice faltered more than once during this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Silas Pettibone , his brown eyes shining , exclaimed in joyful yet solemn tones , " and God sent me ! " The encircling Good was perfectly manifest at that moment in the shape of two strong arms . Miss Philura rested in them and was glad .
