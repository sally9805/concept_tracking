AMONG the popular fallacies now in circulation is one brought forward to sustain the free-tobacco bill , and to justify the repeal of the internal-revenue system generally . It is that since the national debt , or a large part of it , draws only three per cent . interest , while money is worth seven per cent . to the taxpayers , it is unwise to pay off the debt so rapidly  --  that we ought to reduce the revenue to the lowest point possible , and " let the money fructify in the pockets of the people . " If this is a good argument against paying the debt rapidly , it is good against paying the principal at all . It is like saying that we should be better off if no part of it had ever been paid  --  that is , if it were about $1,000,000,000 greater than it is  --  for in that case we should have been earning seven per cent . with the money all the time , whereas , the debt has always been running at a less rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in short , that the national debt is a national blessing . It is assumed that the whole $1,000,000,000 would have been saved by the taxpayers and converted into capital  --  not spent unproductively , not lost , but saved and invested in such manner as to yield at least seven per cent . per annum . Otherwise there would be neither force nor pertinence in the argument . The confusion of ideas which all this implies arises from the habit of looking only at the money which passes from the taxpayer to the bondholder  --  looking at the sign instead of the thing signified . As money is only the vehicle by which the real operation is facilitated , we must look deeper to find out the essence of the transaction . The operation of paying either principal or interest of the public debt is an operation of distributing the national earnings among the various members of the community by law . The national earnings consist of wheat , cloth , iron , fuel , and whatever we produce by our labor . In the absence of any debt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a portion of these products every year and hand them over to a particular class who are not rendering a corresponding service . So long as the debt continues , this is unavoidable , but the question how long the debt ought to continue is to be answered by a simple arithmetical computation . There are , say , $350,000,000 of three per cent , bonds outstanding , which the Government has the right to redeem . if they are redeemed at the end of three years , this arbitrary distribution of the national earnings will amount to $350,000,000 principal , plus $31,500,000 interest , total , $381,500,000 . If the payment is prolonged to ten years , the total will reach $455,000,000 ; if to twenty years , $560,000,000 . The fact that the people can earn six or seven per cent . with their money does not affect the case at all . There are no presumptions to show that they would make better investments than the persons to whom it is paid  --  namely , the bondholders . In fact , the presumptions are the other way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when they are paid off , the sums they receive will in came out of every hartdrecl reinvested as capital and not squandered . There is no reason to suppose that anything like the same percentage would be laid aside and converted into capital if the money were left , as the saying is , " to fructify in the pockets of the people , " especially when ' we consider the countless driblets in which it reaches the Treasury . As a general thing , when a tax is removed from an article , the consumer will buy and consume more of it , instead of putting the difference into the savings bank . This would undoubtedly be the case if the tobacco tax were repealed . The assumption that the money , if not taken , will " fructify in the pockets of the people " is without any substantial foundation . It is much more likely to fructify if it goes to somebody who has already saved up the equivalent of it in a Government bond , and who depends upon the interest , that is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have , therefore , nothing left to consider but the question whether , in the case mentioned , it is better to discharge a given debt by paying $381,500,000 or by paying $455,000,000 , or by paying $560,000,000 . It may be asked whether it would not be better to pay the whole $350,000,000 now , and thus save all the interest . It would be better if it were convenient , but it happens to be inconvenient to pay so much at one time . The whole question of national-debt paying is one of convenience . If those who argue for a less rapid reduction can show that it is inconvenient to those who pay ? not to those who receive  --  and more inconvenient than prolonged interest payments , they may make out a case . But to do so , they must prove that a forced distribution of the national earnings is a good policy per se , and ought to be perpetuated . THE " CORNER " AND " FUTURE " IN QUIRY . THE inquiry into the effect of " corners " and " futures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is carrying on , has assumed a distinctly bouffe character and reflects but little credit on all concerned . Indeed , it is enough to make a New Yorker hang his head for shame to have an official investigation of this kind pending in one of the leading commercial cities of the world . The appearance of the clergy in it is particularly regret-able . Every man cuts a somewhat ridiculous figure who undertakes to throw light on a subject of which he confesses he knows nothing , and in this position the ministers summoned by the Committee seem to place themselves with a certain solemnity when beginning their testimony . The effect of their testimony is to make them a laughing-stock to the profane , and especially to the dealers in " futures , " and to diffuse an uncomfortable suspicion that the Committee called them in order to diminish popular respect for their office . The Rev. John J. Reed 's testimony , in the course of which he quoted Proverbs against " withholding " corn , and in favor of prompt sales , and Amos against false weights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example of the way in which a simple-minded clergyman may sometimes be betrayed into providing popnlftr entertaiaraeat by the ill ? , judicious use of his professional lore . He had prefaced these citations first by acknowledging that he had no practical knowledge of his subject , and then by some politico-economical utterances which it is to be hoped have been jumbled by the reporters . If he is correctly reported , one does not know what comment to make on the dicta that " prices should be made to depend as far as possible upon the law of supply and demand , " and that " other influences affecting prices should be looked on with suspicion , " and that " there was a temptation to commit fraud where the right to property , and not the property itself , was transferred . " Mr. Reed laid down these doctrines , he said , as a " teacher of morals " ; but no one is fit to be a teacher of morals in our day , at least to business men , who has not some little knowledge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of trade . It is to be hoped the theological seminaries have found this out . The two witnesses who have up to this time distinctively made their mark in the proceedings are Henry Ward Beecher and Jay Gould . Mr. Beecher took in the farcical side of the inquiry at a glance , as proved by confessing himself a dealer in " futures " by profession . But in answering the numerous silly questions which were afterward put him , he gave the Committee some very valuable , though very elementary , lessons , both in political economy and applied morality . That these lessons were much needed may be inferred from the fact that he was asked " how he would regulate the standard of prices for commodities " ; " whether nature does not contribute something to the value of the necessaries of life " ; whether the ? prices of breadstuffs are not affected by " the laws regulating climate , the atmosphere , and various other causes controlled by the Deity " ; what his opinion was of " the natural value of a field of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and what was " his opinion of a man who does not try to cultivate Christian principles by controlling his temper . " Jay Gould showed himself a complete mas-ter of the whole subject , and his evidence might really be called a useful little lecture on speculation in produce and stocks . He holds , as everybody must hold who knows anything of the history of speculation , that the great check , and the only practical and effective check , on speculation in anything , is the great losses sustained by the vast ma-jority of those who speculate . No legislation can provide a substitute for this . He holds , too , that corners in grain almost always re-sult in giving higher prices to the producer , and thus stimulating production , while the losses fall on those who make the corners ; that the less we interfere with traders , and the more we leave their rewards and pun-ishments to the operation of natural laws , the better we make our market and the more capital we Ijraw hither from all parts of the world ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corners " and all other illegitimate transactions on a great scale become . Con-gress was , during the war , very much annoy-ed by " corners " and " futures " in gold , which it held were got up by the enemies of the country , and other wicked persons , to dis-6r6dit the g-OvernMene , - Under the lead of Thaddeus Stevens , it passed an act forbidding speculation in gold . Gold instantly rose higher than ever , and the act was soon repealed . The lesson ought not to be forgotten by this time , and yet this very foolish inquiry makes it seem as if it had been forgotten by the politicians , and as if some of our ministers had never heard of it . There is one species of speculation to which inquiry ought to be directed , and which is as much within the purview of legislation as any other breach of trust , and now constitutes one of the crying scandals of American finance , and that is the speculation of railroad officers in their own stocks . Much of this is as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though perhaps not all , could be reached by criminal justice , or by State supervision . State supervision , at all events , could prevent to a considerable degree the management of roads in support of a " short " interest in the stock on the part of the officers , or , in other words , the plunder of the stockholders in aid of the speculations of their agents . THE BRITISH MINISTERIAL CHANGES . MR . CHILDERS , who is to take Mr. Glad-stone 's place as Chancellor of the Exchequer , is the second person who has under him held that position after receiving his political training in Australia  --  a curious illustration of the reflex influence of the colonies on English social and political life . The career of Mr. Lowe , now Lord Sherbrooke , who was the first , in fact remarkably resembles Mr. Childers 's . Both are sons of clergymen , both graduated with honors at Cambridge , and both went to Australia as soon as they left college . Mr. Lowe , however , practised successfully at the colonial bar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and rapidly became a leading man under the then newly-established government of Victoria , devoting himself mainly to questions of trade and finance . Both stayed in Australia seven years , and both then came back to England , and entered Parliament , and rapidly go ' into office , and both finally became Chancellors of the Exchequer under Mr. Gladstone . It is to be said , however , that Mr. Lowe did not fill the place successfully , and his mistakes had much to do with bringing about the defeat of the Liberals in 1874 , although his unfitness had been recognized in the previous year by his transfer to the Home Office . It was his breakdown , too , which first led Mr. Gladstone to assume the double duty of First Lord of the Treasury and Chancellor of the Exchequer , from which Mr. Childers 's appointment relieves him . Mr. Childers was First Lord of the Admiralty under Mr. Gladstone 's first Ministry in 1868 , but had to resign in 1871 from ill health . His strength lies mainly in his organizing power , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and still more striking proof recently in charge of the War Office , in which it has fallen . to his lot to carry to completion and improve upon Lord Cardwell 's great scheme of army reorganization . His experience in financial and mercantile affairs , owing partly to natural taste and partly to the possession of a large private fortune , is very great , and be has from time to time issued pamphlets on financial topics which , though not popular in the ordinary sense of the word , are considered weighty in " the City . " He differs from his prototype , Lord Sherbrooke , also in believing in popular government , or , at all events , not fearing it , and in feeling that the best days of the human race are not yet over . Lord Derby , who is said to be coming into the Cabinet too , but whose views , if this be true , about Irish Home Rule appear to differ curiously from Mr. Gladstone 's , is the great English apostle of common sense . He forms a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be called the " Rupert of debate " by his Tory contemporaries , and whose fervid genius and habit of dealing with questions offhand used to scandalize his painstaking and unimaginative son when he came into public life , and furnished at least a foundation for the story that the son observed , half in despair , " that if his father would only work he might come to something . " Lord Derby really belongs to a very large type of Englishmen in whose lives the imagination plays little part , and who are always standing on guard with a kind of heroism against the illusions created by the feelings , and who make " seeing things as they are " the great business of man on earth . If it was not for a dogged courage which nothing can dismay or dishearten , and an endless capacity for toil , the type , which is a very large one , would long ago have arrested the stream of English progress , and given the state a distinctly Chinese civilization . No public man now living can equal Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this his dealings with Russia when he was the Foreign Secretary of the Beaconsfield Cabinet furnished an almost comic illustration . He used to furnish the deputations who came up to see him about the Russians or about the Turks with such excellent summaries of the reasons both for action and inaction , that he dumbfounded and reduced them to silence . He can talk common sense , too , on any subject by the hour , and is for this reason particularly happy as a popular lecturer on wages , or thrift , or land-tense . In discoursing on themes like these to plain people , he has all the air of a man who is constantly trying to get the very most out of life , on an income of about $1,000 a year . Lord Hartington 's transfer to the War Office has no special significance , nor has Lord Kimberley 's to the Indian Affairs . Lord Hartington has the Derby temperament , but with much less capacity for work . In fact , he is supposed to carry on a perennial and almost desperate conflict with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last ten years in the House of Commons , speaking little , though always with force . Though the heir of a great dukedom , he shows , in the fidelity with which he follows the explorations of Gladstone 's daring political imagination , that he has not only the traditional courage of his order , but that unquenchable faith in English political ideas and in the destinies of the English people which has always saved the English aristocracy from drifting into the attitude of sulky and alarmed isolation , of which the French nobility furnishes such a melancholy example . FRENCH COLONIZATION . THE French Government has within two or three years been displaying an extraordinary eagerness to plant colonies and acquire dependencies in semi-barbarous countries . The same spirit showed itself during the latter part of the seventeenth century and the early part of the eighteenth , under the old monarchy . Extensive territories were seized in America , and a very large emigration for those days was poured into them , and settlements were made in India which seemed to promise at one time the rise of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England was afterward compensated , for the loss of her possessions in America . Under the Empire , however , all colonial aspirations were utterly abandoned , and whatever spirit of adventure there was in the people was absorbed by European wars and attempts at European domination . The Monarchy of the Restoration , to which the field of European conquest was necessarily closed , tried to revive the Bourbon traditions by the seizure of Algiers , now nearly fifty years ago , but there the matter ended . The Algerian colony has not succeeded . It has not yet got beyond the garrison stage . Few Frenchmen go there , and , when they go , show but little ability to get on without Government supervision or protection . Of late years there has been somewhat more progress , but it is slow and sickly . After the Algerian conquest , too , the great fact began to show itself that French population was stationary , and likely to remain stationary . This , when it first became apparent , about forty years ago , startled French politicians and surprised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century it was the fixed belief of this latter class that , peace being restored , the French people would multiply enormously , as the Irish had multiplied . One English economist predicted that by our time France would be " the great pauper warren of Europe , " and would furnish hewers of wood and drawers of water to all other countries . The French , however , refused to multiply , and , under the new social regime , began to display that deeply-rooted love of home and preference for thrift to adventure as a means of growing rich which are now such potent factors in French politics . This killed all colonizing schemes on the part of the Government , and led the Second Empire to take up once more the role of an arbiter in European politics , and to attempt extensions of the French territory in Europe . It recognized the fact that , as the London Economist recently remarked , the French people have never supported their Government in schemes of distant aggrandizement ; that nothing beyond the seas touches the French popular imagination . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take in the geography of the globe , and remains in much the same condition about the earth , in spite of ell the schools and colleges can do , as that of the ancients in the days of Herodotus . The world for it contains France and two or three adjacent countries , all flat , and beyond them there is the " ocean stream " and Cimmerian darkness . In one of the recent French opera - bouffes one of the characters describes foreign parts generally as consisting of " le Canada , lea Canaries , les Colonies , et cetera , " which is probably as near as most Frenchmen come to realizing the world outside France . Hamerton , in his charming book on French home life , describes a French lady living quite near the Swiss border as being under the impression that Switzerland was further off than England , probably because she saw more Englishmen than Swiss . The Republican Government is now turning to the foreign-colony enterprise for the same reason that the Restoration conquered Algiers , because it is cut off from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the absurd campaign against the Krumirs would have been followed by interference in Egypt if that had not seemed to threaten European complications . But it has been followed by an attempt to establish a protectorate over the western and northwestern coasts of the island of Madagascar , against which the Malagassy Government has sent an embassy to Europe to protest , and by a similar attempt to establish one over the Anamese province of Tonquin , over which the Chinese now exercise some kind of sovereignty which they threaten to defend in arms . Finally , M. de Brazza 's somewhat ridiculous treaty with King Makoko on the Congo has been submitted to the Chambers , and ratified with amusing haste and solemnity , as if it was a great thing which would make the British pale with envy . It is pretty certain , however , that the French people will not support these schemes with anything like popular interest and attention , and , when once the novelty has worn off , these colonies will simply prove expensive garrisons , and not homes for French settlers . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a superabundant population such as Great Britain and Germany possess . It is safe to say that distant conquests will never be popular in a country which raises its armies by conscription . Conscription is only tolerable when the troops are not likely to be taken far from home . It would be intolerable if they were much drawn on for service in distant and unhealthy climes . One of the great reasons why Englishmen have always so much enjoyed their wars at the far ends of the earth is that they are carried on by volunteers . In other words , the British foreign and colonial empire has been founded and is defended by men who soldier because they like it , and whose departure for the wars , therefore , sends none of the tremor of anxiety through the community which is produced in the Continental states by a scheme of military ambition . THE DECLINE OF HOSPITALITY . THERE exists an impression that American hospitality is in a bad way . To a certain extent the foreboding justifies itself . Any one can see that the lavish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has well-nigh vanished ; it lingers only on the frontiers ; it is disappearing even from the South . In the cities , we keep our houses for ourselves and for our friends , especially our previously-invited friends . Nevertheless , among one class of Americans the tendency is for hospitality to grow freer and more diffuse . Nowhere is there a readier or  --  if one may so express it  --  more luxuriant hospitality than among very rich Americans . They fill their country-houses every summer . The travelling foreigner has some ado to save his digestion from their multitude of dinners . And the fashionable custom of always laying extra covers at luncheon for possible guests , speaks loudly for their ever-ready cordiality . Nowhere , too , is the entertaining more genuine , cheerful , or informal . Unhappily this , charming hospitality stops with the very rich . They , truly enough , open their houses to their friends . The rest of us are apt rather to bar them , taking down the bars only on special occasions and with due formality . We still have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's immediate families bread and lodging , though no invitation have summoned them . But other people we keep civilly at arm 's length . Our transient hospitality is as rigid . We do not like to have guests on the spur of the moment . How many husbands , for instance , venture to bring a friend home with them as often as inclination prompts I Men are hospitable by nature . They enjoy unceremonious entertaining . It pleases them to display their wives and children and houses . But , commonly , their wives are of quite another mind . The luckless husband is apt to run full tilt against some sacred household ordinance of washing , or ironing , or baking , with the saddest results to the family peace . His rash and ignorant good feeling hurries him into invitations and makes him forget that the day is Monday , a solemn occasion of purification , a day fittingly observed by a semi-fast , or that it is Tuesday , when we iron , or that a dressmaker is in the house , and all the week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succession of catastrophes teaches him a wise timidity . He grows wary through tribulation . The chances are so much against his hospitality hitting a day when no harm will be done , that he gives up asking his friends to risk them . Instead , if he lives in a large city and can in any wise afford it , he joins a club and takes his friends there . If he lives in the smaller towns , he can only gratify his sense of the obligations of good-fellowship , in a saloon , by " setting up the drinks . " Neither of these alternatives is to most wives ' taste ; but they are the popular alternatives just the same . Hospitality , then , would not appear to have waned among men ; it has merely changed its form  --  and its place . The real decline has been among women . Yet very rich women are indefatigably hospitable ; to be a delightful hostess is part of every " great lady 's " social equipment . Behold a mystery . Here is one class of women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them the equals of the first in everything save money  --  stubbornly though silently narrowing its limits . The mystery , however , is shallow . When all is said , hospitality is a sort of barbaric virtue only half acclimated in civilized climes , and thriving best among the class that has the nearest approach to the barbaric leisure and recklessness . The barbaric welcome is fascinating , but , after all , it costs the barbarian little . The coming of a stranger is a pleasant break in a monotonous life . The barbarian has plenty of time on his hands ; generally he has a rude plenty of provision and service ; when he has not , he is too reckless of the morrow to be troubled , and shares his last crust with a stranger without dread of future hunger . Just how much improvidence has to do with generosity one does not venture to say ; but , certainly , most of the hospitable races have been improvident  --  which holds true with the civilized as well as the barbarians . Take the Scotch Highlander , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole tendency of industrial civili zation is to make men more provident . At the same time life constantly becomes more orowded ; compared with an Arab sheik , all we civilized people are in a hurry . So it happens that we are at once too prudent and too busy to be barbarously hospitable . The single class prwsPssing the barbaric requisites for hospitality  --  recklessness and leisure  --  is the very rich : they are hospitable . There is another reason , possibly going deeper . One result of the generally diffused ambition of Americans is a general pretence . We all hope for better things than we enjoy , and meanwhile most of us try to seem to have captured more of them than we have . This pretence is a very deadly foe to hospitality . Barbarians are comparatively free from it ; ignorant savages that they are , they have no " company dishes " or " company manners . " The very rich resemble the barbarians , making little change in their manner of living for ordinary guests . But the average American woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than she can before her own household . She " makes a difference " for " company . " Hence these tears . As a rule she has too few servants for the work of her house ; and " making a difference " involves additional work , which , flung on already overburdened shoulders , reacts on the servant 's temper much as it would on that of any one else . Thus she comes to dread her husband 's thoughtless hospitality , liable to light on Mondays , Tuesdays , or that awful season when the house is , as it were , recreated and goes into a preliminary chaos . In truth it is her lack of service , not her lack of kindliness , which makes her less hospitable than her rich acquaintance with the extra covers at luncheon . She has no leisure , because she tries to live outwardly as well with her three or two or one servant as does a woman with six . The disproportion , often , between the house , the dress , the table , and the service of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is something appalling . All over the land are women with large houses and a single maid-servant . The woman 's husband is not poor , and the house is expensively furnished . Perhaps there are three or four children . By economy and clever observation , and doing dreadful things to her back over a sewing-machine , she contrives to dress her children and herself as " stylishly " as does her richest neighbor . This is a triumph . A triumph , also , is her little feast when she opens her doors to invited friends . But at other times the labor of the household is so ingeniously parcelled out that there are no spare chinks of time or thought for idle , aimless , unrequited hospitality . Doubtless there is much to be said for this hard-working creature 's refusal to do more than she does . Indeed , how can she ?
