THE historian of the future , reviewing an epoch preeminent in so many respects , will find the nineteenth century not , at least , far behind its predecessors in the odd character of its cults . He will be , moreover , surprised to learn that one of the most bizarre of these , though compelled by nature to make its way without the assistance of logic , actually grew ? slowly but surely ? until it had , in a few years ' time , attained a size to be accounted for , if not an influence to be reckoned with ; and that this eminently illogical proceeding took place without the appearance of anything that could be called a serious answer to the challenges made , ? even from the profession most directly attacked . For the criticisms of Christian Science , though numerous and in many cases just , have been , I think , far from satisfactory . And for this reason : that they have attacked superficial defects without due regard to underlying principles . Probably no characteristic of the Christian Science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inconsistencies ; certainly no book , making any claim to scientific consideration , so abounds in manifest contradictions . And yet we have not disposed of the question when we have pointed these out . Mrs. Eddy offers us a theory of knowledge and of evil ; and her inconsistencies in elaboration affect the truth of neither the one nor the other . Jibes , too , make a somewhat poor substitute for logic , ? if reasoned conviction be , indeed , your aim ; for it is easy to ridicule where you can not cope , and a very small genius may be a very large jester . Nor does the charge of fanaticism do away with all need of debate ; for Truth has , in more than one instance , been done high service by this enthusiasm run riot . Jeopardizing accuracy in an epigram , we may say that history hibernates between honest fanatics . But for them , indeed , the world 's thankless chores would fare but ill . Without under-estimatind the value of a conservative position in both the theoretical and the practical concerns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other position could , in the long run , surpass it in the majestic front it offers to fickleness of thought and action , it is important to remember that the people of one idea ? the " dare-todo-right " men of the juvenile books ? have done , unattractive as their lack of mental equilibrium may be , some big things in the world . The really intellectual men of an age are , for the most part , conservative men ; and often they are conservative to the extreme of prejudice . Anything iconoclastic risks being for them , ipso facto , beyond the pale of legitimate belief . Yet we must not forget how often in history the thoughtful and conservative men of a century have accepted and taught ideas which the conservative and thoughtful men of preceding years had dallied with only to scoff at them . Any striking work must expect striking opposition . Indeed , those deleted material // ence therapeutics is the truth if Christian Science philosophy is the truth ; indeed , if Mrs. Eddy 's premises be correct , her conclusion is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a philosophy of Evil based on a philosophy of Knowledge , and its cure of disease is only incidental , even though identified in the popular mind with the system itself . The basal propositions upon which Christian Science may be wrought into a system , and at which any criticism of that system must be directed , are its teachings about God , Man , Knowledge , Matter , Evil , and Christianity . Briefly , they are these : 1 . God , the Ego , is All in All , the only Life , Substance , and Soul , the only Intelligence of the Universe . He is Mind and fills all space . 2 . Man is the true image of God ; he has no consciousness of material life or death ; his material body is a mortal belief ; he was , is , and ever shall be perfect . 3 . Knowledge . Knowledge gained from the material senses is a tree whose fruits are sin , sickness , and death . The evidence of the senses is not to be accepted in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case of sin . The physical senses are simply beliefs of mortal mind . 4 . Matter can not be actual . God being all , matter is nothing . 5 . Evil . ( a ) Sin . Error is unreal . All that God made is good ; hence there is no evil . ( b ) Sickness . Health is not a condition of matter . Human mind produces organic disease as certainly as it produces hysteria . ( c ) Death is an illusion . ( d ) Cure . The cure for sin , sickness , and death ? since all are illusions ? is the destruction of the illusion . 6 . Christianity is a demonstration of divine principle casting out error and healing the sick . Soul can not sin nor being be lost . Scripture must be interpreted spiritually.n . There are four great highways of evidence which will lead , I think , ? as all roads met at Rome , ? to the essential unsoundness of Christian Science : though each may bring us to a different aspect of it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and it may be shown , in addition , to be specious philosophy , superficial science , and a caricature on Christianity . Christian Science comes to us claiming a revealed origin ; and the presumption from the first is therefore against it . Men who have read history have learned to suspect such claims . They know that thousands like it have been made before ; and they know , too , that few have stood off oblivion long enough even to get themselves discussed . They have come to recognize certain characteristics as proofs of speciousness ; they have learned to demand as indispensable certain other distinguishing qualities . Simplicity , with a majestic mystery ; humility , with a commanding dignity ; when these are wanting ? as they are most emphatically wanting in Science and Health ? men with some knowledge of history have a right to be suspicious ; and when shocked Christian Science replies , " The Hand that made me is Divine , " the critic , with his textbook of the Past open , answers , " Your name is Legion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they fail to do so , history can do no more than stamp them specious . And it is about as likely that the Great Unknown , casting about for a medium for his sanitary pronouncement , should have singled out this bungling prophetess , as that the immortal spirits , dead and not yet born , should find no more profitable occupation than strumming banjos for the delight of mediums too spiritually constituted to engage in honest work . But Christian Science takes its second fling at the canons of history in its attitude toward the future and its limitless 436 Christian Science . claims over it . For this naive philosophy nothing is impossible . It is a catholicon ? absolute and unfailing . The mysteries of Life ? the one mystery especially which has absolutely baffled every thinker who has attacked it ( and that includes humanity ) ? are to Mrs. Eddy ridiculously plain . We are suspicious of omniscience , and we have a right to be . A few mons of disappointed hopes have taught us to smile at that word " Panacea . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Christian Science to be , not a development , but a flash of light from heaven . Truth hates haste , and history knows no short cuts . Most iconoclastic institutions have made their entrance into the world gradually , in the face of recognized difficulty ; and , if analogies from nature be valid , it would seem that it is always thus with progressive processes . Indeed , so thoroughly have men come to realize this fact that " evolution " is a byword with the essayists ; and whether the subject be " The Digestive Apparatus of the Oyster , " or " The Origin of Religion , " they are never tired of telling us that slow growth is the universal habit of the truth . Only in rare instances has any new truth been brought to light by a flash ; the rule that history teaches is ? a slow stumbling in the dark until the light is reached . The presumptive evidence , as the great laws of life working themselves out in history have made it of value to us , is against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past . It fails emphatically to exhibit the premonitory symptoms of truth . And , apart from all other considerations , these are strong counts against it . But , as a system of philosophy , ? and as , essentially , a theory of matter and knowledge , ? Christian Science is even more obviously unsatisfactory . The history of idealism in modern times , from Bishop Berkeley down through Leibnitz and Kant to Hegel , is one of the most fascinating chapters in thestory of thought . Moreover , the contest that raged so long and so fiercely as to the ultimate nature of knowledge resulted , at least , in establishing the value of the profound idea that is at the basis of a thoughtful idealism . The thinkers of this school felt , not of course for the first time , but perhaps more centrally and vividly than their predecessors , that we had possibly been too hasty in accepting as final the outer world as it impressed itself upon us . They suggested that we be cautious in regarding as real anything which could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our relation to the objective world ? as mediated by senses which we must trust absolutely in their perceptions , though never allowing them to be final in their interpretations ? was an unchangeable fact , they also realized that the traditional theory of matter and our relation to it was not necessarily the true one . The value of idealism became , of course , apparent ; and men , as usual in history , began to be extreme . From doubting matter they came to deny it ; and the fundamental weakness of idealism , cropping out even in its most thoughtful exponents , but painfully obvious in the extremists , was seen to be its failure to square with what we may call ? indefinitely , it is true , but still intelligibly ? common sense . To say that matter is non-existent means nothing , in the ordinary sense of those words ; the only way in which it can be made to mean anything is by interpreting it , not as a statement about matter , but as an unusual definition of existence . And it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was not the annihilation of phenomenal existence , but the distinction of it from real existence which they insisted upon ; so that on logical grounds they stand immeasurably above the gross philosophy which identifies lack of " existence " with nothingness . Yet , on grounds of common sense , even this position is a weak one . " The essence of anything , " said Spinoza // in his seventh axiom , " which can be conceived as non-existent does not imply existence . " But the point is that matter can not be so conceived . For matter is as existent as anything we know about . We can conceive of spirits as on a higher plane of existence because manifesting qualities which we , intuitively or empirically , if not arbitrarily , call higher ; but the qualities which we ascribe to spirit are as much a matter of perception with us ( though not , it is true , directly perceived by the physical senses ) as the qualities which we ascribe to matter . So that , to discard the findings of perception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to leave us with no world to explain . We must ask extreme idealists to define their terms . When they say that matter does not exist what do they mean ? That it really fails to exhibit extension in space ? Then there remains for them to explain the illusion , and they have only substituted one problem for another ; beside which , they have denied to the one object we know which seems to exhibit extension in space that attribute without the manifestation of which by matter the whole conception of extension in space becomes unthinkable . Or do they mean that extension in space can be exhibited by an object which does not exist ? Then they are merely defining existence in a new way , and species of existence must now be distinguished . What then do they take as a standard ? Spiritual existence ? This itself is a matter of perception , and there is nothing to show that it exhibits more stigmata of reality than material existence ? whatever you may hypothecate about its immortality or self-consciousness , which are , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ object . Or do they speak in terms of abstract existence ? Then I answer that their statements mean nothing ; for while abstract existence may be a dialectical entity , it is far more reasonable to suppose that an object , with which we are brought into actual relation with every activity of the cells of our sense-organs , really is , than to imagine that existence is monopolized by a something the conception of which simply passes human understanding ; unless we only hypothecate it as a basis for the actual world with which we have to do , and so make that world not'final , but a manifestation of something more fundamental . But philosophy must be more than a " soulless play of concepts . " It will not do merely to " play bricks with words " and imagine that we are doing a grown man 's work . It is possible , I suppose , by way of analogy , to talk of dry water . But it is ridiculous ; as it is always ridiculous for men to adopt the concepts of another universe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We mean nothing when we talk in terms of another existence . The world of matter and the world of spirit are the two worlds with which we have actually to do ; and to talk of one of them as illusional is an attempt to view life with a perspective which only omniscience makes possible . " A dream which all dream together , " said Kant , " and which all mast dream , is not a dream , but reality . " " That which is probable for all , " said Aristotle , " is certain . " And , practically , too , the theory is unsatisfactory . For , granted that external objects have no existence save as subjective ideas , how will that change my relation to them ? I can not destroy my sensations ; and so long as I have sensations the illusion stays . While eyes and ears and hands remain the fashion , the world will exist for me ; and my belief that it does not exist in itself , but only in my mind , can alter in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idealism means merely that matter and spirit manifest themselves in different ways , then it is a self-evident truth ; if it means that all our knowledge is a knowledge of relations , and that the unconditioned is attainable by faith alone , then it is , if not the truth , at least defensible ; but if it means , on the other hand , that matter can be actually proven non-existent , then it is a philosophy which , though conceivably tenable for omniscience , is ridiculous and unpractical as a theory of life for finite man . ' So much for idealism per se . The unconipromising idealism , however , which Mrs. Eddy offers us not only has these defects , but is guilty of a far more serious charge . It poses as an explanation , and is in reality a total evasion . To deny that matter exists , and assert that it is an illusion , is only another way of asserting its existence ; you are freed by your suggestion from explaining the fact , but forced by it to explain the illusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escape from a problem is a solution . You are out of the frying-pan , it is true , but you are in the fire instead . Christian Science philosophy makes sensations and dreams analogous ; but it is a fallacy to attempt to analogize two activities which not only are felt to be different in kind , but which bear a suggestive time relation to each other , and without the previous occurrence of one of which the other can never be shown to function . And this is the fact about sensations and dreams . I smell a rose , and that night I dream of what I have done . Both acts , says Mrs. Eddy , are dreams . Then , I answer , how do you account for my recognition of the two activities as different in kind ? If all psychic phenomena are dreams , why do I recognize only certain psychic phenomena as dreams ? To equate illusion and sensation is to balance inches with pounds ; and it explains neither . The great ideal philosophers recognized this inadequacy ; though it was Berkeley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kant , Leibnitz , Fichte , and Hegel were idealists with a qualification ; and this qualification was their salvation . But Mrs. Eddy has strengthened her position in no such way . For the testimony of the senses is , to her , absolutely unacceptable : not because it fails to be final , but because it is essentially false . She quite ignores the fact that while , so long as we have no extrinsic standard , it may be impossible to demonstrate the reliability of the senses ' reports , it is equally , and for the same reason , impossible to prove their unreliability . And matter , which idealism had warned us against accepting as known or knowable , Mrs. Eddy rejects , not as unproven , but as proven non-existent . In a word , she has jumped at a conclusion in a way that is pathognomonic of dilettanteism . From slight hints which Nature gives that , in certain details , the external world is not just as our senses report it , the wild hypothesis is , I will not say arrived at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senses have to do is a deep , base lie . She tells us that inasmuch as we can not be sure that the external world does exist as we perceive it , we must be sure that it does not exist at all ; whereas the conservative and rational theory , which the facts suggest , is that the report of the senses , so far from being rejected , is to be sincerely accepted : but always under the condition that the perceptions be subject to mental interpretation . " Do not conclude , " says Browning , " that the child saw nothing in the sky because he assuredly did not see a flying horse there as he says . " While Christian Science , then , is so closely allied to this fundamental position of philosophy , it must not , for a moment , be supposed that it rises or falls with the rise or fall of idealism . The latter , in its healthy manifestations , is one of the profoundly true positions of modern thought , for it makes the valuable fundamental distinction be- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ontology is not healthy ideal metaphysics , and the very best that can be said for it is that it wildly hypothecates what the extreme interpretation of ideal-* ; ism merely suggests . Transcendentally speaking , we can never show that matter either has or has not real existence . The weakness lies not in suggesting that it may not exist , ? philosophers recognize that clearly enough , ? but in asserting dogmatically that it does not exist ; and Mrs. Eddy has taken the weakest portions of a weak philosophy , and , by subtracting its elements of strength , has made it weaker still . Her treatment of Evil , too , ? manifesting itself in the favorite trio : sin , sickness , and death , ? is equally unsatisfactory from the philosopher 's point of view . The explanation of each is its non-existence ; the origin of the illusion is simply neglected . Here , for example , is a man from whom you have removed the heart . He is dead , according to our ignorant and loose use of the word . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a subjective illusion . " " Whence did this illusion arise ? " I ask . " From custom , " is the reply ; " men have learned to associate the supposed absence of a non-existent heart with the illusion , death . " " But , " I say , " back in primitive times , before there were customs or majority opinions , before men had learned to connect the heart with life at all , what started the illusion , death ? " And there is absolute and ridiculous silence . She has done nothing ; core , you see , than define death ? and the same holds true of sickness ? in an unusual way ; but incapable of a large vision , and ignorant of the distinction between proximate and ultimate causes , she persuades herself that she has really explained the mystery . Moreover , aside from all theoretical considerations , the practical solution of suffering which the heroes of life andthought have given us , and have proven practicable by applying it to the sorrow and limitations and cruel obstacles in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bravery , so little of hypocrisy and willing blindness to facts , ? rings , in a word , so true to the highest ideas and ideals of life , ? that the discordant clang of this panacea grates on a discriminating taste . Blind John Milton , " bearing the mild yoke " in a life of high-minded and stimulating content ; Stevenson refusing to allow medicine bottles and bloody handkerchiefs to color his view of things ; martyrs and saints in high places and low , going cheerfully and usefully to work in a world whose ugliest facts are best known to them in some circumstances of their own lives , which are there to be triumphed over , but which , nevertheless , are there : does not this attitude appeal by its frankness and bravery and nobility where Christian Science disgusts by its insincerity and bravado and lack of refinement ? " That he is unhappy , " writes Epictetus , " is ass addition which each one must make for himself ; " significantly calling attention to the facts which must exist before our attitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the addition we make determines the character of our philosophy ? whether of hope or despair ? and the outcome of our living ? whether in triumph or defeat . The theology which Mrs. Eddy offers us is nothing more not less than pantheism . It is true that she denies this accusation often and strenuously ; but , as a matter of fact , no grosser statement of the pantheistic position has ever been made than when Mrs. Eddy attempts to eliminate matter by maintaining that if it existed and had real dimensions , God would by it be actually elbowed out because there would be no room for Hint in space . The philosophical argument against pantheism is , of course , well enough known , and , it may be thought , admits of satisfactory answer . I wish deleted material // effect of Truth . " Is this guessing or statistics ? Does she seriously mean to tell us that since 1865 , or thereabouts , the slight hold that Christian Science has had on the world has really lengthened life ? Could statistics culled in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to longevity and its cause ? Has she any scientific understanding of the meaning of statistics and of the tremendous periods they must cover in order to be of value ? " It is proverbial , " we are told again , " that so long as you read medical works you will be sick ; " and the expansion of a fallacy with a semblance of truth in it into such a lie as that is expected to appeal to hard-headed men ! " The ear really hears not , " Mrs. Eddy tells us in her typical dogmatic way ; but such a glib statement is surely capable of demonstration , and if the demonstration has been wanting , it is fair to assume that the statement is prattle . Will she stuff her ears and tell me what I am saying ? " Brain , " we are told , " is the material stratum of the human mind , a mortal consolidation of material mentality and its suppositional activities ; " and we are not surprised that a mind which can call that mess of words a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has previously been denied ? runs into argument after argument whose weakness and looseness are obvious to the slightest thought . Here are a few samples of such logic . The simple fact that the sun 's apparent rotation is really due to the movement of the earth is made a proof of the unreliability of the senses ' testimony . " Until this false testimony of the eye was rebuked by clearer views of the everlasting facts it deluded the judgment and induced false conclusions ; " but , as a matter of fact , the testimony of the eye falsely interpreted , so far from being rebuked by clearer views , was set straight by that same eye - testimony , rightly interpreted . It was not the testimony , but the meaning of it , that was at fault ; and it is the most specious sort of logic which can argue away the value of the sense - organs by quoting conclusions based on the work done by those very organs . It is obvious enough that the brain is necessary back of the senses ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as for Ptolemy , the thing seen was a moving sun ; Astronomy was reborn only when an old observation received a new and true interpretation . Again , notice the absurd explanation of the action of drugs . " When the sick recover , " we are told , " by the use of drugs , it is the law of general belief , culminating in individual faith , which heals ; even if you take away the individual confidence in a drug . . . the chemist , . . . the doctor , and the nurse equip the medicine with their faith , and the majority of beliefs rules . " Acetanilid , then , reduces temperature , by action on the heat-coordinating nerve centre , because the majority of men , or the patient himself , believe this to be the case . Well , the fact is that the majority of men have never heard of acetanilid , or the heat centre ; that there was a time when practically no one had heard of the drug , and yet it had the very action that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as due not essentially to an effect on metabolism but to an increase of heat-dissipation through a vaso-motor change , had to win its way to its present universal acceptance in the face of scientists ' previous unanimous belief that the opposite was the case ; that the drug itself , in spite of the majority opinion of those who know , ? that it will always reduce f ever , ? sometimes fails to do so even when exhibited in maximal quantities ; and that its action , so far from being dependent on the patient 's belief , is observed in animals , which may reasonably be assumed to have no belief on the subject whatever ! Again , Mrs. Eddy has loosely ignored origins . She neglects the fact that a ma- jority opinion must start somewhere ; and she betrays a lamentable ignorance of the frequency , in the history of pharmacology , with which an established majority belief has been overthrown by the ideas of one man . Her explanation , besides , takes no account of the varying action of drugs when exhibited under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fail to reduce temperature when the connection between body and basal ganglia is broken ; yet there can be only one majority opinion at one time , and this is not affected by an operation on an unconscious dog 's brain . If belief were the essence of therapeutics , patent medicine would , long ere this , have induced paradise : as a myriad dupes could testify . But no less deplorable than her inaccuracy and speciousness is Mrs. Eddy 's ignorance of elemental natural history , ? an ignorance quite unimportant except for the fact that she has not only claimed , but actually usurped , the function of oracle to a large and growing clientele . When a finger is amputated we are told that the nerve is gone which we say had been the occasion of pain in the finger ; and referred pain after amputation is made to prove that sensation is hide-pendent of matter . This is inexcusable ignorance . The nerve is not gone ; and pain is , of course , just as possible , as it is possible for water to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in Weir Mitchell 's simile , as it is possible to ring a doorbell from any point along the wire as well as from the knob itself . The appearance of the horizon on the retina is cited as a proof of the falsity of sense testimony ; here sky and earth appear to meet when , as a matter of fact ( we are told this as though it were a new idea ) , they do nothing of the kind . Well , Mrs. Eddy is apparently ignorant of the fact that the retina alone does not give us our idea of the outside world ; that a complicated system of fibres , known as the optic tract , and a part of the brain in the region of the calcarine fissure arepart and parcel of the visual apparatus . If apparent vision proves the sense-organ a liar , what about the sight of the mind without an organ of vision ? Does a blind man see truly ? Unscientific , too , is the charlatanry with which the author of Science and Health appropriates for proof , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system has not been applied . It is a popular misconception that the therapeutics of Christian Science is identical with the therapeutics of Mental Science ; that both teach the annihilation of existent disease by the superior influence of spirit over existent matter . True mental therapeutics is , however , as a matter of fact , based on the theory that disease is a molecular disorder , and that the power of mind is curative by reason of its ability to bring order out of molecular chaos ; while obviously , Mrs. Eddy teaches nothing of the kind . " The remedy for disease , " as she outlines it , " lies in probing the trouble to the bottom , in finding and casting out , by denial , the error of belief which produces a mortal disorder , and never honoring it with the title of law or yielding obedience to it ; " and yet in nearly every one of her reported cures such a procedure is conspicuous by its absence ! It is the boldest kind of appropriation to assume that a given cure is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case , but which has been replaced by methods of treatment whose power is perfectly well recognized . And appropriation is only a parlor name for theft . But , again , Mrs. Eddy is unscientific in her attitude toward the Bible . This , she noisily claims , over and again , as her sole guide ; but when we press the matter home we find that the Bible means an allegory based on the Hebrew Scriptures . interpreted so as to accord with a special pleader 's views , and mutilated till it supports them . It is a canon of scientific criticism that the right meaning of a passage is the meaning it would naturally // have conveyed to those for whom it was written . In this light read Mrs. Eddy 's " Spiritual interpretation " of the Lord 's Prayer , which ( though I say nothing of the actual mutilation where , by altering the hortatory of the original Greek , the petition " Thy Kingdom come " is made to read " Thy kingdom is come , " and is interpreted as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I say , were it not so blasphemous , would be as ridiculous as it is unscientific ; and then place with it her interpretation of Simon 's impetuous reply , " Thou art the Christ , the son of the living God " ( by which he meant , she says , " The Messiah is what Thou bast declared ? Christ , the divine idea of Truth and Life which heals mentally " ) ; and , though you are ignorant of her ridiculous , fragmentary view of Genesis and of numerous other absurd interpretations which defy every principle of criticism , you have in these two quotations alone sufficient patents of quackery . But the last item in the indictment is that Christian Science is fundamentally unchristian , ? a charge made , not against one who has refused intellectual assent to a certain faith , in which case it would be a statement and no charge , but against one confessedly committed to the very tenets thus wantonly emasculated , in which case the question of honesty naturally arises . For Christianity certainly embodies some ideas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the creed , and then go about denying in the voice of the street what you have just intoned . And central in the Christian theology stands the idea of the Atonement ; for it is the one idea , to say nothing of the uniqueness of its Christian form , intimately incorporated in , and expressly developed by , Jewish ritualistic history , Psalms and Prophecy , Christ 's own words , and the writings of apostles and fathers alike . To deny it may be to take a perfectly rational position ; but of one thing there is no question : it is to take a thoroughly antichristian position . I offer no theory of the Atonement ; nor do I pretend here to defend the traditional theory . I make all reasonable allowance for the honest difference of opinion which has long existed on every side of the question , among those whose ideas we are bound to respect , as to the correct interpretation of the mystery . I ask for no hard-and-fast definition of a phenomenon which men can no more explain than comprehend . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ symbolic , nor for an idealistic interpretation . But I do say that , given a belief in the essential truth of the Bible , no one can dare honestly to call himself a Christian who does not regard Christ 's death as sacrificial , whatever interpretation he may subsequently make of that word . And the point is that logically , whatever may be Mrs. Eddy 's method of smoothing over this obvious defect , the whole idea of the Atonement , whether interpreted sacrificially or not , should be rejected by Christian Science ; for , having annihilated sin as a fact in life , what need is there for a savior from sin ? But it is characteristic of Mrs. Eddy to reject so much of a system of thought as flies counter to her hypotheses , and to accept enough to serve for a captious catch-call . Nazarene , not Christian , should she be called , ? as Canon Liddon said of Martineau . The Resurrection , too , ? which most Christian thinkers rationally regard as a central fact in Christian apologetics , ? Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the historical fact , ? we might sympathize with her if she did . But she interprets the fact away . It is not , she tells us , a demonstration of Christ 's divinity , but of man 's divinity . Christ rose ? that is , spirit overcame matter ? in order to show that man may do the same . " Anybody can do that , " is her Easter hymn ; and it seems only a fair inference to draw that a system which rejects both Atonement and Resurrection does little less than masquerade when it poses as Christian . But it is in her attitude toward the Scriptures that Mrs. Eddy is most brazenly unchristian . This shows itself , first , in literal contradiction ; for exegesis with her means acceptance of so much of the Bible as aligns itself with her hypotheses , and flat contradiction of the rest . Her pages bristle with assertions most strikingly opposed to the statements of the Book she loves so much , and the opposition extends , in many cases , to verbal gainsaying . But what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consistency of one whose theory of interpretation allows her to accept as revealed truth two chapters and five verses of Genesis because so much of it answers her needs , and to reject as Error 's Story the rest of the account , for the very acceptable reason that it fails to square with her ideas ! The fact is , Mrs. Eddy 's loving adoration of the Bible shrivels , under the light of investigation , to the crassest maudlin sentiment . She is innocent of exegesis . Eisegesis she has substituted for it , and she has done it clumsily . It often happens , however , that heresy in spirit is more serious than crime against the letter : and Mrs. Eddy 's is a case in point . Her philosophy is more blasphemous than her exegetical mutilation . The Bible has little or nothing to say as to the origin of evil ; for the account of the Fall is , after all , not an explanation , but a description . But it has a great deal to say on man 's attitude toward the problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more clearly than in the Book of Job : the book which , Mr. Froude tells us , " will one day be seen towering up alone , far away above all the poetry of the world . " I take it that that book teaches essentially three things as to suffering : first , that it is really here ; second , that God , if not its author , has , at least , an overseeing part in it ; and third , that the solution consists , not in denial of the fact , but in one 's attitude toward the fact . In one line ? magnificent and triumphant ? the man of Uz outlined the attitude toward suffering which found favor with God . " Though he slay me , yet will I trust him ; " that was the optimism of Job . And the whole Bible teaches no other . From Genesis to Revelation the word is , Endure ; and Christ himself never attempted to treat as anything less than fact the sorrow of the world , before his share of which even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightest Scriptural warrant for expecting immunity from pain . No rosy picture is anywhere drawn . The only solution of the problem from first to last is the old-fashioned trust of intelligent resignation . And the drama of Job , aligning itself with Scripture as a whole , teaches as plainly as drama can teach that faith is the only philosophy which can square with God 's demands ; that , as Mr. Froude puts it , " no clearer or purer faith is possible for man than that which Job achieved when he learned to feel that he could do without happiness , that it was no longer essential , that he could live on and still love God and cling to Him . " This is the answer of the Hebrew poem to the world 's great question : Be brave and trust ; for " only to those who have learned to say ' We can do without happiness , it is not what we ask or desire , ' is there no secret . " But for Christian Science the opposite is the truth . With a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a foolish claim of certainty is substituted for a majestic and triumphant faith . Suffering is no longer a mystery and trust is impossible . The grim philosophy of Job , which has seldom failed in history to lead to the sturdy faith that makes men , is swept away at a blow ; and in its place we have the effeminate bravery of a vulgar creed of certainty . Essentially it lacks nobility . If it had been regarded as truth from the first , history would have lost its chapter of heroes . It stands condemned by rational philosophy and shamed by Christian faith ; and by its fundamental opposition to the Scriptural theory of the solution of the problem of evil , it brands itself as criminally inconsistent . It is nothing less than blasphemy ? and blasphemy of the most insidious kind ? to distort the plain philosophy of the Bible , until it offers men the pathetic delusion that they are to escape completely the suffering , without a relatively large share of which no human being has been known to pass his threescore and ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : that a philosophy is proposed which assumes man made purposely for perfect happiness in this dispensation , ? an assumption at once gratuitous if observation base philosophy , and groundless if Holy Writ be the standard . It is not , as Dr. Wace said in a very different connection , that things ought not to be so explained , but that they can not be . Mrs. Eddy 's opposition to the spirit of the Bible is even more fundamentally heretical than her contradictions of its letter ; and the evidence of infidelity to professed standards , corroborating the evidence of historical , philosophical , and scientific weakness , points to the fact , or , ? if knowledge may never get higher than probability , ? to the extremely well-founded probability that Christian Science is , at the'best , a long , long way from the truth . The bald facts of life may be said to be the legitimate forbears of pessimism ; the possibilities of life the legitimate forbears of meliorism ; and rose-water optimism a bastard for which indifference , ignorance , or inexperience is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Material for it exists , no doubt ; but it is not obvious , does not obtrude like the other , ? must , indeed , be sought for with diligence , and marshaled , even whipped , into line before any serviceable theory results . That the Evil of the world is a reality , that improve-ment is a possibility , but that equation of facts with our highest desires is an extreme improbability : this is a creed to which , I suppose , the most wholesomely thoughtful among men would not hesitate to subscribe . " Panacea " and " Despair " are twin devil-words , which , despite their fascination , history has blotted from thoughtful language . Healthy-minded men , while they do not blind themselves by gazing straight at the sun , are broad enough , at the same time , not to turn backs to the sun and spend their lives with eyes on the shadows . Not to emphasize either the cloud or the lining , but to stand aside that we may see both , ? this is the liberalism of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improvement is also a fact ; and the honest seeker after truth must not look so intently at the former as to be blind to the latter . Men who have known what it is to suffer and to see others suffer are cruel if they are not ever ready to accept any innovation that gives promise of amelioration . But such men , aware of the terrifying power of disease , and of the pathetically helpless attitude which medicine must take before so many of its manifestations , will turn with a sickening sense of disappointment and disgust , and a humiliating feeling of tricked credulity , from the boastful claims of Christian Science . Its ridiculous extremism , unsupported by dignity , breadth , or logic , marks it unmistakably as charlatanry . It ignores the past , as it defies the future . It makes limitless claims , substitutes assertion for proof , prefers the captious to the logical , abounds in contradiction , never hesitates to shift ground when the enemy 's firing grows hot , answers unanswerable argument with suave evasion , contents itself with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is manifestly the work of others : in a word , exhibits absolutely no points of strength , courage , or consistency , but preserves an unbroken monotony of fantastical word-play that , were it true , 446 Christian Science . would be as hopelessly unpractical as , being false , it is hopelessly unappealing . And when all is said and done , what does it offer suffering men ? Why , this eminently satisfying advice : that to ignore obstacles is to overcome them ; that to avoid the precipice we must close our eyes and be blind to it ; that the darkness of night is to be illuminated by blowing out the stars i And what is the word with which we are sent back to a world of error and ignorance and sin and suffering ? That God 's service is the deadening of sensation ; that a world of bravely Struggling individuals must be transformed into a raft of logs : heroes and God 's men being the most thoroughly anmsthetized among them ! And yet it is interesting to inquire whether the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account for the presence in the world ? not of Christian Science , for that certainly can be given no place in so distinguished an evolution , but ? of the general mental movement of which it is but one , and that a pathological , manifestation . And I think the people who are fond of the word " inevitable " might use it with some effect in this connection . It might , for instance , be found that a movement , no matter how exorbitant , which tended to restrain a popular mind now in extravagant ecstasy over a purely natural method could , where it touched thought at all , only improve it . For it ought not to be forgotten that the great problem as to the ultimate nature of matter and spirit is not yet really laid ; nor assumed that it will ever be solved by a " wave of the critical hand . " History has , it is true , shown the practical results of spiritual intoxication : volatilization of activity with nothing more virile than asceticism left . But it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of activity , degradation of purpose , and worship of license that come when a people has " sucked ? got drunk ? at the nipple of sense . " And it may quite conceivably be true that we need , both in our philosophy and in our life , a reminder of the mental problem , so busy are we with the concerns of the physical . For Science , ? a loose enough word to be sure , but one suggesting pretty definitely the attitude of mind which inaccurate usage has associated with it , ? having passed her nonage and reached her proverbially dangerous majority , begins to assume the precarious function of making the traditions ; and mindful , perhaps , of the bullying to which she was subjected in youth , when the traditions had another source , she has in some instances begun to bully in turn . We have , for example , but the other day , seen a book ? the reasoning of which was pronounced from a high source to be a disgrace to the philosophy of Germany ? set the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after it like hungry sheep , for no better reason than that the author spoke the tongue of science like a native , ? the tongue from the vocabulary of which " authority " and its synonyms were once blotted with such gusto . It is quite easy , indeed , to forget the limits beyond which Roger Bacon long ago stated that scientific explanation had no right to go ; and , rushing into metaphysics , to indulge in dogmatism far more sweeping than that which is criticised so keenly in the opponents . But the simple fact remains that the question " Whence ? " still goes unanswered save for the old-fashioned reply ; and the chief objection to that rejoinder seems to be that it clashes , not with truth , but with the new traditions , ? which is a sort of reversed echo from the past with a ring Science ought to recognize . And while we can not complain if Science refuse to dally with that question , ? indeed the point is that her sphere lies entirely this side of it , and has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ? we are right in complaining if she presumes , with no more data than are now at hand , to answer it definitely with any other // word than the traditional one . Suggestive phenomena , too , keep crowding to the front with every advance in knowledge , which make it idle blandly to dismiss the metaphysical element in living activity . In calling attention to this limitation of a purely natural method , it is by no means necessary , of course , to degrade criticism to tirade . It would be idle , as it would be unjust , to attempt to detract from the glory of the recent triumphs of Natural Science . The term , indeed , has been not so much developed as made anew . Old fields have been worked out and fresh ones opened . New hypotheses , new methods , and a new spirit , ? what could these beget save an almost new world of thought ? Instruments hitherto undreamed of for their delicacy and ingenuity , a technique almost fantastic in some of its refinements , an equipment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wealth , a spirit almost religious in its enthusiasm , fidelity , high ideals , and intolerance of defect , ? these are some of the forces whose resultant we see in that array of facts and figures , laws and hypotheses , truths and guesses , which , massed together , we know as Science . And the questioner has known no bounds . Birth and death , hitherto restraints to inquiry , no longer block the way . Research refuses to confine her labors to the day of Life . She will prevent the morning ; and far into the dark , when only the stars are burning , she will carry the query with a brave spirit , a triumphant hope , and what light from the day her ingenuity can devise . " But do not conclude from this , " the mental philosophy might say , " that the whole problem has been cleared up . " The " Topsy " theory of things ? that they " just growed " ? has yet to prove itself the final theory ; Feuerbach 's definition of man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not given quite the complete satisfaction once prophesied and hoped for ; mental causation , as Martineau said , has not been successfully reduced to physical by diluting it with duration ; nor is there now any more reason than in Romanes 's day for concluding that , when " a phenomenon has been explained by means of natural causation , it has thereupon ceased to be ascribable to God . " It is , moreover , to put it mildly , hasty epistemology to echo the trite and tiresome monotone running through thought and literature to-day : We know only what we see or feel or taste or hear or smell ; " and any system , be it Christian Science or what not , which strikes a blow at this cheap sort of precipitate conclusion from quite inadequate data has , to that extent , struck for fairness , if not for the truth . But such considerations as these lead us somewhat afield ; for our most obvious task , in view of the popular identification of Christian Science with its therapeutics , is to determine whether this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? has really anything of value to offer orthodox medicine as regards either its theory or its practice . Now it must never be forgotten that the moment we make philosophical inquiry into the nature of disease we enter on a devious path leading through delicate metaphysical ground . The word itself hardly admits of exclusive definition ; and , though you have as you think never so satisfactory a theory , you will be sore put to it to understand or explain intelligently many pathological phenomena lying in the twilight realm between perfect health and outspoken disease . You can not draw sharp lines about disease by making it always depend on a pathological lesion , and so class those morbid phenomena , with apparently no such etiology , as illusory conditions . For that test is obviously impossible always to apply . Nor will it do to imagine that by introducing the word " neurasthenia " or " psychosis " the problem vanishes . For pain , one of the most constant and striking 448 Christian Science . manifestations of disease , is so obviously a subjective symptom that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only gives us no solution of the problem , but is a hair-fine distinction for the patient , whose testimony , after all , is the final witness as to the existence or non-existence of the condition in question . The problem of perception is , of course , elusive enough , attack it where you will ; but when the question is of such a nature that the perceptive faculties of more than one individual may be called into court , we have , at least , the law of probability to guide us . So that if one man sees a golden cross in the sky and a hundred thousand can not see it , the verdict can only be one way . " Illusory pain " can not , however , be so easily dealt with ; so that when Christian Science offers us a theory of disease which is manifestly not the true one , Medicine ought to remember that her own pathological theory of the thing , though perfectly satisfactory so far as it goes , ceases to be invulnerable where all natural reasoning begins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and " mental " conditions . As a matter of fact , technical terminology no more explains " illusional " pathological conditions unassociated with known lesions , than Christian Science explains ordinary organic disease . Virtually an orthodox physician yields to the Christian Science position when he talks of " appendicular hypochondriasis ; " but these and similar perfectly legitimate descriptive words are disingenuously assumed to be at the same time explanatory in a far different sense . So long , however , as we can not ourselves offer any explanation that is satisfactory , a bland dismissal of a theory of disease ? which emphasizes , even if it exaggerates , the mental factors of pathological condition s ? is unwarranted . For there are certainly clinical facts ? like the curious phenomena of hysteria ? far too suggestive to be waved away ; and to attempt to cover our low-sounding ignorance with high-sounding words is merely to substitute the pretentious Latin of the physician for the captious capitals of Mrs. Eddy , ? without any gain in the logical appeal . For the problem is a real one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side , quite as apparent " mental " phenomena ; between them , a mysterious link , the existence of which long ago ceased to be debatable . What sort of a theory is it which removes or lessens the mystery ? Certainly not the one Mrs. Eddy has given us , ? that to acknowledge the mental factors of disease or health is to make cancer a phantom . But when that is said the problem still looms , ? looms large despite a scientific shrug , an imposing dialect , a condescending smile . How satisfactorily to comprehend the etiological importance of mental states in disease , and the relation of tissue changes to psychoses ; how intelligently to apply to therapeutics the mental factor which present ignorance forces us to neglect altogether , or to treat as a mere plaything , ? these are the problems which the " mental " movement is giving over to science for solution . Christian Science may have succeeded in calling more emphatic attention to a neglected group of phenomena ; certainly it has failed satisfactorily to interpret them . But just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shun the issue or to regard the question as a closed one , the last word is very far from having been said on this mysterious subject . And all this theoretical consideration has a very practical bearing . For this much may at least be said : that , however great be the limitations in our theory , the relation of intelligence to disease is a clinical reality . In the large majority of patients ( most typically , perhaps , in those afflicted with tumors ) it is hard to conceive that this relation means anything at all : for there is not the slightest trustworthy evidence that the course of one of these has ever in a single instance been affected by the mental state . In others , however , the " habit of mind " seems to be an important factor in determining the occurrence or issue of disease , ? a proposition of no mystical nature if the well-established relation between " emotions " and physiological processes be kept in mind . And if this be true , as I think it is , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deduction which a generation destined to a high-tension life ( such as the coming generation will necessarily lead ) would do well to write on the tablets of their hearts . It is not mysticism , but the statement of clinical inference , to call Descartes ' motto ? " tacher toujours h me vaincre " t ? good hygiene as well as good philosophy ; and if the children of today , who are to-morrow 's men , be taught to overcome that sort of selfishness which centres attention on one 's own sensations , future health will have been potentially promoted by the relegation to history of that class who ? " habit , " with them , " tending toward disease " ( as Burton said ) ? enter the large army of the neurasthenics , and worry themselves into their graves . For the striking fact is that people of high intelligence and of natural or studied composure actually offer a stronger front to disease , other things being equal , than their weaker brethren . If a cancer single them out they will , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willing ; " but with a properly schooled mind the man of an average constitution , decently cared for , may actually avoid that great class of diseases which , though their etiology is not yet clear , are certainly furthered , if not started , by an improper mental attitude . High-minded and intelligent indifference to small but annoying ailments beyond cavil increases effectiveness and makes for health . The history of philosophy has grown up about three high aims of intellect . Theories of the Universe , theories of Knowledge , theories of Evil : these are the massive concept-systems which Aspiration has left pricking up into history , relieving the deeps of degeneration , and ribbing ? as mountain ranges stand out from a continent ? the dead flat of self-content . But Christian Science , exhibiting no constructive activity whatever , has certainly played no part in this creative work . No peak in the philosophical landscape reaches , after Mrs. Eddy 's vaporings , one whit nearer heaven . The most charitable thing to be said is that attention has again been called to certain glaring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
