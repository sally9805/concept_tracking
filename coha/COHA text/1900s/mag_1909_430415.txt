AS FOR ME , I am a country man by feeling , inheritance and inclination . The good old mother , still living in the old home in the country , portrays to me a character as strong and enduring as time itself . The spirit of her life has been so unselfish , so uncomplaining , so steadfastly honest , true and sincere as to inspire and ennoble every friend or acquaintance who knows her . With this great life before me , I can not for one moment feel that the normal country woman has a narrower field than her city sister . My personal experiences , based upon a life largely spent in the country , do not give the prominence to isolation that most observers have been inclined to emphasize . A stranger in the city is usually more isolated than one in the country . I am ready to admit , however , that some of the old-time isolation does exist yet ; but I do insist that modern conveniences , better modes of living and a freer commingling with other people have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to farm life . Before the telephone was known , before the free delivery of mail was introduced , and before even the women 's magazines and the daily papers were generally available , there was much isolation . But the isolation of today is not the solitude of the dungeon house of yesterday . I have seen more cheer , more real joy and happiness and more true fellowship mixed up among women who live in the so-called isolated farm homes than among women of the city . Nor does living in the country narrow . The charge that in going from city to country is to give up freedom , friends and social development is untrue . What follows is a change of point of view . The very things so much prized in the city give way to more important duties , richer in feeling and deeper in satisfaction . There follows not less of freedom but more of liberty and independence ; not fewer friends but more faithful and true companions ; not less of social advantages but a redirected notion of social joys ? a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sympathy . The country woman meets with her neighbors just about as frequently as does her city sister , and if she desires to increase the number of such visits it is within her power to do so . The social standards of the city are taken , as a rule , from the leisure class ; of the country , from the busy , working class . The leisure class of the country gives itself over to recreation and social activity as freely as the leisure class of the city ; and the busy , enthusiastic workers of the country have just as much time for recreation and for interchange of social duties and requirements as the working class of cities and towns . Indeed , it may be said that if there is anything in favor of either , it is with those of the country ; for there are many seasons of the year when neither farm duties nor home duties are especially pressing , a condition that enables both men and women to enjoy these opportunities to their limit . In many cases ? in the majority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of spending an afternoon or evening with congenial friends is not utilized . Many , however , do so ; why not all ? The fault is not of the environment , but of the people themselves . Good roads have opened up many possibilities of social intercourse , and in this direction more and more is still to come . So long as birds and flowers and household duties are required , there is neither solitude nor isolation , especially if the mind has been trained to know how to make the most of these .  | The secret of the whole thing is to give woman a better chance . In too many homes she has been a drudge and a slave . She works too hard and too much . She must be content with old contrivances , with old appliances , while her lord and master indulges in new tools and machines as fast as they appear . Woman 's emancipation begins when books and magazines are delivered by the mail carrier , when a library or sitting room is fitted up , when water is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handled by the men or not at all , and when modern conveniences are made permanent fixtures of the home . When she has these things her home life is neither isolated nor barren . The woman who never reads , who does not appreciate the society of birds , flowers and country people , who makes her work mere drudgery , finds isolation indeed a harsh reality and her lot one of weary toil and a hardship . This woman might be better contented in a city flat . To a woman with great strength of character , with clear ideas and warm sympathy , who knows what she wants , isolation is not a bugbear . She will secure those things necessary for her growth and comfort ; she will banish discontent from her house and she will establish a new order of things . The most undesirable features of the farm home today are the primitive ways of living . City people have eliminated a great many of these primitive customs , and women have profited in proportion as the completeness of the change has been effected . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; because of them the country woman is dissatisfied ; and I for one do not blame her . For one thing , she has become a more refined being . The fibers of her nature are more delicate . The disagreeable conveniences of the old-time isolated farm home have become irksome , distasteful and out of place as a part of the domicile of this very intense , very nervous and very intellectual creature . What is needed , therefore , is not more wealth or society , or more social activity , but instead a new standard of home living , a new arrangement of home and house things that shall provide for this noble queen with a dignity and appreciableness more in keeping with her nature and demands . Hence all of these things that mean refinement , a higher plane of living , a closer association with what is going on in the world , will bring her happiness and fit her for the complete fulfillment of her sphere on the farm or in the town . Eight steps in advance In the first place , let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Second , make over the house so that the bathroom may be provided . Third , indulge in an occasional trip or visit to nearby and distant points . Fourth , utilize more freely all intellectual advantages , like lectures , books , papers and magazines . Fifth , devote less time to mere manual work , substituting new conveniences and better methods for the old ways of performing household duties . Sixth , secure a better-arranged kitchen . and make water and drainage available to it . Seventh , introduce modern comforts throughout the house like better lights , up-to-date methods of heating , comfortable furniture and home furnishings . Eighth , give attention to the home labor problem , so the drudgery work which so frequently falls to the woman 's lot may be taken from her shoulders . This means that churning , washing , ironing and other common tasks will be done by modern tools and appliances . All of these suggestions can be introduced easily , quickly and inexpensively . In many modern farm homes they have been introduced already . I am confident that if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them will be forthcoming . What if a little sacrifice be necessary ; it would be less than the daily sacrifice of mother and daughters in the usual routine as now necessary in the great majority of farmhouses . But , gentle reader , you must initiate these things yourself . Your husband may mean well , but oh , he is so slow ! Just start in , figure up the bill , get the plans made and then spunk up ! And never waiver . You 'll win and every decent man will back you . In too many farm homes the plan has been to provide every outside desirable thing , leaving the needs of the home to the very last . A good , comfortable-looking house and a somewhat ramshackle barn may not stand for wealth , but it shows the men folk have some respect for the women of that home . I never see a big , fine-looking barn with a small , ill-kept house and yard that I do not think the man who owns the place is more of a beast than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than of his wife and children .  | The men will gradually improve , but in the meantime let the women who want more comfort and pleasure , who wish to live on a higher plane , plan some things that will redirect country life into such channels as will bring in the biggest rewards and secure for the women folk needed improvements for which these reforms stand . In some cases two or three years will be required for planning and completing , but what delightful planning it will be ! The family that sets about to secure these things , to make over their country home for respectable women to live in , has a great deal of pleasure in store . The simple anticipation of the thing will be worth all its costs . But , dear madam , some of the fault is yours , too . How many spare bedrooms have you ? How many best dishes and how much best tableware have you ? What about the parlor carpets and parlor wallpaper and extra things ? You have all these , but you set them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who is the best company ? Are not husband and children the best company ? Abandon these spare bedrooms , open up the parlor windows and let the family have the use of every part of the house . Do n't save your best dishes for company ; your husband and children are the best company , and to you are worth more than all other company in the world . All of this means that the woman herself must have a clear notion of her work . She needs to know how to arrange the kitchen , how to set the table , what to provide for in the living ' room , how to make the home cozy and comfortable . More than this , she needs to know how to get the best effect in arranging her hair and clothing ; what is good taste in music and pictures ; and . in addition , she needs to know a good deal about the real sciences of cooking and household work . Here is where the real art of housekeeping and of happiness begins in the home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this difficulty will be overcome , for the reason that in time every country girl ? and she will soon preside in a home ? will receive instruction in home making as she now does in other things , many of which have no direct bearing on her work in life . I am not at all satisfied with the instruction work as required in our school courses , but if you insist , I will agree to let the teachers have their way of living up to the old traditions and teaching my daughter about many foolish things , but I do want them to consider some of the more useful things , and inform her about and instruct her in some studies that will help her in a practical way when she has a home of her own . Woman is now the pillar of the church , and she can do still more in that dire &; tion . But in this work she will be more of a helper than a leader , because this problem largely rests with the country minister and his wife . Nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an occasional lesson in domestic science , when this work gets under way . Other than these occasional opportunities the country school and the country church will not enter largely into improving the farm , excepting through channels of better education for oncoming generations . The club has possibilities in rural communities , but its attraction will in all likelihood be along different lines from those now promoted in cities and towns . In addition to the club , there is available , and should be used to its full limit , every other line of social work and activity , like the grange , the farmers ' club and the gatherings at home . In communities where the grange or the farmers ' club exists , great satisfaction has followed . In some places these clubs have been developed very far , giving to the men , women and children of the farm every outlet for social growth and pleasure . Community forms of recreation , while still in their infancy , are rich in possibilities . Women 's clubs or granges as units of organization could study these problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , picnics and other enterprises that tend to solidify community interests , will in time be developed and will do much in way of adding charm , enthusiasm and life to the rural social activities . And back of all are the social affairs of the home : those of the family , the visits of relatives mid congenial friends , all of which make glad the hearts and make beautiful the joys of the country home . After all , the problem is a joint affair . and it will be solved in time . As men grow out of their little conceits , become more mindful of what it is to love and cherish , they will more willingly co-operate and more freely sink their selfish notions ; then woman will be more generously enthroned in her place and the farm will possess the delights now denied it , but rightly its own , and the country woman 's outlook will open up to all of its beauty and grandeur .  |                  @ @ @
