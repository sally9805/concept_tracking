We started in to fight the miners ' union , and We propose to continue that fight to the end . " As for the report of a conference of the z ailroad Presidents , I do not care to say anything about it one way or the other. ? Certainly there is no settlement , conference or no conference .

I do not know of any representatives of the miners coming to see me . " William Pierson Hamilton of the firm of J. Pierpont M ? rga:n &; Co. yesterday afternoon declined to make a statement about the conference supposed to have taken place in the office of his firm .

President Thomas of the Erie Railroad , Rho was reported to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' absolutely denied that he had made any such statement .

Central had certainly not . been represented . - John Edrncrndsr-agent of the Philadelphia arid  --  Reading Coal and Iron Company , , said that he had heard nothing Of . such- a conk fer*n.Ce. ** o'clock , ' r.he ' said .  --  a friend of mine , a coal agent in Wall Street , telephoned me that the anthracite coal strike had been settled .

Manley , and Fred S. Gibbs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State and Senator Penrose of Pennsylvania were consulted . The session lasted more than two hours . Senator Hanna was very reticent when asked about what was being done to settle the strike , and professed to know nothing about it . " But you went to see J. Pierpont Morgan , the head of the coal syndicate yesterday and to-day to see what could be done about a settlement , did n't yon ? " the Senator was asked . I was at Mr. Morgan 's office , " he replied , " but I went there to see a man from St. Paul . " " Have you been informed that a settlement has been reached ? " " No , " Senator Hanna answered ; " I have heard that some of Markle 's men have returned to work , but about all the information I have is what I glean from the newspapers . " It is reported , however , that Senator Hanna is not only doing all in his power to end the strike , but that he almost succeeded in averting it before it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but for the interference of a selfconstituted committee that upset his plans .
