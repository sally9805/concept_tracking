txt The Oceanic crossed the Bar at 10:10 o'clock . The mirage was seen at its best by the scant two hundred passengers on the steamer Sandy Hook on her 9:35 o'clock trip from West Forty-second Street . The vessel had passed West Bank Light , and most of her people were outdoors forward enjoying a fresh breeze , which was largely of her own making , when , with many exclamations of astonishment , they saw the small Romer Shoal Lighth , ause slowly transformed into a ? towering Pharos , while a sandsucker steamer. working on the Ambrose Channel further out , assumed the lofty pro'portions of a line of battleship of a century ago . Seaward a vast , cubical bulk was seen advancing . Gradually it rose higher and higher ; then a ray of horizontal light s'hot across its surface , and the surprised spectators beheld two images of the Oceanic , both right side up , but clear and distinct from each other , - advancing at full speed , throwing mighty surges from their prows . The two wakes stretched far behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vision became a huge box and continued to sink until but one ship was seen , and that at length seemed submerged to within three or four feet of the upper deck , from which , towered the twin straw colored smokestacks to apparently more than a hundred feet . The Oceanic was within two miles of the harbor boat before she assumed her every-day appearance .

BUSINESS CARD ON $20 BILLS . The Alleged Offender , an Englishman , Says He Did n't Do It .

The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firm , when his cashier called his attention to the vandalism , was wrathy . What made the broker hot was the fact that the name stamped on the bills was the business card of an Englishman representing an English company in New York . Somewhere in the back of his head the Wall Street man had a recollection that it was about as serious an offense to deface currency as to use the flag for advertising purposes . He made inquiry of the United States District Attorney and learned that there is a Federal statute attaching a penalty of $100 to just such an offense . The broker wondered whether he really ought to get after the offender , but when he figured up how much the thing might cost him he decided to let the matter drop . The business card stamped on the bills read : " Gloster Armstrong , representing the Manchester Ship Canal Company , 11 Broadway .
