txt The fight of Mr. JEROME against the bosses means the fight of the people for the right to choose good officers . It can have no value or urgency unless he who makes the fight has himself been a good officer . Bosses of some sort 1 there will always be , for there is no such thing as united action for any length of time by a large mass of men unless there is organization , and no such thing as effective organization without leadership . If Mr. ODELL and Mr. MURPHY were wise and honest leaders , pursuing sincere views of the public good by legitimate means , including the nomination of candidates fitted for their duties , Mr. JEnomE could have no quarrel with them , nor could we . On the other hand , If Mr. JEROME , rejected by the leaders , were himself unfitted for the place he seeks , if he could not indeed be shown to be extremely well fitted for that place , the fight he is making would not interest us . As a matter of fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an extraordinarily able , sound , energetic , impartial , and successful District Attorney , and , therefore , has proved that in a second term he will be even more useful . It is precisely because of his unusual qualities that the bosses would have none of him at first , while one of them has yielded reluctantly to the overwhelming pressure of public opinion . So Mr. JEROME stands plainly as the representative of the people 's right to choose good officers . A glance at his record will show it . There is hardly a form of crime and vice infesting this great city that Mr. JEROME has'not attacked with all the powers of his office and with surprising efficiency . He has broken up the big gambling houses which four years ago were carried on ' behind the flimsiest veil of secrecy , with large profits to the owners , with serious demoralization for the weak , and to the obvious disgrace of the city . Of these CAN-FIELD 'S was the type , and his fate has involved the most conspicuous and mischievous of the others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it Mr. JEROME was obliged to secure from a Republican Legislature special action that was resisted not only by the gamblers , but by allied interests . Mr. JEROME has done much to repress and limit the lower and even more vicious forms of gambling , pool-selling. and policy playing , though these are naturally more difficult to reach or fully to exterminate . It is certain that in another term he can do more , and that he will . The most revolting and cruel form of vice in this city has been that which prevailed in the " red light " districts , prostitution of the lowest sort , accompanied by the organized ruin of young women at the hands of professional betrayers , the infamous " cadets . " It is the testimony of all with opportunities for correct information that this base traffic has practically been ended by 1 the vigorous and untiring prosecutions . of Mr. JEROME . A kindred form of viciousness and lawlessness found its home in the " Raines law hotels . " To deal with this legislation was found necessary and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JEROME . Under the old law a good deal was done , and under the new still more will be done . In the field of less disgusting but hardly less dangerous vice , Mr. JEROME has found many notable cases to prosecute . Along with ADAMS . the " Policy King , " he has sent to prison the lawyer who furnished advice to the famous Miller scheme for getting rich quick ; ROTHSCHILD , the President of the Federal Bank ; HARLAN , the pawnbroker convicted of receiving stolen goods ; a half dozen lawyers guilty of the petty forms of swindling to which the poor are especially exposed ; SAM PARKS , the betrayer of the trades unions , and a lot " business men " engaged in the ordinary forms of cheating their creditors . We do not claim that Mr. JEROME has been a faultless prosecuting attorney . He has made his mistakes , which we have from time to time criticised . But he has unquestionably been a remarkably efficient and successful and a perfectly honest officer . A secondary but immensely important effect , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the amount of corruption dile to the sale of prdtection " Am:evildoing he has so persistently and effectually run down . The two sources of this corruption which yielded the greatest revenue and secured the most mischievous protection were undoubtedly the gambling and the disorderly houses , and from these sources the revenue has greatly been lessened , for the simple reason that proteetfOn can no longer surely be attained . If Mr. JEanME had done nothing else for the city , his - service would be very great , and his claim to re-election would be completely established . When we remember that it is precisely because of his relentless and ipractical war on corruption and the means of corruption that the bosses were opposed to him , the duty o ; all sensible and honest citizens to support him9s almost too plain for argiiment . It must be addyd that his office has been conducted with absolute independence of all partisan considerations , and , if he be elected , will continue to be .                @ @ @ @ @
