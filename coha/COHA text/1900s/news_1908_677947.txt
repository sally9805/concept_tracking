txt Mrs. Betty Green , : according to an interview published in The Traveler , and signed by a newspaper man of excellent standing , today talked of the financial situation , : politics , and the Vanderbilt family. , Concerning finance she is quoted as saying ' that the effect of the recent , ' flurry , which she attributes largely to : President Roosevelt , is not yet over. : " What should an old lady like me know about politics ? " she inquired , responding to a question . Then she answered her own inquiry by saying that " some men in pretty high places , out of the kindness of their hearts , keep me posted . " On the basis of that she says the Taft canvas at the proper moment is to be turrred , over for the benefit of President Roosevelt , who is to be the Republican nominee . " I saw this situation to have said , talking of the money flurry . " I said then that the rich were approaching the brink ; and that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could not ignore . Some of the solidest men of the Street came to me and wanted to unload all sorts of things , from palatial resl.dences to automobiles . The New York Central quietly negotiated with rue for a big loan , and that made me sit up and do some thinking , for that road is one of the wealthiest in the world . " There had been an enormous inflation of values , and when the unloading process was begun the holders of the se , curities found great difficulty in getting real money from the public . The stringency was felt by the big brokers and manipulators long before the people had any inkling that such a condition existed . Never Buys Real Estate . 0 / saw the handwriting on the wall and began quietly to call in my money , making a few new transactions and getting into my bands every available dollar of My fortune against the day I knew was coming : Every real estate deal which I couldpossibly close up was converted into cash . I never buy real estate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crash game I had money , and I was one of the very few who really lied it . The others had their ' securities ' and their ' values . ' I had the cash . and they had to come to me . They did come to me in droves . Scme of them 1 lent money to , and some I did not . That w.is my privilege . Those to whom 1 loaned my money got it at ? 6 per cent . I I nik:lit just as easily have secured 40 i per cent . But never in my life , no mat-i ter what has been said against me have I practiced usury , and no one knciws it Letter than the wealthy men who have Lad business dealings with me . " Aside from the ' financiers ' I went to the relief of many others engaged in ' legitimate ' business . Nearly all the big department stores in New , York came to rue , and I loaned them money . Harry ! Payne ' Whitney applied for a loan of *1,000,00 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Refused Vanderbilt Jewels . " I loaned money to the New York Central , but when the Vanderbilt family applied I refused them . They came to me some Itttle time ago  --  that was before the wedding  --  and brought a box two feet long containing the famous Vanderbilt jewels . They wanted me to take them as security and lend them money . But , Lord bless you , I know nothing about diamonds and such things . This may have been worth all that was claimed , but I do n't deal in diamonds . I know a few things about real estate mortgages , but ' hot jewels . I have no use for them in my business . " They say that Mrs. Cornelius Vanderbilt Is going to marry a Hungarian Count She ought to have a guardian instead . Her husband - was one of God 's anointed , one of the finest men I ' ever knew . He gratified every whim of his , ? wife , and she , poor woman , thinks that every other man in the world is like him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreigner . New York Central 's ' stare . ? If she marries him the control of the Vanderbilt system of railroads will pass out of the family 's hands . The millions which Gladys brought to her husband have been shipped to Hungary , and the =other millions which her mother will have I to give up if she marries her Count will be shipped to Hungary . That leaves the other members of the family.in the position of having to purchase the railroad securities held by the two women , and to pay cash for them . Those foreigners wo n't take our securities . When they marry us they demand real money , and ' they get it . Can the Vanderbilt family pay the price ? Well " Money is easier than ft was a spell back , as every one knows . Why should not it be after the rain of Government dollars which Corte/you poured into the ' bank 's ? But that is merely first aid to tile Injured . It does n't correct the evil . The hard times are bound to continae @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen no one knows . - Ultimately the financial situation will adjust itself , but ? not on the past inflated basis . Personally , have faith in American business institutions. , and as soon as this faith spreads again to the people the financial depression will he a thing of the past , and not till then . " It was- C ? taSed by this very lack of faith : A gera many things contributed to the loss of confidence . Roosevelt is partly to blame ; but /lid wholly . In injk " opinion , the President has not made goot7.1 ' What would you think if I were to say every day for years thae.I was going : out and kill a muskrat , and then never . did KT- What has he accomplished , aside // HETTY GREEN TALKS . CASH AND POLITICS Oondirrnea from Page 1 . from helping to create the present situ. ation ? " You say you have an admiration for President Roosevelt ? Have you got 1$ still ? Yes ? Young man , I am tempted to feel your bumps . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the evils of high finance , as he said he would ? What has he actually done , except to wield the big stick ? I/collectible Elam " The result has been the imposition of enormous fines that ca n't be oollected . Or at least I have n't heard that they have been . Still , Roosevelt should not be Held solely responsible . The muckrakers started the loss of confidence campaign , and the courts have continued it . " You ask me what I know about politics . Nothing- . How should an old lady like me know about such things ? But , of course , I 've heard things . Some men in pretty high places , out of the kindness of their hearts , keep me posted . They tell me about the 1-residential situation , for instance . " All this talk about Taft being the nominee of the Republican Party is moonshine . The real leaders understand the true situation . The scheme is to pose Taft before the country as the President 's choice . He will get all the delegates he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in the convention . Ho knows it , and everybody else on the Inside knows it . When it becomes apparent that he ca n't carry the convention . Taft will get up and proclaim that Theodore Roosevelt is demanded by the country , or if he does n't ' somebody else in authority will . Taft 's whole strength will be thrown for Roosevelt , and Teddy ' . will sweep the convention like a prairie fire . He will have to accept the nomination then . It Is a beautiful scheme , and will probably win . " But if for any unforeseen reason A , does n't ? Roosevelt 's future I8 all provided for . He will succeed Platt in the United States Senate . If Roosevelt Is nominated he will be elected . There are 7,000 foreigners to the acre in the Bronx who are aching for a chance to vote for him . His attacks against the moneyed powers have worked them into a frenzy of approval . Taft is merely the nominal man of the hour . He will not make a real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ term . Prosperity Is Doe . " In speaking of the President and the present hard times , I am not actuated by bitter feelings . The hard times have n't hurt me any . I might have made millions at the rates asked for loan money , but was satisfied with 6 per cent . There is no real need of any legitimate business enterprises suffering . except as they have become involved through the panic among the stock gamblers and high financiers . The country still contains all the elements of prosperity , and it will come back when conditions are right . " People sometimes wonder , " she said , in ending the interview , " why I spend so much time and energy in defending lawsuits . j do n't dare not defend them . I would n't dare be known as an ' easy mark . ' All my life I have struggled against being considered one , and I think I have succeeded fairly well . " It is the principle of the thing-I am fighting for . A few dollars more or ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inheritances left me by my dear father was this injunction : ' Hetty. be honest always , upright , cad just ; never take a dollar that does n't helong to you , and never take an unfair advantage of any one . And above all things , fight for your rights . As-long.as you have health , fight . ' " And , " concluded Mrs. Green , with , ' . a whimsical smile . " as I am still enjoying very good health . I am still fighting . '
