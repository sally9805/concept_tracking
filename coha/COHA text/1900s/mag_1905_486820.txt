We extend our sincere sympathy to Benjamin B. Odell , jr . After reading his testimony before the insurance inquiry on Thursday last , it is apparent that a more misunderstood statesman never figured in American political life . Mr. Odell has apparently been pursued for years by some malign fate which has sought , by means of astounding coincidences and misleading appearances , to entangle this good man in such a way as to all but destroy his fine reputation and to dig that premature political grave beside which Thomas C. Platt already stands weeping . After studying Mr. Odell 's career , it is easy to understand how innocent men are hanged on circumstantial evidence . The brain of Poe himself could not have woven a more astounding mesh of false inferences with which to bind and deliver an innocent hero to his enemies than that from which Mr. Odell is struggling to cut himself loose . Mr. Odell is a man of a peculiarly sensitive nature , which leads him to burn c. ith indignation whenever he beholds injustice , particularly if the public is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anger flamed forth when he discovered that , through Alexander &; Green an 1 the Mercantile Trust Company , widows and orphans were being fleeced of their all by alluring prospectuses of no less than fifteen stock-jobbing companies , conceived in infamy and brought forth for purposes of plunder . At once the Governor sends for Senator Ambler and declares that the wrong must stop . Forthwith this fellow-purist introduces a bill repealing the charter of the Fireproof Warehousing Company , under which the Mercantile Trust Company was doing its business . This was ever the Governor 's impulsive way -- show him a wrong and he would draft you overnight a bill to stop it . But , on sober second thought , this knight-errant recalls that he himself has a claim against the Mercantile Trust Company , quite forgotten in the heat of his ire  --  and this is coincidence number one . With his usual delicate feeling about what is right and proper in a public officer , Mr. Odell sees that his action would be misinterpreted ? curiously enough , it already had been by some newspapers  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orphans and other lambs might be sheared , but their rescue should not be purchased by the staining of the Governorship . Rather than injure the good name of the State through its executive , the Governor put his indignation aside , and the Mercantile Trust wolves had leave to continue to pull down their prey . Meanwhile . of course , as Mr. Odell hell that the Governor of the Empire State should not be concerned with Shipbuilding bonds  --  since they had proved worthless-4/1e once nlOre showed his readiness to injure himself at the behest of duty by selling these bonds at a loss of $125,482.36 . It is , we submit , merely coincidence number two that they should have been purchased when Mr. Odell was serving his first term as Governor . Must not a governor , like other people , invest his moneys ? But the Governor , freed by the sale , felt that some punishment must be meted out to those who had betrayed him . Hence his suit against the Mercantile Trust  --  and more astounding coincidences . It was an accident , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offices of Mr. Harriman , with whom the Governor never had any business relations . And there Mr. Odell informed Mr. Hyde of the stern decision he had arrived at that there should be no legislative punishment of the Trust Company . Noblesse oblige . Mr. Hyde knew how to respond in kind , and the check for $75,000 was promised , though not until further negotiation had taken place . By another unhappy coincidence , long before this happy conclusion had been reached , Mr. Odell 's sense of duty impelled him to advocate the election to the Senate of some other person than Senator Depew , since 1877 a director and a legal adviser of the Equitable , which owned the Mercantile Trust . There was absolutely nothing behind Mr. Odell 's opposition to Mr. Depew but a worthy desire to improve the State 's representation at Washington . But , as he himself afterwards admitted , he had misread the sentiment of the up-State Republicans . When he found that he had erred , and that Mr.Depew 's retention was the wish of the party , he announced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that he withdrew his all-powerful opposition , and that Mr. Depew would continue to represent the State  --  and the Equitable  --  in the Senate . Alas ! his cruel fate had one more terrible blow in store for him in the shape of another , on its face , damning coincidence . That same clay , December 30 , 1904 , in his morning 's mail , Mr. Odell found the long-promised check for $75,000 from the Mercantile Trust Company . Mephistopheles himself could not have planned more subtly to undo virtue . To make matters still worse , busybodies are recalling that when Mr. Odell receded from his opposition to Senator Depew , Senator Brackett charged him with saying that he must do so or break with his " dearest friend " ? an unofficial explanation which , if true , would , after all , merely reflect Mr. Odell 's loyalty to his friends . Nor is there reason to criticise Mr. Odell because at Mr. Harriman 's request he wrote to Mr. Roosevelt urging Mr. Hyde 's appointment as ambassador to France . This was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his $75,000 , but was merely an example of bla Christian readiness to do a good turn ito one who had wronged him . It is quite absurd to insinuate that , in aiding Mr. Hyde 's ambition , Mr. Odell was also aiding his " dearest friend " to get Hyde out of the country , so that the " dearest friend " might get at the Equitable 's surplus . It was again only a coincidence that the letter should have been sent before Mr. Odell received his check of $75,000 . Truly , as a victim of so many trying coincidences , we believe Mr. Odell to merit the sympathy , not the carping , of every charitable soul . THE UNHOLY ALLIANCE . Mr. Hyde 's testimony last week stripped away the last shreds of the veil behind which grafting financiers and grafting politicians have been hiding . Suspicion has now become certainty . We see the whole politico-financial conspiracy revealed . It was not only great speculators who were driven wild by the sight of the vast life-insurance surpluses ; politicians also went frantically to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge accumulation . The dovetailing of greed and corruption , in finance and politics , is now clearer to the public vision than ever before . Mr. Hyde , with either the innocence of an enfant terrible , or the quiet resolve of a man with his back to the wall to tell the whole truth , has given the world a picture of the unscrupulous politician in alliance with the conscienceless financier , which no subsequent protests or attempts at correction can blur . Ex-Gov . Odell , for example , is a ruined man . " Questions of veracity " between the masters of many millions are always " painful " for a society in which wealth has insensibly come to be a synonym for virtue . We shall not undertake to decide whether Mr. Hyde or Mr. Harriman committed perjury , but may remark that the chief issue between them is narrower than some seem to suppose . It is simply whether Mr. Harriman did or did not suggest to Mr. Hyde that Odell ought to have his demands satisfied because he was so powerful politically . if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what Albany correspondents and the New York newspapers were saying week after week . It was " in the air " that Odell was too big a politician to be trifled with by any mere millionaire , vulnerable at many points . Whatever is to be said of the ex-Governor 's explanations , it is clear as daylight that Odell has now to fight for his political life . Whether or not his exculpation be pronounced technically and legally adequate , the blow has fallen upon him , and the signal for an assault upon the stronghold of his power , the State Chairmanship , has been given both at Albany and Washington . Odell is a man of great vigor and determination , and has many political resources . He may , for a time , sustain himself : but if he ( Ices , he will Sink 101 porte Jtl ihip State , In the field of national politics , too , we have further details of the same unholy alliance . Republican fingers burned to get at trust funds . The Equitable also paid $50,000 to elect Theodore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been the " assessment " of each of the big companies by the National Committee . Treasurer Bliss , Mr. Hyde testified , got that amount at the expense of the Equitable policyholders , the plain understanding being that " many large corporations " were also contributing heavily . And yet we seem to remember a fine moral indignation at Judge Parker for asserting this to be the case a year ago . If our memory serves , a heated document issued from the White House on that subject . True , Judge Parker made specific allegations of blackmail by Mr. Cortelyou , which he could not sustain ; and the President 's denials were technically correct . Still , if the facts now known had been known last November , the public would have thought the case as bad as Judge Parker asserted . But all this was before Mr. Hyde went to the White House to ask for the ambassadorship to France in return for the Equitable 's contribution . On this point , Mr. Hyde testimony is illuminating . To be sure , Treasurer Bliss re- , quested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but that did not prevent the saviours from coming in for something handsome . Both he and Mr. Frick felt that Mr. Hyde 's qUalifications for the Embassy at Paris rose with every $25,000 he took from the policyholders to give to the campaign fund ; and they backed him  --  or fooled him  --  to the top of his bent . This matter can not rest here . We have had a good deal of financial housecleaning , in consequence of the insurance revelations , but the political housecleaning is yet to come . And there can be no doubt who should take charge of it . President Roosevelt is the leader of the party which has been sadly smirched . He himself stands as the presumptive beneficiary of the concealed gifts of corporations . It is beside the point to say that his great popular majority showed the shady financial soliciting of his committeemen to have been unnecessary . Neither he nor they knew it to be unnecessary . The money was asked for on the ground that it was indispensable . These huge sums were taken and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That he did not , in fact , need the tainted money , does not excuse its being sought and accepted ; nor does it relieve him from the duty of publicly repudiating his agents ( which he has not yet done ) , and taking vigorous measures to prevent the repetition of such scandals as those with which they have stained the Republican party . We look to President Roosevelt 's forthcoming message for plain speaking on this subject , and for recommendation of laws to prevent his party , or any party , from disgracing itself and debauching the electorate with money secretly and corruptly obtained from corporations . Only by some such step can Mr. Roosevelt both clear his own skirts and do the country a service for which the times are crying out . THE IMPROVED BALLOT IN PRAC-TICE . Thus far , in the agitation for ballot reform in this State , we have heard little but a priori reasoning . Such and such a form must necessarily have such and such an effect ; this provision will encourage independent voting ; that will serve as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the perplexing questions of legal marking . It is perfectly possible , however , to show not what would , should , could , or might be accomplished by an enlightened form of ballot , but what actually has been so accomplished . There are at present six States whose election laws embody the essential principle of all the model ballots suggested for this State  --  namely , the elimination of the straight-ticket circle . Last year there were seven , but Rh.ode Island , thanks to her Republican organization , last winter exchanged the excellent Massachusetts ballot for one similar to our wretched New York type . One of the remaining six , Montana , has a ballot arranged on the party-column plan ; that is , the names of each party 's nominees from the highest to the lowest are printed in a separate column , as in this State , but there is no emblem at the top and no method by which a straight ticket may be voted at one operation . If a man desires to vote for the Republican candidates in a body , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each of the said Republicans . The other five have the names of candidates grouped according to offices . New York has always prided herself on an exceptionally active independent sentiment in politics and a large non-partisan vote . Let us see how the amount of independent voting here compares with that in the States which use enlightened ballots . It is not possible in most of the States to determine accurately the extent of split ticket voting . A convenient method of approximating it , however , is to add the vote of the two great parties for every office , and find what proportion each bears to the total . Then , by comparing either party 's percentage for the office on which it does best with that on which it does worst , we obtain a figure which roughly represents the net amount of ticket-splitting . On this basis we find that in the election of 1904 in New York the difference in relative vote between the highest and lowest State officers was 1.88 per cent . In 1902 the vote for Cunneen for Attorney-General , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was but .47 per cent . more than that for his least successful colleague on the ticket for executive officers ; of the judicial candidates there is more to be said . Following are the corresponding figures for the States with more progressive ballots : deleted table This table is not merely a political curiosity . The figures are vital , because the amount of split-ticket voting is also an inverse measure of the chance which a bad or unfit candidate has of being " pulled through " by a good one . We have thought it fairest to compare here the members of the State administrative tickets only . There have been many occasions in New York where there was much splitting of tickets with re-gard to some one office , especially if that were judicial . Thus , if Judge Gray 's vote be compared with that of the Dem4ocrat who ran farthest behind the State ticket in 1902 , the difference amounted to 8.67 per cent . Mr. Jerome 's vote represents nearly five times as much independent voting as that . But such results have been secured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30,000 ahead of his ticket . in Missouri , where the only method of splitting was to write in his name on the Republican strip ballot . Great movements brush aside all such obstacles . The peculiar service of a really good ballot is that , by requiring the voter to scrutinize  --  at least to look at . ? every name , it brings about discriminating voting among even minor offices . We have here classed together all the ballots lacking the straight-ticket circle . whether or not they adopt the group by offices , and we see that all except Maryland showed high percentages of independent voting in their recent elections . The converse of this must be remembered , too . Take any one of the excellent ballot forms proposed for this State , and place somewhere upon the sheet a series of spaces where a straight Re1publican or Democratic ticket may he voted by a single cross or stamp , and the ballot becomes at once very little better than our present one . To put such a provision in a ballot law otherwise good is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it was done in Pennsylvania . Both these States have the semblance without the substance of a good ballot . New York should be warned in time against any similar attempt . THE PANAMA MUDDLE . With each new step forward at Panama , we seem fated to take two backwards . If anybody chose to r , ue that there had all along been a conspiracy to delay matters and to heap up expense and finally to disgust the American people with the whole project , we must say that he could point to a good deal of presumptive evidence . Saturday 's decision by the board of consulting engineers would not be the least item of it . It is an unhappily divided report which is to be made to the President , the nice question on which side the weight of technical opinion really lies not being determinable until names and details are given . Mr. Roosevelt will have to refer the conflicting plans to Congress ; and thus we shall have the greatest engineering problem of the age passed on to 476 men who know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fresh delays opens before us ! The whole thing is , first of all , a sardonic comment on the President 's way of " doing things , " with his fitiger always on a hair-trigger . What was the excuse given for his lawless course in Panama two years ago ? Why , it was that the intolerable postponements of the people 's hope of an Isthmian canal must be ended , once for all . Talk not to Mr. Roosevelt of being patient with Colombia , and taking six months more to renew and perfect a treaty in an orderly way . The thing had to be done out of hand . There must not be another day 's delay . If necessary to filch the canal by means of a bogus revolution and a bouffe republic , do it without hesitation  --  anything , rather than lose an hour 's time in setting to work . Secretary Taft , in his speech on Saturday at St. Louis , deprecated the use of the phrase " make the dirt fly . " But it was the President 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his action , he sent the triumphant message : " Tell them that I am going to make the dirt fly on the Isthmus . " That was two years ago , and where are we now ? Still , according to the majority of the consulting engineers , fifteen or twenty years away from the completion of the canal , and with an outlay before us of $250,000,000 or $300,000,000 , instead of the $140,000,000 asked of Congress . The final muddle will be highly disconcerting to the President . He looked for a unanimous report , surmounting all technical difficulties , and he finds the engineers he appointed sharply and hopelessly disagreed . In his address to them at Oyster Bay , he put " the utmostpracticable speed " in the forefront . They coolly talk of a period which will leave the canal unfinished even after Mr. Roosevelt 's fourth term in the Presidency  --  if he fulfils the predictions of his friends and is elected again in 1912 and 1916 . The President urged " immedate building " ; he has got something painfully like " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon be defined in the dictionaries as " American political slang meaning ' never . ' " On the technical aspects of the case , it does not become a layman to pronounce . We must await the reports and listen to the experts . It is clear , however , that some of the rumors set afloat at Washington , with the reported alignment of engineers and the alleged reasons which guided them , are to be received with much suspicion . The proceedings and the vote were actually secret , and the contradictory leakages given in the press make impossible sure knowledge of what the real status is . It is said , for example , that one reason why the sea-level plan was favored was that the lands to be flooded under the terminal-lake project would cost from $30,000,000 to $40,000,000 . This must be a tremendous exaggeration . Under our treaty with Panama , there was absolutely ceded to the United States a zone of " the width of ten miles , " with " any other lands and waters . . . necessary and convenient for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protection of the said canal . " Such of this property as was privately owned , is to be appraised and paid for according to its " value before the date of this convention . " That is , we have in any case to take and pay for most of the land to be flooded ; the Panama Railroad , which we have bought , owns a good deal of the property to be damaged ; and , finally , the very best use to which the low-lying swamps and jungles can be put is to cover them with water and do a great work of sanitation at a stroke , while producing a good stretch of lake navigation for vessels in transit . The sea-level plan undoubtedly appeals to the man in the street ; what the man on the bridge of a 30,000-ton steamer may think of it , is another story . It sounds well to talk of " making a Bosphorus " at Panama , but , on examination , we find this Bosphorous is to be a canal only 150 feet wide ; and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amerika through it would be admitted by all navigators . Besides there has to be one lock , at Miraflores , even in the sea-level plan ; and hence we seem to be going to an extra expense of at least $100,000,000 , and a delay of seven or eight years , chiefly for the sake of ruling out three locks and keeping one . The situation gives fresh point to the question asked by Gen. Abbot in the Engineering Magazine of last February : " It is the unanimous opinion of all the engineers who have had practical experience in canal work , and time to study the problem thoroughly , that no sea-level project without locks , and no sea-level canal with a tidal lock , is practicable , that would be comparable in ease and safety of trans-sit to one equipped with modern locks and planned to take advantage of all the desirable elements which the natural conditions offer . Why , then , waste an extra ten or a dozen years and untold millions of dollars , to execute a scheme which the investigations of thirty-five years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the imagination of M. de Lesseps ! " Plainly nothing has yet been finally decided . There will be at least two reports from the engineers . Probably both will admit the feasibility of either plan , and will look only at the preponderance of advantages differently . The President and Congress may take another view . In any case , we are as far off from an actual beginning as ever ; and Mr. Roosevelt 's strenuous driving has simply left us floundering in the Panama morass . MR. - WHITEHEAD AND HIS TOR-PEDO . The death in England last week of Robert Whitehead , the inventor of the automobile torpedo , ends the career of a man who as fairly revolutionized naval warfare as did Ericsson with his monitor . Not that Whitehead first hit upon the idea of blowing up vessels by torpedoes . For more than a century prior to Whitehead 's success , there had been recourse to stationary or movable torpedoes . During our civil war they became a large factor , the Confederates destroying with them seven Federal ironclads , thirteen wooden war vessels , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or less severely . These feats were accomplished , either by anchoring torpedoes in the channel , as at Mobile , where the Tecumseh was sunk , or by exploding them alongside a vessel from a small boat . This involved great risks , and not infrequently cost the lives of all the assailants , as happened in some of the attacks on the Union fleet off Charleston . When Cushing sank the Confederate ram Albemarle , he did so with a little launch carrying a torpedo fixed to the end of a spar . To supplant this clumsy method , so unfavorable to the attacking forces , by a dirigible torpedo became more than ever the objective of naval inventions , as soon as the civil war demonstrated wha havoc could be wrought by an underwater explosion . A Capt . Lupuis of the Austrian navy had by 1864 progressed far enough with his plan of an automobile torpedo to need the assistance of a good working mechanic . He engaged Mr. Whitehead , then manager of an engine manufacturing company at Fiume . From that time on , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lupuis 's plans , he succeeded , in 1867 , in perfecting the delicate machine which bears his name , with the assistance only of his son , a mere boy , and one trusted workman . As a result of that success , every navy has its fleet of torpedo boats and torpedo-boat destroyers , and almost every cruiser and battleship has its torpedo-launching tubes . In order to combat this terrible weapon , there was introduced first the torpedo netting , now discarded , and then the quick-firing guns , intended to protect a warship by an incessant hail of projectiles . Incidentally , the weight of armor on all protected vessels was greatly increased , and finally the submarine was undoubtedly hastened by the Whitehead invention . Indeed , the torpedo has probably had a greater influence than any other factor , save the comfort of men and officers , in developing the modern topheavy , high-sided fighting vessel , as the standard type of battleship , instead of the Ericsson monitor . Whitehead 's first torpedo was of steel , 14 inches in diameter , weighing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dynamite . Its speed was low -- only six knots  --  and the right to manufacture was purchased by the English Government in 1871 for the trifling sum of $15,000 . As now developed , the Whitehead , whose motive power is compressed air , has attained a speed of 26 knots an hour , with a range of 4,000 yards . It can be regulated to explode by impact or after a definite time ; it may be set to travel at a uniform speed and depth the whole of its range , or both depth and speed may be varied . So remarkable is its mechanism that it may be made to rise to the surface or sink to the bottom after missing its mark . Its " war head " being detachable , it can be used again and again during practice with perfect safety . In length , the Whiteheads used by the United States navy vary from thirteen to eighteen feet . Whitehead himself re-designed his torpedo in 1876 , 1884 , and 1889 . By 1885 and 1886 , torpedo boats for the discharge of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greece , , Italy , Portugal , Russia , Spain , Sweden , Turkey , Germany , France , and Great Britain . To-day , England alone has 142 torpedo-boat destroyers , 117 first-class torpedo boats , and 72 of the second class , in addition to 39 submarines built or building . In addition to this , automobile torpedoes are part of the coast defence of several nations . So far as the effect of Whitehead 's invention upon general naval tactics is concerned , the battle of the Sea of Japan affords the best illustration , although full and accurate reports of the part played by the Japanese torpedo boats are not yet at hand . It is believed , however , that some of the Russian yessels were directly sunk by torpedoes , and that others received the coup de grace from torpedo boats after they had been wrecked and put out of action by gunfire . Moreover , the repeated Japanese torpedo attacks , even when successfully repelled , as at the beginning of the battle , kept the Russian crews in a high state of tension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made our American naval officers nervous and set them to seeing spectres and firing at phantoms . As long as torpedo boats are in the vicinity of a fleet , its crews will be nervously wrought up . For many years to come the success of the Japanese torpedo attacks at Port Arthur on February 28 and the destruction of the Sebastopol should be the classic examples of the damage which can be wrought by daring torpedo officers . One lesson of the late war is that torpedoes are of little value on board large ships , while the torpedo tubes on them are sources of structural weakness ; but this had already been foreshadowed . It must not be forgotten , however , that floating mines were even more destructive than torpedoes . Three big battleships foundered at once on striking mines , while not one was totally destroyed by a single torpedo . In this connection it is interesting to note that , as the United States was the last country to build torpedo boats , so its naval officers , by their own admission , have paid far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ navies . Not until 1900 was the first torpedo with a war charge fired by an American torpedo boat . This indifference is distinctly regrettable , because the United States is the country , ? bove all others , which can be well defended by a torpedo flotilla . Unfortunately , our naval experts are now far more concerned with heavy offensive squadrons than with the defensive measures long urged by the founders of this Government . But if our navy were to devote itself to developing torpedoes and torpedo boats , it might demonstrate that the country needs fewer battleships than it has to-day  --  and this , from the point of view of many officers , would never do .
