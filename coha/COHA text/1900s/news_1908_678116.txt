txt PROPOSED LINCOLN ARCH . Would Ill Celebrate Nation 's Victory Over its Own People . I notice in THE TIMES to-day a suggestion for the erection of an arch to President Lincoln . We should build a noble memorial in New York City to the savior of our Nation , but it seems to me it should not be in the form of an arch . which is associated with the triumphs of Roman Emperors , for whom arches were built in honor of victories over foreign foes . Such a sumptuous , joyous expression of triumphant conquest is not an appropriate expression of our success in the civil war , which was in no sense a war of conquest , but a life and death struggle of the Nation with itself , and no note of triumph should appear on our memorials to events or persons associated with that struggle -- certainly not in those erected to Lincoln , whose heart was torn with anguish at the awful carnage of the war among his fellow citizens . Lincoln , in all his efforts during the civil war , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a conqueror . GEORGE E. BISSELL . Veteran of the Union Army .
