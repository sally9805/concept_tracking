THE reader will perceive that in criticising Cymbeline my object has been to take independent views of the world 's great dramatist ? to apply , and to apply fearlessly , to his work the selfsame critical canons as arc universally applied to all other imaginative writers , never forgetting , however , Cole-ridge 's saying , " assuredly that criticism of Shakespeare will alone be genial which is reverential . " I will begin by saying a few words on the subject that is being now discussed by Tolstoy and others ? Shakespeare in relation to the twentieth century . That his name has dominated the nineteenth century has been made manifest by treatises upon him and his works that can almost be numbered by the thousand . Will it dominate the twentieth century ? That depends , I think , not so much upon his poetical genius , and not so much upon the adequacy or inadequacy of his philosophy of life to the new century 's cosmogony of growth , but rather upon the esthetic principles of his art . What are those principles ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joubert 's saying , " Fiction has no business to exist unless it is more beautiful than reality " ? Shakespeare , in spite of his occasional coarseness and his lapses from good taste , shows a quest of the beautiful far surpassing that of all other poets . Is this quest of beauty , in which he is so transcendent , the proper quest ? I think it is . But that being so , what about the twentieth century , whose quest , at present , is an entirely different one ? the quest of the ugly , the most squalid , cynical realism ? Should this quest continue Shakespeare 's position will indeed suffer a change . The reason why I think with Joubert that fiction has no business to exist unless it is more beautiful than reality is this . Man was not really horn in Paradise . No , he descended , as the twentiethcentury is only too well aware , from a certain hairy animal living in the trees , described by Darwin . Now that descent can not be called lovely , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful dream of what man may , and perhaps will , some day become , the better for mankind . If the twentieth century continues to think otherwise , it will batten upon the literature it likes , and then , exit Shakespeare . No play is more fall of Shakespeare 's passion for beauty than Cymbeline . And this is why I have dwelt so fully upon the subject . Take , for instance , the scene in Imogen 's bedchamber , when Iachimo has emerged from the chest to carry out his treacherous purpose . All poets feel that there is nothing in the world so lovely as a lovely woman , and Shakespeare above all others shows this . But he who ventures to describe a lovely woman in her bedchamber treads on dangerous ground , as we see in Marlowe 's Kern and Leander. and in too many other English poems . Shakespeare and Keats alone have come out of the perilous situation with safety . The bedroom scene in Keats ' " Eve of Si . Agnes , " for purity as much as for beauty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : How bravely thou becomest thy bed , fresh lily , And whiter than the sheets ! That I might touch ! But kiss ; one kiss ! Rubies uu paragon 'd , How dearly they do't ! ' T is her breathing that Perfumes the chamber thus : the flame o ' the taper Rows toward her , and would under-peep her lids . To see the enclosed lights , now canopied Under these windows , white and azure laced With blue of heaven 's own tinct , In the Italian story the distinctive mark on the heroine 's bosom , which is to play such an important part in the eve- lution of the plot , is a mole with a group of golden hairs surrounding it . To Shakespeare there was clearly something repellent in the idea of hairs , whether golden or not , marring the ivory globes of a beautiful woman 's bosom . And yet , in any dramatization of the story a mole was necessary ; for some striking and easily recognized peculiarity of the bosom could not be dispensed with . See how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On her left breast A mole cinque-spotted , like the crimson drops I ' the bottom of a cowslip . Shakespeare 's quest of beauty indeed is incessant . And it grew upon him , as indeed the love of beauty does grow with the years . There is perhaps more beauty in his later plays than in his earlier plays . He was a man fairly advanced in years when he produced The Tempest . It is overweighted with beauty . In all his plays we see that beauty is made a perpetual quest . At every turn we see that while toiling in London , new-vamping old plays of other dramatists , or recasting and enriching such new ones as were sent for the theatre 's acceptance from Oxford to Cambridge , there was , beneath his consciousness of the play he was working on , an ever-shining mirror ? the magic mirror of youthful memory . This mirror was bright with the shimmer of Avon as it wound through the meadows he loved ? meadows colored with the tints of the Warwickshire flowers ? winking marybuds , cuckoo-pints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swallow dares , and take The winds of March with beauty . Whenever he was in need of a poetical image , or lovely fancy , to illustrate or beautify a passage , he had only to look down into this magic mirror , and there was the very picture lie wanted , ready for use . Thus it was with the substitution of the crimson drops in the cowslip for the golden hairs . Those who are familiar with the cowslips of Avon meadows know that the warm-colored spots in a cowslip 's hell are of a deeper hue than in most other specimens of the flower . Therefore I say , in spite of Steevens , that " Cr/It1S011 is the very word to describe it . When Shakespeare wants an adjective that shall express for ever in one word all the charm of the violet , he has only to look down into this mirror to find it : Violets dim , But sweeter than the lids of Juno 's eyes Or Cytherea 's breath . In the Avon-side meadows , the dimmer the violet the more exquisite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in love with her , as we all are . Note how he never forgets that she is an English girl , and note how he never forgets that she is a great lady ? a princess . Upon no one of Shakespeare 's women has there been more eulogistic writing than upon her . Mr. Swinburnc concludes his remarks upon Cymbeline in A Study of Shakespeare with the following words : " I am therefore something more than fain to close my book upon the name of the woman best beloved in all the world of song and all the tide of time ; upon the name of Shakespeare 's Imogen . " And yet , perhaps , most of the critics have missed the one feature of her character that makes her the idol of the English race ? her bravery . Her naivete , her affectionateness , her sweetness , have all been dwelt upon . But her bravery it is that makes her to Englishmen the most bewitching of all Shakespeare 's women , who , as a role ? to which , however , Cordelia is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the English feeling about the ideal girl there is , no doubt , the inherited reminiscence of our Norse ancestry . Women took a vastly more important place among the Norsemen than among other races . While Griselda is the type of admirable womanhood in romance literature , the ideal of womanhood with her Norse forefathers was Brynhild . Imogen 's bravery shows that in his portrait of her Shakespeare intended to paint the ideal English girl . And see how he has transfigured the heroine of the Italian story where she is thus introduced when confronting her would-be murderer : The lady , seeing the poinard , and hearing those words , eNclaimed in terror , " Alas ! have pity on me for the love of Heaven ! Do not become the slayer of one who never Hail , thou fair heaven ! We house the rack , yet use thee not so hardly As prouder livers do . Hail , heaven ! Hail , heaven ! offended thee only to pleasure another ! ( Ind , who knows all things . knows that I have never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband 's hand . " And this is how Shakespeare paints Imogen in the scene where Pisanio tells her of his commission to kill her : Come , fellow , be thou honest ; Do thou thy master 's bidding : when thou see'st him , A little witness my obedience . Look ! I draw , the sword myself : take it , and hit The innocent mansion of my love , my heart : Fear not ; ' t is empty of all things but grief : Thy master is not there ; who was , indeed , The riches of it : do his bidding ; strike . Thou may'st be valiant in a better cause ; But now thou seem'st a coward . Mrs. Jameson contrasts the English with the Italian woman , merely to show that Imogen resigns herself to Posthumus ' will with a most entire submission . She is mistaken , 1 think . There is nothing in Imogen of the Griselda . Death is naught to this brave girl in comparison with her husband 's treachery . And yet , perhaps , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of beauty shown in Cymbeline . I allude to Imogen 's romantic feeling about Posthumus , her husband . Such love is almost always depicted in contemporary literature , and indeed in all literatures , between unmarried lovers . It is surely unique in poetry , this beautiful feeling between husband and wife . As to the occasional freedom of speech in such scenes as Act II , Scene 4 , it would he a mistake to suppose that they contradict in the least degree Shakespeare 's love of beauty . Coarseness is entirely a question of manners , and has nothing to do with deeper things . What is considered eonrse now ( the most cynical of all periods in England ) was not so considered in Shakespeare 's time ( the most enthusiastic period ) . Cymbeline is another instance of Shakespeare 's eye for a good story . It was not likely that he would let pass such an interesting tale as that of the ninth novel in the second day in the Decameron , in which a merchant boasts of his wife 's charms and accepts a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But how Shakespeare be- The first . appearance of the play was in the first folio of 1623 . Why it appeared there among the tragedies , and why The Winter 's Tale appeared there among the comedies , would be an interesting subject of speculation , if I had space to linger over it . Tn The Winter 's Tale there is really only one tragic episode , the death of Mamillius . In Cymbeline there is none , except the death of Cloten , and the death of such a character as that can scarcely be called tragic . Did the intense pathos of Imogen 's story give the play a tragic atmosphere without any humorous scenes to enliven it , while in The Winter 's Tale Autolycus , an enormous favorite with the audience , left on the mind a humorous suggestion , and wiped out the serious and pathetic incidents ? Who shall say ? Of course , however , the Elizabethans did not divide tragedy and comedy with anything like the sharp line that the Greeks did . Cymbeline is universally pronounced to be entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single critic has taken any other view . If it really is all by him , how shall we explain its great inequalities ? Indeed it may be said that it is not merely its beauties that warrant its attribution to Shakespeare . The very faults of style observable in it are Shakespearian . Take , for instance , Shakespeare 's frequent obliviousness of the characteristic defect of our language , the preponderance of sibilants . Marlowe , whose ear in some respects was finer than Shakespeare 's , gave great attention to this defect , which will always prevent English from being a " singing " language . So did Fletcher , when he had time . And Fletcher , it must be remembered , taught Milton , the greatest of all English harmonists and melodists , as much , or almost as much , as Marlowe did . But Shakespeare often gives no attention to sibilants . Indeed it was well for him that lie wrote a good many years after a certain severe critic , Dionysius of Halicarnassus , was dead , who is so wroth with sibilants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it often occurs insupportable , and that the hiss is more appropriate to the beast than to man . Even the exquisite song , VOL . CXVIII. ? No. 707-94 ? Hark ! hark ; the lark at heaven 's gate sings , And Phcebus ' gins arise , His steeds to water at those springs On ehalieed flowers that lies ; And winking marybuds begin To ope their golden eyes : With everything that pretty is : My lady sweet , arise ; Arise , arise , would have been more exquisite still , at least from a musician 's point of view , if Shakespeare had attended to his sibilants . On chalked flowers that lies is very bad , and the only excuse for III substitution of " bin " for " is " in the line , With everything that pretty is , is that it gives some relief from the hissing sound that pervades the otherwise divine lyric , and gives the singer a little chance . If , however , Cymbeline is all written by Shakespeare , we can only suppose that some portions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signs that the story was never thoroughly fused in the author 's mind . It should never be forgotten that Shakespeare was a business man , most likely the finest business man in the world of letters at that time . His first object was to produce a play upon a given subject at a given moment , and he , in consequence , must have often worked while his imagination was half dormant , and he had to be content with perfunctory and often with makeshift writing . Sometimes , as in the case of Hamlet , the success of the hastily written play was so great that he went over it again and transfigured it . The Hamlet mentioned by Thomas Nash in. 1589 is lost , but compare the Hamlet of 1603 with the Hamlet of 1004 . There you see the most marvellous instance of a dramatist working upon a story with his imagination only half aroused , and the same dramatist working upon the same story with his imagination at white heat . The subject is a great one , and can not be fully treated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my article upon . Poetry in the Eneyelopmdia Britannica . It will aid him in understanding what I mean . He will there find a discussion upon the difference between absolute vision and relative vision . In absolute vision the imagination is thoroughly aroused , the soul of the poet when at work is seized upon by the divinity which Iamblichus speaks of , who " guides it as be will , " while in relative vision the imagination is only partially active . In the latter ease the dramatist produces makeshift , or , at least , only secondary work . There are , of course , very few dramatists or novelists who show absolute vision on any occasion . But here is the point that I wish to impress upon the reader : the same dramatist , if he be Shakespeare , may display absolute vision in some parts of his work and relative vision in others . Compare , for instance , the second act of Macbeth ? the most wonderful piece of absolute vision to be found in all drama , unless we except the great Clytemnestra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Act IV , Scene 3 , where Malcolm runs through a catalogue of imaginary vices of which he accuses himself in a transparent way that narrowly escapes being ludicrous . The only reason for the existence of this scene is to give Macduff the opportunity of exclaiming , Fit to govern ! No , not to live . Not even Shakespeare , it would seem , can display absolute vision until every part of the story has become familiar to him as matter of fact , and the whole has become fused in his mind . In other words , the dramatist must live the story in its every detail before he can display that highest of all qualities ? absolute vision . But , in truth , all Shakespeare 's plays show that whether the story is found ready to hand , as in Hamlet and Macbeth , or invented , as in The Tempest and A Midsummer-Night 's Dream , or adapted , as in Gyntheline , it passes through two stages in the mind of the dramatist ? the stage when the story is first confronted ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long familiarity it is really imagined , when the mind of the inventor or adapter has become as familiar with it as though he had himself actually lived in it . Are there , then , two Shakespeares ? Yes , the Shakespeare of absolute vision and the Shakespeare of relative vision . Consider the enormous activity of Shakespeare during his stay in London . He had the duties of joint manager , adapter-general , and original author . Consider , too , that his great object was to make money in order to repair the fortunes of a singularly unfortunate father . Perhaps it is this overwhelming variety of work that accounts for the fact that there arc no records of him during his London life . How could a man in this situation find time , except occasionally , to mix with his convivial , happy-go-lucky contemporaries ? Depend upon it those " wit combats " between Ben Jonson and Shakespeare were of rare . occurrence . No sooner was one play produced than another was wanted from so popular a writer . This , I suspect , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with makeshift work , for a while , Loping , if the play should prove a great success , to find time to work upon it Besides the case of Hamlet , there are other instances , such as those of Romeo and Juliet and the Merry Wives of Windsor , of Shakespeare substituting good work for makeshift work the mo meat opportunity offered . But he who dares delay is bold . Shakespeare died at fifty-two ? died of a fever ? quite suddenly , according to tradition , which his hasty will corroborates . He went down to Stratford to meditate and to perfect his work . The perfunctory makeshift parts of Cymbeline are very apparent . For instance , it is seen in Act II , Scene 4 , in the entire lack of dramatic subtlety in the dialogue between Posthumus and Teel-limo . This lack of dramatic subtlety would not have been displayed , I think , had the story been fused in Shakespeare 's mind . It is seen in the clumsy soliloquy of Belarius in Aet III , Scene 3 , while in the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Scene 2 , there is not much sign of makeshift work , although the scene does not show any absolute vision . The makeshift work comes up later on in the same scene , in the dialogue between Belarius and the two boys : not only is the idea far-fetched , but the style is so crabbed that it can only be taken as makeshift writing . Note , for instance , the scene in Act I , Scene 4 , between Philaria , Inchimo , Posthumus , and others , which seems to have been tossed off as fast as he could write , and is in his worst style . But perhaps the most notable instance of the mixing of relative vision with absolute vision occurs in the scene between Pisanio and Imogen , in Aet III , Scene 4 . The scene opens superbly , but tails off into a feeble dialogue expressed in crabbed writing . And yet it would be difficult to say that all this scene is not by Shakespeare . In speaking of Shakespeare 's makeshift work , I am not , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dramatist 's reliance upon the frank and genial nature of the Elizabethan audiences , who were always eager to grant as large a measure of imaginative belief as they could . An instance of this kind occurs in the first act of Cymbeline . The course of the story is very lucidly indicated by the opening dialogue between the two gentlemen . But a modern dramatist of the most ordinary type would have seen the advisability of avoiding the apparent absurdity of making one gentleman of Cymbeline 's court tell another what must have been a matter of familiar knowledge to both of them equally , by making one of the interlocutors an emissary from some other court . Shakespeare knew that there was no need for him to take any such trouble as this , with an audience like his , an audience that was willing to accede to any and all of the conventions of the stage . An example of the vast imaginative belief that an Elizabethan audience was ready to grant is afforded by the riddle in Pericles , propounded by Antioehus , which is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed to have baffled many suitors for the hand of the tyrant 's daughter . There was not one among the groundlings who did not expound the riddle for himself as soon as it was given out : it was so obvious , and meant to be so obvious . But the audience knew that in order for a romantic story to be told it was necessary that they should take for granted that this babyish puzzle had baffled the intelligence of a host of knights , and was only at last yielding tothis new ( liclipus , Pericles . The absorbed attention with which an Elizabethan audience must have followed a play constantly strikes with amazement the student of the old dramatists . The Ms-dome of Dr. Dodypoll , a very popular play at that period , and in. some scenes a very beautiful one , as the readers of Lamb 's Specimens need not be told , is a notable instance of this . Without the aid of scenery of any kind to keep the imagination alive , an Elizabethan spectator of this play was able to follow a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his leisure in his study , finds it almost impossible to follow . In fact , I never did talk with any Shakespearian student who could give me a lucid pr ? cis of this bewildering play . A still more wonderful instance of the power of attention of an Elizabethan audience is afforded by Yarington 's Two Tragedies in One , where a poetic version of The Babes in the Wood , and an English murder - drama as realistic as A Warning to Fair Women , and as direct in its method as Arden of Feversham , are intermingled in alternate scenes . One of the impeachments of Shakespeare 's art advanced by Tolstoy is the frequency with which characters in disguise are used . and the ease with which they impose upon those who know them well . Edgar 's imposition of disguise upon his own father , Gloucester ? Kent 's imposition upon Lear , etc. , are simply proofs of the immense power of this imaginative belief in Elizabethan audiences . Throughout the Shakespeare dramas , and throughout all the dramas of Shakespeare 's contemporaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the temper of the Elizabethan playgoer and the temper of the playgoer of our own time . When Hippolyta , at the conclusion of the Pyramus and Thisbe interlude in the midst of A Midsummer-Night 's Dream , says , This is the silliest stuff that e'er I heard , Theseus makes the pregnant reply : The best in this kind are but shadows ; and the worst are no worse , if imagination amend them . Thus Shakespeare has himself spoken the last word upon idealistic drama .
