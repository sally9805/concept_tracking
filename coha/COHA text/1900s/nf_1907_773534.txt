txt 12o THE MACHINERY OF EDUCATION one ought to be independent , self-reliant , dictatorial , strict , frank , exacting , masterful , that the work of the world may be done efficiently ; because the other is servant , he ought to be dependent , humble , obedient , silent , servile , resentful , that the work of the world may be done agreeably . Give the master his way too freely , and the workers would perish from overwork and underfeeding in peace and from wanton sacrifice in war ; give the servant his way , and the world , with its wealth and its people , would be wasted by indolence and ignorance in peace and by malice in war . To the master , the masterful seem good and the servile bad ; to the servant , the servile seem good and the masterful evil ; to the philosopher , who knows only the good and the harmful , the morals of each seem one-sided and biased . To the ruling class , honor is the chief virtue ; to the serving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debt , but cheat a tradesman ; a mechanic will pay his grocer , but , in distress , desert wife and children . A gentleman tells the truth ; a servant keeps the peace . In America , there are many in the middle class , sharing more or less in the virtues and , sad to say , in the vices of both rulers and servants . Philosophers , believers in the whole life , desire only the virtues of that life , which are few and clear , ? singleness of heart , zeal to know the truth , consideration for others , faith in the constitution of the world of God . But these virtues are rational , and therefore remote from many . A particular feature of the problem of Negro education , so called , ' is the attempt to reduce them all to the servant class with the servile morality , while , in fact , in the city pope ulations of the Negroes , the mulattoes , so called , who are really mestizos , prevail , and in the country populations the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ descended from the stocks of African rulers . Now the mestizos are but brothers and cousins in saffron of the men and women in white . Formal education , forgetting the " color line within the color // line " and the natural classes of all mankind , too generally attempts to impose upon these mixed races habits of thought and action suitable to the serving class only . The truth is that the Negro desires and needs the resources of the entire encyclopedia of education in matter and in method . In this subordination and dependence , the School is forced to assume a position and a character entirely contrary to its real nature . When education looks to government or to religion or to the arts for its ideals , its goal , it contradicts itself . Jesus said , " Except ye become as little children , ye can not enter the kingdom of heaven . " 1 This is a principle , not a particular statement of temporary meaning . For its goal , education must look into the pure soul of man , such a soul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be found not in the social institutions , not in the veteran souls , seasoned by experience , immune by infections resisted or endured , but in the young souls stepping forth out of the skies into the world of men and things . To look in the manner of the child without prejudice upon things as they seem really to be is more nearly to find them as they are than falls to the lot of the adult man . The goal of education is truth , delight in truth , understanding of truth , faith in truth . This truth is no matter of prescription , no truth that needs bulwarking by laws , by exhortations , by ridicule and sneer , by threats , by institutions , by force of any kind whatsoever save its own self , its very nature . " Truth only needs to be for once spoke out , And there ' s such music in her , such strange rhythm , As makes men 's memories her joyous slaves , And clings around the soul , as the sky clings Round the mute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is but systematizing , persisting // in , trusting such simple interrogations as are universally characteristic of the child . The very affirmations of the child have the validity and universality of the highest philosophy . And why not ? Whence save from revelation can come new truth ? And what is a child but a new , a last revelation ? A little child , not yet three years old , was swinging twopound dumbbells . Her father asked her whether they did not tire her . Proudly arching her chest , she replied , " Dod did make me tong ( God did make me strong ) . " To test her , the next day her mother asked her the same question under the same circumstances with the same reply . This occurred in a family by no means given to religious ceremonies or discussions . Such certainty was beyond that of Kant . God and the goodness of God to man and the gratitude or love due from man to God are as much " intuitions " as are time and space . Whether they be intuitions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indifference . The Power , the Father , God , may teach truth to man in an instant or through ages : certainty of this is a condition of sanity , of intelligence , of humanness , and any uncertainty is devolution of mind , insanity , animalism . ' Since pure truth , unprejudiced , simple , such as is the natural aspiration of the child , is the goal of education , what is the utility of speculations or of inquiries regarding history , science , social institutions ? Why consider the adult at all ? Why not turn society upside down ; and why not let the adults be organized in classes under the instruction of children ? What a ridiculous suggestion ! Perhaps so . But let us consider for a moment some of the evils that would instantly be condemned , were young children lords of the world . Consider palaces , prisons , slums , murders , treasons , plots , lies of intent , double dealing , avarice . The adult mind , strong as it is , shrinks from the task : reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the child select as ruler of all ? Him or her let us make ruler in imagination . The fond mother , indubitably . And let us forecast the result . What a miracle of cleansing would be accomplished ! Would crimes be punished as now ? Would money be idol and magic as now ? Read literature . Read political philosophy . Read sociology . Far less profitable suggestions have been made by very serious men than the suggestion of Jesus that we turn about and become as children . Mayhap , God spoke in that word . Mayhap , it is the method to make love rather than power or property the alembic of life , ? of personal , of national , of world life . At any rate , whatsoever be the cost , I will not deny it : I will not explain it away : I will accept and use it . I , the adult , the father , the mother , am part and parcel of humanity , bridging from child to child as certainly , as humbly , as simply as once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nor do I , grown out of the child , clearly know what part of me is child , what part adult . The child is , indeed , the father of the man but he is more , he is the essence of him , if he be really man . For the very qualities that we call " manly " are childlike , ? sincerity , aspiration , love of truth , fair play , openness , loyalty . All heroes , all saints , preserved sacred the child in themselves . Uncalculating self-sacrifice , singlehearted goodness ; the child is incapable of intending anything else . And yet , and yet ! Life is not for naught . Higher may the man rise than the child ; as certainly as that often , I fear usually , he sinks lower . He rises by being obedient to the heavenly visions of the child and by observing certain of the habits and tastes of the child . The versatility , the many-faceted activity , the sleep , the appetite , the very dislikes of the child , ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And yet knowledge // comes . To be good , it is necessary to be good for something ; and what shall that something be ? The child can not know . The career of many a man illustrates the principle . It was the aim of Demosthenes to become " a good speaker . " When he became that , God sent him something to say . Many a poet has first learned the art of poesy ; after he had learned his art , he received his message . ' That the message comes undeniably as revelation , unsuggested , unhistorical , may be sometimes an illusion ; but often it is really what it seems . Otherwise , by human knowledge , it becomes impossible to understand certain persons , some famous , some one 's familiar neighbors . ' The School belongs to the child for the sake of the race . It belongs to the childlike , of whatever age , for the sake of the progress of the race in culture , in wealth , in worth . The School , therefore , belongs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kind that needs no apologists or defenders , no protectors or advocates . While it is perfectly true that the School prepares for " life , " and equally true that " life " ( the world ) contains Church , State , Business , nevertheless it is not the purpose of the School to prepare for the State or for the Church or for Business . Perhaps these institutions are needless or even wrong . It is quite possible that God reveals morality to the child , and that the sin of the adult alone occasions the need of religion ; ' in which aspect the religious attitude is inferior to the moral intention . It is quite possible that business is a transitory degradation of the industrial arts . It is quite possible that government as such , as the rule of the bad and of // the weak by the good and the strong , is necessary solely because education has not yet accomplished its perfect work . ' But perhaps the statement that the School is wholly subordinate and dependent is challenged . Property , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in shuffling off all responsibility for the School . Here and there a property school , living by endowments , independent of fees , controlled absolutely by educators ( with no business men as trustees and , therefore , rulers ) , may survive . 1 know of few such schools in the western world of Europe and America , and none of any importance . The Family still maintains its " select " schools , mostly for girls . These are sometimes schools for small children , or " finishing schools " for girls . The object of the former kind of school is to relieve mothers of home care . The object of the latter kind is to furnish girls with " accomplishments , " by means of which to win desirable husbands and to make attractive homes . In these latter years a peculiar kind of school of accomplishments has appeared , ? the school for training in domestic science and art . A more familiar kind is the " boarding school " for boys or for girls . Such schools are the results of parental interest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents must either teach their children themselves or provide teachers for them . The management of these " private schools , " as we Americans call them , whether endowed or not , is always in the interest of the " patrons " representing the Family . A school is " unsuccessful , " and its principal " does not know the business , " when , as very often happens , he does not make the school attractive to son or daughter and to father or mother . The family or private school , as a // type , persists to this day . Most examples of the type are but short-lived . Occasionally , some academy with a relatively large endowment lasts for generations . The private school by its selectness appeals to the economic class whose members are dependent upon the workers for support , and to the class whose members have attained culture superior in form and in grace to that of the workers . The private school discriminates financially against the independent masses . Even when conscientiously and honorably " run , " not for profit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by necessity of character , aim to please parents as a class , though perhaps not as individuals . By common report , it must be pro-Family . The Family School , therefore , is typically subordinate to parents , and , unless endowed , is wholly dependent upon them . ' Some of its endowments may be derived from pleased parents . The Church is third in age as a social institution , and it holds many a school in its grasp . Indeed , in one of its forms , it holds an entire system of schools in its grasp . Moreover , of recent years , another form has undertaken to establish a similar system of schools . And the Church now maintains , as it has maintained for fifty centuries and more , training schools , " theological seminaries , " " schools for monks , " " temples , " affording preparation for the priesthood , ministry , and ceremonial service . This magnificent , world-wide , age-old system of the Church is far more philosophical , sociological , scientific , than appears . It conforms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ masses of population . By this system , there is training for clergy and for laity upon different lines . But for the celibacy of one great priesthood , ? a celibacy that , of course , wipes out the class in every generation , ? the system would almost certainly have // transformed the world . And yet , though absolutely preventing the scholarly class from becoming an hereditary caste , and wholly relying for that class upon the variants from the masses , the Roman Catholic Church has won and maintained a primacy in many nations and a power throughout all Christendom that can be accounted for only by the efficiency and by the completeness of its educational system . ' But this educational system is a mere part of the entire Catholic ecclesiastical system ; and every clay 's work in every Catholic school , whether local primary or international graduate , is directed to one end , - . the maintenance of Catholic Christianity . : schooling of such kind we may call education . Without doubt , it is education , for no boy could go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of powers . Ten thousand , many million , bear witness that Catholic schooling is more than training and inculcating , for it is , in large measure , developing . And yet , once more , it is the achievement of a school wholly subordinate to and dependent upon a church . Appointments , compensation of teachers , fees of pupils ( if any ) , rules , courses of study , text-books used , are all determined not by free educators , but by priests . Or rather the bishop , the priest , is not wholly churchman , but is in part schoolman . In the Catholic world , the school has not yet completed its differentiation within the Church by separating from it and integrating itself outside of the Church . The persistence of the Catholic school has at least suggested , if not really stimulated , in America the establishment of various schools under the protection and often the patronage of other churches . The power of these ecclesiastical parochial and boarding schools is limited only by their contributing population and by their // property . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religious school from being a vast influence in America . It is a chief agency of particular clergies for religious inculcation and propaganda . ' Education is subordinate , incidental , apparently accidental . Now comes Culture , with its splendid schools , ? the university , the college , and the institute . In these schools , as compared with the schools of the Family and of the Church , the educators are free , yet not wholly so . For over the faculty is the board of trustees , holding the property , the purse , and the policy of the institution . This board of trustees is very , very seldom controlled by educators . It is usually composed of business men ( merchants , manufacturers , publishers , bankers ) , lawyers , ministers , politicians , leisure-class men , capitalists . Sometimes one who is only an author , a professor , an architect , a journalist , an engineer , an educator , or a scientist , breaks into the circle , but never with any support ; and never an artist , a mechanic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when no particular class or type is in full control , and when no particular patron , donor , or philanthropist determines the policy , such a board of trustees serves very well , being a microcosm of the world of men . Over the heterogeneous board , the educator-president , if he be not cleric disguised as culturist , 2 or the professors of the faculty often have considerable influence . But a homogeneous board , harmonious , with an established policy , especially when its members have any leisure , is likely to invade the domain // of the faculty and to alter opinions , even to enforce them , in matters alike of substance and of detail . It is in appearance only that educators control the higher institutions of learning . Indeed , as a matter of sociology , perhaps also of psychology , it is not desirable that at present they should control them . ' That control properly belongs , however , not to Property and Business , as it too often does now , but to Culture , and that not to Culture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ science , but as including every knowledge and skill of any value to men. - Freedom comes in the conflicts of men and of ideas . What ? Should college professors help make investments , expend money for buildings and maintenance , fix and pay salaries , decide courses of study ? Of course , they should . How else can they be men in a world of men ? How else can they be fitted themselves to fit youth to enter the world of men ? The Roman Catholic Church has survived professional control of finances , which is the essence of control , nearly two thousand years . Let us have complete integration , ? Business for business men , Education for educators , Culture for men of culture , Cobbling for cobblers . But the running of a university is purely a business matter ! It should not be . A lot of scholastic , absentminded , dreamy professors would soon waste the funds ! Who cares most to preserve the funds ? Those who live by them , or those who are merely set to watch them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is clear , that Culture will yet come into its own , which is independence . // of everything that is not-culture . The fact is clear , however , that Culture is still in leading strings . Not less true is this of the public or State universities . Whatever be the mode by which the democracy enforces control over these institutions , it is still control of Culture by the will of non-cultural society . ' The failure of Property , of Family , of Religion , and of Culture to provide universal education forced the constitutional State , for its own preservation , to take the School under its protection . By no means clearly understanding the nature or the extent or the meaning of the enterprise , democratic government in America undertook general education in order to prevent illiteracy , inefficiency , and immorality from ruining the society in its control . The modern State is universal : every child is horn into it . The State , therefore , upon adopting the School , decreed that it also should he universal : every child must accept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is historically a peculiar organization . No other universal institution , such as the Church once was everywhere in Western Europe , ever submitted to the control of the many , ? that is , of the masses . Only a few Protestant churches , of course , none of them universal , are democratic . The American State is apparently all society organized for government . The reality is that it is a transient majority of adult males organized for government , and usually so organized by masterful natural or hereditary aristocrats in their own interest . ' With an amazing rapidity that displayed the free energy of an age of legislatures , frequently in session , of newspapers , of telegraph , telephone , typewriter , steam // and electric railroads , conveying men and ideas almost fluidly about the country , the American State created the American free public school . ' Like a parasite at the banquet of a Roman Senator , public education waits eagerly upon every act and upon every word of the American government . We may talk of " more money for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more money ; but all the while the relation is essentially false . Substantively , education is a form , a mode of religion ; but it is in no proper sense a form or a mode of government . Better the dependence of the School upon the Church than upon the State . This is a transition era ; and submerged in it , we arc likely to mistake a tide for an ocean current . Education as a formal , universal system will never return to the Family or to the Church ; and it will soon go free from the State . But what are the symptoms of this subordination and this dependence ? What are the indications of finally " reaching majority " and going free ? And what are some of the disagreeable complications in the StateSchool disease ? We hear much in history of the StateChurch . What of this State-School ? What revolution is contained in the present ; and when the wheel of society revolves , will it revolve forward ? The enormous majority of children and youth who are subject to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wherever the public school of the State exists , there it is absolutely controlled and in every respect directed by a political board of education.2 The superintendent , if any there be , is chosen by that board . Courses of study , text-books , rules and regulations , generally appointments , // transfers , discharges , and always salaries of teachers are determined by the board , or by some still higher legislative body acting as the will of the democracy . Who constitute the board ? Educators never . Here and there some educator , retired or employed elsewhere but resident in the municipality , may be a member of the board ; but the control is always in the political members . Indeed , the educator must be a political favorite in order to secure membership . So universal is the non-professional character of the board of education that the employed ' educators , as the product of their conditions , rejoice in serving men " who know nothing about education . " It matters not whether the members of the board be chosen by election at large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judge : professional interest and equipment are practically a bar to office . Once upon the board , the member becomes infected witli the tradition of all boards , that " Educators know nothing about money affairs . " Immediately a double relation is established . The board members arrogate to themselves not only legal control and final authority , but also omniscience in every financial matter , while out of mere self-respect the educators sullenly retreat to their fortified schools and become a conspiracy against the board and against the superintendent , if he is " loyal " to his employers . Moreover , the board becomes characterized by all the traits of the master class and the teaching force by all those of the servants , so that the public is disturbed beyond measure . Imagining that the teachers are what they purport to be , profess to be , and by the board itself are advertised to be , that is , responsible for the education in the schools , ? parents and citizens require or try to require them to produce results wholly beyond their opportunities and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Enough generations of schoolchildren have not yet come into the society of men , the society national and international , for anything like final testing . Too many of the failures of the public schools are regenerated by the colleges , or tinkered into shape by parents , employers , special schools , for the real truth to be positively known by even the enlightened general public . Despite every handicap , some public schools are really educational agencies ; and their product is genuinely educated . But the fallacy of the system nevertheless remains ; it is undeniable , and it is undenied by the truthful . Where State legislatures by laws for the public schools , or where boards of education by resolutions or tacit custom , delegate large powers to educators , there little harm results from the present transitional system ; but such discriminating legislators and such self-renouncing boards are few . Read the statutes of any State , read the rules and regulations of any municipality ; and the truth of the authority of the board as over against the school becomes at once apparent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading these laws and regulations . The influence of the vested legal powers of the board of education upon members is very instructive . In a certain city , a young man under twenty-six years of age , two of whose sisters were teachers in the local schools , came upon the board of education , pledged to certain reforms and vowing to support the teachers in their rights . He was confronted at the second meeting by a petition from the teachers , requesting that personal matters of incompetence and of unsatisfactory service be discussed only in executive session and in the hearing of the accused . His remark , " It makes my blood boil to hear the insolence of these employees , " told the story . He added , " Human nature is human nature ; and I for one am going to use the power granted by the laws . Let them look out . " The subordination of the School is shown in the // finances . Almost everywhere , teachers are paid less than policemen and firemen . Almost everywhere , the school department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tendency is to employ more and more women and fewer men so as to save money and to secure employees who will not " interfere in politics . " In the vast recent prosperity of America , the teachers have no real share . Their wages have not risen as fast as the purchasing power of money has decreased . Schoolhouses do not improve generally in allowance of space per child and in amount of investment per child . Commonly , the tendency is to make the School a mere subsidiary department of the city or town government . Almost everywhere are to be found statutory limitations of the amounts per thousand dollars of taxable property or per child to be spent for educational purposes , though such limitations are set upon nothing else : as though we were in peril of being too well educated . Who ; are the persons Chosen for board membership ? Characteristically , young men , lawyers or physicians desirous of advertising , or of " getting a start in politics , " business men of minor importance , puppets of the " unseen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successful men are few . Many superintendents feel that they can resist more effectively the clerk than the millionaire , and go so far as to advocate the policy of appointing or electing inferior men . Though the end is not yet , there are signs of change . Board membership is being lengthened in term , in the hope that long service will develop wisdom and prove to be a kind of education for educational control . Boards are being given , here and there , separate taxing powers in independence of city councils.2 Their ancient right of // holding buildings and lands in fee is in process of restoration . Elections are held for board membership upon nominations by petition and on days other than those set apart for the partisan political elections . ' In a few instances , salaries are paid for services . In not a few instances , boards are employing business managers and school architects , thus acknowledging ignorance of educational construction . They are delegating many of their powers , such as choosing teachers and books , to professional men . All these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not prevent the disease . The StateSchool is merely a transitory type . We have , therefore , the school that prepares girls for society and for marriage ; the school that teaches the masses to worship and the variants to conduct worship ; the school that inculcates certain kinds of knowledge ; and the school that is supposed to prepare for citizenship . This last , much lauded , common school of compulsory education has adopted the principle of Jesuit Catholic instruction , ? Give us the child till twelve ; we can determine him for life by that time.2 To the StateSchool , all the meaning of adolescence is lost . Whereas , in fact , for boys the most important year for education is fourteen and for girls thirteen , the State-School allows its education to end there for the great majority.3 Business and Culture both discovered the lack . Culture devised the old academy and the new high school for the supernormal variants from the masses . Business devised the commercial school or college . Its cry is " Education for practical life , " meaning the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the business // school , Business presides mercilessly , and dictates pure training for the prescribed ends . Business is now reaching out to dictate courses and methods to the State high schools . It develops strong arguments for secondary ( early adolescent age ) schools of commerce . Its theory is not " man for the State , " not " man for the Church , " but " man for Business . " Thus , a department of Society arrogates to itself more than Society has ever claimed , ? to subordinate the immortal soul to material wealth . And why not ? Why is it not best for the boy or girl to go to school and to acquire there a skill , or better , an art ' whereby . to support his or her physical life ? Is not the economic activity the essence of humanity ? Must we not first have food , shelter , clothes , work-for-wages ? Jesus did not think so ; but the Master lived in the first century , in a land halfway around the world from us . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be wise as well as righteous , for the masters of business do not come from business schools . It is more important to educate than to train . Besides all this , it appears that Business itself is on trial . ' The economic regime , that came in but two or three hundred years ago , new-founded upon the factories of the nineteenth century , is on trial . ' It may be that its prescriptions of rent , interest , taxes , profits , and insurance , which now worry so many students of arithmetic and practitioners of bookkeeping , will be as obsolete two or three hundred years hence as // feudal dues ( fines of alienation , worships , reliefs ) are now . It is not well to be too serious about typewriting : some day it may be as obsolete as hieroglyphics are now : and as useless . Only thought lives . Only the soul is worth anxiety . Upon this analysis , which fails to discover a single system of schools whose sole purpose is the true purpose of education , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from ideal . The desiderata of the ideal school are two : The independence of a sufficient group of educators from all external control ( save , of course , public opinion ) ; Adequate grounds , buildings , apparatus , salaries , and other means of physical support . In other terms , freedom from authority , and authority in this freedom . The social forces that should and will produce a formal system of education competent to perform its obligations are five : ? The police protection of society , for without the school civilization would soon go to wreck ; The desirability of material progress whose benefits may be so widely diffused that incurable moral delinquency shall be the sole cause of poverty ; The neighborliness of humanity , seeking that all persons may be fit for companionship ; The love of children and of youth , which means to help them to realize as much as possible of the good of life ; and The spirit of modern scholarship , which desires all men to share in the heritage of human knowledge and skill . These forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? a yearning that imprisons millions for hours a day in conditions often irksome and sometimes painful , to bring American society to the independent , properly supported School . CHAPTER VIII THE NEW EDUCATION Flrom ancient Chaldea to modern America , the tale of progress is the tale of adding and separating , of approving and discarding , the talc of change . Progress in education has been a tale of the new becoming the old , and of the old giving place to the new . In a sense , progress is mechanical . We may count its steps , concatenate them , mark the resting-places , measure the speed and the space of each march . But though the mechanism be perfectly clear , the spirit may still be hidden . ' No one has yet written the history of the methodology , the practice , the mechanism of education through the centuries , though many have written the history of educational theories with more or less comment upon methods and actual practice . Such a history of educational mechanics would be profitable as affording tests of modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its entire justification , for " the letter killeth , but the spirit giveth life . " 2 // Every change in mechanism is due to some change in the life that is before or within the mechanism . ' Things are the products , the forms of thoughts : Laws , processes , plans are thoughts . It can not be proven by any of the efforts of philosophy or of science that things are not thoughts ; and that mechanism itself is not a mode of spirit . All that we know is that things and thoughts are at least not incongruent and exclusive , for if they were , mind could never apprehend matter . ' The progress in thought has forced the progress in mechanism . Every change in thought is accompanied by , perhaps inevitably causes , a change in mechanism , ? on the principle , it may be , of the " conservation of energy . " The movements of population , its growths , its collisions , , its combinations and wars ; the movements of ideas by a the migrations of men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movements of wealth by invention , by commerce , by fire and pillage ; the movements of thought and of art expressing thought ( in a phrase , the mechanical process of society , which , in appearance at least , is progress ) : these have forced changes in the mechanism of education , which expresses the social spirit . This spirit of society , the time-spirit , has typical purposes in education , which necessarily characterize the school of the time . The schools of a particular age and country are seldom much better or worse than the generally prevailing culture . And the typical purpose of education is usually the typical purpose of the sovereign power in the society , which , of course , always resides in some ruling class or classes . The temper of the present age in America is democratic , scientific , practical , mechanical , materialistic . ' It // is , therefore , out of harmony with the characteristic temper of historical education , which is aristocratic , unscientific , impractical , religious in a formal sense , and imperfectly organic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not mere points of common interest , but actual overlappings with resultant common grounds . Education has always been , in no small measure , formal and mechanical , the formalisms and mechanisms interfering , not slightly , with its essentially organic , vital , spiritual nature . The modern American social temper is , therefore , to be considered more out of harmony with true education than with historical education . And yet it may well be that education is to gain greatly from certain qualities of our age : its will to freedom , if not also to equality , of opportunity , its scientific devotion , and its practical character . These will lead , undoubtedly are leading , to far greater diffusion of knowledge , to perfection of the mechanism of education , and to its reality as a force and a life . The effort of modern education to diffuse knowledge more widely is thoroughly scientific in its results , if not in its methods . The diffusion of knowledge tends to accomplish two ends that may be termed mechanical : to discover the variants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peculiar power and of large service ; and to teach to the masses the ways of culture and to orientate them in the world of social right and wrong . This democratization of education is wholly good as well as scientific and practical . The perfecting of the mechanism of education is also a thoroughly scientific enterprise . The workman is known by his tools , his methods , his skill : these prove his craft not less certainly than do his products . The selected teacher , the free and wide curriculum , the better book , the closer organization , the more complete equipment , the larger and finer building , the careful ventilation and THE NEW EDUCATION ' 4 ' sanitation , the ample grounds ; ? all these testify to the art of the educational director . The very system is evidence , though not proof , of a science within its substance and determining its form . Is , then , education an art or a science ? Socrates , as represented by Plato , considered teaching at least an art : and teaching is half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but education a science . It is a subtle distinction . Art is an efficient mode or method of action resulting in a product of beauty . ' And beauty is a quality that whenever present pleases all of us . ' A science is a body , a whole , of systematized knowledge , composed upon understood principles that correlate clearly known facts ; while science is a mode or method of arriving at fact with certainty , that is , of finding truth . Art also has its concrete meaning , for an art is a body , a whole , of products of a particular kind of beauty . Pottery is an art , often styled ceramics . The making of pottery is an art . The mode and the product of beauty may be considered art . Similarly , the body of chemistry constitutes a science , while chemistry as a mode of investigating Nature is a science . Both art and science may be used in either a kinetic or a static sense . As a formal system , education is on the way to becoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or to speak more loosely in the common fashion , education ) is an applied science on the way to becoming an art . Now the art of education is pedagogy ( or pedagogics ) , which is not the subject of the present inquiry . ' // The artist-educator may be said to teach well ; the scientist-educator , to teach wisely . In the one case , we emphasize the good result or the prospect of it ; in the other , the method and the intelligence shown in the processes employed by the method . The science of education must be based upon other sciences , such as psychology , particularly the psychology of the feelings ; genetic psychology ; biogenetic psychology ; physiology and physiological psychology ; anthropology ; pathology ; biology ; sociology ; criminology , far better to be styled sinology ; and political economy . The essence of the whole matter is biology , the science of life , which reveals the origins of the animal body and of its various structures and functions . Thereby , man is interpreted to himself as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of every other living creature . He who is not something of a biologist can never again be anything of a philosopher . ' Who can measure how much his primitive biology helped to make Aristotle " The Philosopher , " holding primacy for a thousand years ? 3 The whole matter of education , again , is ensphered in sociology , which accounts for the humanness of the mind of modern man . By becoming a socius , the homo becomes a vir Out of the individual , companionship makes the person . Not for the sake of society , but for the sake of the boy and the girl , are they prepared for society . Yet the centre and the envelope do not complete the sphere , which finds its substance in psychology , the science of the soul . This science , for man the most // significant of all sciences , has many fields of inquiry . The science of human nature must sound and map the innermost deeps as well as measure the surfaces and edges . It must begin , therefore , with motives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which it exists ; the persistence of the reason in unconsciousness produces its evolution into motive and characterizes it as such . The cause of this persistence is an appreciative condition of that unconsciousness , ? its apperceptive appropriateness , we may perhaps say , by analogy with the processes of consciousness . The reason within the motive is always an ideal . Every motive has also always a judgment regarding the ideal ; this judgment is its valuation of the ideal ; and the integrity of the motive is always conditioned by this judgment . The force of the motive is conditioned by its adjustment to the general nature of the personal soul and by the force of that soul . Motive is in the depths of the man ; no man ever has a motive false to his real self , though it may be false to the self that he hopes to build.3 While every motive has an ideal within itself and a value for its ideal , not every ideal has a judgment of value as yet attached , and not every value awakens motive . Ideals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its centre , value relates centre to circumference ; and the whole constitutes the entire circle of unconsciousness . It may seem , at first , a contradiction in // terms to assert a psychology of unconsciousness ; yet we may know it by its manifested acts . Values give quality and substance ( that is , power ) to ideals , by transmitting to them the power of motive . A value , in this sense , is a judgment of the intellect , working below the plane of consciousness ; an ideal is an aspiration of the heart ; a motive is a direction of the will . The value of an ideal is realized by the motive , which must be sufficient and appropriate . Ideals lend dignity to motives , the dignity of value . Without value , there is not motive , but pure impulse . In the senses of this relation , an ideal is a conception of the intellect , a motive is a feeling of the heart ; and a value is a projection of the will . The ideal in a motive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and worthy . Motives produce energy in values , the pure energy of ideals . In this relation , a motive is a causation of the intellect ; a value is all affection of the heart ; and an ideal is a prevision of the will . ' As the imagination , the memory , the judgment , and reason itself , are no longer to be considered separate faculties of the mind , but facilities , functionings , modes of operation involving the whole mind , so intellection , volition , and emotion ? consciousness , subconsciousness , and unconsciousness ? are also to be considered as modes of operation involving the whole mind . The old // psychology of intellect , will , and heart was true , for all science is by definition truth ; but it comprehended only a few features , and those chiefly mechanical , of the truth at present known of the mind of man . ' As we need a psychology of habit as well as of mental acts ; as we need a psychology of subconsciousness as well as of consciousness ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of volition as well as of intellection ; so also do we need a psychology of production and of creation as well as of reception and of repetition . Our modern psychology is but the nucleus of the psychology that will be when we complete the sphere of our inquiry . The essence of the matter , of the entire matter as well as of this apparently paradoxical phase of ideals , values , and motives , is mental functioning whose second power as seen in culture 2 is always productive , creative , and serviceable . When one knows something new , there are three kinds of uses to which one 's mind puts the new knowledge . One use is to hold it in memory , consciously or unconsciously , as reserve knowledge , which functions in its simplest mode when reproduced in kind.3 A musician learns a nocturne : he plays it accurately . A second use is to hold the knowledge in memory , not as such , but in composition with other similar knowledge . The new knowledge functions in a more complex manner when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but true to its own essential nature . A musician learns many selections he plays an original composition // with echoes and overtones and the spirit of the original music . A third use is to acquire the knowledge , but to absorb it , making it part and parcel of one 's own mental life . The new knowledge functions in a manner that does not permit of its representation as it was . A musician learns the science and art of music ; and becomes a poet or an orator or a physician , employing only the power that the music gave his intellect , his will , his soul . The knowledge functions simply and plainly ; or complexly and obscurely ; or occultly and vitally . The knower may learn or think or create because of what he knows . In the last case , his knowledge functions as education , as education pure , simple , and perfect . ' // These terms are not proposed as mutually exclusive or as in systematic order ; as complete or as necessary to completeness ; or finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convincing evidence that psychology is the substance of the science of education . But pure or theoretical psychology is by no means all of the subject . Almost as important is physiological psychology , which deals with the nervous system as the instrument of the mind . Closely allied with this is physiology itself , with the associated sciences of anatomy and of pathology . Subsumed under them all are genetic psychology and biogenetic or biological psychology . So vast is the range of these sciences , so incredibly vast their present content , ' and so exhausting to the imagination their possible inquiries , that I hesitate to make any suggestions as to their meaning and as to their truth for education . ' And yet because this hesitation may be misunderstood or resented , I note a few topics . The physical and the psychical determinants of the limen of consciousness . The rate of physico-psychical action . The content of consciousness . Psychophysical parallelism . Motor and sensory diatheses . Nascent periods when interests first appear in the soul . The history of the animal soul . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // Defects of the special senses : vision and muscular accommodation of eye ; deafness ; etc . Spinal curvature . Psychoses . Neuroses .

True and space senses ; other special senses . Fatigue . ' Closely related , of course , to psychology and to physiology is pathology , to which an entire profession devotes itself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // experienced a pathological state has fully entered into the life of civilized humanity ; and for two reasons . Of these , the first is that the perfectly healthy man is one whose mind has never overcome and exhausted his body ; whereas , until such reduction of the body to the mind , certain states of consciousness that teach man his nature are never realized . Perfect health knows neither ecstasy nor exhaustion , both clearly pathological states , that build echoing halls in the soul . The second reason is that one knows his fellows only through a sympathy that comprehends from experience . Never to he ill , never to be wounded , never to he weak , never to he excited or too weary for hunger or for sleep , never to be face to face with death , never to know pain , is never to feel the common emotions of humanity , and , therefore , would seem to be isolation from humanity . ' Taking life as a school ( and what else is it ? ) , one might also be justified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disease as among the privileges of humanity . To the animal , a serious disease means death ; to the man , environed by knowledge and skill , it means education . Sickness has bound more persons together in common affection than all other causes for sympathy taken together . Moreover , it has taught men more of Nature than all other agencies taken together . The chief motive in science is the desire to know the causes of disease . Pathology is the heart of all sciences . Pain is the mother of progress . ' Closely related to pathology is criminology , broadly defined . Unfortunately , crime is partly an artificial matter , a thing of definition , of tradition , of custom , rather than of reason , for a crime is a deed supposed to be ' so THE MACHINERY OF EDUCATION both a sin and a sanction , l a deed at once wrong and forbidden . A sin , morally , is a deed of harm to one 's self or to one 's neighbors , an act of injury , an evidence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as expressed by government . ' Were government perfectly intelligent and perfectly righteous , every crime would be a sin ; and whatever sin was sufficiently injurious to one 's self or to one 's neighbors to threaten the welfare of society would be a crime ; and nothing else would be . But because there are some crimes not essentially sinful , and many sins not legally recognized as criminal ; therefore , crime is partly an artificial and partly a defective matter . And yet criminology , the science of the prevention and cure of crime , is a subject of no slight importance not only to statesmen , but also to educators , because if all educators understood perfectly how to educate , the sins that are crimes would never be committed , for there would he no sinners , and the crimes that are not-sins would be erased from the statute hooks . Then all lawmakers would he moralists ; and no moralist can tolerate the notion of forbidding and punishing as a crime any act that is not dangerous to one 's self or to one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same relation as that in which pathology stands to medicine ; for as the essence of medicine is hygiene , so the essence of education is conduct . ' The pathological state is the result of unhygienic living or conditions , while the criminal state is the result of a soul or of an environment that knows not education . Only the uneducated are criminal ? Not that . There are criminals whose deeds were not sins . Only the uneducated are sinful ? Not that . But only the incompletely educated are sinful , for the very commission . // of sin is evidence of the incompletely evolved soul.l Exactly as a man who is perfectly well and entirely isolated from infection is certain not to develop disease , so the man who is perfectly educated and entirely isolated from ignorance ( or from the ignorant ) will not develop sin . Of course , such a proposition requires a special definition of education , the definition to which this entire book is devoted . On two grounds , the double question is sometimes asked whether ignorant or uneducated persons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , s , Paul argued upon one line in answer . A perfectly ignorant man with a mind of normal powers is impossible . only the idiot is perfectly ignorant , thought-proof . Ignorance , therefore , requires definition . This much is certain : the man who knows nothing in the premises can not be guilty because he is not malicious , but no more is he righteous , for he can not be making a choice between right and wrong . All one 's knowledge lies within the range of his morality . A child can not steal . A boy legislator can not betray the public welfare . The conscript soldier , firing in his squad , does not commit murder . Taking , voting , shooting , ? whether in ignorance or under duress ; whether mechanical or spontaneous or superstitious , ? if without understanding , can not be sins . The illiterate heir to an estate who signed a paper giving away the title was not generous . The childless uncle who at his death left his fortune to his nephews deserved no gratitude . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deed good or evil.2 The sinner precedes or commits the crime . The functions of criminology , therefore , are three : to discriminate among crimes the sins and the not-sins , to prevent sins , and to reform sinners . The criminologist owes it to humanity to persuade the State to abolish all crimes that are not-sins ; he should study the causes of sin that // lie in the conditions of society as well as those that lie in the nature of the sinner , and should persuade the State to remedy those conditions ; and he should study the sinful and the methods of reforming them . The criminologists , however , are few ; and criminology is but in its beginnings as a science . The evaluations of sins are often absurd , ' while the punishments , if any , are often scarcely less absurd . Every criminologist should be fundamentally an educator . The science of education must have criminology as one of its foundations ; or , to speak conversely , criminology is , in greatest portion , but a department of education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall I say , instruct ) for the routine of life ; and the educated like the uneducated fail , seem ever to fail , in times of crisis . It is a matter of familiar knowledge that skilled mechanics and men or women , who are manually , that is , organically , educated , are never to be found in penitentiaries or jails . The graduate of the professional school , the graduate of the college , the banker , the merchant , the clerk , the hotelkeeper , the bar-tender , the laborer , the foreigner , and even the farmer : all these are to be found among the criminals , for they may become criminals . But almost no mechanics and almost no mothers are ever to be found within prison-walls . Why are these facts what they are ? Consider the greater sins , forgetting which of them are crimes . These are treachery , lying , stealing , fornicating , // bribing , assault , destroying . All are characterized by getting something for less than its value , by perverting something from its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they may all be resolved into ecstasies of body or of soul or of both ; whereas soul and body should be harmonious . These ecstasies consist in forgetting one 's self or one 's neighbors and in giving way to centrally excited sensations or feelings or desires in wanton disregard of results . ' A thousand crises must be faced in an active life . The wise and righteous man passes every crisis successfully and becomes a master of men : or he may have failed in some crises , only to learn from his failures and to pass later crises successfully . Of course , most men start with handicaps , it may be of body or of family , of heredity or of environment . But the race is not always to the swift or the battle always to the strong . ' The worst handicaps are propensities to sins : yet these are the handicaps most neglected by the secular education of the times , which persistently forgets the inferior many and theorizes too much about the superior few . Now become plain the two reasons why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so bad as to constitute crimes : the mechanic by reason of his art or craft has learned , has become habituated to , physical self-control , is almost incapable of ecstasy , can not forget himself ; while the mother by reason of housework , of maternity , of care of husband and children , has become habituated to equal self-control , is also incapable of any ecstasy save that of forgetting herself through devotion to others . Sin can find no material in // mechanics or mothers , who have learned real values in terms of labor and of interest and who have little time or energy for desiring something for nothing . Sin tempts mechanics and mothers and such as they are chiefly in the form of intoxicants to tide them over periods of undue weariness . He whom a rational art and poverty combine to master is safe against his own wantonness and the powers of this world . Convert , therefore , thy ambition into art and thy wealth into tools and thyself into a servant of many : for this is the highway to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love in the secret recesses of the soul . Another science of vast importance to education would be political economy , but a pseudo-science continues to masquerade under that name . The true political economy deals with the management of the wealth of the State as a domestic concern . ' Blind natural law is repudiated by sound political economy , as it is by everything else that is sane and civilized . Moreover , a sane political economy recognizes that in modern days we do not deal in wealth-as-such , but in property-in-wealth , not in goods free , but in goods owned , that is , in goods conditioned by public and private law . The fundamental assumption of modern , current political economy is this : " The starting-point in all human activity is the existence of wants . " 2 This is , of course , a fallacy , for a want implies a power to want . This is a priori truth . A posteriori , we know that all human activity in fact is the result of powers . To apply the Aristotelian test , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is least active ? He who is most ill . Again , who is most active ? The man of greatest power . A similar // analysis shows that not labor as such , but power or energy developed as skill , produces the typical modern forms of abundant wealth . ' The present common economic analysis gives the distribution of wealth to land , to capital , to labor , to management , to insurance , and to government . Every educator should understand and should teach his boys and girls , his youth and maidens , to understand rent , interest , wages , profits , premiums , and taxes . Moreover , he should understand real values and money prices , competition and cooperation , and the incidence of laws . Lastly , he should understand poverty , luxury , and population laws . He who does understand these elementary matters will be an advocate of qualification tests for legislators not less drastic than those for physicians . The body politic is the prey to quacks and scoundrels : between the knaves and the fools , the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all civilizations . God seems not yet to reveal to men how to produce enough good and wise rulers to lead any people forever forward . His will appears to design historic cycles rather than marches.2 Upon this analysis , the scientific elements for the new science of education are disclosed . But has the science of sciences , philosophy , nothing to contribute ? Has history nothing ? Has literature nothing ? Have the arts nothing ? Vast stores of facts ; elevating ideals ; warnings ; a high hope for the race ; pleasures , emotions , leisure , beauty . These are their contributions of materials to education . Has religion nothing ? Education is the main trunk of religion . And what of all lesser knowledges and skills ? Materials , suggestions , devices . // The conclusion is that education is something substantial , integral , no mere congeries of borrowed ideas . Its individual nature and character as a science will appear upon a consideration of the normal or typical progress of the child to the old man . What is the course ? The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light dawns upon him very gradually . What his first consciousness was , no human being as yet has remembered . It may be from the peripherally excited sensation of the change of temperature from the womb to the world ; it may be that of the change from darkness to light ; it may be the pain of birth ; and it may be that even the foetus or the embryo has consciousness . Quite possibly , consciousness is transmitted as part of the heritage with ovum and sperm . ' After birth , however , the opportunities and the materials of consciousness are multiplied . By discovering the world , the babe discovers himself : he discovers this self not as body , but as spirit , which , as he differentiates and integrates it , becomes to child and man his soul ? his ego . After this discovery , he is aware , upon certain occasions and in certain conditions , of himself as spectator and critic of his consciousness . The little child discovers himself through his senses , but learns even the locations , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and special , long afterwards , if at all . He feels property in himself , his body , its parts . Things useful to him become his own like his body . The property-sense is the first mental activity that is above sensation and attention . Perception is making an idea one 's own , that is , one 's property . The familiar , the . // understood , thing becomes proper to one : with it , one is at home . Along with this property-sense grows a more important sense of the use and function of the bodily parts and organs : a sense not analytic but synthetic , a sense of power accompanied by a desire for skill . To state this double matter otherwise : the soul is forthstepping to conquer the world and to possess it , and therefore takes wealth as property and exercises itself in and through its body for propriety . Thus acquisition and skill proceed almost pani passe , for a time . Before the consciousness of possessing a body to be trained is fully established , the desirability of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begins to stir in the soul . Such is the beginning of the search into Nature , a search seldom abated voluntarily while life lasts . To possess things , to control one 's body , to know the real world : these mark the limits of the activities of many men . To these , all matters of religion , of family , of politics , of society , of business , are but tributary , ? important , if serviceable , but otherwise incidental and often objectionable . In truth , unless deliberately educated by others , most human beings can not compass more than these notions and functions of property , of the body , and of the physical world . The next stage in psychical growth is that of return to one 's self , to inquire into the real self . This leads to the discovery of soul and body , ? but words to most persons . Their differentiation and recognition as interrelated but not causally connected integral things , the healthful body being a good servant and the unhealthful a bad master , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are events of major importance in the course of a complete education . To know one 's own body , one must know biology , zoology , physiology , histology , physics , chemistry , mechanics : to know one 's own soul , one must know philosophy , history , literature , // religion , morality , government , psychology ; for this is science , to connect one thing with everything else . ' Thereby consciousness passes into self-consciousness . ' Now arises a new and higher self-control , the earlier being physical , this being psychical . Beyond self-knowledge and self-control lies self-direction . Once more the individual must pass beyond and outside of himself to know the world . Now he must know the world of human society so well , and must trust himself so thoroughly in it , as to will for himself his course of action in it . Such an individual is rare , indeed . And yet even now his education is not complete . The self-directing individual who can overcome society at least to the extent of forcing his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control . Such a man takes the world as his own and overcomes it . He has learned to think not only for himself and for his own , but for most other persons as community and as society.He becomes a popular demigod or a national hero . I I igher yet may a man rise by this zigzagging between world and self , object and subject . Ile may absorb the world into his own heart and yearn over it as a mother over a child , loving the world better than himself , listening to its needs , trying to help humanity bear its burdens and redeem its life . Such a man is incomprehensible to all other men than those of his own measure and nature . ' Consciousness is the first evidence of psychical progress : to possess it is a fundamental necessity without // which goodness and intelligence are meaningless as terms of human morals and mental activity . The second stage is sense-knowledge , which gives at once property-in-things and property-in-self . I Ie is good who treats himself well and preserves his own property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and how to keep property and how to use his own body for pleasure and profit . Of one who is in this stage and incapable of going higher , selfishness must not he predicated as sinfulness , or self-gratification as ignorant narrowness of mind . Children of ten years of age are entirely justified in delighting in possessions and in practicing their bodily powers in games and in drills . The third stage is knowledge of the world of sense . To be good in this stage is to enjoy the delights of sense without surrendering to them . These delights are many , and they tend to feed and to develop the " lust of the eye " and the " pride of life . " ' Covetousness of property sets in , because much property enables one directly and indirectly to gratify the senses . ' Sins flaunt their pleasures before one . The senses plead for gratification . Taste calls for wine , and hearing for music ; sight calls for jewels , and smell for attar of roses ; touch calls for silks , and temperature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for leisure , and sex for its ecstasy ; pride calls for the powers of property , and vaunts itself above the poorer ; and all together demand money , which in this age short-circuits to all sense-delights . To escape social restraints , one travels , indulging among strangers the sense-activities that seem vices among friends . Then result thievery , adultery , drunkenness , arson , murder , 16o THE MACHINERY OF EDUCATION and betrayals of every kind . He is good who yields to none of these temptations . He is intelligent who uses every sense as a tool for knowledge and for service . Vast as is the world opened to us by the senses , it is small and trivial compared with the world of the higher stage of the soul . He is good in this fourth stage who does everything in love of himself and of his neighbor , conceiving that I and my neighbor are upon a journey that is never to end . ' And he is intelligent who so orders his days and his acts that all contribute to permanent good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one 's neighbors . This , of course , is obvious ; and yet it is possible to enter upon this stage of knowledge of body and soul and to sin there far more terribly than in any earlier stage of development . Many have betrayed their own souls . ' So high is this stage that the State scarcely attempts to punish such sins as crimes . There are treasons against society organized as the State more horrid than to furnish news or supplies to an enemy in war . These are the treasons that rot society , poisoning the fountain-head of social justice . It is the kind of sin that to Dante seemed most awful . ' To make righteousness a THE NEW EDUCATION 16r mock , to pollute the intelligence of man , woman , child , community , nation , to teach vileness as evidence of smartness : these have been the ambition of some , whose names are unfit for these pages . The fifth stage is yet higher . Few have ever attained it . To become self-directed in the world , to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , ? this is beyond the limits of the minds of nearly all men . But what is it for the self-directing man to be good ? This : never to secure one 's own end at any cost to another . And what is it to be intelligent ? To know how to secure one 's own end . Ile , therefore , who is both wise and good , the self-directing man of intelligence and of personal and social morality , secures his own ends without injury to others . Only the genius , only a few among geniuses , can accomplish this . The rest make a wreck of those about them . Yet higher is social control . He is good who sets the world about him to the work of its own development , and he is intelligent who so directs that work as to produce prosperity among his people . And he is evil who sets the world to do work for himself ; and he foolish who fails finally in his effort . Napoleon lived in this stage of personal evolution ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington succeeded in this stage . The imagination of man compasses yet one higher stage , comprehension of the world-spirit , relating it to the time-spirit , and interpreting it by the personal spirit . This stage includes every other , includes social direction , self-direction , knowledge of body and soul , sense-knowledge , physical skill , property in things and in one 's own body and consciousness . Plato and Socrates failed to attain this stage , the one lacking self-surrender and the other social mastery . Lincoln failed to attain it , lacking but one grace . // The Gospel story of Jesus Christ , which upon internal evidence appears to be defective as well as erroneous , nevertheless reveals the ideal person and , therefore , the redeemer of mankind . According to the story , the Master passed through every stage and through nearly every experience in every stage until Ile attained the highest . As a boy , He was taken down into Egypt , an experience of travel and sojourn very useful in securing self-alienation . Later , He acquired a manual art . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctors in the Temple at Jerusalem , He remained obedient to his parents throughout adolescence . Whether the story of the temptation in the wilderness by the devil be allegorical or historical , what it displays is that Jesus became conscious that a man of his powers might master the world . Later , his followers desired to make Him King , but what l le had already renounced as a matter of securing by force of ability He again renounced even as a matter of receiving by social favor . 13y preaching , by teaching , and by healing , He had set the beginnings of a new order among men . Meantime , He had consorted with publicans and harlots and had been tempted by every pleasure of the senses , yet had overcome . Finally , though well aware that He might escape by deceit or by flight or by an army of angels , He submitted to an illegal and unjust sentence and accepted an ignominious death on the cross rather than set a whole world in chaos . Like Socrates , Jesus had lived by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Such , in outline , is the record of the only sinless man who achieved social power . Buddha almost attained ; perhaps he did in reality . But for most men such an end , indeed , any end is a horror , for we have not achieved the victory over death . To achieve this , it is necessary to learn the world-spirit , which involves proceeding consciously from stage to stage up the long way // to world-understanding through self-renunciation . God Himself has naught to gain by all his labors through all the eternities and all the infinities . As far as we know or can understand , He is the Alpha and the Omega ; and his beginning is as his end . " Behold , thy God sublime , Through agonies of T'ime , In silence and alone , The King without a crown , Unchanged throughout all change , The infinitely strange , Forever gives and gives , And by His giving lives . " ' What , then , are the purposes of education ? Considered scientifically and considered philosophically , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they are the same . Whether for the children of the rich and of the wise , or for those of the poor and of the ignorant , they are the same . As far as he has capacity , the individual must repeat those stages in the history of the race which saw progress in social welfare , and should attempt those stages in the histories of the good and intelligent individuals which lie within the compass of his developing powers . By recapitulating the social and the personal processes , formal education proposes to develop as much as possible as many individuals as possible . And the fundamental motive in education is to bring man , the race , into harmony with the will of God for the men and women of this world . One who realizes this motive has found " the mystery of eternity present at every hour of time . " 2 CHAPTER IX THE FORMAL SYSTEM OF EDUCATION . WE may classify the materials employed by the formal system of education under three heads , ? the humanities , the sciences , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three heads , ? study , recitation , and physical work . The humanities are those subjects by which humanity has expressed unsystematically and informally its knowledge of its own life , its aspirations , its reflections , its society , its customs , its morals . Literature and language , grammar and rhetoric , philosophy and history , and whatever is subordinate to them or is wholly composed of them , belong to the humanities . The sciences are those subjects by which humanity has expressed its knowledge of the world beyond humanity , its laws , its facts , its relations , its nature , its tendency , and also those by which humanity is now able to express systematically and formally its knowledge of itself . Chemistry , physics , biology , geology , geography , anatomy , physiology , psychology , sociology , anthropology , histology , botany , ecology , philology , and many other subordinate subjects belong to the sciences . // The arts are those subjects by whose methods and devices humanity expresses its mastery of the world by setting its objects in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They include music , painting , architecture , sculpture , carpentry , iron-working , and many another exercise of skill . They may be assigned in groups under the term , " fine and industrial arts , " or perhaps with intermediate groups of art-crafts and of applied sciences . Not a few subjects are difficult to classify . Poetry is both a humanity and an art : medicine is loth a science and an art , as is education also : or perhaps more exactly , medicine and education are or should he applied sciences : history is both a humanity and a science . Political science can not be accurately classified ; for , like political economy and , to a degree , history , it is composed of all three elements . By employing these materials appropriately , the formal system of education proposes to accomplish the purposes of the school . As introductions to the humanities , it has invented two of " the three R 's , " reading and writing ; as introductions to the sciences and arts , it invented arithmetic long ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it invented drawing and scalesinging . I call these affairs " inventions , " though recognizing fully that in subject-matter they are either primitive or puerile or both . It is in their methods that reading , writing , arithmetic , drawing , and singing are school inventions . At this point , we come upon a singular matter . Adults of normal power and children of superior , or supernormal , power may enter upon the humanities , upon the sciences , and upon the arts without the formal bridging of these school arts . Of what use , then , are these mediate methods ? First , to anticipate the natural maturing of the powers , to hasten the process , and to insure it . By // education , years of experience may often he saved ; that is , education short-circuits experience . Second , to save those whom life by its haphazard and by its apparent chaos would otherwise ruin . This saving is accomplished by setting in order the ideas , and by training , disciplining , and regulating the functions , of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elements of knowledge before it must face complexities ; and thereby vastly to broaden its talents . For without the stimulus of the School arts , few would ever be versatile or open-minded or fortified upon more than a single side of their natures . Mere life tends to sharpness , narrowness , positiveness : it is intense . The School arts lead to roundness , breadth , balance , for the School is not focused upon mere success , which is survival among competitors . These school arts , reading , writing , arithmetic , singing , drawing , and recently sewing , bench work , and calisthenics , must not he confused with the true arts suggested by these terms . The general public of adults and the artists and craftsmen ( as also not a few schoolmasters ) are often , perhaps usually , wrong in their estimate of these exercises . The causes of their error are characteristic : The general public think that children and youth approach all subjects as adults do , perhaps more slowly and weakly , yet with essentially the same powers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their own sake , whereas in fact they are pursued solely for the sake of the students . The difference is wholly a matter of the point of view with a resultant antipodal opposition in method . Because of the difference in method , reading is not literature , writing is neither penmanship nor literary composition , singing is not music either as science or as art , drawing is not etching , not painting , not architecture , not design , sewing is not tailoring , bench work is not carpentry or cabinet-making , and calisthenics are not gymnastics ; but each is an admirable preparation for its respective art or craft , a setting out toward a goal , a strengthening for reality . // A school art ( contrary to popular notions and to artistic prejudices ) is not to be taken too seriously . The parent who said of her ten-year-old son , " Well , 1 should think Johnny would not try to write his composition neatly when he knows that his teacher will throw it into the waste basket without a second reading , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be persuaded to write at all , if he supposed that his little paper would be photographed and reproduced in facsimile for publication in a monthly magazine and treasured up against him to the day of his death . ' A school art is mediate , its product is ephemeral , and its motive is solely educational , being the desire to grow rapidly and well . ' The formal system of education takes the school arts , the humanities , the sciences , and the true arts , and so disposes their subject-matter and their exercises of method as to promote the growth of boys and girls into healthy , competent , and happy men and women , useful to one another ; or should do so . Moreover , beside the school arts , there are several other knowledges and skills so strangely transformed by educational requirements as to be only in name what they seem to be . The general history and even the United States history are arranged and edited for school use quite beyond identification with the true subject of history . Literature is emasculated without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elimination and of generalization and partly of reduction from adult truthfulness to educational serviceability . Geography , though confessedly made simple , is supposed to be made also encyclopedic , yet scarcely one cycle is discoverable in it . However , geography is more nearly what it purports to be than any other subject in the curriculum of the first seven or eight years . The problem of educational method is how to arrange the studies , lessons , exercises , games so as really to promote the growth of the soul , to advance its welfare , to // relate it happily and profitably to what is best in the world . This is the problem of pedagogy , its function , its responsibility ; and I confess grave doubts as to its general success . Naturally , education in all its lines of endeavor , in pedagogy as in everything else , has followed the line of least resistance . In this case , the line has been traced through the traditional course in subject-matter , partly because it is traditional , partly because it is subjective and speculative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and partly because human life seems too sacred for experiment . The tradition is easy to follow , easy for the conscience as well as for the intellect . What was good for the father may be , perhaps must be , good for the son . All caste is based upon this notion , and caste has controlled ages and millions of the civilized . The old course has been solidly established in the mind of the teacher . Ile is sure of its facts and of its principles , of its methods and of its results . Every presumption is in its favor . It made him what he is . Now the teacher is characteristically not self-alienated , for he has had no " practical experience in life . " Such experience means learning by undirected experiment upon untried affairs . It is " practical experience " for a theological student to get out among the people as a book agent or street traction employee ; or for a lawyer to serve as clerk in a store ; or for a college professor to try farming . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man has no instruction from others and no consciously and intelligently worked out theory of his own to guide him . In this sense , the practical man is " self-made . " The value of practical experience is in securing thereby self-alienation through familiarizing one 's self with self-absorbing enterprises of which hitherto one knew nothing . Since God has made the human mind a generally efficient agent , frequently by practical experience one becomes // very skillful in a strange art , of whose methods one knows nothing scientifically . ' Such experience , when successful , breeds confidence in one 's own powers , develops sympathy with others , and by projecting self out of one 's self into the world shows one 's self to the self . The instruction of others can never accomplish so much for one . I do not mean that the untaught artist will surpass in skill one who is well taught : far otherwise . I mean that one who knows nothing beside what he has been taught and what he has experienced in connection with his learning will never know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elementary school course , three or four years of high school , one , two , or three years of normal school or four years of college . Then he or she immediately begins teaching . All that he knows consists of home , of school , and of friends , and nothing of a world not of home , not of school , not of friends . But such an experience discovers only a part , a very small part , of the real world . It is group life , ? not communal , not social life . Of necessity , so trained , the professional teacher is narrow . Here rests the sole philosophical justification of the board of education 's consisting of laymen and looking with worldly eyes upon teachers and their institution , the School . Having no particular will or emotion in repeating in his own school the lessons taught him in the schools of his childhood , the teacher tends to rely upon his intellect alone and unfortunately upon but two intellectual functions , attention and memory , and mainly the latter . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The School , which ought to drive against inefficiency and immorality , ignores these perils and confines its weak efforts to illiteracy , broadly conceived . The applauded graduate of the school , the " scholar , " is a bookman and very little more , seldom even a book writer . Obviously , we must correct this in the interests of humanity , of progress , of sound culture , of social righteousness . The // formal system of education must deal with far more than it yet sees . ' To begin at the true beginning , education must secure whole-hearted and strong-willed as well as learned teachers . As a matter of self-alienation , no experience in life enforces such self-understanding as marriage and parentage . And yet by our salaries , and in the case of our women often by our rules , we forbid marriage and parentage . As certainly as that nothing that is false to human nature can last , this prescription of celibacy for women teachers can not last . ' It is a commonplace among school superintendents that the youthful normal school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twelve years of age ; despite the fact that they are nearer them in age , these girls have very little sympathy with , or understanding of , these adolescents . They do better , we all say , with young children . The reason is perfectly clear . The maiden of twenty is still in adolescence , but out of childhood . Adolescence is a true self-alienation from childhood , and gives a point of view and a perspective for childhood . The young maidens , the virgins of thirty years , and the " old nails " who understand boys and girls above thirteen years of age are very , very few . Those who do not understand them are , of course , out of place in grammar and high schools . I say " of course , " knowing that my statement is a challenge of existing conditions . I am ready to agree that the unmarried young man is quite as much out of place in grammar or high school as the unwedded woman . My proposition is very broad . As the legal profession , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men who are husbands and fathers , I believe that the educational profession should be composed mostly of parents . But , it may be objected , we have no ban upon married men in the profession . Many and many a time , I have known boards of education to refuse to appoint a man with a wife and family to a position paying but eight hundred or a thou- THE FORMAL SYSTEM OF EDUCATION rqr sand dollars , despite the fact that the candidate was ready to take the salary . The reason submitted by the board is always this : " They can not live decently upon the money . " Perhaps not . Perhaps it is also true that married men willing to take the sum are inferior in ability and in energy to unmarried men of that money-value . I have an opinion that for a young man to dare risk the support of a wife , in this age , bears testimony either to uncommon energy or to uncommon folly ; and am willing to trust to professional examination the elimination of the fools . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as the nation needs , the first essential is securing the right kind of educators , both men and women . Husband and grown children must be no more a bar than wife and children . On the contrary , they should constitute a favorable element in a candidacy for appointment . To this proposition there will be several objections . To consider them with the utmost brevity . ? The first objection is that for a wife and mother to support herself and to help in the support of her children is to break up the family . Historically and logically , this is arrant nonsense . Through untold ages until the invention of machinery and **31;0;TOOLONG , mothers supported their children . Do not imagine that the prolongation of infancy that made man human was a feat performed by the father alone or by the father mainly . It was the victory of the mother over a lower animalism that she first outgrew , teaching the father by her example . Until machinery multiplied goods and exchange transferred them with extreme ease , mothers were as essential to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sewed , planted , as well as bore the babes and suckled them . Millions of mothers to-day work as hard as do . the fathers to feed and clothe the children . Several millions are factory operatives and store clerks , bringing home their wages for the family use ; and trying to keep house by evening , Sunday , and before-day-dawn labor . There is nothing unwomanly , nothing // unmotherly , nothing unhistorical in the support of children by mothers . ' Another objection is that women teachers who are also mothers will neglect their school work because of home duties in out-of-school hours . Unless made specific , such an objection does not sit well upon the lips either of men , who are characteristically less conscientious than women in matters of detail , or of unmarried women , many of whom are very properly spending their evenings and holidays in companionship with possible husbands . The woman teacher who , well past thirty , has entirely given up the desire or the fond fear of marriage may perhaps safely criticise her married sister who wishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she may , unless , as is very often the case , she is the housekeeper for invalid parents or other relatives in dependence upon her . One specific averment does lie against the young married woman ; but when we all come , as we should , to the view that a leave of absence for a few years should be enforced upon teachers every sabbatical period and freely granted upon request at any time , we shall be glad to see the happily married woman and mother in our schools . The notion that a teacher must teach two hundred days every year or cease to be a teacher is a survival of the time when teachers were bondmen . Another objection supposed to lie against the employment of married women whose husbands are living is that their employment displaces unmarried women . This objection is not valid against the proposition to employ only the married women with talent , training , and successful experience before marriage . We are certainly not supplied in America with a sufficient number of good teachers . With married men shut out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salaries , and with married women , however skillful , shut out by regulations or by fixed custom , we are forced to accept as teachers many young girls with neither talent nor training for educational duties . There are 300,000 maiden school teachers in America ; but only 2,000,000 maids // above twenty-one years of age in all . Not one woman in seven is really born with the talents and the disposition for teaching . In our country now , every year one maid in five of our school teachers gives up teaching for marriage ; and some inexperienced girl five years younger than herself takes her place , or tries to take it . Against a double injustice , ? to the school children and to the teacher , ? I raise this protest . All other objections to married women appear frivolous ; that they will obey their husbands rather than their principals ; that they should be housekeepers rather than teachers ; and that their husbands will live in idleness upon their earnings . The answers to these objections are too obvious for explanation ; intelligent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , but faithful in a larger sense than enslaved wives could ever be ; housekeeping is not synonymous with motherhood or homemaking ; and the kind of woman who was so successful in teaching before marriage that her services are desired after marriage seldom chooses a loafer as a husband . To found , then , a formal system of education , competent for its purposes in a democracy , we require that the majority of our teachers of boys and girls above twelve shall be husbands or wives , fathers or mothers , and that some of our teachers of smaller children shall be parents . In the college , university , and professional school , the professors are men of family . Especially in the high school do we need to follow their example . Fathers and mothers of grown boys and girls are none too experienced , none too wise to manage the boys and girls of other parents . A high school of a thousand students needs a faculty of forty or fifty teachers , ten or a dozen fathers , as many mothers , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the youthful tutors of the colleges and ushers of the English schools . A young woman " studying to be a teacher " should be studying as much for her life work as she who is studying law or medicine or theology , or any young man who is studying for any profession . This is the sane view . Without it , there can never be a profession of education . Without it , we can never make a profession of what , to a majority of the // practitioners , is now merely a makeshift until marriage or other " good fortune " relieves them of the unhappy " necessity " to teach . The employment , to this time constantly increasing both absolutely and relatively , of young women and of unmarried women as teachers was originally due to three causes , two meritorious and the third temporarily necessary but now discreditable . Of these , the first was the fact that with rising standards of professional preparation for teachers , the young women just out of school were actually to be preferred to older men and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ male and female , without training , were displaced or replaced by younger but better equipped women . The second was the fact , already presented , that woman is often peculiarly fitted by age and disposition to teach sympathetically the children from four to ten years of age . ' It is still true and is likely always to be true that buoyant , carefree girls and young women from nineteen to twenty-five or twenty-eight years of age make particularly good kindergartners . The third reason was the institution in cities of compulsory education : this forced many children into school , especially children from eleven to fourteen years of age . Consequently , boards of education found it necessary to employ many more teachers than before . The most available persons to be secured by the insufficient funds of these governing boards were the young women of the country such as before 1875 had very few economic opportunities . Their labor was cheap and has remained cheap , despite the wonderful improvement in its quality . Because of the number of such teachers , their employment became a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago only , of the women , " dames " and " goodbodies , " that is , mothers and housewives , were ever employed as teachers . The young girls were found not only cheap but very amenable to lay control by school trustees and visitors . The " cult " throve until it has become almost a superstition . But in this age , // when the School is being restored to the control of educators as professional superintendents , principals , and supervisors , the rights of the child to education by the best teachers are also being restored , and the mothers and the fathers are coming back into the schools as teachers . The cult , scarcely three decades in duration , will soon be recognized as a fad and will pass into history as a curious example of the force of temporary economic and cultural conditions . A competent profession of educators , exercising the authority already sufficiently indicated , supplied with buildings , apparatus , and salaries worthy of the cause , would conduct education upon lines and by methods , devices , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these transition days when universal education is impoverished , weak , and empirical . What formal system it would establish no man can foresee . And yet few will doubt that certain features would appear . These I submit one by one , expecting a challenge of each , and knowing that I can not be right in all . First : The period of education , while compulsory , will be arbitrary not as to age but as to attainment . Every boy and every girl will be kept at school until adolescence has passed its climax and character and intelligence have been well established . The ideal is to send out each graduate literate , efficient , and moral , able to understand at least the important phases of neighboring society , ready to do something worth while , and strong not only to resist temptation , but also to help others in righteousness . Every depraved and vicious boy and girl , man and woman , ? by whatever name they may be called , by whatever immorality he or she may take a living out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or promiscuity or other criminality be a survival of primitive and natural conditions , which the good have overcome , or whether these ecstasies // or sorrows be perversions due to a multitudinous humanity , careless of its degenerates , ? is evidence that education is incomplete , and that the School does not yet perform its perfect work . Second : The materials of education will be widely varied to meet different individuals and to remedy different social conditions . All the elementary work will , however , be done in one " common school " for all as now , the ideal einiteitsschule of the German Democrats , our real school dedicated to equality of opportunity . Options and electives must be multiplied , and " constants , " though maintained in definite form , must be reduced in number . ' The " bents , " when bad , must be made straight ; when good , must be followed . Aptitudes and interests must be atrophied when dangerous and nourished when profitable . We must aim at breadth of mind , at sincerity of heart , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge functioning as aims and guides , must be implanted iii curiosity by teaching facts upon principle , and motives , which issue from knowledge functioning as impulses and desires , must be developed in feeling by action likewise upon principle . Third : Study , recitation , lecture , and exercises must be proportioned not only to the various grades of the School , but also to the various individuals . The desideratum is to do away with idleness and to secure in every moment work or whole-hearted play or perfect rest . Since we are to keep the boy and the girl at school until educated , and since we are to give them the materials needed by their souls , we must see that every moment counts for growth . Fourth : The School " as good as the people want " is as useless as the Church that is no better than its attendants and neighbors . The School must be rescued . // from mediocrity and supineness and sordidness . It must be made so good as to be a happy memory and a constant inspiration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people as they are , I marvel that the people are as intelligent and as good as they are . The kindness overflowing from strength that is anxious to be of service , the love of truth that characterizes men and women of free nobility , the sense of beauty potent in the souls that mean to bring ideals to reality and to harmonize art and fact , and the wealth that God and invention have now made possible everywhere in this land , must transform the actual School of the present into the enlarged , enkindled , enriched , and ennobled School of the future , to the end that as many as possible ( not merely the survivors of a narrow formalism ) shall be saved for themselves and for this nation . The vicious do not desire such a School , nor do the avaricious , the tyrannical , or the slothful ; for vice feeds on ignorance and begets it , and avarice thinks to grow rich upon the forced labor of the starveling , tyranny fears the intelligent , and sloth is scornful of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , but must image the civilization that may come to pass . The formalism of these times , which hides its shallowness and insufficiency behind programmes , courses , reports , regulations , and routine drudgery , must give way to life , to the informal that is spiritual . And the life will justify itself , as it has in all ages of the past , by creating new and larger forms and modes for the larger spirit that is ever flowing into the soul of man . The new School will be a relation between teacher and learner : all the rest will be incidental . As Confucius said , " Better a conversation with a wise man than five years of the study of books . " The School must be for every pupil a walk and conversation with wise men , such as use forms and modes not as ends but as means . The real product of the good School is // not high marks , fine compositions , beautiful drawings , the Latin essay , a steam-engine , but youth who love the light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercises of every description will be evaluated with reference to the pupils and graded according to their needs . The boy will not study all American history consecutively when fifteen years of age because " he will soon leave school , " nor will the girl study " Evangeline " because " every American should know something of Longfellow . " The location of studies and exercises will be determined solely in the interest of the pupil , for the purpose of the School is to furnish forth into life the best possible man or woman . By assuming this sovereignty , the School renounces all obligations of service to Church , to State , to Business , to Art , and to Culture . It teaches nothing upon dictation ; and the sole utilitarianism that it knows is the utilitarianism of providing for Society capable , righteous , and learned men and women . On the other hand , and indeed as a consequence of this position , the School will utilize , as never before , all knowledge and art in the preparation of men and women ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Society and all its institutions . Of course , when the School aims to send out completely educated young men and women , the man who is only a business man will deplore the rising wages and the insufficiency of cheap help , he who is only a politician will resent the activity of independents , he who is only a clergyman will mourn the prevalence of free thinkers , and he who ' " ? wants a submissive wife " or some other woman victim of " man 's superiority " will want her forever , since none will be ready for the sacrifice . For when the School is strong and bold enough to evaluate and locate studies and exercises as the School chooses , we shall find many omissions and additions and changes in its management , curricula , and results ; and its courses will display a // simplicity as gratifying to intelligent critics as it will be delightful to the pupils . Sixth : The School will increase not only in number of subjects and exercises but in complexity of organization and in the variety of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , schools for children from eight to twelve , schools for boys and girls from thirteen to sixteen , and schools for youth from seventeen to twenty . Each school requires a special kind of faculty and a peculiar kind of management , because each offers a characteristic problem . Whether two consecutive schools are under one roof is not very important , but they must have different teachers and different organization and administration . This School of the future is forever coming to pass . Evidences of increasing independence , of growing knowledge , of new , higher , and larger ideals , while not on every hand , outweigh and outnumber all evidences to the contrary . CHAPTER X IN the evolution of human society , there has been discovered a wonderful machine by which progress may be intentionally produced by majority agreement , so that we need no longer to depend upon accidental collisions of persons and of groups , but in peaceful and orderly fashion may resolve upon and adopt our line of march . This wonderful machine has been the theme of many writers t and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislature of the delegates of the people operating the republic as a representative democracy . Neither state nor government , neither legislature nor democracy , is the simple affair that it appears to be . Each indeed is so complicated as almost to defy analysis , history , and description . There is as yet no complete science of human nature , though this science has its beginnings in psy- // chology . And there can be no complete science of democracy until there is a clear science of society : that is , we can not know the people until we know both the political man and the private man , the latter of whom the Greeks called " idiot . " Man in democracy is in the position of the prospector who has found gold but who must yet dig the mine to get the ore out . The first , fundamental , distinctive , and characteristic legislature of a great democratic people , conscious of its power and hopeful of its destiny , is the convention to form the constitution , which is to be its basic law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a crisis in the history of the people . Once inaugurated , only the power of a military genius can prevent or overthrow it . At some point , every government depends upon autocratic will , ? personal , oligarchic , aristocratic , democratic . The constitutional convention , whether or not it submits its decisions to the approval of other political bodies , expresses the will of democracy . The constitutional convention of our Nation was more genuinely democratic than that of any State save four , for its conclusion permits men and women alike to vote . In forty-one States , we are still governed by a political aristocracy of adult males . The American constitutions , National and State , create the conditions of all the social institutions , ? Religion , Government , Family , Property , Education , Culture , War , Business . In the State of New Jersey , by virtue of the Constitution and of Acts of the Legislature , designed to make its provisions effective , the differentiation of the School from the State has t82 THE MACHINERY OF EDUCATION proceeded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former . The State School Superintendent is a court of special and superior jurisdiction in all legal matters of public education , and appeals go from him to the State Board of Education . The State courts can not interfere with any executive orders or legal interpretations issuing from City , County , and State Superintendents , or from the various municipal boards of education or the State Board , save that the Supreme Court may determine the constitutionality of a particular law . As a matter of custom , the State Legislature passes , with little or no change , the bills proposed by the State Board of Education . Every municipality is a school district , constituting a corporation separate from the ordinary city corporation . Municipal school officers are in no sense town or city officers , and are , therefore , independent of mayors , councils , and all other boards . ' The State pays more than half of all local school expenditures , save those for buildings . The differentiation is not complete , because the laws for the School are made by the State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though indeed many minor rules and regulations are made by the latter body . All taxes are provided for , though not entirely determined in amount , by the State Legislature . A considerable degree of autonomy is vested in local boards of education as to rules and regulations . The State Superintendent of Public Instruction , however , is nominated by the Governor , and confirmed by the Senate of the State Legislature . Since he must hold a State certificate to teach , he belongs educationally to the School , though politically to the State . The legislation for the School begins with the Constitutional Convention , proceeds through the Legislature , the State Board of Education , if any , and the County Board of Education , if any , and ends with the Municipal Board of Education . This legislation is of exceeding importance , especially that by the first three bodies . Here many vital questions arc settled , if not answered . // It is legislation usually by men not only incompetent , but also indifferent . Many State and municipal legislators are disloyal to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 . Legislation that makes education compulsory from six to twelve years of age betrays education , because these are not the most important years for education . 2 . Legislation that makes education compulsory only in name , but provides all manner of ways of escape and fails to provide economic support for the children of ( lire poverty , is false to democracy . 3 . Legislation that provides fine and broad curricula with or without ample and appropriate buildings and apparatus , but fails to provide a sufficient number of happily circumstanced and efficient teachers , is incompetent . 4 . Legislation that lays heavy burdens upon teachers , but provides for them only ignorant , disloyal , and dishonest controllers , as municipal board members , is malicious . 5 . Legislation that by authorizing rigid contracts without release clauses , by forbidding married teachers to teach , and by similar restrictions of personal liberty , degrades what should be a profession into State helotage , is subversive of civilization . 6 . Legislation that creates such an office as that of superintendent without prescribing the highest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is such a mockery of education as grieves and alarms the intelligent patriot . 7 . Legislation that promotes or even permits unsanitary , unhygienic school buildings , grounds , courses , exercises , programmes , or rules and regulations , and fails to make health the beginning and the end of education , is the modern offering up of the seed of mankind to Moloch . All the possibilities of the improvement of education begin with legislation , for the constitutional convention of democracy is omnipotent . Private education , parochial education , and endowed education , as well as free common education , may well be improved by legislation . // As a stream can not rise higher than its source , so education can not rise higher than the legislation that initiates it . Law is the die by which all schooling must be cut . The trunk of a tree tapers from its roots up . Briefly , so much as to legislation as an educational instrument . Second in importance is administration . The laws may be very good , but when badly executed or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very bad . Under the same State laws , even under similar municipal regulations , one city may have excellent schools and another criminally poor schools . I mean criminally in the literal sense , that is , schools so poor as to defy the laws and to render their administrators liable to indictment and to conviction . With really bad laws , it is not possible to have good schools . In order to have a good administration of good laws , it is necessary to have a good system and competent , efficient , and righteous administrative officers . The State laws limit but slightly the administration of private , endowed , and parochial schools . The noteworthy peculiarity of American State legislation is that it leaves the private school free to do almost anything that its administrators choose . While creating the vast public school system , it permits , one may even say encourages , the supplementing of this system by the establishment and conduct of other schools . In many States , so numerous and so correlated are the Catholic parochial schools that they constitute a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of private , endowed , and Episcopal , Catholic , Lutheran , and other parochial schools has alarmed some publicists , sociologists , and others to such an extent that they have proposed various interferences with their freedom in isolation from State control . Among these interferences , accomplished in some States or at least proposed , are these : ? // r . To require the employment only of properly qualified teachers , whose proficiency shall be known , perhaps even determined , by State educational inspectors . ' 2 . To enforce the compulsory attendance of boys and girls of so-called " school age " by the visitation of attendance ( " truant " ) officers in private as well as in public schools . 3 . To require instruction in certain subjects , such as reading , writing , arithmetic , hygiene , American history , by the inspection of State educational officers . 4 . To enforce laws relating to ventilation , sanitation , hygiene , lighting , seating capacity , per capita of pupils to the teacher , gradation , graduation , and similar matters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from public schools only upon rules and by examinations of the State teachers . G. To apportion State public funds to such private , endowed , or parochial schools as fully conform to State laws and regulations , and to close up others . The State seriously questions the right of parents to place their children in schools of inferior quality , or of teachers to control and instruct them there . By the democratic State , we all live and die . By the quality of its people , it lives or dies , ? whence proceeds the right of the democratic State to do what it will with its own . This is not mere theory . As matter of fact , the despotic , omnipotent , modern democratic State actually before our own eyes is doing what it will with our children , whom , be it known , plainly and to our sorrow , it often chooses to treat cheaply and meanly . ' In most States , the public schools constitute a system centralized in form , if not in fact , about a State Superintendent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This officer and this board have more or // less executive control and legislative jurisdiction over the district schools . The State control of the schools in districts of the cities and towns is usually much less than that of the schools in the districts of the villages and strictly rural neighborhoods . In some States , the cities and towns possess charters , giving them distinctive rights and privileges , and isolating them from the general State system . Such charters in this age are survivals of elder ages when universities , guilds , and other societies , corporations , and institutions secured liberties by grants from imperial sovereigns or from feudal lords . In general , through the State School system , State and School are paralleled and demarked by a political board of education and an educational hierarchical officer known as State , County , City , or Town superintendent or Village or Township principal . This paralleling of State and School indicates the differentiation of the School from the State and its integration as an equal social institution . Of course , it may be argued , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adopted the ancient School and is transforming it in character . Or it may be argued that the schools , many and various , seeking homogeneousness and integrity , seized upon the State for support and have become a great social institution , essentially and unfortunately , perhaps irredeemably , parasitic . But the truth appears to be that the democratic State , seeking evolution into competent and just government , calculated to advance the welfare of mankind , discovered in the ancient schools an invaluable idea , that of the probability of education from the right formal discipline and instruction . Democracy then saw what was never before known in the world save by men of genius , ? that education is the mode , the only mode , of continuous progress . Democracy saw in education part of the cause and all of the cure of civilization ; saw , that is to say , that government of the people , by the people , for // the people can and will produce a happy civilization by means of true education and by no other means whatsoever . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the product of the democratic spirit as the State itself is . The history of education shows that since democracy took possession of the School , it has been born again , born into a larger life . The business of the local board of education is fourfold . ' It must raise in whole or in part the funds for buildings and maintenance by appeal either to town meeting or to city council or by direct levy upon property ; sometimes it has very great , sometimes very limited , powers in respect to securing funds . It must expend such funds as it gets for permanent improvements or for current expenses . It must secure teachers , janitors , and other employees to operate its plant . And it must govern the schools . At a thousand points in this business , the local board may fall below the ideal of education as expressed in the State laws . This local board is legislative , administrative , and judicial . It legislates when it prescribes rules and regulations to carry out State laws . It administers when it purchases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the board administers theoretically at least , often really , even the education itself . It is judicial in that it decides all appeals from the actions of its appointees and employees . The local superintendent is also an administrative , a legislative , and a judicial officer . Unless he has rights derived from qualifications prescribed by the laws of the State Legislature or from the rules and regulations of the State or County Board of Education , he is almost wholly subordinate to the municipal board of education . // He has , of course , the contractual and personal rights guaranteed by National and State Constitutions and a certain measure of rights due to public opinion , which fortunately , because it holds him rather than the board of education responsible for actual school conditions , is very apt to support him in controversies with that board . In a city school system , there are usually from six to ten grades or ranks of the teaching force : first , the superintendent ; second , the associate , assistant , or deputy superintendents ; third , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; fourth , the division or district superintendents ; fifth , the principals of schools with or without annexes or branches , the high school principals outranking but not controlling the grammar ( full elementary ) school principals , and these outranking and sometimes controlling the intermediate and primary school principals ; sixth , the vice or assistant principals , if any ; seventh , the heads of departments within the schools , if any ; eighth , first assistants ; ninth , directors with one or more subordinates ; and tenth , . the class teachers , permanent , temporary , and substitute . Such a system is essentially either hierarchical or feudal . Many varieties and forms are in actual existence or have been proposed . Sometimes the teachers have almost absolutely permanent tenure : their class-rooms are allodial possessions . Sometimes the system is a torso , with a superintendent in name but not in fact . Sometimes the reverse is true , when the board delegates to him all its powers , and he employs , discharges , transfers , elevates , and reduces all subordinates almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organization and in administration so radically as not to permit a brief summary of fact . The principles in issue may , however , be discussed and evaluated . Over against State centralization stands local autonomy . Whatever may be our opinion as to which should prevail , we must agree that from Massachusetts to California the tendency in every // State , with no demonstrable exception , is toward greater control by the State and away from that by the municipality . Very complicated municipal systems of education sometimes result . On the side of the State , there may be State legislature and courts , county board of freeholders and courts , and municipal council , mayor , judges , and others in partial control ; and on the side of the School , State board of education , State superintendent and staff , county board of education and superintendent , and municipal board of education and superintendent . State centralization seems to develop such advantages as these : ? r . Assurance of local schools everywhere , reaching at least a minimum efficiency and maintained for at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minimum education for every child . 3 . Effective encouragement of progress and condemnation of retrogression in the weaker and more ignorant communities . 4 . Such a measure of general uniformity as in our mobile population permits the pupil to go freely from a school in one community of the State to another , and facilitates his transfer outside of the State to a school elsewhere . 5 . Establishment of a central office of education on guard at the State Capitol where sits the legislature with its vast powers over education , public and private . Local autonomy seems to develop certain other advan-tages m . Encouragement of the immediate personal interest and ncern of parents and of other citizens in the education of each individual pupil . 3 . Incitement of effort in those educational activities which e represented by parents ' organizations , free evening and day lectures , artistic buildings and grounds , kindergarns , and physical training of one kind and another . 3 . Appeals to various degrees of local pride : ( a ) excelling // every other community ; ( b @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reaching at least the average . ' From the extreme local freedom of Pennsylvania to the extreme centralization of Louisiana is a long distance ; but recent developments in States as far apart as New York and California seem to indicate a national conviction that the safety of democracy rests wholly upon education , and that this is too important to be intrusted to municipalities . Indeed , the conviction is spreading that the Nation itself should organize a central office of education and build up a School system as wide as its own boundaries . ' Otherwise , the contrasts between the States in respect to intelligence , efficiency , and morality may become so great as to be a cause of sectional separations and antipathies . In particular , the establishment of great national universities , in the several regions of the country , with picked students on salaries and pledged to enter the government service as consuls , teachers , ' clerks , scientists , after graduation , is advocated as a practical necessity . Similarly , to prevent the child-illiteracy and the child-slaughter due to childlabor carelessly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industrial training of all citizens , whatever their nationality , race , religion , or color , to encourage proficiency in the sciences and the arts , ? metallurgy , forestry , engineering , agriculture , and all other useful occupations requiring skill , ? and to diffuse generally a knowledge of the principles of morality in the common and the uncommon affairs and relations of life , national regulation and subsidizing of State school systems are
