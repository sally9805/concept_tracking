txt Following a series of quarrels about the manner of his defense , Harry Kendall Thaw , the accused murderer of Stanford White , dismissed yesterday the firm of Black , Olcott , Gruber &; Bonynge as his counsel . The dismissal was absolute , and almost before the lawyers had received his letter advising them that their connection with his case was at an end he sent for the reporters and handed them a copy of the communication . Of all the developments in the Thaw case none has been more surprising than the action of the defendant In thus discharging the men who have had charge of his interests from the day following the Madison Square Garden tragedy . Ex-Judge Olcott has been in almost daily consultation with the man from Pittsburg , and has spared neither time nor money in running down evidence in his behalf . He has permitted his other law business to look after itself . Terence J. , his associate , has been even more assiduous . To Mr. Olcott , Mrs. Thaw , wife of the defendant , related @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stenographers in the employ of the firm . Every witness for the defense so far discovered has been examined by the firm . When it was rumored that Thaw was short of ready cash ex-Judge Olcott stepped to the front and instructed Warden Flynn to let the prisoner have everything he wanted , regardless of cost . Thaw 's Letter to His Counsel . It was well along in the afternoon when Thaw sent word to Warden Flynn that he wished to see the reporters . When he confronted the newspaper men who answered his summons he handed out a typewritten letter , saying it was a Copy of the communication he had just dispatched to the firm which had been in charge of his case . This was the letter : New York , N. Y. , July 14. 1906 . Messrs . Black , Olcott , Gruber &; Bonynge. 240 Broadway , New York City . Dear Sirs : After careful consideration , I have concluded to make a change in my attorneys , and , while I have no possible criticism to make of your conduct of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to no longer retain you as my attorneys . You will therefore regard your connection with my case as finished and will please deliver all papers in my ease to Clifford W. Hartridge . I have Sent a copy of this letter to Mr. Hartridge and asked him to communicate with you at once . Yours truly , H. K. THAW . While Thaw was evidently laboring under suppressed excitement when he handed out a copy of this letter , he kept himself well in hand . He was carefully dressed and newly shaven . " What is the reason for this action on your part ? " he was asked . " I have no statement to make , " he replied , " further than that contained le my letter . " Then he ; timed and went back to his cell . Clifford W. Hartridge , who halls from Pittsburg , now maintains offices at 149 Broadway . He has long been identified In a legal capacity with the Thaw interests and was somewhat more communicative than the other firm , but he would do no more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's leading counsel is no longer in the case . " The letter speaks for Itself , " he declared . " My client insisted that it be made public . I may have a statement to matte to-morrow . " District Attorney Jerome and Assistant District Attorney Gamin learned of the letter just before they left the Criminal Courts Building . They refrained from comment . Others about the District Attorney 's office suggested that there might be something behind the seemingly inexplicable move . Comments in Jerome 's Office . " It 's crazy enough on its face , " one man said , " to warrant the inference that it is part of a plan , following Thaw 's . defiance of his lawyer 's advice in giving out statements to the reporters , to bolster up a plea of Insanity . It would not surprise me if , after all , the lawyers ostensibly dismissed are identified with the defense when Thaw faces a jury . " With the Olcott firm out , Thaw is minus a single lawyer who is skilled in criminal practice . Lewis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Olcott firm , is unknown in the Criminal Court Building . Mr. Hartridge , his new counsel , has never practiced there . Thaw 's personal counsel , John B. Gleason , is also a civil practitioner . If the dismissal of Black , Olcott , Gruber &; Bonynge is not rescind. ed it will be necessary to retain some other firm versed in criminal practice . While Thaw was preparing the letter to his attorneys his mother , Mrs. William Thaw ; his sister , Mrs. George L. Carnegie , and her husband were steaming up the bay aboard the steamship Kaiserin Auguste Victoria . The ship docked in Hoboken soon after 5 o'clock . They were met at Quarantine by messengers from Thaw ' hearing letters from him to Ills mother . It was too late for Mrs. Thaw to visit the Tombs , and the party was driven to the Hotel Lorraine , where Mrs. Harry K. Thaw is stopping . Josiah C. Thaw , Harry 's brother , was at the dock . He accompanied his mother to her hotel , later returning to the Holland House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to discuss the case . It was evident early yesterday morning that there was one thing important impending in the Thaw case . Between 8 and 10 o'clock he was continuously engaged with lawyers . Representatives of the firm of Black . Olcott , Gruber &; Bone ynge . did not participate in the conferences . As he has not heretofore received callers until after his wife 's daily visit , this was regarded as significant . The fact that Clifford W. Hartridge was the first to appear also excited comment . After an earnest conference with his client , Mr. Hartridge left the Tombs , appearing a little later with his partner , A. Russell Peabody . John B. Gleason arrived about the time they were leaving . Mr. Hartridge was questioned closely by the reporters after his second visit and re-. plied that there would be nothing to give out for the time being , but that he might make a statement relative to the case on Sunday . After the news of their dismissal had been pretty well circulated members of the Olcott firm decided to say something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been dismissed by Thaw in a fit of anger , a culmination of a series of disagreements between him and his counsel as to the plan of defense . Ex-Judge Olcott has all along contended that the only thing to do was to plead insanity . and Thaw has vehemently insisted that he would not stand for such a plea . On Friday afternoon , so one story ran , there was an open break , when Thaw told ex-Judge Olcott that he was through with the firm " I am the boss , " Thaw is said to have declared after the lawyer told him that he would have to put himself unreservedly in the hands of his counsel . " and I wo n't plead insanity . I 'm no more crazy than you are . " Statement by the Olcott Firm . When ex-Judge Olcott left the Tombs after this interview his temper was at the boiling point . He did not believe , however , that Thaw meant what he said . Last night , after the receipt of the letter , this statement was made by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engaged by Harry Thaw , but by the law firm of Delafield &; Longfellow , who are counsel for Harry Thaw 's ? mother , and who were counsel for his father in the latter 's lifetime . They re/Pined us to take care of the criminal end of the case . We have been obliged . in making our plans for the defense of young Thaw , to proceed along lines in defiance of his wishes . Further than that I do not care to talk just now . " Another cause of disagreement , it Is said . arose over the payment of bills contracted by Thaw since his imprisonment . On Wednesday a statement of his account , showing his indebtedness to be about $20n , was handed him . He marked " 0 . K. H. K. T. " on the statement and directed that it be sent to ex-Judge 01-cott . From the Olcott office the bill went to Delafield &; Longfellow , and there , for some reason , it stayed . Friday morning Thaw asked if the bill had been paid . When told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passion and demanded a check book . He drew his personal check to cover the amount , and sent it to the Fourth National Bank for certification . It was certified and turned over to the attendant . In the meantime , however , ex-Judge Olcott had paid the bill with his own check , the check reaching the Tombs a few minutes after Thaw had settled the account . The man to whom the bill was due could not understand why he should be paid twice , and reported to Thaw . Sent Back Office Check . " Send Judge Olcott 's check back to him , " Thaw ordered . " I do n't need and do n't want his money . I have plenty of money of my awn . " The first open break with his counsel came one day last week when Thaw called in the reporters and issued a pronunciamento denying that he is insane , and declaring that this would not be the plea of the defense . Of this episode ex-Judge Olcott said : " Harr ; pestered me so much I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the nest day he called in the newspaper reporters again and made a second and a stronger statement . After the break on Friday , which came when the ex-Judge tried to reason with him , one of the senior representatives of the firm called at the Tombs . R. C. Peck , a young lawyer who has been taking care of Thaw 's correspondence , was the only one to show up from the Olcott office yesterday . The Tealserin Auguste Victoria , with the elder Mrs. Thaw , her daughter , and sonin-law aboard . should have reached port earlier . but she ran into a fog bank and was forced to proceed at half speed . This brought her in five hours late . The revenue cutter Hudson , which met the vessel at Quarantine , carried John B. Gleason . Thaw 's lawyer , and John A. Wade , the chaplain of the Tombs , to greet the party . Both Mr. Gleason and Dr. Wade were the hearers of letters from Harry Thaw to his mother , and Dr. Wade had In addition a packet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These declared his innocence and prophecied his acquittal . " Tell my mother . " Thaw told Dr. Wade , " that all my thoughts are of her and that I am most anxious to see her . Give her these letters . They may show her that I still have friends who believe In me . They are from people all over the United States . " Thaw Impatient to See His Mother . The clergyman said that Thaw was in a fever of impatience to see his mother , and that he had talked of her a great deal . Mr. Gleason said that he did not know whether he should see Mrs. Thaw or not ? that it would rest entirely with her . " So far as my business with her is concerned , " he said , " I have simply to deliver a letter from Harry . " When am cutter reached the ship and the lawyer and Chaplain climbed up its sides , they discovered that it was no easy matter to even find out the cabins occupied by : he Thaw party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experienced the same difficulty . Finally Mr. Gleason and Dr. Wade succeeded in reaching the Thaw maid . Through the maid they sent Mrs. Thaw the letters in their care and asked if there was anything they could do for her . She sent back word that there v.-as not . George L. Carnegie , her son-in-Iaw , explained to them that Mrs. Thaw was much fatiguei and greatly distressed and that she could not see any one until she had consulted with her son , Josiah C. Thaw . who was to meet her at the dock , ' ' There is absolutely no use in trying to see Mrs. Thaw , " Mr. Carnegie told the reporters . " She knows nothing of her son 's case , and if she did she would not care to discuss it at this time , although she may say something in a few days . Josiah C. Thaw , she says , is now the head of the family , and she wishes- to see him first before making a statement . " Mrs. Carnegie , who joined her husband , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on behalf of herself or her mother . " What is there for me to say ? " she asked . " Mother is prostrated and will see no one . She is simply a loving parent coming hack to the defense of her son , whom she dearly loves . " Mrs. Carnegie said that they had been on the ocean for some days , and that the only details of Harry 's case which they had received had been conveyed to them by wireless telegraphy . She did not meet either Mr. Gleason or Dr. Wade , and soon retired to her cabin , where she stayed until the ship docked . Mrs. Thaw Kept In Her Cabin . ? ' The steward said that Mrs. Thaw stayed In her cabin for the entire trio . Her meals were sent to her . With her maid she occupied the Chambres de Luxe , Nos. 383 and 385 . Mr. and Mrs. Carnegie were in 214 and 218 . Before the Kaiserin reached Quarantine . Mrs. Thaw went to her daughter 's room and stayed there until she left the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on deck and looked around for Josiah C. Thaw . They soon saw him beside the first cabin gangway . Mrs. Carnegie was dressed in a gray checked suit , and wore a flowered hat . Mr. Carnegie went back to the cabin and got Mrs. Thaw . She was dressed : : 11 in black , and leaned heavily on his arm . As she walked to the gangplank , she was seemingly oblivious to all that went on about her . The pier was alive with waving flags and resounded with welcomes to the home comers . When she met her son at the foot of the gangway. he took her in his arms end kissed her . He led the way to the end of the pier I and down the steps . to where two electric hansoms were we item . Into these they stepped , eluding a small army of camera fiends , and were driven rapidly to the Fourteenth Street Ferry Evelyn Nesbit Thaw was not at the pier to meet her mother-in-law . It had not been expected by friends of the family that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presence would have at- , tracted much attention . As it was . not ten persons on the pier recognized the , Thaw party . Meeting Between the Two Mrs. Thaws . At the limel Lorraine both the elder and the younger Mrs. Thaw as well as , the Carnegies. refused to see the reporters . They went at once to the rooms ! which had been engaged for them . The apartments of Mrs. Thaw the younger ' are on a different floor from those of her mother-in-law . A note was sent to her , some time : titer the arrival of her hus-1 band 's relatives . asking if she had seen her mother-in-law . " I saw motheit. " she sent back word . " There is no more to say . " It is understood at the Botel that the younger Mrs. Thaw called on her motherin-law in the latter 's apartments and i stayed but a few minutes . They did not I dine together . That Mrs. Thaw the elder will he able ! TO see her son to- ( lay is problematical. ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do so . Commissioner Lantry Vas out of town , and up to a late hour last night nobody had been found who had the authority to issue a permit in the , Commissioner 's absence . The chances , therefore , are that she will be unable to see Thaw before to-morrow . Mrs. Harry Thaw , accompanied by May , reached the Tombs in het electric hansom yesterday morning at 10:15 o'clock . She asked that Miss MaoKenzie be allowed to go to her husband 's cell with her . The request was referred to Warden Flynn , who promptly denied lit When the two presented themselves at the gate , Miss was told that she should have to stay in the waiting room unless she had a pass signed by the Commissioner . Mrs. Thaw thereupon made a second appeal to the Warden . She was most earnest in pressing her request , and Miss gave the impression that it was of the utmost importance that she should see the prisoner . Warden Flynn was firm in his refusal . Finally Mrs. Thaw went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tombs together and were driven to the offices Of Hartridge &; Peabody . After a stay of about an hour there , they returned to the Tombs and Miss waited down stairs while the wife went to Thaw 's cell . Rejoining her friend after a somewhat shorter stay than before , Mrs. Thaw was driven to her hotel , where she stayed for the rest of the day . After she left the prison Mr. Hartridge appeared for a second visit and stayed several hours . Mrs. Thaw said her husband was cheerful , but the prison attendants said that for the first time since his imprisonment he ate no lunch and seemed excited about something . District Attorney Fooled . Assistant District Attorney Garvan admitted yesterday afternoon that he had been badly fooled by a man who lived in Manchester , N. H. , and who declared that he had such valuable evidence about the Thaw case that his expenses were paid to New York by the State . This man , who said he was Andrew Cummings , declared he had letters which were written to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which Mrs. Thaw said : " The dirty blackguard is out of the way , and I am glad of it , but I did n't think it would be done that way . " Deputy Assistant District Attorney Turnbull was sent to Manchester to examine Cummings . but the man said he would treat only with Mr. Garvan . His expenses were thereupon paid to New Tork . He arrived on Thursday night and was taken to Mr. Garvan 's house at 23 Fifth Avenue . He said he did n't have the letters with him  --  that his wife had taken them with her on a trip to Harlem . He declared that Mrs. Cummings and Mrs. Thaw were great friends , Mr. Garvan , much annoyed , told Cummings to be sure and bring the letters the next day . and sent him to the Astor House . There he registered as " E. P. Cummings , Cambia Station , N. H. " Mr. Garvan contracted to pay his bill . Friday passed and no Cummings came to the District Attorney 's office . Mr. Garvan sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleared out , bag and baggage , before 7 o'clock . Cummings told Mr. Garvan that he was going to Europe , but that he would be back in time for the trial . " I suppose I was stung , " Mr. Garvan admitted . " But he did n't get but $25 from me , and he paid the long distance telephone tolls , which were almost that much . " Joseph Leiter , whose name was mentioned as a possible witness for the State , and who is ' now in Chicago , yesterday issued a formal denial that he ever attended a dinner-dance at which Nina Farrington , the actress , was a guest . He said he was unacquainted with any of the parties to the Thaw case . Moses Sachs . a lawyer , of 63 Park Row , counsel for Matthew Glazer , a traveling salesman , announced yesterday that his client was willing to swear that while in the cafe of a Broadway hotel which Stanford White frequented . the architect approached an ex-prizefighter and offered the latter $250 to thrash Thaw . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State in the Thaw case .
