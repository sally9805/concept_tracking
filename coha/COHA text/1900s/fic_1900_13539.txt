Miss Jenkyns 's parlor . Doors R. and L. Old-fashioned portraits on walls . Table C. , with bell and vase of flowers . Miss Matilda Jenkyns is DISCOVERED seated R. of table , her feet on a foot-stool . Miss Mary Smith sits L. of table . Both ladies have knitting or embroidery . JENKYNS , MISS It is such a comfort to have you here , dear . Since my dear sister 's death , I am well aware that I have no attractions to offer . It is only to the kindness of my friends that I can owe their company . SMITH , MISS You know how I love dear old Cranford , and you , dear Miss Matty . SMITH , MISS Have you bureau drawers enough ? I do n't know exactly how my sister used to arrange them . She had capital methods . She understood training servants , and I do n't know what to do with this new girl . Did you notice how she bounced the potatoes on the table ? SMITH , MISS She is a rough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I liked her looks the first time I saw her . SMITH , MISS I told her she was to have no followers . And what do you think she said ? " Please , ma'am , I never have but one at a time . " p. 3 SMITH , MISS Of course , you told her she could not have one ? SMITH , MISS Of course . But I wish you would have a little private talk with her . I 'll send her up . ( Rings bell , and EXIT L. ) ENTER Martha , R. SMITH , MISS I hope you find your place comfortable , Martha . MARTHA Well , ma'am , missus is very kind , and there 's plenty to eat and drink , and no more work but what I can do easily , but  --  SMITH , MISS But what , Martha ? MARTHA Why , it seems so hard of missus not to let me have any followers . There 's such lots of young fellows in the town ; and many a one has as much as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never be in such a likely place again ; and it 's like wasting an opportunity . Many a girl as I know would have ' em unbeknownst to missus ; but I 've given my word , and I 'll stick to it . And it 's such a capable kitchen  --  there 's such good dark corners in it  --  I 'd be bound to hide any one . I counted up last Sunday night  --  for I 'll not deny I was crying because I had to shut the door in Jem Hearn 's face , and he 's a steady young man , fit for any girl ; only I had given missus my word . p. 4 SMITH , MISS I will speak to Miss Matty about Jem . MARTHA Thank you , miss . ( EXIT , R. ) SMITH , MISS What will Miss Matty say ? She will think I have gone over to the enemy . But why should n't a pretty girl like Martha have her follower ? ENTER Miss Matty , L. SMITH , MISS Oh , my dear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inquire how you are after your journey . They will give you some rest to-morrow , but the next day , I have no doubt , they will call , so be at liberty after twelve  --  from twelve to three are our calling hours . And I dare say your mamma has told you , my dear , never to let more than three days elapse between receiving a call and returning it , and also that you are never to stay longer than a quarter of an hour . SMITH , MISS But am I to look at my watch ? How am I to find out when a quarter of an hour has passed ? SMITH , MISS You must keep thinking about the time , my dear , and not allow yourself to forget it in conversation . ENTER Martha , R. MARTHA Miss Betty Barker is below . May she speak to the mistress ? p. 5 SMITH , MISS Yes , yes ; but it is not twelve yet . Wait five minutes , Martha , while I change my cap . We wear our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , L. ) SMITH , MISS Who is Miss Betty Barker , Martha ? MARTHA Why , miss , she used to be lady 's maid to Mrs. Jamieson , and then she and her sister set up a milliner 's shop , and then her sister died and Miss Betty shut up shop and retired from business . She has set up a cow too . And she dresses finer than any lady in Cranford , for she 's wearing out all the caps and bonnets she could not sell . Did you ever hear , ma'am , of Miss Betty 's cow that fell into a lime pit ? SMITH , MISS No . Why , she must have been burned to death . MARTHA No , she was soon taken out , but she lost all her hair . Miss Betty cried , and was thinking of giving the beast a bath of oil ; but Captain Brown , just in joke , ma'am , told her to get a flannel waistcoat and flannel drawers ; and Miss Betty did . You ought to have seen the town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in dark gray flannel . ENTER Miss Matty , L. , her best cap on top of her old one . SMITH , MISS You may bring Miss Betty up , Martha . EXIT Martha , R. p. 6 SMITH , MISS So Miss Barker is a retired milliner ? SMITH , MISS Yes , but she sold only to the lite . No caps nor ribbons to any one without a pedigree . Oh , how angry the farmers ' wives used to be ! Lady Arley has sometimes lent her the pattern of a cap . ENTER Betty Barker , R. ; she courtesies . Good-morning , Miss Barker , I am very glad to see you . Miss Barker , let me introduce my young cousin , Miss Smith from Drumble . SMITH , MISS ( aside ) . What is the matter with Miss Matty 's head ? BARKER , MISS Glad to make your acquaintance , miss . ( Down stage ; aside . ) Drumble ! Cotton mills ! I hope her father has not engaged in that horrid cotton trade and dragged his family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a seat . ) Miss Jenkyns , will you excuse my presumption ? My former occupation considered , will you excuse the liberty ? SMITH , MISS ( aside ) . Oh , she has found out that double cap , and is going to rectify Miss Matty 's head-dress . BARKER , MISS I came to ask if you would do me the honor , the very great honor , to take tea at my house next Tuesday . I hope Miss Smith will accompany you . ( Miss Matty bows. ) p. 7 SMITH , MISS ( aside ) . Oh , that cap will fall off ! BARKER , MISS Mrs. Jamieson most kindly and condescendingly said she would be happy to come . One little stipulation she made , that she should bring Carlo . I told her if I had a weakness , it was for dogs . SMITH , MISS And Miss Pole ? BARKER , MISS I am going to ask Miss Pole . Of course , I could not think of asking her until I had asked you , madam  --  the rector @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not forget the situation my father held under yours . SMITH , MISS And Mrs. Forester , of course ? BARKER , MISS And Mrs. Forester . I thought , in fact , of going to her before I went to Miss Pole . Although her circumstances are changed , madam , she was born a Tyrrell , and we can never forget her alliance to the Bigges of Bigelow Hall . SMITH , MISS She 's a very good card-player . Mrs. Fitz-Adam  --  I suppose  --  ? BARKER , MISS No , madam : I must draw a line somewhere . Mrs. Jamieson would not , I think , like to meet Mrs. Fitz-Adam . ( To Miss S. ) In Cranford some may be poor , but we are all aristocratic . I have the greatest respect for Mrs. Fitz-Adam , but I can not think her fit society for such ladies as Mrs. Jamieson and Miss Matilda Jenkyns. p. 8 SMITH , MISS Just a choice and select few . BARKER , MISS May I beg you to come as near half-past six , to my little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dines at five , but has kindly promised not to delay her visit beyond that time  --  half-past six . Good-morning , Miss Jenkyns . ( Deep courtesies . ) Good-morning , Miss Smith . ( Stiff bow . ) Tuesday , at half-past six . ( EXIT , courtesying , R. ) SMITH , MISS Why not Mrs. Fitz-Adam ? SMITH , MISS She is the sister of our surgeon . Her parents are respectable farmers , content with their station . But their name is Hoggins . Such a coarse name ! though , as my sister Deborah used to say , it would not be much better if it were changed to Piggins . We used to hope there was a relationship between Mr. Hoggins and that Marchioness of Exeter whose name was Molly Hoggins . But the foolish man utterly denied any relationship . What could we do ? Mrs. Fitz-Adam married and went off . Then her husband died  --  I 'm sure none of us knew who he was  --  and then she came back , a well-to-do widow , dressed in rustling black silk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a deeper sense of her loss . However , we all called upon her , all but Mrs. Jamieson . You know the Hon. Mrs. Jamieson , sister-in-law to the late Earl of Glenmire ? p. 9 SMITH , MISS Oh , yes ; I have heard of her . And so Mrs. Fitz-Adam did get into Cranford society ? SMITH , MISS Yes , we thought she had settled in Cranford in the hope of being admitted to the society of the town , and if this had been her hope , it would be cruel to disappoint her . Besides , as Miss Pole said , as most of the ladies in Cranford were elderly spinsters or widows without children , if we did not relax a little and become less exclusive , by and by we should have no society at all . SMITH , MISS I always understood that Fitz meant something aristocratic ; there was Fitz-Roy . I think that some of the king 's children have been called Fitz-Roy ; and there was Fitz-Clarence , now  --  they were the children of dear , good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty name , and I think it probably means " child of Adam . " No one who had not some good blood in their veins would dare to be called Fitz ; there 's a deal in a name . I had a cousin who spelled his name with two little ff 's  --  ffoulkes  --  and he always looked down upon capital letters , and said they belonged to lately invented families . I was afraid he would die a bachelor , he was so very choice . When he met a Mrs. ffarington at a watering-place , he took to her immediately ; and a very pretty , genteel woman she was  --  a widow with a very good fortune . And my cousin , Mr. ffoulkes , married her , and it was all owing to her two little ff 's . ENTER Martha , R. , with a note , which she gives to Miss Matty. p. 10 SMITH , MISS ( reads it ) . O , Mary , my cousin , Major Jenkyns , who has lived in India thirty years , writes that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and would like to spend a night in Cranford if it will suit me to receive them into my house . Of course , it must suit me . All Cranford knows I have a bedroom at liberty . Oh , how shall I manage ? I wish he had stayed in India . Oh , no , dear , I do n't mean that ! Forget that I said it . Oh , how must I manage ? If Deborah had been alive , she would have known what to do with a gentleman visitor . Must I put razors in his dressing-room ? Dear ! dear ! and I 've got none . Deborah would have had them . And slippers and coat-brushes ? SMITH , MISS Probably he will bring all these things with him . SMITH , MISS And after dinner , how am I to know when to get up and leave him to his wine ? Deborah would have done it so well ; she would have been quite in her element . Will he want coffee , do you think ? SMITH , MISS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to wait on the table . SMITH , MISS We will have her up now and teach her . SMITH , MISS Now , Miss Matty ? SMITH , MISS Yes , now . I must have it off my mind . ( She rings bell . ) ENTER Martha , R. p. 11 SMITH , MISS ( with great dignity ) . Martha , my cousin , Major Jenkyns from India , is coming here . Miss Smith will teach you how to wait . SMITH , MISS Take the vegetables round to people and let them help themselves . SMITH , MISS And mind you , go first to the ladies . Always go to the ladies before the gentlemen when you are waiting . MARTHA I 'll do as you tell me , ma'am , but I like lads best . SMITH , MISS That will do , Martha ; you may go to the kitchen . ( Martha starts toward R. door . ) CURTAIN . @x A Lapse of Three Days . Miss Barker 's parlor . Doors R. and L. Tea-table spread , C. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C. Easy-chair down R. Cord-table up L. Miss Barker is DISCOVERED , kneeling L. , arranging paper paths . Peggy stands R. , with a tray in her hand . PEGGY What are you putting all this paper on the carpet for , ma'am ? BARKER , MISS ( arranging paper strips ) . It rained hard this morning , and I do not want my new carpet to be soiled . PEGGY I think these paths look rather queer . BARKER , MISS ( rising ) . That 's because you have not been in society , Peggy . I heard that Miss Jenkyns once gave a party and spent the whole morning before cutting out and stitching together pieces of newspaper , so as to form little paths to every chair . ( Peggy hums . ) Do n't sing . ( Peggy drops tray on chair . ) Pick up that tray . ( Inspects table . ) There , I believe everything is ready . Now , Peggy , remember not to talk to me when the ladies are here as you do when we are alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to me . Do you understand ? p. 13 PEGGY I do n't know how I 'll ever manage without you , ma'am . BARKER , MISS You 'll have to . PEGGY What a beautiful cap that is , ma'am ! BARKER , MISS ( goes to mirror and adjusts cap ) . Yes , it 's just the pattern of one Queen Adelaide wore , and the king complimented her because it was so becoming . ( A knock , R. ) Wait , Peggy , wait till I 've run upstairs and washed my hands . When I cough , open the door ; I 'll not be a minute . ( EXIT L. A short pause , then a cough . Peggy opens the R. door . ) ENTER Miss Jenkyns and Miss Smith , R. They pass in front of the stage to the mirror , L. C. SMITH , MISS What are those papers on the floor for ? JENKYNS , MISS To protect the carpet . It is the fashion in Cranford . While they take off their wraps and fold them carefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them Mrs. Jamieson ENTERS with a dog in her arms . Peggy assists the ladies , who all prink before the glass . When they are ready , the ladies say , " After you , Mrs. Jamieson , " and she leads the way . Miss Barker ENTERS L. and welcomes them . p. 14 BARKER , MISS Good-evening , Mrs. Jamieson ; delighted to see you . Good-evening , Mrs. Forester ; charmed to see you . Ah , Miss Jenkyns , this is kind . Happy to see you , Miss Pole . ( Curtly . ) Good-evening , Miss Smith . ( All are down stage . Peggy tries to approach Miss Barker . ) Delightful evening after the rain , ladies . ( Peggy pulls her arm ; aside . ) What does Peggy want ? ( Aloud . ) As I was saying  --  ( Peggy pulls her again ; aside . ) What does Peggy want ? ( Aloud . ) As Captain Brown used to say  --  ( another pull )  --  You remember  --  ( another pull ) . Poor , sweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , poor ittie , bittie doggie , and it shall have its tea , it shall . ( Takes the dog in her arms and EXIT L. , followed by Peggy . ) FORESTER , MRS . I suppose Miss Barker was thinking of Captain Brown 's saying that the ladies in the town wanted something to talk about . MISS POLE I do n't think they do . We have the St. James 's Chronicle three times a week , and we have plenty to say . RE-ENTER Miss Barker , L. p. 15 BARKER , MISS Mrs. Jamieson , will you kindly sit here ? ( She draws out a chair . ) And Mrs. Forester , will you sit next Mrs. Jamieson ? Miss Jenkyns , will you kindly sit next me ? And Miss Pole , will you take this seat ? ( Shortly . ) Miss Smith , will you sit there ? ( She draws out all chairs but Miss Smith 's ; smiles delightedly . The ladies seat themselves at the tea-table . Miss Barker , R. , and Miss Jenkyns , L. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barker 's R. , and next her Mrs. Forester ; opposite them Miss Pole at Miss Jenkyns 's L. , and next her Miss Smith . The side of the table nearest the audience remains unoccupied . ) Ah , how charming this is ! Mrs. Jamieson , shall I have the honor of pouring you a cup of tea ? How do you like your tea ? JAMIESON , MRS . Sugar and no cream . BARKER , MISS Oh , I am so sorry you will not take cream , Mrs. Jamieson !  --  cream from my cow . Miss Smith , I keep a cow . SMITH , MISS I think I have heard of it . BARKER , MISS She met with a sad accident , but Captain Brown made it all right . Mrs. Forester , how do you like your tea ? ( Miss B. asks all the ladies , and serves them . Peggy ENTERS and passes the salad , etc. , nudging the ladies if they do not help themselves . ) Yes , I was speaking of Captain Brown . Miss Smith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died . We all drop a silent tear when we think of him ( ladies take out their handkerchiefs ) , but since he is dead and we ca n't have him , we are glad there is no other gentleman in Cranford . A man is so in the way at a party . ( Ladies assent . ) You have to amuse him and find conversation for him . Why , what have you here , Peggy ? p. 16 PEGGY Why , it is the salad you made yourself in the kitchen this morning , ma'am  --  MISS POLE It is delicious . BARKER , MISS You are kind to say so , but nothing in the world equals Mrs. Forester 's bread jelly . If we might only have the receipt for that ! FORESTER , MRS . There is something sacred about that . I have made my will . BARKER , MISS Your will , Mrs. Forester ? FORESTER , MRS . Oh , only about the jelly . I have left the receipt to Miss Matilda Jenkyns . After my death she may retain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not dictate . SMITH , MISS How delicious these cakes are ! BARKER , MISS They are little cupids  --  a dish we are very fond of in Cranford . SMITH , MISS But are they not rather dangerous ? BARKER , MISS No , I do not think so . I have eaten them all my life and experienced no ill results whatever . Another cup of tea with cream , Miss Jenkyns ? Captain Brown was always joking me about my carnivorous beast  --  or was it graminivorous ? I always mix those words the same as I do horizontal ( makes a perpendicular line with her hand ) and perpendicular ( makes a horizontal movement ) . But then , you know , four-syllabled words are of no use , except to learn to spell . But you have no idea how many yards of flannel it takes to cover a cow . I was nearly ruined . p. 17 SMITH , MISS Miss Matty was telling me you had some fears of robbers in Cranford . MISS POLE Yes , we have had one or two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all round the kitchen and cellar every night . I lead the way , armed with the poker , and Mary follows with the hearth brush , and Martha carries the shovel and tongs to sound the alarm . MISS POLE I suppose every one  --  that is , every one but me  --  has fears . Nonsense I call them . SMITH , MISS I suppose it is nonsense ; but ever since I was a girl I have been afraid of being caught by my last leg just as I was getting into bed . When I was young I used to take a flying leap from a distance . BARKER , MISS We ca n't do as we used to , dear Miss Matty . Oh , no ! SMITH , MISS I do n't like to think of looking under a bed and seeing a man concealed , with a great fierce face staring out at me ; so I have bethought myself of something  --  perhaps you have noticed that I told Martha to buy me a penny ball , such as children play with  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night . If it comes out on the other side , well and good ; if not , I always take care to have my hand on the bell-rope , and mean to call out " John " and " Harry , " just as if I expected men-servants to answer my ring . p. 18 ALL What a capital idea ! BARKER , MISS Miss Smith , I do n't suppose you remember Napoleon Bonaparte ? SMITH , MISS No  --  o  --  o . BARKER , MISS I did not think you did , but I remember him . And many a night have I lain awake , thinking I heard the tramp of the French entering Cranford . Some people wanted to hide in the salt-mines , and meat would have kept capitally there , but perhaps we should have been thirsty . And your father , Miss Matty , preached two sets of sermons  --  one set in the morning , to spirit up the people to fight with bricks and broomsticks , and one set in the afternoon , making out that Boney  --  we used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same as Abaddon and Apollyon . My father and I used to think those sermons ought to be printed ; but perhaps the parish thought it was enough to hear them once . And your brother , Miss Matty , copied all those twelve sermons . There were people who said he would rather have gone fishing . Scandal , of course . SMITH , MISS Of course . BARKER , MISS Here I am rattling on , and have not asked what your special fear is , dear Mrs. Forester . We know Mrs. Jamieson fears nothing . FORESTER , MRS . I have borrowed a boy from one of the neighboring cottages and promised his parents a hundredweight of coals at Christmas and his supper every evening for the loan of him at nights . I instructed him in his possible duties when he first came ; and , finding him sensible , I have given him the major 's sword , and desired him to put it very carefully behind his pillow at night , turning the edge toward the head of the pillow . He is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spying out the major 's cocked hat , he said , if he might have that to wear , he was sure he could frighten two Englishmen or four Frenchmen any day . But I have impressed upon him anew that he is to lose no time in putting on hats or anything else ; but if he hears any noise , he is to run at it with his drawn sword . p. 19 SMITH , MISS But are you not afraid he may rush upon Jenny getting up to wash , and run her through before he discovers that she is not a Frenchman ? FORESTER , MRS . I do not think that is likely , for he is a very sound sleeper , and generally has to be well shaken or have cold water thrown on him before we can rouse him in the morning . I sometimes think such dead sleep must be owing to the hearty suppers the poor lad eats , for he was half starved at home , and I told Jenny to see that he got a good meal at night . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special timidity . FORESTER , MRS . Ghosts . ( All start and exclaim , " Ghosts ! " ) MISS POLE Nonsense ; you are troubled with indigestion or optical delusions . SMITH , MISS I have a little leaning toward ghosts myself . MISS POLE Spectral illusions ! FORESTER , MRS . Ghosts are part of my religion , and I think that I , the widow of a major in the army , know what to be frightened at and what not . PEGGY Please , ma'am , I 've seen a ghost with my own eyes in Darkness Lane . p. 20 MISS POLE Indigestion ! BARKER , MISS Peggy ! FORESTER , MRS . How did the ghost look ? PEGGY All in white , ma'am , and without her head . FORESTER , MRS . There ! PEGGY She was sitting , weeping and wringing her hands . FORESTER , MRS . There ! BARKER , MISS Now , ladies , to have a little more cheer , what do you say to a game of preference . There are six of us . Four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , MISS I will play cribbage . FORESTER , MRS . And I. MISS POLE And I. BARKER , MISS No , ladies . I will play cribbage . I do not know Spadille from Manile . The ladies step down stage while Peggy clears and removes the table and sets the card-table . Mrs. Jamieson sits in the easy-chair , R. ; the others stand , L. EXIT Peggy , R. MISS POLE I suppose , Mrs. Jamieson , you have no fear of burglars ? p. 21 JAMIESON , MRS . No ; with Carlo I am perfectly safe . BARKER , MISS Carlo is such a fierce beast ! JAMIESON , MRS . But he is a gentle dog . BARKER , MISS Oh , very gentle ! MISS POLE What a beautiful brooch , Miss Matty ! SMITH , MISS Yes , my cousin , Major Jenkyns , sent it to me from India . I was afraid to leave it at home , and afraid to wear it . As we came here I thought there was a man behind every tree . But you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think I have . They are very choice , and so I wore them all . See  --  one , two , three , four , five , six , seven . Yes , I have on seven . BARKER , MISS But I must admire this lace , Mrs. Forester . FORESTER , MRS . Yes , it was made by the nuns . You ca n't buy it now for love or money . BARKER , MISS Now , ladies , I have a little surprise for you . Such a piece of gayety as has not come to Cranford since Smith 's lions were here , and one of them ate a little child 's arm . ( Reads from an advertising card . ) " Signor Brunoni , Grand Magician to the King of Delhi , the Rajah of Oude , and the Grand Khan of Thibet , will give a performance in Cranford for one night only . " Now , are you not surprised ? " Old Assembly Hall . " Ah , that place has its associations . Many is the minuet you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Miss Pole . p. 22 MISS POLE But how did you know about this ? BARKER , MISS I saw the placard . You know my little maid , Peggy ? She has a cousin  --  second cousin  --  who scrubs at the Hall . And , passing , I thought she would like to know how Peggy was . In I went , and saw Signor Brunoni himself . MISS POLE Oh ! how did he look ? All speak at once . SMITH , MISS Young or old ? All speak at once . SMITH , MISS Married or unmarried ? All speak at once . FORESTER , MRS . Was he handsome ? All speak at once . MISS POLE Did he have a beard ? All speak at once . BARKER , MISS Oh , ladies , I thought of Thaddeus of Warsaw , and the Hungarian Brothers , and Santo Sebastiani ! But he bowed me out . Such a polite bow ! In return I dropped a courtesy . Foreigners have such elegant manners . One catches something of it . I went home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some toasted cheese . FORESTER , MRS . Toasted cheese ! p. 23 BARKER , MISS Yes , nothing but toasted cheese will soothe my soul in moments like that . ( Ladies sit at card-table , C. Mrs. Jamieson snores . ) What a compliment ! It is very gratifying to me , very gratifying , indeed , to see how completely Mrs. Jamieson feels at home in my poor little dwelling . She could not have paid me a greater compliment . ( Gives Miss S. a seat , L. , and hands her some picture-books . ) I know young people like to look at pictures . These are fashion magazines of the years 1824-1825 . You may find some useful hints . ( The ladies draw out their old-fashioned purses . ) BARKER , MISS Shall we play for penny or sixpenny points ? ALL Sixpenny . BARKER , MISS It will be more exciting , but there will be more risk . ( They play . ) BARKER , MISS Hush , ladies , if you please . Mrs. Jamieson is asleep . FORESTER , MRS. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , MISS Mrs. Jamieson is asleep . Very gratifying , indeed . I wish my sister had been alive to see this day . ( Gazes heavenward. ) p. 24 FORESTER , MRS . Your turn , Miss Barker . BARKER , MISS Hush , please , do not waken her . ENTER Peggy , R. , with tray , decanter , and glasses . JAMIESON , MRS. ( wakes ) . The room was so light that I have been keeping my eyes shut ; but I have been listening with great interest to all your amusing and agreeable conversation . BARKER , MISS Why , Peggy , what have you brought us ? ( Offers glass to Mrs. Jamieson . EXIT Peggy , L. ) Just a little , leetle glass , Mrs. Jamieson , after the salad , you know . Salads are sometimes thought not very wholesome . ( Mrs. J. accepts ; others follow her example . Terrible coughing . ) MISS POLE It 's very strong . I do believe there 's spirit in it . BARKER , MISS Only a little drop  --  just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brandy-paper over preserves to make them keep . I often feel tipsy myself from eating damson tart . JAMIESON , MRS . My sister-in-law , Lady Glenmire , is coming to stay with me . ALL Indeed ! ( Silence. ) p. 25 SMITH , MISS I am afraid we must be going . I see it is nine o'clock . BARKER , MISS Oh , ladies , do not leave me so early . ( A knock . ) ENTER Peggy , L. PEGGY The sedan chair has come for Mrs. Jamieson . ( Peggy brings the wraps and helps the ladies put them on . ) JAMIESON , MRS . Do n't you find it very unpleasant walking ? MISS POLE Oh , dear , no ; it is so pleasant and still at night . FORESTER , MRS . Such a refreshment after the excitement of a party . SMITH , MISS The stars are so beautiful . JAMIESON , MRS . Are you fond of astronomy ? SMITH , MISS Not very . BARKER , MISS Thank you , Mrs. Jamieson , for honoring my poor house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to each one , except Miss Smith . ) SMITH , MISS We have had a very pleasant evening . BARKER , MISS You are kind to say so ! The guests EXEUNT R. door , leaving Miss Barker C. and Peggy L. CURTAIN . @x A Lapse of Two Days . Miss Jenkyns 's parlor , as before . The table , C. , is set with dessert , oranges , crackers , decanters and glasses , etc . Two candles in candlesticks , one of them lighted . Miss Matty and Miss Smith are DISCOVERED seated at the table . JENKYNS , MISS Will you have an orange , dear ? I always like to draw the juice with my lips , I do so when I am alone . But it makes one look so ! SMITH , MISS We might sit with our backs to each other . SMITH , MISS Very well ; I will try not to make the noise offensive . ( They turn their chairs and sit back to back , each with an orange , Miss Matty , l. , Miss Smith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is over , and well over . ( Takes a good squeeze at her orange . ) I think Martha attended to our directions very well . SMITH , MISS Yes , I was sorry to see her nudge the major when he did not help himself to potatoes while she was handing them around . ( A good squeeze . ) Have you had any talk with Martha about followers ? SMITH , MISS No , but I must now . It is a fearful responsibility . Are you sure it is right ? ( Squeeze. ) p. 27 SMITH , MISS Oh , I am sure it is ! Martha ENTERS R. Both ladies turn their chairs about and resume their former positions . SMITH , MISS Martha , you are young  --  MARTHA ( courtesies ) . Yes , please , ma'am ; two and twenty last third of October , please , ma'am . SMITH , MISS And perhaps , Martha , you may some time meet with a young man you like , and who likes you . I did say you were not to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , and tell me , and I find he is respectable , I have no objection to his coming to see you once a week . You may think it over , Martha . MARTHA Please , ma'am , there 's Jem Hearn , and he 's a joiner , making three and sixpence a day , and six foot one in his stocking feet , please , ma'am ; and if you 'll ask about him to-morrow morning , every one will give him a character for steadiness , and he 'll be glad enough to come to-morrow night , I 'll be bound . SMITH , MISS To-morrow night ! ( EXIT Martha , R. ) It 's very sudden . You are quite sure it 's right ? I think it is time to extinguish this candle . I was so excited , I forgot . Dear , dear , how uneven they are ! If any one were to call , they would think we burned but one candle ! p. 28 SMITH , MISS But nobody does call in the evening . SMITH , MISS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yarn . SMITH , MISS Ca n't I go for you ? SMITH , MISS No , dear ; you could not find it . Watch the candles while I 'm gone , and finish your orange if you can do both at the same time . ( EXIT , R. A short pause , during which Miss Smith is comically occupied with her orange and the canales . Miss Matty RE-ENTERS . ) SMITH , MISS What is the matter ? SMITH , MISS I am rather uncomfortable . I opened the house door for a little fresh air . I heard such a strange noise just as I was opening the door . SMITH , MISS When ? Where ? SMITH , MISS In the street , just outside . It sounded like  --  ( hesitates ) . SMITH , MISS Talking ? SMITH , MISS No  --  kissing . SMITH , MISS Jem Hearn was not far away . ENTER Martha , R. MARTHA Miss Pole is below , ma'am . p. 29 SMITH , MISS Quick , light the other candle . ( Miss S. does so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , r . EXIT Martha . MISS POLE Good-evening , Miss Matty . Good-evening , Miss Mary . ( Is seated , C. ) I came to see how you are after the party . Of course , I could not call yesterday while the major was here , nor this afternoon , for I knew he would n't leave till four . I suppose you enjoyed his visit ? ( Miss Matty hesitates . ) SMITH , MISS Yes , he was very nice . He brought a Hindoo servant with him . SMITH , MISS And he reminded me of Bluebeard . MISS POLE What , the major ? SMITH , MISS Oh , no , the servant ! I thought Martha would never end staring at him , with his brown complexion and his white turban . MISS POLE Did you ever see such a supper as we had at Miss Barker 's ? I am sure you and Mrs. Forester must have seen ghosts . I wonder what Mrs. Jamieson thought of that supper ? Vulgar , I call it . She never has even seed cake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does practise elegant economy , but I thought she enjoyed Miss Barker 's supper very much . p. 30 SMITH , MISS I thought we all did . MISS POLE By the way , you 'll think I 'm strangely ignorant , but do you really know , I am puzzled how we ought to address Lady Glenmire . Do you say " Your ladyship " where you would say " you " to a common person ? I have been puzzling all the morning . And are we to say " My lady " instead of " Ma'am " ? Now , you knew Lady Arley  --  will you kindly tell me the most correct way of speaking to the peerage ? SMITH , MISS It is so long ago . Dear , dear , how stupid I am ! I do n't think I ever saw her more than twice . I know we used to call Sir Peter " Sir Peter , " but he came much oftener to see us than Lady Arley did . Deborah would have known in a minute . " My lady " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and as if it were not natural . I never thought of it before , but now you have named it , I am all in a puzzle . MISS POLE Well , I really think I had better just go and tell Mrs. Forester about our little difficulty . One sometimes grows nervous , and yet one would not have Lady Glenmire think we were quite ignorant of the etiquettes of high life in Cranford . SMITH , MISS And will you just step in here , dear Miss Pole , as you come back , please , and tell me what you decide ? Whatever you and Mrs. Forester fix upon will be quite right , I 'm sure . ( EXIT Miss Pole , r . ) " Lady Arley , " " Sir Peter . " p. 31 SMITH , MISS Who is Lady Glenmire ? SMITH , MISS Oh , she 's the widow of Mr. Jamieson  --  that 's Mrs. Jamieson 's late husband , you know  --  widow of his eldest brother . Mrs. Jamieson was a Miss Walker , daughter of Governor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they fix on that way of speaking , you must just let me practise on you . RE-ENTER Miss Pole , r . MISS POLE Well , to be sure ! We are not to call on Lady Glenmire . I met Mrs. Jamieson , and she told me . Yes , she wants to have her sister-in-law think she visits only county families . She took me so by surprise , I had nothing to say . I wish I had thought of something very sharp and sarcastic . I dare say I shall to-night . ( Sits down , C. ) And Lady Glenmire is but the widow of a Scotch baron , after all ! I went on to look at Mrs. Forester 's " Peerage " to see who this lady was that is to be kept under a glass case ; widow of a Scotch peer  --  never sat in the House of Lords  --  and as poor as Job , I dare say ; and she  --  fifth daughter of some Mr. Campbell or other . You are the daughter of a rector , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Sir Peter might have been Viscount Arley every one says . And I went and ordered a cap this morning , to be quite ready . Mrs. Jamieson shall see if it is so easy to get me to make fourth at pool when she has none of her fine Scotch relations with her ! Too good to be looked at , I suppose . p. 32 SMITH , MISS Martha saw her yesterday . Here she comes , and she will tell you how my lady looks . ENTER Martha , r . MARTHA Well , ma'am , is it the little lady with Mrs. Jamieson you mean ? I thought you would like more to know how young Mrs. Jones was dressed , her being a bride  --  MISS POLE Good gracious me ! As if we cared about a Mrs. Jones  --  the baker 's bride ! MARTHA The little lady with Mrs. Jamieson had on , ma'am , rather an old black silk , and a shepherd 's plaid cloak , ma'am , and very bright black eyes she had , ma'am , and a pleasant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but yet I should guess younger than Mrs. Jamieson herself . She looked up and down like a bird , and nipped up her petticoats when she came out , as quick and sharp as ever I see . I 'll tell you what , ma'am , she 's more like Mrs. Deacon at the " Coach and Horses " nor any one else . SMITH , MISS Hush , Martha ! That 's not respectful . MARTHA Is n't it , ma'am ? I beg pardon , I 'm sure ; but Jem Hearn said so as well . He said she was just such a sharp , stirring sort of a body  --  MISS POLE Lady ! MARTHA Lady  --  as Mrs. Deacon . CURTAIN . @x A Lapse of Ten Days . Miss Jenkyns 's parlor , as in the first scene . Miss Matty is DISCOVERED , seated L. Miss Smith sits R. SMITH , MISS I wonder if Lady Glenmire has found the past ten days lively at Mrs. Jamieson 's ? JENKYNS , MISS I had almost forgotten she was in town . The first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second I hardly remembered that there was such a person . ENTER Martha , r. , with a sealed note . MARTHA A note for Miss Jenkyns , ma'am . ( Hands note , and EXIT . ) SMITH , MISS ( opens and reads it ) . An invitation from Mrs. Jamieson to take tea with her next Tuesday  --  a small party . I think we will have a previous engagement at home . ENTER Miss Pole , r. , with an open note . MISS POLE So ! Ah , I see you have got your note too . Better late than never . I could have told my Lady Glenmire she would be glad enough of our society before a fortnight was over . p. 34 SMITH , MISS Yes , we 're asked for Tuesday evening . And perhaps you would just kindly bring your work across and drink tea with us that night . It is my usual regular time for looking over the last week 's bills and notes and letters , and making candle-lighters of them . But that does not seem quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home , though I meant to make it do . Now , if you would come , my conscience would be quite at ease , and luckily the note is not written yet ! MISS POLE Do n't you mean to go then ? SMITH , MISS Oh , no ! You do n't either , I suppose ? MISS POLE I do n't know . Yes , I think I do . You see , one would not like Mrs. Jamieson to think that anything she could do or say was of consequence enough to give offence ; it would be a kind of letting down of ourselves , that I , for one , should not like . It would be too flattering to Mrs. Jamieson if we allowed her to suppose that what she had said affected us a week  --  nay , ten days  --  afterward . SMITH , MISS Well , I suppose it is wrong to be hurt and annoyed so long about anything ; and perhaps , after all , she did not mean to vex us . But I must say I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did about our not calling . I really do n't think I shall go . p. 35 MISS POLE Oh , come ! Miss Matty , you must go . You know our friend , Mrs. Jamieson , does not enter into the little delicacies of feeling you possess in a remarkable degree . SMITH , MISS I thought you possessed them , too , that day Mrs. Jamieson asked you not to call . MISS POLE I think we ought to be ready to forget and forgive . SMITH , MISS I have nothing to forgive  --  but  --  MISS POLE But you are not willing to forget . Now , I think it is your duty as the daughter of the late rector to buy a new cap and go to the party . SMITH , MISS I think I must have a new cap . I have heard that turbans are the fashion . I know I am too old to care for dress , but yellow is my favorite color . MISS POLE And what shall we talk about ? SMITH , MISS Sugar has risen  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But are you sure the Peerage eat preserves ? SMITH , MISS Or know how they are made ? MISS POLE I shall ask her ladyship if she has been at court lately . p. 36 SMITH , MISS Capital ! I believe Lady Glenmire lives in Edinboro ' . MISS POLE I had an uncle who once passed a night there . SMITH , MISS That is very pleasant . SMITH , MISS Oh , we shall get on finely ! CURTAIN . @x A Lapse of Seven Days . Miss Jenkyns 's parlor , as before . Miss Matty and Miss Smith are DISCOVERED , both seated , R. JENKYNS , MISS I think Lady Glenmire is very nice , do n't you ? SMITH , MISS Yes , indeed . SMITH , MISS And we passed a very pleasant evening . SMITH , MISS Yes , but I came home pretty hungry . What thin bread and butter , and what weak tea ! And Carlo had all the cream and left us the milk . ( A noise is heard off R. ) SMITH , MISS Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not twelve yet . I must change my cap . ( They hurry L. as fast as Miss Matty 's rheumatism will allow . ) ENTER Miss Pole , hurriedly , R. MISS POLE ( R. ) . Do n't go  --  I ca n't wait  --  it is not twelve , I know  --  but never mind your dress  --  I must speak to you . What do you think , Miss Matty ? What do you think ? Lady Glenmire is to marry  --  is to be married , I mean  --  Lady Glenmire  --  Mr. Hoggins  --  Mr. Hoggins is going to marry Lady Glenmire ! p. 38 JENKYNS , MISS Marry ! Marry ! Madness ! MISS POLE Marry ! I said " marry ! " as you do ! And I said also , " What a fool my lady is going to make of herself ! " I could have said , " Madness , " but I controlled myself , for it was in a public shop that I heard of it . Where feminine delicacy is gone to I do n't know ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ashamed to know that our marriage was spoken of in a grocer 's shop , in the hearing of shopmen ! ( Miss Matty , Miss Smith , and Miss Pole seat themselves R. ) SMITH , MISS But perhaps we are doing her an injustice . MISS POLE No . I have taken care to ascertain that . I went straight to Mrs. Fitz-Adam to borrow a cookery book which I knew she had , and I introduced my congratulations propos of the difficulty gentlemen must have in housekeeping . And Mrs. Fitz-Adam bridled up , and said she believed it was true , though how and where I could have heard it she did not know She said her brother and Lady Glenmire had come to an at last . " Understanding ! " Such a coarse word ! will have to come down to many a want of refinement . I have reason to believe Mr. Hoggins sups on bread and cheese and beer every night . p. 39 SMITH , MISS Marry ! Well , I never thought of it . Two people that we know going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ POLE So near that my heart stopped beating when I heard of it , while you might have counted twelve . SMITH , MISS One does not know whose turn may come next . Here in Cranford poor Lady Glenmire might have thought herself safe . MISS POLE Bah ! Do n't you remember poor dear Captain Brown 's song , " Tibbie Fowler , " and the lines  --  " Set her on the Tintock Tap , The wind will blaw a man till her " ? SMITH , MISS That was because " Tibbie Fowler " was rich , I think . MISS POLE Well ! There is a kind of attraction about Lady Glenmire that I , for one , should be ashamed to have . SMITH , MISS But how can she have fancied Mr. Hoggins ? I am not surprised that Mr. Hoggins should like her . SMITH , MISS Oh , I do n't know . Mr. Hoggins is rich , and very pleasant-looking , and very good-tempered and kind-hearted . MISS POLE She has married for an establishment , that 's it . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SMITH , MISS What will Mrs. Jamieson say ? SMITH , MISS When will it take place ? MISS POLE Where ? SMITH , MISS How much a year has he ? SMITH , MISS Will she drop her title ? SMITH , MISS How can we teach the servants to announce a married couple as Lady Glenmire and Mr. Hoggins ? SMITH , MISS Will they be visited ? SMITH , MISS Will Mrs. Jamieson let us ? SMITH , MISS I like Lady Glenmire the best . She is bright and sociable and agreeable , and Mrs. Jamieson is  --  SMITH , MISS Hush , dear . ENTER Mrs. Forester , r . MISS POLE ( rises ) . What do you think , Mrs. Forester ? What think ? Lady Glenmire is to marry . Lady Glenmire  --   --  Mr. Hoggins  --  Lady Glenmire  --  What do you think ? FORESTER , MRS . Horrible ! Such conduct brings stains upon the aristocracy . I feel for my Order . ( Sinks into chair , R. ) p. 41 MISS POLE The idea of his daring to ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's son of them wishes to be considered Samson and Solomon rolled into one  --  too strong ever to be beaten or discomfited  --  too wise ever to be outwitted  --  too fascinating ever to be resisted . ( Seats herself , R. ) FORESTER , MRS . They are very incomprehensible , certainly . MISS POLE My father was a man , and I know the sex pretty well . SMITH , MISS I do n't mean to deny that men are troublesome in a house . I do n't judge from my own experience , for my father was neatness itself , and wiped his shoes on coming in as carefully as any woman . But still , a man has a sort of knowledge of what should be done in difficulties , so that it is very pleasant to have one at hand ready to lean upon . Now , Lady Glenmire , instead of being tossed about and wondering where she is to settle , will be certain of a home among pleasant and kind people , such as our good Miss Pole and Mrs. Forester . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my acquaintance being married . It gives me a shock . I ca n't think what may happen next . A moment 's silence . The ladies , in a group down R. , fall into a dream . The strains of the Wedding March are heard . An effective finale can be made by a procession of Brides , thus : The rear flat is raised or drawn off , disclosing behind it a drop curtain , which extends across the stage , somewhat in front of the rear wall . The Brides enter from the R. , pass across the stage slowly and sufficiently far apart to allow full sweep for their trains , and disappear L. They then return , behind the rear curtain , to the R. entrance and re-enter in turn , thus giving the appearance of a long procession . If a calcium light is used , lower all front lights and throw calcium upon the procession ; otherwise keep all lights up . MUSIC  --  CURTAIN . ( END OF PLAY )            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
