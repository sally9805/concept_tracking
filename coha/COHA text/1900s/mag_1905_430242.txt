 |p616  A Ruffling Gallant CERVANTES , noble by blood , was born poor . An infancy at Alcala de Henares , boyhood at Valladolid , youth at Madrid ; from such early years he emerges into the half lights of biography in the two worlds of arms and letters . He was certainly the poet of his school , for his master praised and printed the verse of his " dear and beloved pupil " ; and why should we not believe he was that same Miguel de Cervantes , page at court , who , for ruffling there in an affair of gallantry , was condemned to ten years exile and to have his right hand cut off , and escaped to hiding ? ' T is as easy as deerstealing . But , whether as a cavalier in flight , or as a protege more peacefully picked up , Cervantes left Madrid at twenty-one . in the train of the Papal Ambassador , Monsignor Acquaviva , a fortunate Italian youth two years his senior , and a patron of art and letters , and , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " A Crusade ! " There , in a city which was still the world 's high capital , the young Spanish provincial half-poet , half-gallant ? came into touch  |p617  with life in the large . He learned Italian , then the master tongue of literature : in the palace he mingled with the most cultivated society of the world , and heard much highbred discussion ; he came to recognize that something barbarous and belated which foreign nations found in the literature of his own land . Cervantes had a soul capable of great enthusiasms . At Rome , in 1570 , a great cause was in the air . I t was one of the oldest of great causes . " A Crusade ! A Crusade ! " was the cry . The Turks were storming Cyprus ; they threatened Venice ; they filled the African coast ; they held the sea . Was the Mediterranean to be a Turkish lake ? I t appealed to Cervantes because it was a Christian cause , and he was " of the old Christian blood " that for centuries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Turks were heirs . It appealed to him because it belonged to the glory of Spain , with her vice-royalties strewn in Italy and on the Islands , to crush the Infidel . And it appealed to him because he was young . Don John of Austria , whose figure stood out in Southern Catholic chivalry with a brilliancy of knighthood not unlike Sidney 's in the Puritan North , in its power to awake the imagination of the generous and the jealousies of the cold and mean , was the leader of the cause . Cervantes ' choice was a foregone conclusion . If by the spirit he was a writer , by the flesh he was a soldier . In that adventurous age , a Spaniard , though a genius . was born for roving and for arms . When his young patron , Acquaviva , following the pleasant Italian way , put.on the Cardinal 's hat at twenty-four , Cervantes left the antechamber and enlisted in the Spanish ranks . Fighting the Turk at Sea A year later , the sun of Lepanto breaking , October 7 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fever , lay below on the galleon " Marquesas . " At noon , the fight being on , he pleaded his duty against the remonstrances of his comrades , came on deck , and was stationed by the long boat in command of twelve men . At night , the fight over , he lay there with two gunshot wounds in the breast , and his left hand shattered . It was a fruitless victory , men say to-day ; then it was the greatest sea-fight of the world . To Cervantes it remained his " one crowded hour of glorious life . " Five years he was in these wars , in barracks and on campaigns . He served at Navarino , Corfu . Tunis , Sardinia , Sicily , and in Italy ? one fair , last year at Naples . Don John himself and the Sicilian Viceroy bore testimony to his good conduct . He sailed for home , was captured , taken to Algiers , and fell to the spoils of a Greek renegade as a Christian slave . Five years more he was in these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hassan , for five hundred ducats , an interesting fact , the price of a world-genius as a slave not often being quoted . A Slave in Africa His character now shone conspicuous . Two things marked him out among thousands . He was first in the eyes of the captives to plan , to encourage , and to undertake . He was the central plotter of daring escapes for himself and his comrades , by twos and threes , and by scores , by land and by sea . He even dreamed of a general rising , and a Spanish rescue of all the sufferers . Hassan said , " Could he preserve himself against the maimed Spaniard , he would hold safe his Christians , his ships , and his city . " He was first , also , in the respect of his masters . Repeatedly detected , he refused to abandon his attempts ; often threatened and with the noose about his neck , in the full peril of such atrocities as he frequently saw inflicted , with unbroken constancy he shielded others and took all danger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A certain readiness of jesting speech ? helped , perhaps , like Lamb 's , by his stammer ? seems to have served him at such times . His security , nevertheless , is inexplicable . A wilder tale than this of his captivity one does not read in books of reality . He was already 6n board ship for transport to Constantinople , when the long efforts of his good mother , together with the aid of a subscription in Algiers among the merchants by the hands of a Redemptionist Father , bought his freedom . So the decamping court page of twenty came back to Spain at thirtythree , a crippled soldier and a ransomed slave . Office , Prison , and a Wife He became a king 's officer , a commissary to collect stores for naval adventures , like that great one of the Armada , and a taxgatherer . He got embarrassed with courts and officers , a trusted agent defaulted , and he was more than once in prison . He had married a wife , Dona Catalina , not a fortune ,  |p618  but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ besides some vineyards , " two linen sheets , one good blanket and one worn , tables , chairs , a brazier , a grater , several sacred images , one cock , and forty-five pullets . " His house was the general refuge of the women of the family ; there , in 1605 , were living his wife , his natural daughter , two sisters , and a niece ; the women took in needlework , and Cervantes himself by that time had become , apparently , a general business agent , and made out papers for customers who called on him . Lance Never Blunted Pen The jail , the tax-collectorship , the longsuffering poverty , are they not the familiar marks of that other profession , the career of letters ? " Pen never blunted lance , nor lance the pen , " he said ; one failing , he took the other . Strong by nature , he cared for success , and with good sense he sought it in the beaten track . He obeyed occasions , he followed the fashion and the market , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artificial sentiment , and he wrote a shepherd book , like Sidney 's Arcadia , a tangle of intrigue , rhetoric , and love-plaining verse . It was the age of the rising drama , and he tried the play , staging realistic scenes from his life in Algiers . It was the age of the European short story , and he tried the tale , creating that variety of it which springs from direct observation of manners . Twenty years of such labors , a range from the thinnest whimsies of fashionable , courtly fancy to the hard realism of the thieves ' market , and he had not yet succeeded ; but his mind comprised the theater of life , and he was trained in all the modes of literary art . Don Quixote , when it appeared in his fifty-eighth year , was the book of a wise old man . Its popular success did not bring him friends or money . Ten years later the second part was issued . The grave old man , on the verge of seventy , was near his end ; a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chestnut hair , a Roman nose , vivid complexion , and " the silvery beard that twenty years ago was golden " ? so he describes himself . Though he mingled much with men all his life , he appears in the retrospect singularly solitary . Not bred in the university , he had never been accepted by those of the schools ; he had led an independent career , frank of speech , careless of enmity , aloof from every clique , acquainted with the strength and weakness of all , soberly judging even his young rival , Lope de Vega , the darling of the age . No one who saw him moving , with the stooped shoulders and the slow gait , thought how future ages would have prized some living portrait of that face , nor guessed that this stammerer was the world-voice of Spain ; none of the religious brotherhood he joined to secure his funeral rites , as they followed him " with his face uncovered , " a little , unnoticed company , knew that the greatest Spaniard was there consigned to an obscure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreknown the nature of his fame . He did not perceive the relative importance of Don Quixote among his works . Not recognizing that he had broken out the modern path , he went back to the old ways . He again sought the honors of a poet in his Journey to Parnassus . He fell in with the opinion of his friends , that his Persiles and Sigismunda would reach " the extreme of possible goodness , " and be " the best composed in our language , of books of entertainment . " He died , still projecting a sequel to his first pastoral romance , Galatea . He was in no haste to take up and finish the second part of Don Quixote . Literature was , in those days , by the standard of taste and in tradition , a thing of refinement , elevation , style , in matter noble , in manner conventional ; and the conscious ambition of Cervantes clung to this dying classicism for true reputation . Don Quixote Born Behind Prison Bars Don Quixote was never planned to be a great book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps a by-thought of his mind , as a parody of the romances of chivalry . Cervantes was apt to have a purpose in his writings . In his realistic plays he meant to bring home to men 's bosoms that cause of the freeing of Algiers , which was his only practical dream in life and lingered long ; in his novels he professed that they were exemplary or moral tales , and in Don Quixote he declared that his only aim was to destroy the popular chivalric romance which he looked on as a false and harmful mode of fiction . In his first sketch he found it , perhaps , vulgar in matter and barren in topic , too slight a theme to bear his genius ; he tried to heighten it by introducing independent tales , either wholly foreign or loosely connected , and episodes of gallantry more  |p619  closely , yet carelessly , interwoven with the main plot . The book grew under his hand , and almost changed its nature in the second part , where there is nothing extraneous ; it displayed a depth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power of any genius for creation or reflection , and gathered to itself with infinite variety , the universal significance of life . Though Cervantes grew conscious of its intimacy with his own spirit , it is only on the last page that he declares the identity of the work with himself . He had gradually put into it , substantially , all he was ? all he had seen , all he knew ? without being aware of what he had done till it was done ; and , like Columbus , he was never fully aware of what he had done . Don Quixote announced a new age . A Great Book Greatens with Time Cervantes was not in advance of his age . A great book greatens with time ; and the seed-vessels which it contains time rifles , and scatters its germinal forces throughout the world , and ripens them in the bosom of a broad humanity ; but the vitality of these belongs to the human spirit , and is a thing apart from the individuality of the original author . Men have found in Cervantes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and state , a modern pessimist ? all the vexed brood of restless spirits of the latter days . He was none of these . He was a man of his country and age , and accepted the world as it was about him . He observed its elements , its operation , its method ? summed the general result of life ; but he had no thought of changing what was . The idea of change , the revolutionary id a , was out of his ken . Cervantes was part and parcel of the present , whole with his time , a loyal subject , a true Catholic . He approved of the expulsion of the Moors . He had a liberal outlook on the foreign world , shown especially by his fair words for England , Spain 's foe ; and at home he saw the political and even the ecclesiastical organization as human institutions , subject to defect in persons , means , and all their temporalities ; if divinely instituted , they were humanly constituted . He was concerned with life in other phases . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principal gifts , shown not only in minor literary notices that stud the way , but in the large in those discourses which richly interweave the narrative or arise out of the dialogue which turns eloquently to monologue under the flame of thought ; and in the creative parts he was a critic of life . He was a great critic of life , just because he had no ulterior aim either reformatory or humanitarian . Not the practical modification of life , not life in the prospect , but its imaginative contemplation , life in the retrospect , was his sphere . It is an old man 's book . To him life was externally a spectacle , and in himself a function ; as a function it had been a gradually disillusioning enthusiasm ; as a spectacle it had become an increasing irony , An enthusiastic youth is apt to be followed by an ironical old age . In the South , especially , young passion begot these pleasant ironies of later years , and the Mediterranean literature , except in the greatest , is well divided between young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attains to greatness . Its chance " engendering in a prison " is , in itself , ironical ; its destiny to enthrall the world is the very fatalism of the grotesque in life . A madman and a fool , a horse and an ass , seeking adventures in a world as it is , go faring forth on the great , empty Spanish plains : what mortal interest can there be in their doings or their fate ? The Broad World of Spain Don Quixote is the book of Spain . Its theater is the Spanish land . It is a book of the open air and the broad world . It has for landscape the burning plains , the desolate , romantic mountains , the strip of blue by the coast ; its outlook is along the Mediterranean world by the highway of the islands that Cervantes had traveled in youth , whence men came back with tales of seafight and captivity ; on the long , northern edge lay Protestantism like a high mountain range , and its over-sea horizons stretched away to Peru and the Indies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the center of the world , and this Spain was filled with its own folk . The race-mark of " the old Christian blood , " of dark-skinned Moor and gipsy was stamped on them . They came forth in all their variety of life ? hidalgo , bourgeois , picaresque , ducal , provincial , intellectual , young and old , good and bad , soldier , student and priest , inn-keepers , criminals , players , peasants , lovers , highwaymen , barbers , carriers , judges , officials , doctors , menagerie-men , damsels , duennas ? an endless list . Scarce any book has so many people in it . This mass is put in constant  |p620  movement which gives unwearied liveliness to the scene . It is a book of life on the road . All the world is en voyage . The galley slaves are there ; even the dead are going a journey . The delineation of manners is on the national scale . Only the high dignitaries of church and state are exempt from the general conscription . The Court and the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how small a part exalted officials have in constituting the character of a people . The Spanish folk is represented in its racial life without them , and the portrayal is nationally complete . Cervantes deals with this multitude easily , taking them individually and a few at a time . It is a book of short flights , of incidents lightly dovetailed , of scenes strung together , of combinations rapidly formed and dissolved . The characters are seized like Holbein 's in the Dance of Death , only here the dramatic moments are as various as the manifold situations of the living range of human affairs ; the pictures and groupings are , nevertheless , on a similar limited scale , momentary and shifting , and each person is characterized with his own habit of life , caught in his own world , and shown completely in a few strokes . How many such small scenes crowd to the memory ? The muleteer trolling the snatch of Roncesvalles in the dark morning of El Toboso ; the student singing on his way to the wars ; the puppetshow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disasters of the night at the inn ; innumerable vivid sketches . Thus , the book is , by its surface , representative of all Spain , of the look of the land , the figures of the people , the daily event and business of life . Cervantes Coined the Genius of His Race But all this is only the environment of the action and the means of its operation in the tale . Cervantes knew a more admirable way of setting forth the soul of Spain . It is not merely because Don Quixote and Sancho are always on the scene that they surpass the other characters in power of interest ; they have a higher life . Observation and invention are sufficient to account for the others ; but this immortal pair are the children of the imagination . Cervantes stamped the genius of the race by a double die , on the loftier and the humbler side ; noble and peasant , the mad hidalgo and the deluded boor , divide between them the spiritual realm of Spain . The illusion of the one , the duping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect them . Character is deeper than circumstance , and owns a superiority over all the world of appearances . If Don Quixote is , at first , interesting for what happens to him , as is the way of life , he becomes of interest for what he is ; and the same , though in an inferior degree , is true of Sancho . Don Quixote achieves his ideal in his soul , however badly he fares with fortune in the outer world . He is complete in true knighthood , and when his madness leaves him , it can not take away the nobility of nature which it has brought the poor gentleman whom it found nameless and unoccupied on his little estate , and made one of the world 's heroes . . The vocabulary of moral praise can not exhaust his virtues . He is brave , resolute , courteous , wise , kind , gentle , patient ; and , not to continue the enumeration , he possesses these traits with a distinctive Spanish excellence . What tenacity there is in his resolution ; what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resignation ; what endurance in a land of lost causes ; what sadness of defeat accepted in the quiet of adversity . If these are not the most obvious , they are , perhaps , the deepest Spanish traits in the noble natures of that birth and soil . In Sancho ? faithful , affectionate , dubious ? nationality has lower relief , since he shares more simply the universal peasant nature of the South , but he is as abundantly Spanish in his peasanthood as Don Quixote in his sublimated chivalry . Both were fooled to the top of their bent ; but destiny did not mistake her way ; by comedy she perfected them , each in his own kind . It does not matter what happens to the battered body of Don Quixote , any more than to his crazy armor ; in him the soul 's the thing , and Cervantes keeps his soul invulnerable and undishonored . The dignity of the virtue of the great qualities of the Spanish ideal is preserved as well as set forth , and is seconded by the humbler virtue of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cast ideal types of itself more summary , exemplary , and real . Spain , the Quixote of Nations Later ages have seen in Don Quixote a typifying power even more profound , and far beyond the reach of Cervantes to know , as no one can know the deeps of his own personality . Don Quixote was a man of  |p621  the past , bringing outworn arms against a changed world . Spain is a backward nation , ill-furnished for modern times . Other lands have persisted in seeing in Spain the Don Quixote of nations , whose life was a dream of past glory , whose thoughts and appliances were antiquated , whose career in the modern world must be foredoomed . So they saw her set forth lately , in full tilt in the lists against the best equipped , the most modern , the youngest of the nations of the earth . But what unconscious penetration , what depth of truth , there were in that man 's genius , whose embodiment of the Spanish ideal has become the synonym of his country 's fate ! Cervantes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nations , but not altogether as a foreigner . I t is a European book . Cervantes , besides what the genius of his race and country gave him , received a gift from destiny . He embodied a great moment of time , the passing-hour of the old European ideal . I t was a living ideal , that of chivalry . It was sprung from real conditions , and greatly ruled the minds and somewhat the lives of men through a long era . It belonged to a world of social disorder , the thinly populated , scarce reclaimed wilderness of feudal Europe ; it belonged , too , to a world of marvel , where the unknown , even in geography , was a large constituent element , and magic , superstition , and devildom were so rife as to be almost parts of the human mind ; but such as it found the world , there this ideal moved with power . The military spirit never took form more nobly than in this chivalric type . It combined and reconciled two of the greatest motive powers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force of self-assertive personality . The perfect knight would die for his faith , his loyalty , and his love , but he died in battle . The reality of this ideal is shown by the depth , the richness , and the long continuance of its appeal to the bosoms of men . The idea of rescue , generated from medieval misery and helplessness in an environment of brutal physical force , is its ethical core ; but its efflorescence in the imagination of men was as many-colored as a sun . Beginning in the British waste marshes and the Frankish Court , it annexed the farthest Orient to the forests , deserts , and seas of its adventures ; it re-made the genealogies of history and drew all the great , emperors and saints alike , into the lines of its parentage ; it absorbed into its own tradition all past heroic excellence . It developed a ceremonial ritual ; it gathered to itself the mighty power of symbolism in its most august and passionate forms ; it gave forth a great legendary literature , one of the richest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ European tongue , and splendid with the deeds of every soil . In the fullness of time , Arthur and Roland receding , it was Amadis who was the star of chivalry . Amadis ' tale , though now out of the way , was once the book of Europe . It had a spell to hold the finest spirits , like Sidney , and appealed to them directly and intimately as the mirror of their hearts and hopes . It contained the European mood of knighthood in its last beauty , before its near eclipse and sudden dimming . Cervantes loved and honored it , and its hero was Don Quixote 's ideal man , as he had been of thousands of the dying cult . The Romance of Chivalry Smiled Away Such was the nature of the literature which Cervantes " smiled away . " For that had happened to the burning faith of chivalry , which is the fate of all the gods ; at first men are overawed by them and worship , then they lift equal eyes to them and find them companions of life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men at chivalry had already filled the world from the lips of Italy before Cervantes came . In his day chivalry was dead and buried . The madness of Don Quixote was but its ghost , wandering in the staring daylight of a new age , forlorn , ridiculous , without place or use in the world . It is this death of the chivalric ideal that strikes the tragic note . Whether Cervantes was himself conscious of this note of tragedy in his work must remain forever obscure ; if he was aware of it , he very successfully concealed his knowledge . He began with pure , comic intention , and made fun of the chivalric tradition , and very rough fun it was , nor did it grow less rough . His treatment of the knight is not free from coarseness , and is unremitting in cruelty ; here are the standards of the practical joker and the buffoonstage ; but it may be usefully remembered that Cervantes ' scale of cruelty in life was one familiar with the ways of the Turk , and the pains of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its conception and unflinching conduct , Don Quixote gave out  |p622  the note of tragedy only in our own latter days . In this respect it is a myth of the modern mind , which has taken on new meanings and disclosed fresh phases of significance with time , as is the way of myths ; with this Cervantes has nothing to do . As he did not see in his hero the incarnation of his country 's fate , neither did he see in him the last and greatest of knight-errants . He did not look with our eyes , and it is only through the perspective of centuries that we recognize the historic moment , and discern the famous knight , a great-hearted gentleman , standing in his travesty at the grave of chivalry . The Large Results of Time The unconscious element , or what seems such , in the works of the highest genius , is their most immortal part . There is a mystical union of the race with these great works ; they are humanized as much by the adoption of mankind as by their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them ; they blend with it and become impersonal ; in the large results of time ? in mythologies , in the legend of chivalry , in the masterpieces of culture ? they become racial products , unindebted to individuals . It is thus that Don Quixote is enfranchised from being the book of a country , or of a historic moment merely , and becomes a great book of the modern spirit . It rises with the vigor of world-life in it , and bears the supreme title of a book of humanity . It contains the experience , the thought , the doubt of man . This comedy is found to be the tragedy of all idealism . If this is not the aspect under which it has most widely spread as a book of popular amusement , it is thus that it has most profoundly affected the mind of modern times . Mephistopheles and Don Quixote are the two great myths that the modern world has generated out of itself , as characteristic as Achilles in Homeric time , or Roland in the Middle Ages , or Amadis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consciousness , types created in its own image , planets cast from its own orb . The modern world is psychological , and this book contains a psychology , seemingly , as elementary and comprehensive as a law of nature ; it is skeptical , and this book utters , as no other does , the double entendre of life ; it is pessimistic , and this book makes the most destructive impeachment of life . Doubtless , one goes far from Cervantes in such thoughts ; but if he did not fathom , we may well believe that he felt the deeper meanings of his book , for even in the eyes of the comedian it is a book of much sadness . The double nature of life is put to the fore . There is an opposition in human nature , and this is set forth by the contrast of Don Quixote and Sancho . It is rendered in them by divers ways as the antithesis of the imagination with the senses , of the life of thought with the life of fact , of illusion with reality , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poetry with the prose of life ; but essentially , this polarity is in the double aspect of life as soul and sense . Cervantes decides for neither ; he presents both as liable to error . He portrays Don Quixote with the characteristic defect of the soul , imaginative illusion ; and he gives to Sancho the characteristic defect of the material man , self-interest . The higher nature betrayed by its own nobility , the lower duped by its own baseness ? that is the two-edged sword of life . That is the human comedy . It is in the madness of Don Quixote that the heart of the book beats . It is a very singular madness . The invention manifested in the narrative is generally thought to be its prime literary trait ; but its verisimilitude , the skill with which it keeps the quaking edge of truth and fiction , is as marvelous ; and nowhere more than in Don Quixote 's madness are the shades made subtle . It is a very normal madness . Don Quixote does not differ much from other men in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the actual world by his past experience ; only , as he has lived in the world of books a life of imagination , his experience is unreal ; his memory is inapplicable to the world about him , or , as is said , his inferences are all wrong . His illusions have an origin from without , and are misinterpretations of the external world , due to an expectancy in his own mind which has arisen from his absorbed reading of romances . His senses are overlaid with thought , and he sees what he expects to see . It is impossible , too , to acquit him of a certain complicity with his own madness . He shows it when he refrains from testing his second helmet ; in the fact that he was not fully persuaded he was a knight-errant till the Duke treated him as such ; and unmistakably in his tale of what happened in the cave of Montesinos , where Sancho frankly charges him with making it up ; at the end ,  |p623  too , his recovery seems , in part at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also , has a method in it ; in the first part he is his own victim ; in the second he is the victim of others ; beginning with self-deception , he ends as the butt of the deception of all from Sancho to the Duke and the Bachelor . His madness is intermittent ; if his mind is , in fact , diseased , it is by a capability of going mad under certain exciting causes , but on all other occasions he is as remarkable for judgment as for learning and eloquence . Madness of the Soul This strange madness of Don Quixote is comic in its accidents , in its circumstantial defeat , in its earthly environment ; but in itself it is tragic . Its seat is in the very excellency of the soul ; its illusions take body in the noblest human aims , the most heroic nature and virtue of the purest strain . A madman has no character ; but it is the character of Don Quixote that , at last , draws the knight out of all his degradations , and makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dismay begins in the thought that here is not the abnormality of an individual , but the madness of the soul in its own nature . That high aims may be ridiculous ; that heroism may be folly ; that virtue may be insanity ; that the ideal , which was the spiritual wealth of the fathers , may be the farce of the children ; that the soul in its exaltation , its gentleness , and sacrifice , has no necessary wisdom , and in its own vision no warrant of reality ; that the good cast down , - the kind trampled on , the brave broken become the laughter of the world ; these are the truths which make Don Quixote such sorry reading for the idealist . Don Quixote , so far as the knight of the Rueful Feature is concerned , would , indeed , be a pitiful farce to modern feeling , were not his madness typical of the partial sanity of mankind : Still , as in old time , a man finds what he goes out to seek ; a man sees his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victim of past greatness . These are capital truths . Imaginative illusion , the soul 's vice , is common in life , and affects most the best of men , and especially those of great emotional capacity ; and since emotional imagination is the principal feeder of the religious and moral energies of men , this illusion most characterizes men of ideal temper , possessed with the ideas of rescue , sacrifice , and battle , and arises most frequently in the field of the reform of the world . A man of one or few ideas does not differ from Don Quixote psychologically , except in degree . Whether his experience is bookish or real , he confines his attention to a specially selected and usually narrow theme , neglects the correctives that life furnishes , and becomes absorbed in a mastering preconception of life ; he is infatuated . Often he exhibits a like complicity with his own partial madness , suppresses irreconcilable facts , and refuses to think in their direction . Often , too , he passes on from the stage of self-deception , in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victim of others practising on him , whom they profess to take at his own estimate , for gain , convenience , or amusement . The parallel is easily followed out , and the fact is recognized in the word Quixotic , which has become a familiar term in all languages . Cervantes ' Victory Don Quixote is a book of one great defeat , but also of many victories , and especially those of prose , realism , and humor in modern literature . Of all the victories which it embodies , however , the greatest is that of Cervantes over himself . The unfailing cheerfulness of its spirit is the temperament of Cervantes playing through it . He had lived and toiled , he had felt the full passion of life , he had dreamed , and planned , and striven , both as man and writer , in arms and letters , and he had met , for the most part , only the blows of fortune ; wounds and slavery , neglect and poverty , the well-known wages of genius , had been paid him in full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows him unspoiled and still companionable , pleasant , patient . It was in this spirit that , being about to die , he bade farewell to all . Scott , at the end of his days , with Wordsworth and others about him in the library at Abbotsford , asked Lockhart to read the scene . Allan , the painter , " remembered nothing he ever saw with such sad pleasure as the attitude of Scott and Wordsworth as the story went on . " " Good by , humors ; good by , pleasant fancies ; good by , merry friends , for I perceive I am dying , in the wish to see you happy in the other life . " These were Cervantes ' last words in this world . The most profound master of the irony of life preserved his heart uncorroded by that knowledge , as he had kept it sweet against the enmity of man and fortune .
