Even the suspension for a day of the Presidential order , discharging without honor three companies of the Twenty-fifth Infantry , is a welcome sign that the general public disapproval of the President 's arbitrary act is having its effect , at least on Secretary Taft The War Department has been flooded with letters and telegrams of protest , resolutions and appeals have been pouring in from churches , religious societies , and mass-meetings , and hardly one newspaper in the North has affirmed that the punishment of the innocent with the is just or regular Fortunately , there is still ground for hope that the President 's order may ultimately be revoked If the new facts he asks for can be laid before him , his love of fair play will induce him to do justice where he was by inadvertence about to do injustice If some of the men who are about to be discharged without honor were absent on furlough at the time of the Brownsville riot , the President will certainly not insist upon their being punished Some one may also call the President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a murderer in 1891 As we have already pointed out , Col. Compton was at once tried and Punished , though the officers of the Twenty-fifth Infantry have not yet been held accountable for the misdeeds of their men Moreover , a soldier of the Fourth Cavalry who offered to betray his fellows was promptly punished for advising and abetting the lynching , and permitting the carbines to be taken from their racks Even aside from these details , President Roosevelt will find military men unanimous in their belief that his procedure was incorrect from the technical point of view The Army and Navy Journal feels that the President 's procedure " savors too much of Oriental methods , " and declares that Mr Roosevelt violated the army regulations These specifically state that every soldier who is discharged without honor has the right to have his case considered by a board of officers before his commanding officer can give him such a discharge Secretary Root 's speech at Kansas City Monday night was conceived in the high spirit of his addresses in South America It is pleasant to find him laying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon Argontinos and Brazilians This shows that he was not simply trying to butter tlleir pat snips with fine words From even the meagre reports of his remarks before the Kansas City Commei mai Club , it is clear th at he stood for good morals in diplomacy , which he said were as obligatory in that sphere as in private life Between nations , he declared , the same rules of conduct should be followed as between individuals He called this " the new diplomacy . " Yet the contrast is not merely with the old , but with many ingenious dressings of the old in new and deceptive phrases There is " the larger good , " for example , of which we have heard so much in recent years as an excuse for overriding the rights of the weak by the strong .

What new reason is there in this latest disgrace , which h as resulted in his separation from his wife ? His reputation , of a sort to make his reception in a decent home impossible , has been perfectly known for twenty-five years , but what difference has that made ? He has had the highest honors of his party in this State He has been deferentially consulted by Governors and Senators and the President . He has been received at the White House , not only officially , but socially , So what is all the row about ? From Platt 's point of view , the whole thing is clearly unintelligible . He is not at all conscious now of being more unfit to be Senator from New York than he has been all these years Why this sudden squeamishness on the part of his faithful Republican supporters ? Not even his dear pastor r ow comes forward to defend him as before . We admit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Platt 's own mens conscia ? ceti The feelings of the State really come in , absurd as that may seem to Platt It is even necessary to consider the honor of the Republican party . Surprising as it may appear , there are people who assert that his continuing in office is a shocking example to youth , and a standing source of public demoralization Even newspapers that have in the past grovelled before him , or slobbered him , are now demanding that he quit the scene Taking these things into the account , and disregarding Platt 's natural wonder that anything he has done has changed public opinionion about him , we think that the first act of the Legislature should be the passage of a joint resolution calling upon him to deliver the people of New Yolk from the ignominy of having him as Senator A comparison of the power of the labor vote in the Congressional elections , with that of the tariff revis.onists , is much in favor of the latter Three prominent standpatters were defeated , the best-known being McCleary of Minnesota , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a plurality of 1,500 for his Democratic opponent after a campaign in which the tariff was almost the only subject discussed . Lacey or Iowa , one of the readiest protectionist debaters in the House , and a stanch Shaw partisan , was beaten by about 2,200 votes in a district which gave him 0,373 plurality in 1904 , and even this year was carried by Cummins for Governor In Indiana , a plurality of 8,185 in 1904 for Frederick Landis , a high-tariff orator , became a plurality of 1,000 for his opponent . Several Republicans of the Ways and Means Committee had a rough road to travel Chairman Payne and John Dalzell had their 1904 pluralities more than cut in half , while Watson of Indiana and Curtis of Kansas managed to retain their seats by bare pluralities On the other hand , two Democratic members ? Champ Clark of Missouri and Granger of Rhode Island ? more than doubled their pluralities of two years ago In Massachusetts , Samuel W.

Lilley , Representative-at-large from Connecticut , against whom one of the bitterest labor fights was waged , was reelected by a plurality less than that of two years ago , but greater by about 8,000 than that of 1902 In Maryland , Mudd , though losing largely in the Baltimore city districts , obtained a plurality considerably larger than that of 1904 . Representative Gardner in New Jersey , another of Gompers 's dearest foes , was elected by over 9,000 , a plurality nearly up to that of 1902 .

Hearst 's sworn election expenses of more than $256,000 , not only break all records , but outrage all propriety While Hearst was shouting that the other side intended to purchase the election , he was throwing in his quarter of a million with the coolness of a hardened gambler , betting on what he thought was a sure thing The poor man 's champion , with a corruption fund of hundreds of thousands in his right hand , is a novel and repulsive and ominous figure But this publication , portentous as it is to reflecting citizens , may simply make the politician breed lick their chops Let 's get him to run again ' For the love of Heaven , have him nominated for something else ' In all seriousness , such huge and growing payments by candidates for office in this country are an evil that we shall soon have to deal with We shall have to take a leaf out of the English Corrupt Practices Act , and limit by statute the amount that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned $30,000 as his campaign expenses , two years ago , we all gasped a little But this year a successful candidate merely for the State Senate has sworn to more than $31,000 . In Massachusetts , Mr Draper has laid out some $50,000 to be made Lieutenant-Governor . And now comes the loud dumping of Hearst 's barrel Where is this to stop ' If the offices are really to be auctioned off , a thrifty people will surely set bigger plutocrats than Hearst to bidding The indictment of Mayor Schmitz of San Francisco and of " Abe " Ruef , his boss , for blackmailing disorderly resorts , is a sign of hope Not in the whole depressing history of our municipal misgovernment has there been a more flagrant alliance between the authorities and the forces of evil The system , of course , pleased the corrupt railroads and corporations , the merchants who profit by illegal favors , and all the elements that make money out of a " wide-open town " A year ago the decent citizens of San Francisco made an effort to rescue the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawyer of integrity and courage He came within a few thousand votes of winning , but the dissolute , the criminals , the grafters , the labor unions , and those affiliated with corrupt corporations were successful in retaining Schmitz , or rather Ruef , in power The former was originally elected Mayor as the representative of union labor A defender of organized labor as a political force must be speechless in view of its San Francisco record . It has owned the city and the judges Gonapers himself declared three years ago that " every non-union man in San Francisco must get out , " and the threat was nearly fulfilled When a ship-owners ' association asked for protection for non-union workmen , Schmitz told them that he would not allow " his police " to protect a lot of stri ke-breakers , and he did not . When the great fire was over , the labor-leaders stated in a proclamation that no union would be allowed to raise wages , and that non-union men would be allowed to work . This was hardly published before non-union men were driven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to-day in which wages have not been raised from 20 to 30 per cent Labor agitators have long dwelt on the halcyon days certain when everybody would be un ionized . Well , the plan has been tried in San Francisco , and the whole world can read the re-suit In the face of a great calamity the city 's hands are tied , its name is besmirched Union control has meant simply license to rob The decision that the Rev. Algernon S Crapsey is a heretic is now confirmed by the highest tribunal of the Episcopal Church He wished to test the sense of the Church , to ascertain how much it would tolerate in latitude of doctrine He has discovered that the Church can not contain a man who repudiates the dogma of the Virgin Birth Whatever clergymen of the more advanced school may think , the controlling powers hold that this tenet is one of the fundamental verities We do not , we confess , see how the Court of ReIrew could reach any other conclusion Until some body , such as a general convi-ntion , entitled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Virgin Birth is a non-essential , the Court was bound construe the words of the creed according to their obvious acceptation , the meaning which they have carried for centuries If Dr Crapsey holds that Christ was the son of human parents , his place is in some organization which admits that view Furthermore , he should not be made the sole martyr in this cause If he is driven from his parish , all brother-clergymen who think with him are logically and morally bound to abide by the sentence passed upon him If they really are spiritual leaders they must speak out and take the consequences with hnn , rather than stultify themselves by silence . The easy w ay is to smother conviction and say nothing , but the clergyman who allows Dr Crapsey to suffer while he himself , guilty of the same offence , escapes , knows in his soul that he is unfit not only for the ministry , but for association with honest men The election of four architects to be Associates of the National Academy of Design is a step we are glad to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discreetly unsaid , about modern architecture , it is unquestionably the ground on which art and great wealth most nearly meet The architect is the natural intermediary between the wealthy individual or corporation and the painter or sculptor . The four men just promoted to academic honors have all in varying capacities been ambassadors to capital for mural-painting and sculpture . In the present chaotic state of American civilization , such mediation has been most necessary and useful It should be said also that , as compared with other artists , the architects have been socially minded , and have perhaps done more for the education of taste than any other single class In fairness , we must add that American architecture has suffered terribly from commercialization . The secluded position of the other arts has been , if unwholesome , a safeguard also There are some who feel that a fine landscape by Homer Martin outweighs in aesthetic importance all the building of the decade , but such comparisons are unprofitable , and the Academy certainly does well to acknowledge the courtesy it has so long enjoyed at the hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man who could explode a bomb in the first church of Christendom is difficult to analyze , but some sort of consuming hatred is the chief motive of the crime  --  a hatred that embraces both the past and the present .

He is willing to blow any of us up pro tem , - pore , in order that posterity may be freed from the shackles of Church , state , and all organized institutions . Such a state of mind clearly borders on the insane , but it would be an indignity to the most unfortunate class of humanity to identify the anarchists with them . We have to do , rather , with a monstrous depravity , in which the emotions are subdued to some persistent fallacy of the mind , or rather merged In the single emotion of hatred .

The Berlin Conference on Wireless Telegraphy which recently adjourned , reached conclusions that will be of great value in the development of this new method of communication The convention , which was signed by Great Britain , Germany , the United States , Argentina , Austria-Hungary , Belgium , Brazil , Bulgaria , Chili , Denmark , Spain , France , Greece , Italy , Japan , Mexico , Morocco , Norway , the Netherlands , Persia , Portugal , Rumania , Russia , Sweden , Turkey , and Uruguay , contains , as its most important provision , an agreement that the signatory Powers will make arrangements for wireless communication between their coast stations and vessels of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Portugal , Italy , Japan , and three minor Powers , reserved the right to exempt certain stations , but in return bound themselves to provide " open " stations The United States and Germany led fifteen other Powers in expressly renouncing the right to close any of their coast stations to passing ships  --  a broad and liberal policy , which will go far towards ending any narrow rivalry between companies and systems From the first , the United States insisted upon the obligation of general communication and transmission not only between ships and land , but between all ships If Great Britain had endorsed the proposal , the success of the American delegates would probably have been complete The English representatives argued that the obligation was too onerous to be imposed upon general shipping , which includes private yachts In the licenses which will be issued by the Pritish Government to ships with wireless outfits , this requirement will not be inserted , but probably her ships will readily receive and transmit wireless messages , as hitherto they have never failed to answer signals of distress or requests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effort to reserve certain exclusive rights for the Marconi companies Fortunately , the technical and commercial experts maintained that the opening of the Marconi stations to other messages was , in the long run , far better for the Marconi interests And as these arguments coincided with still broader international and humanitarian views , the battle against monopoly was won Writing of Moscow as he found it , a correspondent of the New York Outlook said Except for the strikes , business is nowhere seriously disturbed , and men buy and sell , " eat , drink , and are merry , " as usual The big pleasure resorts  --  the Aquarium and the Ermitage  --  were full to overflowing each evening , and I have never seen the people gayer or more given over to pleas-ure This failure to appreciate the momentous nature of the issues now being worked out in Russia is not unexampled Russia to-day can show atrocities surpassing the traditional iniquities of the Inquisition martyrdoms ( like that of the girl students of Cronstadt descending into the very Inpanars to gain the ignorant sailors for the revolutionary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excess , superhuman ferocity , and almost superhuman devotion Perhaps the daily sensation of the newspaper has destroyed the sense of proportion , and with it the sense orwonder .

War is war , and revolution is revolution , but hunger and clothes and the desire for social intercourse are also facts , and though the Russian student be quite ready to offer his life for his cause , he can see no reason why he should also sacrifice his glass Of tea or his cigarette To the younger of us , to whom the Civil War is the name for a great national agony , it will never cease to be somewhat of a puzzle to read of the gayety that marked the " flush times " of the war ; to think that Edwin Booth was giving the first of his productions of " Hamlet , " and that Longfellow was putting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Inn " in the year of Gettysburg That a great contemporary movement should now and then be tainted with sordidness , that a living hero should be occasionally a bit of a blackguard , and a saint of our own days something of a simpleton , does not surprise us , but the past is different , and wears a halo We may repeat the name Mukden a half-dozen times , and remain comparatively cold But Waterloo , we are sure , must have been fought while the world attended with bated breath That is partly true But it is also true that of Waterloo a great author wrote with fine insight All the country and Europe was in arms and the greatest event of history pending and honest Peggy O'Dowd , whom it concerned as well as another , went on prattling about Ballinafad and the horses in the stables at Glenmalony , and the cla .. 1 chunk theie , and Jos Sedley interposed about curry and rice at Dumdum , and Amelia thought about her husband and how best she should show her love for him , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anniversary of the granting to Russia of the so-called Constitution was observed by some Russian newspapers by footing up for the year the roll of deaths by violence Incomplete the figures must be , since only a part of the facts found their way to the press , yet the total of 24,239 deaths in riots or at the hands of the executioner , is enough to make the world aghast No less than 22,721 persons are known to have perished in pogroms , riots , conflicts with the authorities , and punitive expeditions That this is not all of the bloody record appears from the fact that hunch eds , if not thousands , of the massacred Jews were never accounted for Official executions disposed of 1,518 lives , and thus proved beyond dispute how useless is capital punishment , when a - 44. hole nation is aroused Of the political agitators , 851 were given penal sentences , aggregating 7,138 years In the effort to control public opinion , 523 newspapers and reviews were suppresseu , and 647 editors prosecuted During the year , 31 provinces were wholly , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or war , etc ) To these figures the Strang adds that during the post twelve months there were 1,629 agrarian riots , while 183 secret printing offices and 150 depots of arms were discovered The depots contained thousands of rifles and revolvers , tons of powder and explosives , and several machine guns Bombs to the number of 244 were thrown at officials , while no less than 1,955 armed burglaries were reported . The English Secretary for War , Mr. Haldane , whose career in office is a close parallel to Secretary Root 's in our War Department , is not satisfied with the creation of a General Staff and a college to educate it . He is convinced that specialists in moving troops and furnishing supplies must also be produced What he wants is capable business perts ?

If so , the Continental armies are lagging in the rear ; with them supply officers hardly rank as officers at all Having no important oversea wars to fight , or to be ready for , they naturally are far less concerned than the English with the training of business officers .
