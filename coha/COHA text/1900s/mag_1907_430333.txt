 | A CERTAIN Brahman was descanting on the consideration due to animals , and affirming that he never destroyed one . " The law , " said he , " bids us to walk carefully and with our eyes down , so as not to step on the hum blest ant . " At this a scientist handed him a microscope . Looking through it , he saw a host of little animals on the fig he was about to eat , and in the water he was about to drink . He was astou ded and saddened . He was then told that he could keep the microscope for any use he might have for it . With a flash of joy the Brahman tightened his grip on the glass , hurled it crashing on a rock , and then departed with a light heart . At one easy stroke he had destroyed the truth and saved his superstition ! We have in our own civilization thousands who are mental brothers to this clever Brahman ? thousands who are determined to live in a rosy illusion about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and poverty that press so heavily upon the millions who do the hard work of the world . If by chance a well-wisher gives them a glimpse of the wrongs under the crust of our civilization , they cry , " alarmist ! " " pessimist ! " ? thinking to destroy the unwelcome truth by destroying the unwelcome truth-bringer . They try to blot out the sun by pulling down the blinds ! But even these comfortable moles will not deny the shame of the sweat-shop inferno . Long before Hannah made a coat for little Samuel , women sat in the home at garment-making . The sweated sewing In the tenement home to-day ? a family or more slaving in one room ? is only a belated following of this custom of the ages . But the leisurely sewing of the old times was far  | away from the nerve-racking work of our hurried age . The slow ways are gone . In unaired rooms , mothers and fathers sew by day and by night . And the children are called in from play to drive and drudge beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hand workers are matched against the power and swiftness and cunning of the modern machineequipped factory . Those in the home sweat-shop must work cheaper than those in the factory sweat-shops if they would drain work from the factory , which has already skinned the wage down to a miserable pittance . " Sweat-shop " is a word which the conscience of the nation must yet make obsolete , as it made obsolete its old compeer , slave-pen . A sweat-shop is a place where the worker is at the mercy of middlemen , where his life-blood is sweated out by the pressure of the profit-sucking contractors piled on top of him . A clothing-dealer , for instance , orders from a wholesaler one thousand suits of clothes of all sizes . A contractor takes the order and " subs " it out to smaller contractors , who in turn " sub " it out to the tenement workers . Each middleman demands his profit ; so the wage of the workers is cut very thin . The workers must press in their children to help . The older ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones must slave in the sweated homes . Thus the load falls upon the ones least able to hear it ? upon the backs of the little children at the base of the labor pyramid . But why should we complain ? Is our system not based on profit ? The oppressors of labor are concerned in making money , not in making men . Why should they hesitate to mix the marrow of children into their minted gold ? Nevertheless , let their ill-got money be marked money . Let us strike from their unholy dollars the figure of Liberty , and stamp thereon the cross-bones and the skull ! The great unskilled masses of New York , and of every large city ? foreigners ignorant of the language and customs of the country , as well as our own ineffectual and unskilled legions ? all these hungry and shivering toilers , claiming the right to live , are forced into poorly paid tasks , tasks that can be easily learned and that too often demand only the demoralizing slop-work that marks cheap labor . The clothing-trade , with its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team " work , offers the easiest opportunity to the untrained fingers of the needy . The regular factory gives out its coat in nineteen stints , its shirt in seven . What can not be done by machinery , what is too ill-paid for even the regular factory , is thrust out to the home factory . Thus it is that unbelievable sweating is carried on in the pitiful places called " homes , " where the needy are crowded into the sties and warrens of our cities , some of the proudest cities yet ushered into history . Thus it is that this trade of preparing clothing for the body is the most degraded and the most unguarded of all our industries . Use and beauty ? these should be the ends of all human effort . But the competitive struggle swings us away from this high ground , and plunges us into a quagmire fight for cheap goods and cheap labor . So everywhere there is effort to whittle down the wage . The contractor , or middleman , pushed on by a superior behind him , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as cheaply as possible . " Much for little " is his golden text . He will avoid the expense of factory space , factory overseers , and factory machinery ; also the expense of light , fuel , and storage . By shoving his work into the homes of the workers and making them assume these expenses , by forcing the workers to hid against one another in their workshop homes , by continual hounding for haste , and by ingenious dockings for tardiness , dirt-spots , loose stitches , and all the other petty mistakes of dreary , exacting needledom , the middleman squeezes out his sweated gains , his usury of flesh and blood . The workers find themselves forced into long hours and driven to take the help of their children whose roof and loaf are at stake . Is it any wonder that , under this exploitation of young and old , the garment-makers of the nation are the most beaten down of all our toiling millions ? In three hundred out of five hundred homes , women and children must work to eke out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this long working day . A child frequently earns only one cent an hour ; while the sweater figures so that a woman shall not earn more than ten cents . The average income of the whole family is five dollars and seventy cents a week . Sometimes in a rush order the elders can sleep only five hours of the  | twenty-four . An order must be finished on time and be back on time , though all other activities of the house should cease . The sewing-machine must whir , the fingers must fly . Little and big must toil , everhastening , never-resting , to get the work out and to get home more work to hold the job . For worse than all work is no work ; and the slack spells may fall on any day . Poverty walls the children from play and school . When the wolf whines at the door , all hands must hold the bar . Every finger can do a little . A child under three can help at sorting beads for embroidering slippers and purses , or at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ older can sew buttons on cards , or sew buttons ( twelve to a pair ) on the endless piles of trousers ( " pants " is the tenement name for them ) that are continually being sent out for finishing . Girls of ten or twelve can hem towels or make plain aprons . Older girls can make boys ' summer suits of reefers and trousers for which they get thirty-five cents a dozen . For a dozen kimonos they get sixty cents . A girl can run a sewing-machine all day for a number of years . She may imperil her health , and destroy her usefulness as a mother of children . But never mind : she can sit in a corner by and by and work eyelets in shirt-fronts at four cents a dozen shirts . A young boy , his bones yet in the gristle , may run a buttonhole machine , one foot only on the treadle . He is threatened with curvature of the spine , owing to constant pressure upon one side of his body . But never mind : there are hospitals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of these tired mothers said , " the graveyard always stands the friend of the poor . " The sweat-shop army works long hours , and does work necessary for the comfort of us all . We have seen how it is paid ; let us see how it is housed . In a true civilization , property would be based on service , and the workers would live in beautiful homes . @# Only idlers would live in hovels . But what happens to our useful needle-folk ? They are often driven into ramshackle buildings to be near neighbors to the rats in the sewers and the worms in the rotting wood . In these homes , discomfort is lord chamberlain , and disease the bed-fellow . The houses are ice-boxes in winter and ovens in summer . Every door is death 's door ; for the bacilli of consumption are a dust on the walls and ceilings . Three out of five of these doomed workers who are making our clothes are led down to death by the White Plague . Are there not other places with cleaner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweatshoppers must be near the work that gives them their short leave to be alive . The sewing-trade is highly specialized : it is spasmodic and shifting . Therefore the contract shops must be close together , and close to an enormous central market . The locality is thus conditioned by the trade . The tenements provide the accommodations that the scant , uncertain wage of the worker can command . He must be where he can pay the rent that is his terror ? the rent that the " cockroach " landlord ( the subletting landlord ) is forever raising as the slender fortunes of the needle-folk go up . Only those who know the hard grind can understand the dread of dispossession forever haunting the minds of the workers living on the crumbling verge of the abyss . Food and clothes they can minimize ; but the rent-taker , like death , must have his dole . These unlit , unlovely homes , which the sweated sewers struggle so hard to hold , have only an average of three rooms . Thousands of rooms in these tenements depend upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the light comes in must be the place of cooking , eating , and working ? perhaps also the place of sleeping , with mattresses spread out on the floor at night for boarders . For even these  | three rooms must often be shared with boarders to reduce the rent . The average rent is nine dollars a month . The average monthly income of the husband ( if husband there be ) is only fifteen dollars . So it takes over two weeks ' work to pay one month 's rent . As the average family is four or five , it needs no higher mathematics to see that every expense must be whittled , and every asset made to count , if even hunger is shut out . Long , lowering tenements are yielded up to our sweat-shop infernos . There are twenty-three thousand licensed " home factories " in New York city alone . There are perhaps as many more in the three hundred and sixty thousand dark rooms of our Babylon ? in the back stories of the " doubledecker " tenements , in the cellars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scented out . In one square mile of these tenements , six hundred thousand people are crowded , perhaps the most densely packed mound of human ants upon this planet . The Rev. Doctor Behrends found , in a block off Hester Street , a room twelve by eight and five and a half feet high , in which nine persons slept and cooked and worked . In another room , located in a basement , were living , working , and sleeping two men with their wives , a girl of fourteen , a boy of seventeen , two single men , two women , and four boys just entering their " teens . " Packed together in that cellar room were fourteen human beings . What delicacy or decency of life is possible in such dehumanizing homes ? It is in such mockeries of home that Drudgery wears its spiked crown . It is in such poverties that men drift beastward , women sink to haghood , and children wax old before they have tasted youth . All the year in New York and in other cities you may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nearly any hour on the East Side of New York city you can see them ? pallid boy or spindling girl ? their faces dulled , their backs bent under a heavy load of garments piled on head and shoulders , the muscles of the whole frame in a long strain . The boy always has bowlegs and walks with feet wide apart and wobbling . Here , obviously , is a hoe-man in the making . Once at home with the sewing , the little worker sits close to the inadequate window , struggling with the snarls of the thread , or shoving the needle through the unwieldy cloth . Even if by ' nappy chance the small worker goes to school , the sewing which he puts down at the last moment in the morning waits for his return . Never again should one complain of buttons hanging by a thread ; for tiny tortured fingers have doubtless done their little ineffectual best . And for this lifting of burdens , this giving of youth and strength , this sacrifice of all that should make childhood radiant , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to one dollar and a half a week . In the rush times of the year , preparing for the changes of seasons or for the great " white sales , " there are no idle fingers in the sweat-shops . A little child of " seven times one " can be very useful in threading needles , in cutting the loose threads at the ends of seams , and in pulling out bastings . To be sure , the sewer is docked for any thread left in , or for any stitch broken by the little bungling fingers . The light is not good , but baby eyes must " look sharp . " A dismal room lit by one window , a weary mother sewing , with piles of garments heaped on bed and floor ? this is the last scene that will stay in the memory of little Lena Meyers . One night , to help her mother , she was busily ripping bastings with a pair of big scissors , her face held close to her work . At a sudden jerk she rammed a scissor-blade into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say only , " Me was des helping mama . " Several experimenting young doctors , by the careless use of an astringent , put out the other eye . So Lena is blind for life for " des helping mama . " Down in this dim underworld , poverty lays hourly on the children squalors and hungers , and in freakish moments strikes them with the indignity of accident . In the faint light of grimy , vile-smelling rooms , pressing up to the window , or straining under the ghostly gas-jet , sit the tired mothers and children of the tenements , stitching garments for New York and for the nation . Contrast a December night in these homes that are never in order , and never have any leisure , with a winter night in a hundred homes you know , where mothers , born under happier stars , sit before cozy fires with their laughing little folk about them at games and songs and books . " Home and mother ! " These old syllables strike tender chords in the heart . Yet we have desert regions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but no home , no mother . " Home and mother ! " Our grim system forces hundreds of thousands to lose the meanings of these sweet old words . We are told that we must " maintain the home . " A soldierly phrase , a phrase of good command ! But let us first see to it that our homes are fit to be maintained . What sort of homes are we maintaining in the working quarters of our great cities ? What sort of homes are those where the utmost will to work can not insure roof and loaf ; where leisure and beauty are left out of life ; where the child must leave the cradle only to concern itself with earning niggardly pennies to keep its little empty life agoing ? There is a law in New York requiring , in every home factory , a printed license from the commissioner of labor , declaring the building and its labor conditions to be sanitary . Inspectors issue orders looking to cleanliness and safety , and the cloud would lift a little if these orders could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inadequate to keep track of an ever-shifting army of sweated workers in a great city . The first effect of the license ordinance was to raise rents . The dice are loaded against the worker ; so the poor sweat-shopper is forced , in the long run , to bear the expense of the renovation of the old rookeries . It all comes back to the landlord in raised rents . Need we wonder that the ill-starred workers are often flitting from cranny to cranny , from hiding to hiding , in a wild effort to evade the hated inspectors ? If by chance a " meddlesome " official insists upon light and air , and debars little children from work , it is easy to steal away to other holes and alleys , and be lost in the surging herds of the miserable . This is easier than to obey the intermittent " vagaries " of boards of health , of factory inspectors , and of truant officers , who do not seem to understand that the rent must be paid , whatever fate may be drawn down upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry for little girls in the grim tenements . The mother must be busy at her sewing ; or perhaps she is away from dark to dark at office cleaning . A little daughter , therefore , must assume the work and care of the family . She becomes the " little mother , " washing , scrubbing , cooking , caring for the other children ; carrying coal , ashes , water ; doing the errands and shopping for the young ones below her and the elders above . While other children are playing with dolls and mud pies , these " little mothers " are cooking , and tending baby . " My baby 's teething ; I had to walk with my baby all night , so's't mama could sleep , "  | said a heavy-eyed nine-year-old . " I had to walk , ' cause I 'd go to sleep myself if I stopped walking . " Another " little mother , " taken to the hospital , would not lie straight in her cot that first time in her life she had ever slept alone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm , " said she , " I do n't feel so lonesome ; ' cause then I can make believe it 's my baby . " Is it not a cruel civilization that allows little hearts and little shoulders to strain under these grown-up responsibilities , while in the same city a pet cur is jeweled and pampered and aired on a fine lady 's velvet lap on the beautiful boulevards ? Some of the children in the factories of our great cities , in spite of false certificates as to age , are " rounded up " by truant officers and forced into school until they reach their working-age at fourteen . But the little children of the home sweat-shop , hidden in dark tenements and huddled at their needles , may reach their majority without being run down . Mrs. Lilian Betts found in one tenement-house twentythree persons over eighteen years of age , born in this country , who had never attended school . In New York city alone , sixty thousand children are shut up in the home sweat-shops . This is a conservative estimate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Manhattan Island , south of Fourteenth Street and east of the Bowery . Many of this immense host will never sit on a school bench . Every garment worn by man , woman , or child , may be made in the home sweat-shop . Nine-tenths of the clothing emanating from New York city is made wholly or partly in these sorry places . Frequently these shops are radiating centers for disease germs . This gruesome fact does not concern New York alone ; for New York is the fountain of supply for the whole nation . The fountainhead of a river may contaminate the waters of every stream and cistern between the mountains and the sea . In England , in the early nineteenth century , a jet of poison spurted up out of a dingy Whitechapel sweat-shop into the splendid drawing-rooms of St. James . Heavenly Powers ! Here was something to astound a nation . Disease and poverty were nothing to our bewigged and gartered parliaments , so long as they stayed pent up in the corrals and warrens of the disinherited poor . But when disease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ palace floors , amazement stared , alarum sounded , England was on guard . What caused this cry at the gates , this rush to rescue ? The daughter of Sir Robert Peel was mysteriously stricken with typhus . The infection was traced to a stylish riding-habit ordered and fitted at a correct Regent Street shop , but finished in the tenement of a starving tailor with two children lying ill of fever . When their shivering spells were on , the destitute tailor had flung the heavy robe over his fever-stricken little ones . It was not the first time that the plague of the toiling poor invaded the sanctuary of the mighty . It was not the last time . Hundreds of our own epidemics , emptying our schools and desolating our homes , are due to the desperate conditions under which many of our workers are forced to do their work . And of the nearly two hundred million dollars ' worth of garments manufactured yearly in New York city , ninetenths goes to the wardrobes of our citizens , wholly or partly , by the weary and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for nineteen years a worker among the poor , has seen hundreds of little ones sick with some contagious disease , while on the infected beds were scores of little garments in preparation for he stores and homes of America . The " pants " of the tenements have many times been the pillows and coverlets of measles , scarlet fever , and diphtheria . The Rev. Mr. Swaffield of the Bethel Mission , in Boston , tells of finding two little scarlet fever patients bedded on piles of unfinished trousers . The coat of a hundred-dollar dress-suit being made for a fashionable Broadway firm , was recently discovered in a tenement , lying on the bed of a festering worker down with smallpox . It is to the comfort of opera-box and dinner party that they do not always know the genesis of their adornments . A well-known member of Sorosis , lately speaking to that club , told of visiting a sweat-shop home , where the father , hectic and wan with advanced tuberculosis , lay on a rickety bed adjoining the bed of a babe ill with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon two chairs . Spread over the feet of both patients was an expensive cloak of silk lined with squirrel-skin . From a fashionable shop on Broadway the mother had brought the garment to be lined ,  | and was now out for trimmings for the last touches . Here , poisoning this elegant wrap , were consumption , the most deadly of all diseases , and measles , the most infectious of all diseases . Perhaps in that Sorosis audience sat the woman who was wearing that very cloak , a woman who would on entering her own beautiful home reach out her arms to her own helpless babe , and in that glad embrace send into its little frame the seeds of disease , if not of death . Mr. Henry White , formerly general secretary of the United Garment Workers of America , testifies that high-priced garments , needing much hand work , are really in more danger of infection than garments of the cheaper sort . The manager of one of the best known clothing-houses in New York city says , " If people knew under what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the workers are forced to throw them about in dirty rooms , on beds and floors , they would not buy them nor wear them . " There is a contagious eve-disease ( pinkeye ) brought on , or fostered , in the sweatshop by absence of light and presence of filth . Are you sure , madam , that no germ of it has been left in the garments worn by your little ones ? left by the little sweat-shop fingers that must stop at times to rub sore and sleepy eyes , while sewing for you and me ? There is a certain disease of the scalp , foul-smelling and infectious . Little children scaling off this favus are frequently busy at garment-finishing . I hope , fastidious lady , that no unclean germ of it has reached your children by the perilous way of the sweat-shop palm and pillow . Frequently doctors are not called even in dangerous diseases ; so contagion is not reported . Cases are concealed , perhaps for lack of money ; perhaps for fear that the patient will be taken away to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the clannish tenement women , hearing the rumor that some neighbor has been quarantined by the board of health , will , with the ever-present " pants " under their arms , flock to the sick-room to condole with the family , keeping up their sewing and sighing around the infectious patient . No calamity must ever stop the bread-earning needles . Settlement workers tell me of a child , dead of diphtheria , that was kept three days in a closed room , while a stream of visitors , some bringing their sewing , passed in and out by day and night . An epidemic of diphtheria in a wealthy village a hundred miles from New York city was traced by chance to the " knee-pants " purchased from a traveling-agent selling the sweat-shop goods of New York . Misery scatters widely her seeds . They may take root in hovel or in mansion . Let us no longer shirk responsibility for our epidemics . They are not " the will of God " ; they are the will of man . But is nothing ever done to stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an infected sweat-shop , and confiscate a load of goods . Some firms steam their garments , attempting purification . Yet there are germs that will live through extreme heat ; and there are always homes that evade inspectors and health officers . But more terrible than all the other disasters of the sweated homes is the spiritual disaster that sweeps over the souls of the children . Joseph Barondess says : " I have seen six little girls plying bruised fingers on heavy clothing in a Doyers Street tenement shop , while on the floor beside them lay a half-dozen opium fiends indulging in the drug . " Indeed , poverty sends us hideous neighbors . Again , there is a class of women drifted down from that terrible host " whose feet take hold on hell , " a class that is forced at last into the cheap drudgery of the slopshops . These poor hulks of womanhood , diseased , dissipated , depraved ? these outcasts of the outcast , seeking bread , crowd into the crowded sewing-dens to sit and sew beside little innocent girls , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what spiritual contagion such creatures scatter on humankind ; but we are not too ignorant to know of the physical infections such rotted humanity leaves on all it touches . What is going to protect our homes , and deliver these little sewing-girls from the body of this death ? What , indeed , is going to deliver all the weary and heavy laden from their unjust burdens ? What will ever take the despair and danger out of the lives of the toiling millions ? Nothing but the rise of men and women , resolute and consecrated ? men and women sworn to sweep away this system of greed , this devouring of man by man . Love and Justice must find a working form down in this abyss of labor now ruled by Chaos and brute Chance .
