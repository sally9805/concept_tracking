txt This Country 's Obligations . Special to The New York Times . WASHINGTON , Dec. ** Gage , . does not consider it a matter of great mo- - - ment whether The London Times is right . or wrong in saying the United States is  --  still a debtor Nation in spite of the country 's enormous wealth and its great trade balances . Referring to the matter in an interview to-day the Secretary said : " The statement of The London Times may be true or false . No one knows and no one could say exactly and definitely that we are borrowing more than we 9Xe selling , and that we owe more than Is owad to us . " But it does n't matter a particle . I do n't care whether my creditor lives in New York or England or France , as long as I can afford to borrow money , invest it in American enterprises , pay interest , and gain a handsome profit . That Seems to me to represent , to a large degree , the financial condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money , pay interest and principal when due , sell our products to England , and realize a handsome profit , we should , I think , be perfectly satisfied with the situation . And that is. to a considerable de . gree , the situation in the United States . " But the balance of trade can hardly be against us , as The London Times says it really is . In the last four years , we have piled up a balance in our favor of *1,600 , - 000,000 . " Now we have , of course , spent . money abroad also . We paid freight charges on this enormous bulk of trade with England and Europe ; we have paid insurance and the expenses of tourists . But all these would not consume the half of the grand total of our balance of $1,600,000,000 . Say it eats up $800.000,000 of it . This still leaves us a big balance which has not been Paid back through the purchase of merchandise abroad . not in gold exports nor in any other way . The presumption bas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy- ing back American securities previously held in English and other foreign markets . " While one portion of our people haVe a large balance of trade coming to them , another , class is borrowing money abroad to carry on large business enterprises at home . We have tried to get up statistics that would show , by the importation and exportation of securities , the exact state of the interchange of trade , but it has not been found possible . " We are not an old country . Naturally , as long as we can use borrowed money with great profit to ourselves , we shall be doing good business by borrowing for our new enterprises . We do not put our wealth in securities because we can get better profits in using it in business . The more we borrow , therefore , the more money we are making , and the greater is our wealth and our prosperity . We are a debtor Nation in this sense . But our prosperity justifies abundantly the trade policy of the Nation .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
