txt Another abuse which has just come to , light in Bellevue Hospital is that small sums are extorted from the poor patients cutler penalty of being sent to the Island . Commissioner Keller says he has proof of this . There is to be no truce in the war declared by Commissioner John ? . Keller on the abuses at Bellevue Hospital . The Medical Board of the hospital yesterday answered the Commissioner 's letter relative to the alleged abuses in the hospital . Twentysix members of the board were present , in a closed session lasting two hours , and , besides formulating an answer to Commissioner Keller 's letter , discussed the charges that have been made . It was said that there was no friction whatever between Mr. Keller and the . hoard . A letter from Dr. Austin Flint to the President of the board was submitted at the meeting . It was in part a personal vindication of its author against some anonymous newspaper criticisms of his action in the Newport case in taking a fee on account of a patient in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the hospital . Dr. Flint explains that he had already once examined the patient before his commitment to Bellevue in consequence of having made a public disturbance ; that he visited him there . not in any oificial capacity , but at the request of Ills family , and to insane his prompt removal to a private asylum . which was effected , on the application of Dr. Flint and his associate to the court . The courtesy of allowing members of the the Medical Board to examine private patients in the hospital . Dr. Flint adds , he never heard questioned . except in connection with this case . He appends to his letter a copy of a plan tor the reorganization of the insane pavilion , which he drew up and submitted to the head of the department in January . 1898 . A letter from Dr. Allen Fitch in regard to the same matter was received by Dr. Charles L. Dana , President of the board , in which he says he , at Mrs. Newport 's request . examined her husband . Then Dr. Flint prepared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Newport 's removal to a private sanitarium. as Mrs. Newport desired . All the proceedings were hurried , at Mrs , . Newport 's urgent request . I own no stock in any private asylum , and have never accepted a commission for se nding cases to them , " writes Dr. Fitch . He had no knowledge that his name was to be used in Dr. Flint 's bill . Dr. Alexander Lambert , the Secretary of the board , delivered to Commissioner Keller in Ills room in the New Amsterdam Hotel the letter of the board . The Commissioner is still suffering from bronchitis . The reply informs the Commissioner that special committee of five has been appointed to take up the matter of the general conditions in the hospital and bring them to his notice officially , and then proceeds to answer Mr. Keller 's questions . MEDICAL BOARD 'S REPLY . The board says : " So far from the patient being injured by the bedside instruction of students in Bellevue Hospital , they are helped by it , and in the vast majority of cases the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shown in them , but rather the contrary . It is the experience of this institution and of all others that medical instruction given in connection with the hospital promotes the best interests of the patients and of the hospital . " " Cases in the hospital , " the board reports . " are to be treated , and examinations are to be made with the same gentleness and consideration as would be shown to patients in private practice . Clinical instruction is conducted by us humanely anti it has not seemed necessary that formal limits should be set with regard to the length of time that a patient is under examination . The great majority of patients are not placed on a table at all , but are seen in their own beds . " The Medical Board has nothing to do with the lee system in the Insane Pavilion , the Medical Examiners being paid city officers , not under the control or direction of the Medical Board in any way , and their functions are not those of the treatment and care of the patients . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alcoholic ward and pavilion for insane as govern the wards in the main hospital . It is considered proper and right for a nurse to administer hypodermic injections , but solely under the directions of the house or visiting physician ; it is a part of their training as nurses that they should be able to use a hypodermic syringe. but never except tinder medical directions . " The letter concludes : " We have , in the foregoing , replied to the questions you have asked us . We are ready to supplement these answers in any way you wish , and to co-operate with you in perfecting the service in any way . The records of the hospital will show that no institution is doing more effective medical and surgical work in the cause of tile sick poor than Bellevue Hospital . and the more completely this work is known , the more confident shall we be that the worth and merits of Bellevue Hospital will he recognized . " Commissioner Keller said last evening : " The reply of the Medical Board is a fair answer to all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Board says and I accept its statements . Its reply is not specific in regard to the use of the hypodermic syringes by the nurses . Of course , the reply can not be accepted as conclusive as to the complaints that have been made . Nor could it be reasonably expected to answer these complaints . That must be a matter for individual investigation . " The letter of the board says nothing as to the various charges that have been made with reference to the service in Bellevue . I presume . however , their Committee of Five will take that up with me . " But this will not end the investigation by any means . Those persons found to be responsible for the abuses discovered will be punished . The statement , however , that I have singled out a certain set of persons as being responsible and have decided to remove them is not correct . I knew of tile conditions at , Bellevue for some time before the Hilliard scandal . On Dec. 1 I appeared before the board and told the members that while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and as the responsible head of the department I was anxious to know whether there was anything to justify the charges made . " CAREFUL INVESTIGATION NEEDED . What reply did the hoard make : ? ? " There was an informal discussion , out of which the most tangible thing that resulted was the passage of a resolution to try to get the Board of Estimate to appropriate $300,000 tor a new administration building . The conditions as they have existed for years are the crystallization of the efforts of various administrations , and it is not easy fur a man to take this structure and to say that it is all wrong . " Radical changes can not be trade at one fell swoop without causing prejudice to the proper working of the hospital and the interests of the sick poor . " But I think a salutary lesson has been taught already . So far as the nurses are concerned , the investigation in pradtically closed . I have dismissed ten nurses and also the helpers in the alcoholic ward , and it is pretty well understood that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty or who ill-treats patients . " My chief attention now will be given to investigating a system of petty extortion which I believe exists at Bellevue . It has recently come to my knowledge , through clergymen and others , that the sick poor are often threatened with being sent to the island unless they give up so much money . It is hard to get people to tell about these things , but I have obtained information from some of the clergy , and I can not doubt that there has been extortion practiced at Bellevue . " When asked in regard to his probable action in the cases of Drs , Fitch , Wildman . and Moore . who testified at the Hilliard inquest . Mr. Keller said that he had 110t yet read the testimony , and he did not know just what admissions they had made . " If I were to put out Drs . Fitch and Wildman . who have been examiners ? n lunacy for years  --  and I will not put them out unless I am satisfied that they %Yes ? wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might get some doctors certified by the Civil Service Commission , and they might send some . sane people to the private asylums . You see that I can not act hastily and without due consideration of all that is involved . " THE CHARGES AGAINST NURSES . The Board of Managers of the Mills Training School for Nurses also met yesterday afternoon and empowered Dr. George B , Fowler to draw up a reply to the letter of Commissioner Keller asking for the co-operation of the board in remedying the abuses . The board informed Commissioner Keller that it with co-operate with him . as he requests , and that they are investigating all the charges and are doing everything in the premises to remedy abuses and increase the efficiency of the nurses . in the cases of the six accused nurses , Hamer , Wilson , McCracken , Newcombe , Fredericks , and Rafferty , the board says that in one instance they have discovered that these nurses have not complied with the rules and have treated the patients badly . and in view of these developments the board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by saying that the belief of the board is that the recent unfortunate occurrence was in part . at least , the result of the fact that an improper amount of authority is given to the pupil nurses in the wards and too great responsibility . and that too scanty supervision is exercised e er them . It wits announced yesterday that the State Board of Charities will take an active part in the reorganization of the Public Charities . The members , it is reported . will spend five days . beginning Jan. 10 , and ? devote their entire time to the subject .
