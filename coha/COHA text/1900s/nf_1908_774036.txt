txt // The manner in which the soluble food is absorbed may be explained in part on common physical grounds . When two solutions of different densities , containing diffusible compounds , are separated by a permeable membrane , diffusion through this membrane from the denser to the lighter liquid will always occur . Such a condition as this prevails in the intestines , we may believe . The intestinal solution , the denser one , is separated from a less concentrated liquid , the blood , which is constantly flowing on the other side of a thin dividing membrane . Under these conditions only one thing can occur ; viz. , the passage into the blood of certain parts of the digested food . It is held that in this way water , soluble mineral salts and sugar pass directly into the blood - vessels . The peptones are taken up by the capillaries and the fats enter the blood entirely through the lacteals . In the absorption of peptones , we encounter forces other than those which pertain to the mere diffusion of liquids , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mystery . As we have learned , the proteids are largely changed to peptones in the stomach and intestines , but , strange as it may seem , no peptone is found in the blood . At some point in its passage through the lining tissues of the digestive tract , it has been regenerated into forms more nearly like those from which it is derived . Moreover , the absorption of fats is regarded as being accomplished through the activity of certain cells or corpuscles , which appear to convey this portion of the food to the lacteals . It seems , then , that the vital forces residing in the living animal cells Undigested Residue ? . Why . Digestibility Varies .121 play a part in transferring the nutrients into the blood circulation , and that this absorption can no longer be explained wholly on physical grounds . FECES The soluble and insoluble portions of the intestinal contents become separated gradually , and the undissolved part arrives finally at the last stage of its journey along the alimentary canal and is expelled as the solid excre ment or feces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small proportion of other matter , such as residues from the bile and other digestive juices , mucus and more or less of the epithelial cells , which have become detached from the walls of the stomach and intestines . Very small quantities of fermentation products are present also , which give to the feces its offensive odor . The incidental or waste products may properly be con sidered as belonging to the wear and tear of digestion THE RELATION OF THE DIFFERENT FEEDING STUFF COMPOUNDS TO THE DIGESTIVE PROCESSES Numerous digestion experiments with a large variety of feeding stuffs have abundantly established the fact that these materials differ greatly in their solubility in the digestive juices . This is an important matter , and one which should be well understood , for we must con sider both the weight of a ration and its availability in determining its nutritive value . Variations in diges tibility are caused primarily by variations in composi122 The Feeding of Animals tion . The low digestibility of wheat straw , as compared with that of the wheat kernel , is due to the absence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We , therefore , must deal fundamentally with the susceptibility of the various single constituents of plants to the dissolving action of the several digestive ferments . In this connection , we need to pay little attention to the mineral compounds . They do not undergo fermentative changes in the way that the carbon compounds do , but pass into simple solution either in the water accompanying the food , or in the juices with which they come iu contact . As has been noted , protein is a mixture of nitrogenous compounds , largely albuminoids . The gluten of wheat contains at least five of these bodies , and other seeds as many . What is the relative susceptibility of these single proteids to ferment action either as to rapidity or completeness of change does not appear to be known . Some albuminoids are practically all digested by artificial methods , and probably are in natural digestion . It is a fact , however , that protein is much more completely dissolved from some feeding stuffs than from others . That of milk is all digestible , that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite a large proportion escapes solution . Whether this is due to a differing degree of solubility on the part of the characteristic protein compounds of these feeding stuffs is not quite determined . The fact that highly fibrous materials show the lowest proportion of digestible protein suggests as an explanation that the nitrogen compounds of the coarse fodders are so protected by the // large amount of fiber present that they escape the full action of the digestive juices . It is certain , anyway , that the protein of young and tender tissues and of the grains is more fully digested than that of the hays and straws . In the case of the carbohydrates , our knowledge of the relative susceptibility of the individual compounds to enzym action is more definite . First of all , the necessary modification of the sugars , which are already soluble , is slight , and they are wholly digested . In the second place , we have learned in two ways that the starches are wholly transformed to diffusible compounds , first by submitting them in an artificial way to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by discovering a complete absence of starch or its products in the feces of our domestic animals . In no case that has come under the writer 's notice has either starch or sugar been found in the solid excrement . We can say , therefore , that under normal conditions the starches , like the sugars , are completely digestible . Digestibility must be considered , however , from the standpoints both of rapidity and of completeness . As to the former factor , starches from unlike sources exhibit some remarkable differences . Investigations by Stone , who submitted a number of these bodies to the action of several diastatic ferments , show that " this variation reaches such a degree that under precisely the same conditions certain of the starches require eighty times as long as others for complete solution . " The potato starches appear to be acted upon much more rapidly than those from the cereal grains . // Other carbohydrates and related substances , such as the gums and cellulose , do not undergo complete digestion , sometimes half or more of these compounds escaping solution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fecal residues obtained from them in digestion experiments , found in the feeding stuffs from 6 to 16 per cent of gums , 46 to 77 per cent of which was digested , the average being 58 per cent . Crude fiber proves to be digestible within about the same limits , or 36 to 80 per cent with American fodders . We are much in the dark concerning the manner of digestion of the gums and crude fiber . To what extent these substances are the subjects of purely fermentative changes , or of merely chemical decompositions , is not known at present , but the fact of a partial digestion is well established whatever may be the causes involved . The extent of the digestion and absorption of the fats or oils is also not definitely known . If we were to accept the figures given for ether extract in tables of digestion coefficients as applying to the real fats we would believe that their digestibility varies from less than one-third to the total amount . It is unfortunately true that these coefficients mean but very little . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or oil , as we have seen , and the inaccuracy of a digestion trial is still further aggravated by the presence in the feces of bile residues and other bodies which are soluble in ether , so that the difference between the ether extract in the ration and that in the feces gives us little information as to what has happened to the actual fats . It seems very probable that pure vegetable // fats and oils are quite completely emulsified and absorbed . The foregoing statements make it plain that when the general composition of a feeding stuff is known it is possible to predict with a good degree of certainty whether its rate of digestibility is high or low . The larger the proportion of starch and sugar and the smaller the percentage of gums and fiber , the more complete will be the solution . We see this illustrated in the extreme by the difference in digestibility of corn meal and of wheat straw . NoTE. ? Compounds that have been digested and absorbed into the alimentary canal may he excreted in the feces . Bergman showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into sheep , the phosphoric acid was excreted in the dung . According to Mendel and Thacher , mineral compounds absorbed from the intestinal tract may afterwards appear in the feces . Recent observations appear to show that phytin , a phos phorus body , is absorbed , metabolized and its phosphorus subsequently excreted in the feces in inorganic combinations . CHAPTER IX CONDITIONS INFLUENCING DIGESTION THE chemical changes and other phenomena constituting digestion , which have been described as occurring in the alimentary canal , are practically outside the control of the one who feeds the animals . They proceed in accordance with fixed chemical and physiological laws . It is , however , within the power of the feeder to so manipulate the food or vary the conditions under which it is fed that the extent or completeness of digestion is modified , and this must be regarded as an important matter when we remember that only the digested food is useful . PALATABLENESS It is entirely reasonable to believe that a thorough relish for food is conducive to good digestion . The secretion of the digestive juices is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the nervous system . With man , at least , the enjoyment of eating , even its anticipation , stimulates the secretory power of the salivary glands and those in the mucus lining of the stomach , and it is evident that this holds true with animals . Palatableness is , therefore , an important factor in successful feeding , for it tends to promote a ( 126 ) // state of vigorous activity on the part of the digestive organs . The experienced feeder knows well the value of stimulating the appetite of his animals by means of attractive mixtures . An agreeable flavor or taste adds nothing to the energy or building capacity of a food , but it does tend to secure a thorough appropriation of the nutrients which enter the alimentary canal . With-out doubt , the success of one feeder as compared with the failure of another may sometimes be due , in part , to a superior manner of presenting a ration to the animal 's attention and to manipulations that add to the agreeableness of its flavors . INFLUENCE OF QUANTITY OF RATION @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and smaller rations of the same fodder to the same animals , have been made the authority for the state-ment that a full ration is as completely digested as a scanty one , provided the former does not pass the nor-mal capacity of the animal . It must be said , however , that the testimony concerning this point is not unani-mous . Since Wolff 's experiments , Weiske , in feeding oats to rabbits , found the digestibility to be inversely as the quantity of food taken . In experiments with oxen , by G. Kiihn , at Mockern , when the grain ra-tion was doubled the digestibility of the malt sprouts used was decreased about nine per cent . Results at the New York Experiment Station from feeding full and half rations to four sheep showed uniformly higher digestion coefficients with the smaller ration , the differ128 The Feeding of Animals ences being too large and too constant to be considered accidental . Other experiments give varying and conflicting figures . If we assume that the constituents of feeding stuffs have a certain fixed solubility in the digestive fluids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no effect upon the proportions of nutrients digested , but such an assumption can not safely be made . Doubtless no single statement concerning this point will be found applicable to all animals and all rations . Certainly , overfeeding may lessen the extent of solution and is never wise , while under-feeding for the sake of securing a maximum digestibility would not be good practice . It is reasonable to suppose , however , that the relation in quantity between the enzyms and the food compounds has an influence , at least , upon the rapidity of digestion ; and indeed investigations by Stone very strongly point to such a conclusion , for he found that the rate of ferment action was proportional to the concentration of the ferment solution . EFFECT OF DRYING FODDERS At one time the belief became very firmly fixed in the public mind that curing a fodder causes a material decrease in its digestibility . Because this drying is often carried on under conditions that admit of destructive fermentations or of a loss of the finer parts of the plant , this view is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accomplished promptly and in a way that precludes fermentation or loss of leaves it is // doubtful if curing has any material effect upon digesti bility . The point has been the object of six American di gestion experiments , Hungarian , timothy , pasture grass , corn fodder , crimson clover and winter vetch being the experimental foods . With four of these slight , but un important , differences were observed in favor of the dried material , while the reverse was decidedly true of the crimson clover and the corn fodder . German ex periments show in a majority of cases greater digesti bility for the green fodders . It seems probable that in general practice , because of greater or less unavoid able fermentation and a loss of the finer parts of the plant , dried fodders have a somewhat lower rate of digestibility than the original green material , a fact not due directly to drying , but to a decrease , either of the more soluble compounds or of the tender tissues . INFLUENCE OF THE CONDITIONS AND METHODS OF PRESERVING FODDERS In Jomparing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ digestibility , we may safely rest upon the general statement that when , for any cause , leaching occurs or fermentations set in , di gestibility is depressed . The explanation of this state ment is that those compounds of the plant which are entirely soluble in the digestive fluids , notably the sugars , are the ones wholly or partially removed or destroyed by leaching or fermentations , while the more insoluble bodies remain unaffected . When , therefore , hay is cured under adverse conditions , such as long-con130 The Feeding of Animals tinued rain , digestibility is decreased , and the same effect is inevitable from the changes which occur in a fermenting mass , such as a mow of wet hay , a pile of cornstalks or the contents of a silo . Experimental evidence of the truth of these statements is not wanting . German digestion trials with alfalfa and esparsette , green , carefully dried , cured in the ordinary way , fermented after partial drying and as silage , show a gradually decreasing digestibility from the first condition to the last . A single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as silage , gives testimony in the same direction . On the other hand , field-cured corn fodder , according to nine out of eleven American experiments , is considerably less digestible than silage coming from the same source . Here it is largely a question of the relative loss by fermentation in the two cases , and it is to be expected that the outcome would not be wholly one way . INFLUENCE OF THE STAGE OF GROWTH OF THE PLANT Another generalization , which certainly must hold good with reference to the digestibility of fodder plants , is that any conditions of development which favor a relatively large proportion of the more soluble carbo hydrates ; viz. , starches and sugars , and secure a minimum of gums and fiber , promote a high rate of digestibility , and reverse conditions produce the opposite result . It is well known that , in general , as the meadow grasses mature the relative proportion of fiber increases and the tissue becomes harder and more resisting . NuStage // merous American and European digestion trials unite in testifying almost unanimously to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age . The maturing of maize seems to produce quite the contrary effect . The testimony of experiments conducted at the Connecticut , . Maine and Pennsylvania Experiment Stations justifies the statement that the corn plant , cut when the ears are full grown , furnishes not only a larger amount of digestible material , but . a larger relative proportion than when cut before the ears have formed ; and this is strictly in harmony with our general principle ; for the mature plant , on account of the storage of starch in the kernels , has by far a larger proportion of the more digestible carbohydrates . INFLUENCE OF METHODS OF PREPARATION OF FOOD Much labor and expense have been expended by farmers in giving to feeding stuffs special treatment , such as wetting , steaming , cooking and fermenting , in order to secure a supposed increase in nutritive value , an increase which must come chiefly , if at all , from a more complete digestion . It is plainly noticeable that these methods of feeding have lost in prevalence rather than gained . Practice does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as digestibility is concerned , this outcome is in accordance with the results of scientific demonstration . The conclusions of German experimenters have been that these special treatments have no favorable influence , their effect being either imperceptible or unfavorable. // It should occasion no surprise that the mere wetting of a food is without influence upon its solubility in the digestive juices , because it becomes thoroughly moistened during mastication and in the stomach . It is not rational to expect that previous wetting would have the slightest effect unless it induced more complete mastication , which certainly would not be the case with ground grains . The extensive trials by Kuhn and others with a hay and bran ration , the bran being fed in several conditions , such as dry , wet , moistened some hours before feeding , treated with boiling water and fermented , gave results adverse to all of the special methods of preparation as either useless or harmful , and no testimony so thorough and convincing has been furnished on the other side . German and American experiments unite in condemning the cooking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depression of the digestibility of the protein , with no compensating advantages . Digestion trials with cooked or steamed hays , silage , lupine seed , cornmeal and wheat bran , and roasted cotton seed , uniformly show their protein to be notably less digestible than that in the original materials , a fact which may explain the lessened productive value of cooked grains which has been observed in certain experiments . It must be conceded , of course , that when cooking feeding stuffs by steaming or otherwise renders them more palatable , and thereby makes possible the consumption of material otherwise wasted , the influence upon digestibility is a minor consideration . // INFLUENCE OF GRINDING Few points are more frequently questioned than the profitableness of grinding grain . There seem to be only two ways in which such preparation can enhance the nutritive value of a feeding stuff ; viz. , by diminishing the energy needed for the digestive processes and by increasing the digestibility . While only about a half-dozen experiments bearing upon the digestion side of this question are on record , their evidence is quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corn and oats , grinding caused an increase of digestibility varying from 3.3 to 14 per cent . A single experiment with maize kernels gave a greater digestibility of about 7 per cent from grinding , and with wheat , in one trial , the increase was 10 per cent . In one test of oats with sheep , the unground kernels were as completely utilized as the ground . It is reasonable to expect that with ruminants the danger of imperfect mastication is less than with horses and swine , although whole kernels of grain are often seen in the feces of bovines . The profitableness of grinding grain turns , in part at least , upon the relation of the cost of grinding to the loss of nutritive material from not grinding . If the miller 's toll amounts to one-tenth the value of the grain the economy of grinding it may be doubtful , especially with ruminants . EFFECT OF COMMON SALT It is the custom of many feeders to allow their animals an unlimited supply of salt , and others furnish it // in definite and regular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an abundant consumption of salt is beneficial . If this is true , the advantage arises for other reasons than an increased digestibility . The verdict from earlier experiments by Grouven , Hofineister and Weiske that the addition of salt to the ration does not increase the digestibility has been confirmed by more recent tests by Wolff . Indeed , if we give to the data collected a literal and perfectly justifiable interpretation , salt diminished rather than raised the proportion of digestible nutrients . INFLUENCE OF FREQUENCY OF FEEDING AND WATERING ANLMALS Few experiments relative to this point are on record . One by Weiske and others , relative to frequency of feeding , and another by Gabriel and Weiske , in which the effects of the time of watering and of the amount of water were tested , give no indication that the completeness of digestion is materially affected by variations in these details of practice . It seems probable that the nutritive importance of these minor points in managing animals has been much overestimated by some , especially as affecting the utilization of the food . INFLUENCE OF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fodder crops grown on the same soil may vary somewhat from year to year according as the season is wet or dry , cold // or warm . Such variations may influence digestibility , though no actual demonstration of this fact appears to be on record . The question is often asked whether the storage of hay for a long period affects its nutritive value . The data from four series of experiments touching on this point indicate that there is a perceptible , though not marked , decrease in digestibility of hay during long-continued storage . INFLUENCE OF THE COMBINATION OF FOOD NUTRIENTS Among the apparently important and freely exploited conclusions drawn from investigations in animal nutrition is the statement that the digestibility of food is influenced to a marked degree by the relative proportions of the several classes of nutrients . It is taught that if more than a certain percentage of starch and sugar , or of feeding stuffs rich in carbohydrates , like potatoes or roots , is added to a basal ration , the digestibility of the latter is decreased , the protein and fiber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dietrich and Konig , on the basis of a critical study of the data involved are that if pure carbohydrates are used to the extent of more than 10 per cent of the dry substance of a basal ration , or if potatoes and roots are fed equivalent in dry matter to more than 15 per cent , a depression of digestibility occurs , which increases with the amount of carbohydrate material added . A modifying conclusion is , that if the addition of the carbohydrate material is accompanied by correspondingly more protein , the de136 The . Feeding of Animals pression of the digestion coefficients is much lessened or does not occur . Many data are cited in support of these generalizations which are worthy of careful consideration . It is not unreasonable to suppose that the relative quantity in a ration of the several classes of nutrients may have an influence upon the digestive processes , and we should accept the verdict of previous observations in so far as they will bear critical discussion and further investigation . It should be said in the first place , by way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cited has usually been fed in addition to a basal ration , thus increasing the amount of food consumed , and , as we have seen , this may have an influence upon the proportion of total dry matter digested . In this particular , the experiments have not been logical . In the second place , in these experiments , no allowance has been made for the metabolic nitrogen in the feces , i. e. , that not belonging to the true undigested residue . As this appears to be independent of the amount of protein fed and stands more nearly in relation to the total digested nutrients , it follows that the smaller the proportion of protein in the digested food , the larger the error caused by the waste nitrogen products . A careful study of this point in the light of more recent knowledge might modify the conclusion reached as to the depression of protein digestion through feeding starch or starchy foods . In all or nearly all the experiments where this effect is apparently shown the digestible dry matter of the ration Digestion ? Influence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or was diminished . The depression of the di-gestibility of the crude fiber is not easily explained on any other ground than that of the influence of the greater proportion of starch . What is claimed as the effect of a dispropor-tionate addition to the supply of carbohydrates does not appear to be true of a similar increase in the ration of fat and easily digested protein . Several ex-periments in which oils and albuminoids have been added freely to a basal ration did not indicate that such addition had any material effect upon digesti-bility . CONDITIONS PERTAINING TO THE ANIMAL : SPECIES , BREED , AGE , AND INDIVIDUALITY The conclusion reached by the early experimenters in the field of animal nutrition that the digestive efficiency of the several species of ruminants was prac-tically uniform , has not been set aside by more recent observations . The number of experiments upon which this conclusion was based was large , and their verdict is not likely to be reversed by observations less ex-tensive or less complete . The following coefficients were obtained from Ger-man trials with meadow hay : // Nine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large and small ruminants , steers being compared with sheep and cows with goats . In five cases , the large animal digested from 5 to 14 per cent the more , in three cases the excess for the small animal varied between 7 and 17 per cent , and in one case there was little difference . The general effect of such conflicting results is to confirm the older and more numerous observations . The horse and ruminants differ in digestive capacity to a marked extent . The comparisons which have been made show a uniformly lower digestive efficiency for coarse fodders on the part of the former . It appears that because of less perfect mastication , or for some other reason , the horse dissolves much less of the crude fiber than the steer or sheep , and the effect of this is prominent with hays and other fibrous materials . With the grains , ruminant and equine digestion is not greatly unlike , eight samples of oats with sheep and twenty-four with the horse showing almost identical digestion of the dry matter . With maize the ease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantage was slightly with the ruminant . So far as we are able to judge , swine digest concentrated food about as do ruminants and the horse . How this is in the case of the fodders we do not know fully , but it is proven that the swine digest crude fiber quite freely . Past experiments have not revealed any influence of breed upon digestive capacity . There is no reason for supposing that Shorthorn cattle , Southdown sheep and // Chester White pigs would digest rations differently from Jerseys , Merinoes and Yorkshires . Young animals seem to digest high quality coarse foods and grains as efficiently as older ones of the same species , which is probably contrary to the popular belief . There is doubtless a variation in the digestive power of individual animals , but the data so far collected do not show this with any degree of definiteness . In those in-stances where the same four or more steers or sheep have been used in determining the digestibility of sev eral feeding stuffs the highest coefficients were obtained sometimes with one animal and sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the undigested food the dry matter of the solid excrement , which is practically in accor dance with the fact , we have only to subtract this fecal residue from the dry matter of the ingested food in order to ascertain the amount and proportion digested . All digestion experiments have proceeded on this basis. * Animals have been fed at regular intervals a uniform quantity of carefully analyzed food and the feces have been collected , weighed and analyzed . From the data thus obtained , the digestion coefficients have been cal culated . The method and the mathematics of such experiments are so simple that correct results seem very easy to obtain and they do possess an accuracy suffi sufficiently approximate to truth to render them useful in practice . As digestion trials are usually conducted , the coefficients of digestibility obtained for the dry matter // and total organic matter represent , we have reason to believe , very nearly the actual digestible matter in the particular material studied . The proportions secured for particular classes of nutrients may be less accurate , for reasons that will appear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the digestibility of one hay applies to another produced and cured under totally different conditions . The truth of this latter statement is clearly seen in the effect of the various factors upon digestibility . The inaccuracies of digestion coefficients are chiefly in those for protein and fats . Let us see how and why this is . The errors in the figures for protein are caused by the presence in the feces of nitrogen compounds which are not a part of the undigested food protein . These are waste compounds which are residues from the bile and other digestive juices , epithelial cells and mucus which are carried along from the walls of the intestines during the passage of the food . Their quantity seems not to be proportional to the protein fed , but appears to be influenced more or less by the amount of food digested . Their source is the " wear and tear " of the digestive apparatus . It follows then that the less protein there is in a ration , the larger the percentage error caused by these metabolic products . In certain experiments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than that of the food , although without question much of the straw protein was digested . It has been found , using the best methods known for extracting these waste products , that they cause a much larger error for the protein of the straws than for that of the legume hays . It is probably safe to affirm that at least ten should // be added to the coefficients of digestibility of the protein of coarse fodders as usually given in the tables that have been compiled . Errors are caused in determination of the digestibility of fat in much the same way . Certain of the bile residues in the solid excrement are soluble in the ether which is used to extract the fats , and consequently the undigested fat appears to be larger than it really is . CHAPTER X THE DISTRIBUTION AND USE OF THE DIGESTED FOOD THE digested food , after absorption , all passes into the blood , either directly or indirectly , and mixes with it . The materials which are to serve the purposes of nutrition are now taken up by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutest divisions of every part of the animal . Flowing in regular channels the blood reaches not only the bones and muscular tissues , but it passes through several special organs and glands where the nutrients it is carrying and certain of its own constituents meet with profound changes . It is here that we discover the manner in which food is applied to use and what are some of the transformations which the proteids , carbohydrates and fats undergo in performing their functions . In order to follow intelligently this most interesting phase of nutrition , we must know something of the blood and of the organs ? the lungs , liver and kidneys ? through which it passes . THE BLOOD The blood , when in a fresh state , is apparently colored and opaque , but if a minute portion is ex-(142) // amined with a microscope , it is seen to be a comparatively clear liquid in which float numerous reddish , disk - like bodies . These bodies , which are known as corpuscles , give to the blood its bright red color . The liquid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The corpuscles are not mere masses of unformed matter , but they are minute bodies having a definite form and structure . They make up from 35 to 40 per cent of the blood , and contain over 30 per cent of dry matter . This dry matter consists mostly of hwmoglobin , a compound that is peculiar to the blood and equips it for one of its most important offices . Hmmoglobin , as before stated , is made up of a proteid ( globin ) and a coloring matter ( hamatin ) , in the latter of which is combined a definite proportion of iron . The peculiar property of this compound , which renders it so useful a constituent of the blood , is its power of taking up oxygen and holding it in a loose combination until it is needed for use . When thus charged , it is known as oxyhwmoglobin . Because of this function of their most prominent constituent , blood corpuscles become the carriers of oxygen to all parts of the body . There are reasons for believing that they are also chiefly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nutritive changes , viz. , carbon dioxide , and conveying it to the points where it may be thrown off from the body . The plasma is about nine-tenths water , so that it easily holds in solution whatever soluble nutrients are discharged into it from the alimentary canal . Among // its constituents are found members of all the classes of compounds that are important in this connection , ? ash , protein , carbohydrates and fats . The proportion of ash is about 1 per cent , three-fourths of it being common salt , and the remainder consisting of phosphoric acid , lime and other important mineral compounds . The solid matter of the plasma is rich in albuminoids , including the fibrinogen which is the mother substance of fibrin and several albumins and globulins . These proteids make up about 40 per cent of the total dry substance of plasma . Sugar and fats are also present , their proportions varying with the extent to which they are being absorbed from the digestion of food . It is evident that the blood is charged with those materials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the animal body . THE HEART In quantity , the blood is from 3 to 4 per cent of the total weight of the live animal . It is contained in the heart and in two sets of vessels , one set called the arteries leading from the heart by various ramifications to all parts of the body , and the other set called the veins , leading from all parts of the body back to the heart . Through these vessels the blood is moving in a constant stream , which we call the circulation . It does not move of itself , but is forced along by a very powerful pump , the heart . This is a highly muscular organ divided into four chambers , which are separated by valves and partitions , the two upper chambers beWork // ing called the right and left auricles , and the two lower the right and left ventricles . The right auricle is above the right ventricle and is separated from it by a valve , and the same is true of the left auricle and ventricle . Out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arteries and after reaching the arterial capillaries throughout the entire body , it passes from these into the smallest divisions of the veins and comes back to the heart along the venous system , entering the right auricle . It is then carried to the lungs by way of the right ventricle and is returned to the left auricle to be sent to the left ventricle , and from there to again start on its journey through the body . The principal facts pertaining to the blood and its circulation have been reviewed iii this simple manner as an aid to the discussing of other considerations somewhat pertinent to our subject . The nutrients , as prepared for use by digestion , enter the blood on its return flow to the heart , coming into the venous cavity by way of the hepatic ( liver ) vein and the thoracic duct as previously described . When , therefore , the right side of the heart is reached , a new accession of food material is on its way to sustain the various functions of nutrition . We are more interested in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mechanism . Somehow the digested food disappears into these constantly moving blood currents , and the only evidence of its effect which comes to us from ordinary observation is the warmth , motion and perhaps growth of the animal that is nourished . // THE LUNGS The first point where important changes occur is the lungs . Here the blood loses the purplish hue which it always has after being used in the body tissues and takes on a bright scarlet , a phenomenon that is more easily understood when we understand the lung structure . Breathing is a matter of common experience . We all know how air is drawn into the lungs at regular intervals , an equivalent quantity being as regularly forced out . The mechanism of respiration ( breathing ) we will not discuss at length . It will aid us , however , if we know that the passage which the air follows to and from the lungs , the trachea ( windpipe ) , divides into two branches , one to each lung , and these divide and subdivide until they branch into numerous fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dilation which is made up of air cells opening into a common cavity . These cells are so numerous in the lung tissues that only a very thin wall separates adjoining ones , and in this wall are carried the capillaries or fine divisions of the blood-vessels leading from the heart . This arrangement permits the blood to take up oxygen as it flows along ' and transfer certain wastes into the lung cavities , and thus be made ready to go back to the body carrying a joint load of digested food and oxygen . Of course the air that passes out of the lungs is less rich in oxygen than when it was taken in , and there have been added to it certain materials which we will notice later . // THE USE OF FOOD The revivified blood now passes to all parts of the body and is brought into the most intimate relation with the minutest portion of every tissue . Several things happen in the course of time . In the first place , the new supply of nutritive substances is used by the living cells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worn-out tissue and to form new growth . With the young animal , much material is appropriated in the latter way . In the case of the milch cow , there is furnished to the udder the nutrients out of which the milk is formed through the special activities of that gland . Moreover , it is in the tissues that the oxygen which was taken up in the lungs is used to slowly burn a portion of the food . This combustion is believed not to take place by contact of the oxygen and food in the large blood-vessels , but it occurs by progressive steps throughout the minute divisions of the muscles and other parts of the whole body . Notwithstanding this oxidation may be very gradual and occupy much time , its ultimate products are , for the most part , similar to those which result from the rapid combustion of fuel . In the fireplace , starch , sugar , cellulose , fats and similar bodies would be burned to carbonic acid and water , and this is what takes place in the animal to the extent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protein is not stored as such but is broken up , the result differs somewhat in the furnace and in the animal because in the latter the oxidation is not // complete . Here the proteids may be partially burned to carbonic acid and water , but a portion of their substance passes from the body principally in the form of urea and uric acid , which are the prominent constituents of urine . These compounds carry with them a certain proportion of carbon and hydrogen which in ordinary fuel combustion would more fully unite with oxygen . The heat production from protein is therefore less in the animal than in the furnace . This oxidation in the animal is constant but not uniform . It varies with the exercise the animal is taking and with the amount of food that must be disposed of . The quantity of oxygen needed is therefore variable , and when tine demand for it is largely increased the heart pumps faster , more blood passes through the lungs , the breathing is more rapid and the supply of oxygen is in this way augmented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combustion and from the breaking up of the proteids within the animal evidently must be disposed of in some manner . If not eliminated from the body , they would cause results of a most serious character , as , for instance , when an accumulation of urea in the body produces ura ? mic poisoning . The blood therefore not only carries to the tissues the necessary nutrients and oxygen , but it has laid upon it the burden of taking into its currents the waste products of combustion and growth and carrying them to the points where they are thrown off . Disposition of the 11'astes 1.4 ' ) One of the branches of the arterial system of bloodvessels runs to the kidneys , and , by repeatedly rebranching , traverses all their substance . The main function of the kidneys is to secrete the urine , a liquid in which all the waste nitrogen from the digested protein finds its way out of the body in the form of urea and similar bodies . The blood that enters them carries with it the urea and uric acid which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a most wonderful manner these compounds are filtered out so that they are not present in the outgoing blood . An excess of soluble mineral matters such as common salt is also removed by the kidneys , as well as the bile compounds which are absorbed from the alimentary canal . The carbon dioxide must in some way also be eliminated from the body . This is not accomplished to any extent until the blood containing it reaches the lungs , where it is exchanged for a new supply of oxygen and passes off in the expired air . In the case of man , the air " breathed out " is nearly a hundred times richer in carbonic acid than the air " breathed in . " Water may be regarded from one point of view as a waste , for it is produced in the oxidation of the food , and this passes off from the lungs as vapor , through the skin as sensible or insensible perspiration , and in considerable quantities through the kidneys . To summarize , it may be said that the blood is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the food ( including water and oxygen ) , and the loss consists of urea , carbonic acid and water given off through various channels . // THE LIVER One part of the arterial system of blood-vessels runs to the stomach and intestines and is distributed over their walls in fine divisions . These connect with the capillaries of the portal vein which leads to the liver . During this passage of the blood from one system to the other , part of the digested food is taken up . Now it is very evident that the quantity of material thus absorbed must vary greatly at different times according to the nature and amount of food supply and the activity of the digestive processes . If , therefore , the blood from the alimentary canal was allowed to pass directly into the general circulation , the , supply to the tissues of the nutrients , especially the carbohydrates , would be very uneven . Just here comes in a liver function . In that organ there is found a starch-like body known as glycogen , which appears in increased quantity following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is believed , because of this and other facts , that the liver acts as a regulator of the carbohydrate supply to the general tissues of the body , storing a temporary excess of the sugar in the form of glycogen and then gradually giving it up to the general circulation as it is needed . CHAPTER XI THE . FUNCTIONS OF THE NUTRIENTS THE digestion , absorption and distribution of food are not its use , ? they are the preliminaries necessary to use . Not until the nutrients have been converted to available forms and have passed into the blood do they in the slightest degree furnish energy or building material to the animal organism . We have followed to a certain extent the chemical changes which the digested food suffers , but no detailed statements have been made as to the part taken by each class of nutrients in constructing the animal body and in maintaining its complex activities . Animals use food in two general ways ; viz. , for constructive purposes , which involve the building or repair of tissue and the formation of milk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including heat . The tissues which are to be formed are of several kinds , principally the mineral portion of the bone , the nitrogenous tissue of the muscles , tendons , skin , hair , horn and various organs and membranes , and the deposits of fat which are quite generally distributed throughout the body substance . Energy in the forms in which it is used by the animal organism may appear as muscular activity , such as ( 151 ) // working , walking , breathing , the beating of the heart , the movements of the stomach and intestines , as heat , and as chemical energy necessary for carrying on digestion and other metabolic changes . The animal body is certainly the seat of greatly varied and complex constructive and destructive activities , which are sustained by the matter and potential energy of the food . How this is done we do not fully understand , but we know many facts which are of great scientific and practical importance and which the feeder must consciously or unconsciously recognize if he would not come into conflict with immutable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have learned that mineral compounds are abundant in the animal body . The tissues , the blood , digestive fluids and especially the bony framework contain a variety of these bodies , which are as essential as any other substances to the building and maintenance of the animal organism . Bone formation without phosphoric acid and lime is not possible , and to deprive the digestive juices of the chlorine and soda which they contain would be to destroy their usefulness . Young animals fail to develop if given no mineral food , and mature animals when entirely deprived of even one substance , common salt , become weak , inactive and finally die . Not only must the growing calf have the ash compounds for constructive purposes , but the mature ox must be supplied with Uses of Mineral Compounds ? Protein them in order to sustain the nutritive functions . It is especially true of milch cows , which store combinations of phosphoric acid , lime and potash so abundantly in the milk that they must have an adequate supply of these substances . Nothing is clearer than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food . They can not originate in the animal , neither can carbon compounds take their place . Nature seems to have made generous provision for the animals ' needs along this line . All of our home-raised feeding stuffs , as usually fed , contain in variety and quantity all that is needful of these nutrients except for poultry perhaps . Milk , that is the exclusive food of very young animals , is especially calculated to sustain the rapid bone formation which is taking place . It is only when feeding is one-sided , as in an exclusive corn diet , or when parts of a grain are removed , that we need fear a deficiency of the necessary mineral compounds . FUNCTIONS OF PROTEIN While there are at present many unsolved problems relative to the nutritive offices of protein , there is no reasonable doubt that the vegetable proteids are the only sources of similar substances in the animal body . This is equivalent to a statement that from the proteids are formed the muscles , the connective tissues , the skin , hair , horn , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the secretive and excretive organs ; in short , that they are the source of a large proportion // of all the working parts of the animal 's body . So far , scientific research has not succeeded in demonstrating that an albuminoid is ever synthesized ( built up from simple compounds ) outside of the plant . It appears that bodies of this class must come to animal life fully elaborated . This is a truth of great significance even in its relation to the nutrition of farm animals . The nitrogenous tissues are those that largely determine the vigor and quality of any animal , and as these are formed rapidly in the early stages of growth , a normal and unrestricted development demands an abundant supply of proteid food . It is also true of mature animals that sufficient protein is not only necessary to health and vigor , but it is essential to production that is satisfactory in quantity and quality . The functions of protein are not restricted , however , to the use already described . According to existing views , it is utilized in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was held at one time by prominent scientists that outside the vegetable fats it is the sole source of animal fats , and this view was , not so very long ago , to some extent accepted . Indisputable proof to the contrary is now in our possession , and some investigators even go so far as to deny the possibility of the formation of fat from protein . On this point , opinion is divided . Certainly we must be convinced that nitrogen compounds of the food are , with some species , not the most important source of animal fat , for various investigators , such as Lawes and Gilbert , Soxhlet , and others , have shown upon the basis of searching experiments that sometimes over // four-fifths of the fat stored by pigs must have had its origin outside the food protein and fat . Besides all this , the common experience of feeders that foods highly non-nitrogenous are often the most efficient for fattening purposes is good common-sense evidence that fat formation is not greatly dependent upon the protein supply . Nevertheless , the possibility of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are several considerations which make it seem probable that under certain conditions this does occur . Protein can unquestionably serve as fuel , or , in other words , as a source of energy . The amount so used depends much upon the animal fed and the character of the ration . In the case of a dog eating an exclusive meat diet or of a fattening animal which receives a ration liberally nitrogenous , probably the greater part of the protein eaten is not stored but is used as fuel . With milch cows or young animals growing vigorously , a much larger proportion escapes oxidation . The fuel value of protein will be discussed later under another head . FUNCTIONS OF CARBOHYDRATES Carbohydrates are usually characterized as the fuel portion of the food , or that part which is burned to produce the various forms of energy . This conception of the function of these bodies is correct in the sense that in the case of ruminants they constitute the larger part of the fuel , although not the whole of it . For instance , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ digestible organic matter , giving thirty pounds of milk containing 15 per cent of solids , and neither gaining nor losing flesh , not far from five pounds of this organic matter would be found in the milk and urine , leaving about eleven pounds to be used as fuel , about a pound and a half of which might be derived from the protein and fat , the remainder , or 9.5 pounds , consisting of carbo hydrates . If a fattening steer were eating the same amount of the same kind of food and gaining two pounds of live weight daily , the body increase and urine would contain not over 2.5 pounds of dry matter , leaving not less than 13.5 pounds to be oxi dized , of which twelve pounds might consist of car bohydrates and fat , mostly the former . It is clear , then , that while other bodies serve as fuel , the carbo hydrates furnish much the larger part of that which is needed for this use . Contrary to views that held for a time , it is now well established @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carbohydrates ; in other words , starch and sugar and related bodies may serve the main purpose in feeding animals for fattening . In many experiments , notably those with swine , the protein and fat of the food have fallen far short of ac-counting for the fat in the body increase , some-times much the greater part of the latter having no possible source other than the carbohydrates . A practical expression of this general conclusion con cerning the fat-forming function of carbohydrates is seen in the well-recognized value of corn meal as a // fattening food , a feeding stuff nearly seven-tenths of which consists of starch and its allies . Recent experi ments with milch cows leave scarcely any doubt that milk fat may also be derived from carbohydrates . These more recent views tend to magnify the impor tance of the carbohydrates as nutrients . FUNCTIONS OF THE FATS AND OILS So far as is at present known , the possible uses of the food fats and oils and of the carbohydrates are sim ilar . In other words , both may serve as fuel and both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are that the supply of carbohydrates is much the larger , and the fuel value of a unit weight of fats much the greater . Moreover , it seems possible for a vegetable fat to be-come deposited in the animal without essential change , whereas fat formation from carbohydrates involves complex chemical transformations . FOOD AS A SOURCE OF ENERGY The living animal , either as a whole or in some of its parts , is constantly in motion . This means that the animal mechanism is ceaselessly performing work . Even if the body is apparently quiet , the heart beats , pumping blood to all parts of the body , the lungs are expanded and contracted , and the stomach and intes tines keep up the movements which are essential to digestion . Besides , a living body is the seat of con tinuous , invisible and complex chemical and physical changes that , if not work in the common meaning of // the term , are its equivalent . Walking , trotting , pulling , lifting , pumping blood , breathing , masticating , digesting and assimilating food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those living machines which we have named horse , ox , cow and sheep . Now work requires the expenditure of energy . The projection of a rifle ball through space at the rate of two thousand feet per second is work . The ball does not move of itself , but is propelled by the application of the energy stored in a powerful explosive . Back of every one of our great mechanical operations , such as pumping , grinding and moving railroad trains , will always be found some sort of energy , and what is true of machinery made of wood and iron is equally true of that made of bone and muscle . The fact that the mechanism is alive does not abrogate a single physical law , so that the fundamental principles of energy as applied to machines are as fully applicable to the activities of animal life . It is safe to go farther , and say that the animal organism does not originate energy . Among the fundamental conceptions upon which all our knowledge of chemical and physical laws rests is this , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the sum total of these in the universe is unchangeable . If , then , the horse expends the muscular energy necessary to draw a load of one ton over ten miles of road , the equivalent of this must have been supplied to his body from some outside source . He could not create it . We know that this is so , and we also know it is conveyed to the animal in the food . // This is a complex , but a fascinating , field of inquiry ; one that is now receiving much attention in our researches after a more intimate understanding of the facts and principles of nutrition . It will be profitable , therefore , for us to gain some conception of the knowledge of this kind , which so far seems to have a practical bearing upon our subject . It is natural to first ask , What is energy ? This is a difficult question to answer in a popular way , and the physicists ' definition would hardly serve our purpose . All we can do , perhaps , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Let us resort to an old illustration . Every farmer 's boy has doubtless seen a blacksmith hammer an iron rod until it was red hot . The motion of the hammer-head descending with great velocity was suddenly arrested when it came in contact with the rod . This descent of the hammer-head illustrated one form of active energy ; viz. , motion of a mass of matter . When the hammer met the iron rod on the anvil , the mass motion ceased . Was the energy therefore lost ? Not unless our fundamental conception is wrong , and we find that in this case it is not . The physicist teaches us that the motion of the hammer-head , a mass of matter , was communicated to the smallest particles or molecules of the iron rod , and as the vibrations of the molecule increased in rapidity , the rod grew hotter and hotter . Here we have another illustration of energy ; viz. , the motion of the molecule or heat . The iron rod might have been heated in another way , ? by plunging it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heat energy come in this case ? From the combustion of the carbon . Somehow , when it is deposited in the plant , there becomes stored in this carbon , in a way about which we can only theorize , what perhaps we.may call the chemical energy of the atom , which , when combustion occurs , is changed into heat or molecule motion . From these phenomena we learn that not only are there several forms of energy , but that one form is transferable into another . Perhaps another illustration may still further serve our purpose . A small dynamo is being run by a pair of horses working in a tread power such as is used for threshing grain . The horses are constantly climbing up a moving treadway and thereby communicating motion to machinery . This motion is , by the dynamo , converted into electricity , which , by passing through the carbon film of an incandescent lamp and there meeting resistance , is in part , at least , transformed into heat . We have , then , in a chain , muscular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , etc. ) , electricity and heat , all active energies and all transferable the one into the other . This is a fairly good picture of what goes on with the horse himself , externally and internally , in sustaining life and performing labor for his owner . Back of it all , and this is what interests us , is the animal 's food . As a result of years of patient investigation , it has become known that through the combustion of the carbon compounds of vegetable and animal origin , which serve as nutrients , chemical energy may be transformed into those other forms that are manifested in the activities of living // beings . When we ask from whence comes the energy given up by the plant compounds , we arrive at our last stage of inquiry . Here we enter the domain of plant life , and it is a notable triumph of the human intellect that we are able to declare with certainty that the ceaseless and multiple activities of life on this planet are sustained by an energy which comes to the plant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is obvious that if the internal and external work performed by the animal is sustained by the food , it is desirable to measure the energy available in differ-ent feeding stuffs , provided , of course , that they differ in this respect , as we know they do . In order to measure anything , we must have a standard or unit of measurement . In this case it can not be a unit of space or of mass , that is , we can not declare that corn meal contains so many cubic feet or pounds of avail-able energy . Energy has neither dimensions nor weight . f we measure it at all , it must be by units of tem-perature or of work performed . Units of this kind are applied to the measurement of food energy . The one most commonly in use is the Calorie , this being the energy which in terms of heat is sufficient to raise the temperature of one pound of water 4 ? Fahren-heit . Expressed in terms of work , the Calorie is very nearly 1.53 foot tons , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work involved in lifting one ton 1.53 feet . Heat units are expressed in both the large Calorie and the small calorie . When the former is in-dicated , the word begins with a capital letter . The Calorie represents 1,000 calories . // The total energy or heat units developed in the combustion of feeding stuffs is determined in an ap-paratus called a calorimeter . The latest form of this device is one in which the ground hay is burned under pressure in the presence of pure oxygen , and the heat evolved is all used in warming a known weight of water . Data are thus obtained from which it is possi-ble to calculate the Calories in the particular material burned . The energy value of single compounds , such as albumin , starch and sugar , may also be found in the same way , as has been done in a large number of instances . These data show that the heat resulting from the combustion of the compounds of the same class is not the same in all cases . The value in large Calories of one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several nutrients is shown in the following table : // The heat values of a gram of the dry substance of various cattle foods , which is a mixture of the several nutrients , were found by recent determinations to be the following , expressed in small calories : These figures mean that when a gram of each of these materials is wholly burned the heat produced is as stated . Available energy. ? We must distinguish , however , between the heat produced when any food substance is wholly oxidized in a calorimeter and the heat or energy which is available when the same material is applied to physiological uses . It never happens that the combustible portion of a ration is entirely burned in the animal . In the first place , the food of domestic animals is practically never all digested and , as only the digested portion furnishes energy , the available fuel value of a ration must be based primarily , not upon the total quantity of dry matter it represents , but upon the amount which is dissolved and passes into the blood . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proportion and with the same ease , their total fuel values might show their relative energy worth , but as digestion coefficients for dry matter vary from less than 50 per cent with the straws to nearly 90 per cent with some of the cereal products , it is evident that the fuel waste in the feces is not uniform . // In the second place , the digested proteids are never fully burned . A portion of these compounds always passes off in the urine unoxidized , the fuel value of which is lost to the animal . For , this reason the available energy of the digested proteids is about one-fourth less than the total . Iu the third place , there is , with ruminants and horses at least , an escape from the alimentary canal of unconsumed gases , due to the fermentations which take place during digestion . These gases , mostly methane ( marsh gas ) , have their source in the carbohydrates , and Kellner found them to represent from 10 to 20 per cent of the total energy value of the dry substance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five different animals , Kuhn found the loss in methane to be over one-seventh the energy of the digested crude fiber and nitrogen-free extract . We are to understand , then , that the available energy of a ration is represented by the fuel value of the dry matter which is digested from it , minus the dry matter of the urine and that lost in gases . If , however , we wish to know the actual energy gain to the animal from a particular ration , we must go farther than a determination of its available energy . Net energy. ? Within a comparatively short time we have begun to speak of the net energy of foods , and as this is a practical consideration which is likely to be the subject of much future discussion , it is well to notice it in an explanatory way . As we have learned , food is not applied to use until it reaches the blood . Energy . Loss in Work of Digestion 1.65 Between the time when it is taken into the mouth and when it passes into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way of mastication , solution and moving it along the digestive tract , and it appears highly probable that the amount of this work per pound of food must vary greatly in different cases . In fact , we know this is so from the result of some masterly investigations conducted by Zuntz in Ger many . By means of various devices and methods , a description of which would be out of place here , he measured the oxygen consumption necessary to sustain the mechanical energy of mastication and digestion , and he calculates from his determinations that the fol lowing heat units represented the energy used in chewing certain feeding stuffs : The differences revealed by these figures are inter esting and important . Chewing green food cost in labor only about 62 per cent of the effort required to masticate its equivalent of dry hay , the proportions of labor for hay , oats and corn being in the ratio of 100 , 27 and 8% . This author goes further and calculates that the work of mastication and digestion combined is 48 per cent of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 19.7 per cent of that from oats . He also makes the statement that in general the coarse foods have 20 per cent less net energy value than the // grains . All these deductions are based upon the excess of oxygen used by the animal when engaged in the work of chewing and digestion , over that used when at rest . It follows from these results that anything in the way of growth or treatment of a fodder which tends to toughen or harden the tissue reduces the net energy value . It has long been believed , though perhaps not proved , that grain foods are superior to coarse foods to an extent not accounted for by the differences in digestibility , and if this is a fact , it is explained in part by the unlike composition but is to some extent undoubtedly due to the greater effort of chewing and digesting the fodders . If we wish to ascertain the comparative energy worth of two unlike rations , it would obviously be incorrect to multiply the total quantities of protein , carbohydrates and fats in each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relative energy gain to the animal body . To recapitulate , we may define available energy as total energy minus that which is lost in the excreta and in gases which escape , and net energy as available energy minus the cost of digestion and of preparing the food for use . Net energy is the balance of profit to the animal . ENERGY RELATIONS OF THE SEVERAL NUTRIENTS As has been pointed out , the animal body is the field of numerous mechanical activities . What is the relation of the several nutrients to these manifestations of vital energy is an interesting and in some ways an intensely practical matter . For instance , has protein a peculiar function in the maintenance of muscular Maintenance of Muscular rJJ'nrt 1 ( i7 activity which no other nutrients have ? The belief prevailed at one time that muscular contraction caused a wasting of the muscle substance which must be replaced by the proteid compounds of the food ; in other words , protein alone was believed to sustain the work of the animal body , both internal and external . It would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more protein is needed . This view is no longer held . The more exact methods of modern research have revealed the fact that an increase of muscular effort , even up to a severe point , increases but little , if any , the nitrogen compounds of the urine , these being the measure of the protein that is destroyed . There has come to light a corresponding fact that the consumption of fuel in the body other than proteids increases proportionately with the increase of work . This means that as animals are ordinarily fed mechanical work is largely sustained through the combustion of carbohydrates and fats , and that while for reasons we do not yet wholly understand a fairly generous amount of protein seems to promote the well-being of a draft animal , the non-nitrogenous nutrients mostly supply the extra energy demanded for the labor . Heat relations. ? The question is very naturally asked , As no energy is lost , into what is the energy of muscular contraction converted , as , for instance , that required for walking , the beating of the heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by physiologists that muscular energy used by the animal is partly transformed into external motion and partly into heat , and this certainly is consistent with facts as observed . ' io1.68 The . Feeding of Animals lent exercise by the animal greatly increases the production of heat . We know this is so because under these conditions an increased amount of blood is thrown to the surface of the body , thereby greatly increasing the loss of heat by radiation ; perspiration sets in and with it the consequent evaporation of much more moisture , thus disposing of much heat . The dog , and sometimes other animals , pants and thereby causes a large loss of heat from the expanded surface of the moist tongue . All this occurs without reducing the body temperature below the normal . In fact , nature adopts these various devices , such as increased circulation of the blood and perspiration , in order to regulate the body temperature and prevent its rising above the proper point . The explanation of this greater heat during labor is that the mechanical energy manifested by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ severe exercise is more than enough to keep the body at its usual temperature and maintain the usual radiation . When it is severely cold , on the other hand , vigorous exercise is sometimes necessary in order to keep sufficiently warm . The view is held by some that all body heat is a secondary product , that combustion first supports muscular activity which changes to heat , in fact , that no food is burned primarily to keep the animal warm . Convincing proof of this position is still lacking , however . There appears to be no good reason why we should deny the possibility of combustion of food for the specific purpose of warming the body . Certainly an Arctic climate causes a consumption of food which // in kind and quantity would be impracticable in the tropics , and this too , even if there is no apparent increase of internal or external work . This would seem to indicate the direct oxidation of food for heating purposes . In any case , animal heat is sustained either directly or indirectly by the burning of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions there is an air temperature , called the critical temperature , at which metabolism ( oxidation ) reaches a minimum . If the air temperature falls below this point , thus causing a greater radiation of heat from the body surface , increased oxidation occurs . If the temperature rises above this point there is no diminution of oxidation but rather a slight increase , hence the conclusion that there is a minimum oxidation necessary to the maintenance of the vital functions which must go on however much the demands for the . radiation of heat may be lessened by a rise of the air temperature . It is evident then that at the higher air temperatures there is an excess of oxidation above that which is required for warming the animal , so that some heat must be thrown off as a waste product . Whichever way the air temperature moves from the critical point there is heat regulation , this being chemical for the lower temperatures and physical for the higher . The critical temperatures for our various farm animals have not been determined , so that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the influence of given temperatures upon production . CHAPTER XII PHYSIOLOGICAL VALUES OF THE NUTRIENTS THE preceding discussion of the physiological uses of the various nutrients has dealt largely with them as classes . The special functions and relative values of individual compounds within the same class or of the different classes have not been considered . We know , for instance , that the albuminoids are in a general way flesh-formers , or fat-formers , or heat-formers , but we desire still further information as to the relative efficiency of the individual albuminoids for any specific purpose . Are some albuminoids more use-ful than others in aiding milk secretion ? Similar knowledge concerning the non-nitrogenous nutrients is important . How valuable physiologically is cellulose as compared with starch ? Again , we are convinced that both the carbohy-drates and the vegetable fats may be sources of animal fats , but we are bound to inquire what is the relative importance of these groups of compounds as fat-formers in the animal body . It is easy to understand that knowledge of this kind would be valuable . We are coming to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cattle foods , and if we could ascertain the exact physiologi-(170) // cal uses and relative values of even the most prominent individual compounds , we would be able to make somewhat definite comparisons of the different feeding stuffs . It must be confessed that information of this specific kind is not as complete as one could wish . Its acquirement is very difficult and its present status is in some particulars unsatisfactory . Investigations so far conducted are not only insufficient to final conclusions , but researches by different observers have resulted in a conflict of opinion in some cases . RELATIVE ENERGY AND PRODUCTION VALUES OF THE NUTRIENTS SINGLY AND AS CLASSES It is satisfactorily established , as we have seen , that protein , carbohydrates and fats have certain functions in common , that is , that all three classes are utilized as fuel , and that both carbohydrates and fats , and perhaps protein , may be a source of body fat . The question naturally arises , What is the relative value of these unlike nutrients as a source of energy and as fat-formers ? Moreover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of substances , unlike in physical and chemical characteristics , can we consider the individual compounds within the same class as nutritively equal ? Relative energy values . ? As a source of energy , the carbohydrates and their allies are properly regarded as of first. importance because of their large relative use as a fuel supply . These bodies , so far as they are digestible , have been considered in formulating rations as of practically equal value . It is well known that // this is a doubtful assumption . The nitrogen-free extract digested from the fodders is much more largely derived from crude fiber and the gums than that digested from the grains , starch being predominant in the latter , and we are not justified in concluding , except from reliable evidence , that the materials from the two sources are similar and equivalent as nutrients ; in fact , some investigators believe the reverse to be true . If we accept the heat of combustion of the carbohydrates and similar substances when burned in a calorimeter as the measure of their energy value , we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found in the nitrogen-free extract have been found to vary from 3.7 to 4.2 Calories per gram . This indicates no great difference in value for the production of heat energy . We are not sure , however , that what is true of simple , rapid combustion is true of physiological use . Certain related facts must be considered . Because of Tappeiner 's conclusion that the fermentations to which cellulose is subject , break it up mostly into gases and organic acids which he regarded as largely not useful to the animal , the view has more or less prevailed that digested crude fiber is greatly inferior to starch as a nutrient . More recent investigations throw doubt upon the correctness of this view , and the trend of opinion now seems to be towards regarding cellulose as taking practically the same place in nutrition , apart from ease of digestion , that starch does . It appears that the fermentations in the digestive tract of starch , sugar and other carboValue // hydrates also give rise to gases which pass off unconsumed , though perhaps not to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and several observers declare that digested crude fiber is no less nutritively efficient in a maintenance ration than the more soluble compounds of the nitrogen-free extract . The question has been raised as to whether the gums ( pentosans ) which exist so abundantly in many coarse foods and in some grain products , like wheat bran , are not inferior to the other more soluble carbohydrates . It has been observed that the sugars which result from the action of ferments on these bodies have , in some instances , not been oxidized , but have passed off in the urine as such . It appears doubtful whether under normal and usual conditions this occurs to any extent . The gams are constantly present in all rations for farm animals , and we have no reason for believing that the pentose ( gum ) sugars are constant ingredients of their urine . The comparative physiological values of individual albuminoids and fats we do not know very much about , other than what we may judge from the determinations of heats of combustion . In experimental work single compounds have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based upon the results of feeding mixtures of individual albuminoids and fats as they ordinarily exist in plants . Determinations of the heats of combustion of single and mixed albuminoids and fats from various sources show a variation of from 5.6 to 6 Cal . per gram for the former and from 9.2 to 9.6 Cal . for the latter . The // variation for the same class is seen not to be large , but whether the animal derives energy in similar proportions must be decided by experimental evidence . In recent years much attention has been given experimentally to the physiological values of the nutrients . Among the most painstaking and extensive investigations of this sort are those conducted at Mockern by Kellner and his associates . This work includes fortyfour metabolism experiments , each of fourteen days ' duration , and one hundred and eighty-four respiration experiments , each of twenty-four hours ' duration . In order to secure the desired data , there was added to a basal ration gluten , oil , potato starch , extracted straw ( mostly cellulose freed from incrusting and accompanying compounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheat straw . From the results obtained , through exact measurements of the ingested food , the excreta and the products of respiration , ? thus making it possible to determine the relation of each substance to the maintenance of the animal and to the storage of flesh and fat , ? Kellner worked out both the energy and the production values of the experimental materials . While the figures given should not be regarded as final , they have behind them so much careful and severe investigation that they must be accepted as having great weight . They at least correctly record what happened with particular animals . In presenting these results a distinction is made between available energy value and production or net value . It is the former which interests us at this point , and it is this which is shown in the following figures : // The available energy is seen in the total energy of the digested organic matter less that which is lost in the urine and from fermentations which produce the unoxidized gases . These figures show the energy or heat furnished to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They also represent the heat production when the substances were fed in a maintenance ration , and as Rubner has demonstrated that the heat lost from the animal that is eating just a maintenance ration is a measure of the animal 's use of food , these values show what the different substances were worth for maintenance purposes . It appears that in these investigations the sugars of molasses , extracted cellulose and the material digested from the coarse foods containing much cellulose and gums supplied practically the same available energy to the animal that starch did , wheat straw excepted . Relative production values of the different nutrients ? If we calculate the fat-forming value of protein and // starch on a purely theoretical basis as Henneberg did some years ago , it would appear that 100 parts of body fat can be obtained from 194 parts of albuminoids or 244 parts of starch . The fat factor of albuminoids would be therefore 51.4% and of starch 41% . The equivalence of food fat in terms of body fat has never been expressed on such a basis , though it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may cause the production of an equal quantity of body fat or milk fat , an assumption which has no foundation whatever . These theoretical figures are an attempt to show what in indicating how the food is really used in practice . It is probable that the excess of food over and above maintenance is never all used for production according to the theoretical possibilities based upon chemical rearrangements of compounds . Certainly the production from a given quantity of food varies greatly under unlike conditions . It can scarcely be doubted that the proportion of the available nutrients which are consumed , that is , burned as fuel , increases as the ration increases above what is needed for maintenance , and inversely the proportion of the nutrients stored in the body as flesh and fat is less the greater is the quantity fed in excess of the demands for maintenance . A large excess over maintenance is relatively less efficient than a small one . There comes a point where additional food produces no additional gain , but only additional consumption . The age of the growing animal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the efficiency of the food for production purposes , as does the period of lac-tation with a cow . With all these variations we have no averages which express with any definiteness the relative practical production value of the different nu-trients . Nevertheless this question has been the sub-ject of severe and extended investigation , and some of the results have given valuable information . Henneberg and Pfeiffer estimate that in experiments with sheep the protein in excess of maintenance caused the production of from 30.7 to 41.1 parts of fat for each 100 parts of protein . It is not shown that the fat came directly from the protein or from the carbo-hydrates which the excess of protein replaced in other uses . Experiments by Kuhn are made the basis of the conclusion that 1 pound of starch supported the storage of .2 pounds of fat . The most reliable and extensive data as to pro-ductive values are those already referred to as having been reached by Kellner and others at Mockern . They are summarized in the following table : // The productive value is stated in terms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the work of chewing and digestion , and ( 2 ) that which is appropriated to the molecular rearrangement of the digested compounds which are transferred to the body substance . These being the factors which diminish productive value , it is easy to understand how the usefulness of a nutrient is somewhat determined by its source . When it is contained in a coarse fodder like straw where the work of chewing and digestion is large and where , because of its physical condition , the fodder is slowly acted upon by the digestive fluids and is thus subject for a long time to the action of micro-organisms , the nutrient is less valuable than when supplied to the animal in grain where the work of mastication , digestion and solution is a minimum . Starch , extracted straw and molasses , requiring no energy for mastication and but little for solution , supply digested material which Kellner found to be four times as valuable for production as that coming from ripe wheat straw . The foregoing figures do not tell us how much a steer would gain daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but they do indicate in a general way what is the relative efficiency of the nutrients when derived from given sources . They give us a scientific explanation of the fact that coarse foods are not adapted to rapid production . Relative importance of the protein compounds. ? Much prominence has been given to the fact that protein includes several groups of nitrogen compounds // quite unlike in character . We know also that these groups exist in cattle foods in unlike proportions . For example , a much larger part of the protein of roots consists of amides than is the case with the grains , the protein of the latter being correspondingly richer in albuminoids . If , therefore , albuminoids and amides differ in function or value , we have established one point of unlikeness between cornmeal and turnips . The testimony so far obtained is quite consistent in one direction , and indicates that the flesh-forming function is confined to the true albuminoids . This means that gelatin , amides ( asparagin , etc. ) , extrac tives ( creatin , etc. ) , can not supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however . Experiments with gelatin and asparagin have led to the conclusion that their presence in the ration so protects the albuminoids from consumption that the latter may have their maximum use as flesh-and milk-formers . The extractives seem to have a peculiar place among the nutrients . They are not regarded as , flesh-formers , or as fuel , but so far as is known they act merely as stimulants of the nervous system . The albuminoids are the only flesh-formers . There are , however , many albuminoids , and they differ among themselves as raw material out of which to construct the primary tissues of the animal body . Can albu mins do what globulins can not ? Are nucleins su perior to albumins for special purposes ? Not much that is definite can be said on this point . Because the various nitrogenous feeding stuffs are so generally // interchangeable in the ration , without marked effect upon its efficiency when the protein supply is not diminished , it seems probable that the albuminoids are largely interchangeable in use . On the other hand , certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , well-conducted experiments show that animal protein is superior to vegetable protein as food for ducks , when the two kinds are supplied in equally digestible quantities . It is possible that there are other differences in the effect of the protein from unlike sources which the ordinary methods of observation have not been competent to detect . One interesting question which has been considered , is whether the special nuclein bodies ( albuminoids containing phosphorus ) which are found so abundantly in eggs and in milk must be supplied as such in the food , or whether they may be built up in the animal from other albuminoids and phosphates . If we could learn that the food must contain these peculiar albuminoids all ready for use , then we would have a valuable suggestion for feeding cows and poultry . It now seems improbable that this is the case . The sea salmon , which , during its stay up the river , is believed to take no food , undoubtedly produces large masses of eggs from the body substance , and it seems unlikely that so much nuclein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cow gives thirty pounds of milk daily , nearly or quite a pound of casein must come from somewhere , and there is no evidence that any ordinary ration would contain so large a quantity of phosphorized albuminoids . Hens ' eggs are rich in nuclein , beyond Differences in Protein ( compounds ISi any amount which the food seems likely to supply . Notwithstanding this indirect evidence , it can not be safely affirmed that one albuminoid does not possess much greater value for a specific purpose than another , and here is a field in which the investigator may render valuable service . NoTE. ? Extensive experiments recently conducted with milch cows by Jordan , Hart and Patten , showed that in every instance the nucleo-proteids in the rations were equal in quantity to those in the milk and excreta . The experiments gave no evidence of a synthesis of these bodies . CHAPTER . XIII LAWS OF NUTRITION THE preceding pages have been devoted to a discussion of the origin of cattle foods , what they are in substance , how their nutrients are made available and how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gather together in a systematic relation what may be called the fundamental principles or laws of nutrition , some of which we have not yet directly stated , but which are inferences from the facts presented . It is desirable to do this , however , before passing to the consideration of the practice of cattle feeding . 1 . All energy and building material applied to the maintenance and growth of the animal body come from the food , water and oxygen being included in this term . The animal originates neither force nor matter . 2 . Only that portion of the food which is digested , i. e. , that which is dissolved by the digestive fluids and rendered soluble and diffusible so that it passes into the blood , is available for any use whatever . This fac , is especially important in view of the greatly varying digestibility of different feeding stuffs. 3 . The unutilized food and the wastes pass from the body in some direction . The undigested part mainly ( 182 ) // constitutes the solid excrement or feces . The urea and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protein , pass out wholly in the urine . All digested nitrogen not stored is found here . The carbon dioxide is eliminated through the skin and lungs , chiefly the latter , and water is disposed of through the kidneys , skin and lungs . 4 . The digested food is used in two general directions , ( a ) for the production of energy and ( b ) for constructive purposes . ( a ) The food energy is made available through combustion , i. e. , the oxidation of the carbon compounds of the food to simpler substances , carbon dioxide and water , thus liberating the energy stored in the plant during its growth . Protein is never fully oxidized , but carbohydrates and fats may be . All the organic nutrients may be oxidized to produce energy , the total heat values of protein , carbohydrates and fats being approximately as 1.5 , 1 , 2.4 . This liberated energy finds expression in the animal organism in various ways , as heat , mechanical energy or motion and chemical transformations . The total energy of food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loss in the excreta and gases . Moreover , the net energy gain seems not to be proportional to the available energy , but is dependent upon the work of digestion , which varies with different cattle foods . ( b ) The food compounds are used for constructive purposes , either without changing their general character , as , for instance , the building of muscular tissue from the plant alburninoids , or they may be reorganized into bodies of a very different character , as in the // formation of animal fats from starch and sugar . Protein is used to construct muscular tissue , in fact , all the nitrogenous parts , and it is perhaps a source of fat . Carbohydrates can only be used constructively for the formation of fat , and the same is true of food fats or oils . Mineral matter is needed for the formation of bone and has important functions in digestion . 5 . The matter of the digested food , including water and oxygen , is exactly equal to that stored in the body or in milk , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , water , carbonic acid and urine solids . Such a balance may not be maintained for any particular day , but will ultimately be found to exist . 6 . Under given conditions of species , sex , climate and use , a definite amount of digested organic matter is necessary to maintain a particular animal without gain or loss of body substance . This means simply that tissue wastes must be replaced , and the fuel supply must be kept up . If the animal receives no food , or less than the amount needed for maintenance purposes , tissue waste and the production of energy do not cease , but go on wholly or in part at the expense of the body substance , and , as it is commonly expressed , the animal " grows thin . " 7 . Food supplied above a needed maintenance quantity may be utilized for the production of new substances or work or may be eliminated in part and increase the waste . Within limits , both things generally occur . In the proper sense of the term , no production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Hance requirement . Milk formation may sometimes go on at the expense of the body substance , but with proper feeding , milk , flesh or muscular work are produced at the expense of food supplied in excess of that needed for maintenance . 8 . Regard must be had to the supply of particular nutrients as well as of total food . Even with an animal doing no work and giving no milk a certain amount of protein will be broken up constantly into urea and similar compounds , an amount which will be withdrawn from the body tissues to the extent that it is not supplied by the food . In addition to this , a milch cow , for instance , must have protein for the formation of the nitrogen compounds of the milk , or a steer for the growth of flesh in a quantity proportional to the production , and food must supply it . There is , therefore , a minimum supply of protein , which , in a particular case , is necessary for maintenance and for constructive purposes , less than which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or else requires the use of body tissue . 9 . The different classes of nutrients are to some extent interchangeable in their functions . That is to say , all the organic nutrients may be burned to supply energy . Protein may be so used even to withdrawing it from the purposes to which it is necessary unless the carbohydrates or fats are sufficient to protect it from being consumed as fuel . A proper supply of the nonnitrogenous nutrients is required , therefore , to insure the application of the necessary minimum of food protein to its peculiar uses . CHAPTER XIV SOURCES OF KNOWLEDGE THE foregoing chapters embody many statements of principles and facts which have been made positively and without modification . To quite an extent these are based upon the conclusions of scientific men , that is , conclusions which have been reached after such study of the problems involved as is competent to secure accurate information . In some cases this study has been severe and long continued , having been carried on by the use of methods and apparatus capable of the most precise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effort has been made to proceed logically , so that the results attained shall not be fallacious . Notwithstanding the fact that a great deal of our knowledge is the result of an earnest and impartial search after truth , under conditions especially favorable to its discovery , many persons are disposed to give more credit to the traditions and conclusions of practice than to the carefully prepared verdicts of science . It may not be out of place , therefore , to present in this connection some of the considerations and methods which have to do with the acquisition of knowledge concerning animal nutrition , for this may aid us to appreciate the value of ( 186 ) // well-established facts and to exercise caution in accepting the verdicts either of science or of practice before they are thoroughly justified . There are three general ways in which we may be said to have acquired knowledge in regard to feeding animals : 1 . The observation of ordinary practice . 2 . Practical experiments , so called . 3 . Scientific investigation . CONCLUSIONS OF PRACTICE Until within recent years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conclusions drawn from ordinary practice . Among the many men engaged in animal husbandry , certain ones possessed of more than average powers of observation and business ability have secured good results with certain feeding stuffs and methods of feeding , and their practice has been accepted by their neighbors with no further demonstration than that these successful farmers sold fat cattle and obtained large returns from the dairy . During the centuries that man has had domestic animals under his care , certain results have appeared to follow from certain systems of feeding or the use of certain foods , and upon these socalled practical observations the feeder has built his creed . In these ways there have come to be accepted , sometimes locally and sometimes generally , standards of feeding as to quantity , kind of ration , and times // of feeding . At the same time , it was necessary only to attend a farmers ' convention fifty years ago to become convinced of a great variety of opinions as to the best methods of practice . In fact , opinion was the court of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fundamentals to which appeal could be made as a basis for discussion . While many false notions were entertained , many of the beliefs then prevailing were undoubtedly correct or contained a germ of truth . It is generally safe to assume that when an opinion is widely and persistently held it is not altogether without reason or foundation . It is often the expression , in more or less correct terms , of some important principle . No one should lightly turn aside from the traditions and convictions of a community in regard to any line of practice . A knowledge of the precepts governing the feeder 's art that are the accumulation of experience in the care of animals is to be respected and is , to a great extent , essential to successful practice . It is also true that little substantial progress can be realized in any art if its underlying truths are not understood , for when this is the ease the results of experience under one set of conditions do not serve as a guide under circumstances entirely different . PRACTICAL FEEDING EXPERIMENTS With the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in agriculture , an attempt has been made to search for important truths more systematically , an effort undertaken chiefly by experiment stations . As // one means of gaining knowledge , these institutions , and to some extent private farmers , have conducted many so-called practical feeding experiments in order to verify present beliefs , test theories and solve existing problems . The relative value of various feeding stuffs and rations for producing growth and milk and the influence of different fodders and grain foods upon the quality of the product have been the subjects of numerous feeding tests . Much valuable information has been secured in this way , but there has not always been a full recognition , even by experiment stations , of the limitations which should be observed in drawing conclusions from this manner of experimentation . In order to view this matter more in detail , let us consider experiments in testing rations for growth and milk production . The usual method of procedure with such feeding trials is either to feed two lots of animals on the rations to be compared and note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same lot ou one ration for a time and then change to another ration . If these tests are made with growing or fattening animals , the increase in live weight is taken as the measure of the relative efficiency of the rations compared . It should be said of these experiments that their apparent verdict is to be accepted with great caution , and definite conclusions are not justified until repeated trials of two rations or of two systems of feeding , made with the use of all possible precautions against error , and under a variety of conditions , give uniform and consistent results in the same direction . // There are several reasons why this is so , the main one being that the increase in the weight of an animal is an uncertain measure of actual growth . Variations in the contents of the alimentary canal due to the irregularity of fecal discharge and to a lack of uniformity in the water drank may cause temporary variations in the live weight of considerable magnitude . Moreover , the nature of the growth of body substance is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by his general appearance . Even if the changes in weight are due to an increase of body tissue , this may be more largely water in one case than in another , so that the real contribution of the food to the dry substance of the body may not be shown . Nor is the character of the solids deposited in the animal discovered by merely weighing him . In fact , by such practical experiments we simply learn that one set of animals has gained more or less pounds of weight than another set , but the why and the how are not explained . Practically the same considerations pertain to feeding tests for milk production . When the milk flow from one ration is larger than from another , we can easily satisfy ourselves as to the comparative yield of milk solids , which is the real test of such production ; but we are not able to decide whether the cow either may not have contributed to the milk secretion from the substance of her own body , or may not have gained in body substance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps , with one ration than with another . Even if these uncertainties did not exist , we have // the still greater disadvantage of not learning by this means why a particular combination of feeds has superior qualities for causing growth or sustaining milk secretion . The mere data showing that an animal ate so many pounds of food and produced so many pounds of beef or milk are important business facts , but they reveal nothing concerning the uses of the several classes of nutrients and of themselves furnish slight basis for developing a rational system of feeding . We must somehow learn the function of protein , carbohydrates and fats in maintaining the various classes of animals and the real effect of varying the source , quantity and relative proportions of these nutrients before we can draw safe general conclusions . CHEMICAL AND PHYSIOLOGICAL STUDIES As preliminary to more comprehensive and convincing methods of investigating feeding problems , there has been going on during many years a necessary study of the compounds which are found in plants and animals . Much has been learned about the ultimate composition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their physical and chemical properties , the compounds into which these bodies break under certain conditions , the chemical changes to which they are subject through certain agencies , and their relation to one another . Investigations along these lines have for years occupied the time of some of our ablest scientists , and , while such researches when they were conducted may have seemed to the extreme // utilitarian to be of little value , we now see how directly they are contributing to human progress and welfare . To the above information has been added through physiological investigations a knowledge of the ways in which the several food compounds are transformed in digestion and in other metabolic changes , the avenues along which these compounds travel , and the ways in which their products of decomposition are discharged from the animal organism . We have learned how to distinguish between the digested and undigested food , have demonstrated that all the nitrogen of the decomposed proteids passes off in the urine , have measured the combustion of the nutrients and have learned how to strike a balance between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is now possible to determine with reasonable accuracy just how much substance is retained or lost from the body of the experimental animal while eating a given ration , and what is the nature of the gain or loss . Very recently means have also been devised for measuring the heat given off by a man or an animal in order to ascertain the actual physiological values of different feeding stuffs . MORE ACCURATE METHODS OF INVESTIGATION In applying the principles and facts of chemistry and physiology , the first advance from the ultra-practical feeding experiment in the direction of an accurate history of what occurs when the animal is eating a // particular ration is the measurement of the digested nutrients and the determination of the gain or loss of nitrogen . This is accomplished , as heretofore stated , by ascertaining the quantity of various compounds eaten and the amount of the same in the feces , the difference being the digested portion . The urine is also collected , and if the nitrogen in it is less or more than that in the digested protein , then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless the measurement is with a milch cow , when the nitrogen in the milk must be taken into account . By an experiment conducted in this way , with careful and continued weighings of the experimental animal , it is possible to secure a probable relation between a unit of digested dry matter and a unit of production . Such a method has been used to determine what is a maintenance ration for animals of several classes , and in those cases where the experiments have been continued for a sufficient length of time and have shown on repetition a reasonable agreement , we are justified in accepting the results as a close approximation to fact . When a ration keeps an animal in nitrogen equilibrium for one or more months and no material gain or loss of weight occurs , we may safely regard it as approximately a maintenance ration under the conditions involved . Experiments of the same kind are equally useful in testing the productive power of various food combinations , and whenever by such continued tests one ration shows no superiority over another , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially important to the farmer 's pocketbook. // RELATION OF FOOD TO PRODUCTION Another class of experiments somewhat more severe in their requirements are those designed to give information as to the relation between the constituents of the food and the growth of the various tissues in the animal body or the formation of milk solids . The experiments conducted by Lawes and Gilbert on the formation of fat with swine may be cited in illustration of the methods used . These were planned so as to learn the amounts of digested protein , carbohydrates and fat consumed by the animal and also the quantities of protein and fat stored in the body during a given period . " In experiment No. 1 , two pigs of the same litter , of almost exactly equal weight , and , so far as could be judged of similar character , were selected . " One was killed at once and its composition determined , and the other was fed for ten weeks on a fattening ration of known composition and then slaughtered and analyzed . The quantity of protein and fat which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as ascertained from the composition and weight of the two pigs was then compared with the food supply of similar compounds . It was assumed that a pound of food fat could produce a pound of body fat and that 51.4 per cent of all the protein not stored in the body as such could be used for fat formation . Even with the most liberal allowances it was found that the protein and fat of the food could not possibly have been the sole source of the new body fat , thus forcing the conclusion that the carbohydrates are fat-formers. // Practically the same plan has been followed in studying the source of milk fat . Several cows were fed on carefully weighed and analyzed rations extremely poor in fat , and the amount and composition of the feces , urine and milk were ascertained during sixty to ninety days . The fat digested from the food and the theoretical fat equivalent of the decomposed protein as measured by the urine nitrogen were charged up against the milk fat , and a large quantity of the latter could be accounted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another method of investigating fat formation has been used with dogs . It is well known that when an animal is deprived of food the expenditure of energy by the body is maintained at the expense of body substance . Both muscular tissues and fatty substance are broken down and used in this way , the latter being regarded as furnishing the most natural and available supply of fuel . It was found in the case of dogs that after a certain number of days of starvation there occurred a sudden and large increase in the waste of nitrogen compounds as shown by the urine excretion , the explanation for this being that the body fat had become exhausted and a demand was at once made upon the proteid tissues for the necessary supply of energy . As soon as this rise of nitrogen waste appeared , then the dog was allowed to eat , and whatever fat was found in the body at the end of the feeding period was regarded as having been formed from the food taken after the starvation period . If , for instance , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become de196 The Feeding of Animals posited in the body , this was regarded as proof of the formation of fat from protein . Such experiments as these have not always been conclusive , although they are regarded by some scientists as having furnished proof that protein may be a source of fat . THE RESPIRATION APPARATUS After all , the investigations of the kinds described fail to furnish data so accurate and so complete as are necessary for entirely safe conclusions . In every instance , one or more assumptions are involved where definite proof is not furnished . Nothing short of a complete record of the income and outgo of the animal organism during the experimental period is conclusive evidence as to whether there has been a gain or loss of body substance and what is the kind and extent of the growth or waste . The securing of such a record is an expensive and laborious task . It requires not only complete information in regard to the quantity and composition of the food , but also an accurate measurement of the excreta , including the feces , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off through the skin . Such measurements are taken by means of a respiration apparatus , a costly and complicated mechanism , a detailed description of which would be of little use to most readers . It is sufficient to state that this apparatus makes possible the collection and analysis of all the excretory products , whether solid or gaseous . The experimental man or animal lives in a closed chamber into which is introInvestigation // duced food and fresh air and from which is pumped the vitiated air , the water and carbon dioxide of which are absorbed and weighed . All conclusions drawn from experiments with the respiration apparatus are based largely upon the income and outgo of nitrogen and carbon . As carbon is a constituent of all possible compounds of the animal body except the mineral , it is certain that when the body gains in carbon it gains in organic substance of some kind , and if it loses in carbon there is a waste of organic body substance . The general character of the gain or loss can be determined by the nitrogen balance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than is given off , it is clear that the nitrogen compounds of the body have received an accession . Knowing as we do the proportions of nitrogen and carbon in the various tissues of the animal , we can calculate how much of the gain or loss of carbon belongs in the nitrogenous substance deposited or wasted . If more carbon is gained or lost than can possibly be associated with the nitrogen gained or lost , then there has been a gain or loss of fat , because protein and fat being the main constituents of the animal carcass , any considerable retention of carbon must be in one of these forms . If there has been nitrogen equilibrium , all excess or deficit of carbon belongs to a deposit or waste of fat . By such searching methods as these , it is possible to ascertain with a good degree of accuracy how food is used and what quantity and kind of nutrients are needed in maintaining an animal under given conditions . // DETERMINATION OF ENERGY VALUES We have reached a point in our study of animal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extent commensurable with energy values and that it is desirable to know the energy product of different compounds and feeding stuffs . Moreover , we can not possess sufficiently full knowledge concerning the energy needs of the several classes of animals until we have measured energy consumption under the various conditions of work and of production . The mere determination of the income and outgo of the animal body does not necessarily measure energy needs or use . We may go so far as to ascertain that a certain amount of carbon from a certain source was consumed in a given time , but from this alone we do not learn the extent to which this combustion has supported the internal and external work of the body . Calculation of the energy value of a ration. ? Three methods may be adopted for determining the energy expenditure by an animal eating a given ration . The one of these most easily carried out is largely a matter of mathematical calculation . By the use of average digestion coefficients it is possible to ascertain approximately the amounts of digestible protein , carbohydrates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a desired result . We know from previous determinations what are the calorific values of individual compounds such as albumin , starch , sugar , stearin and olein , and these compounds are assumed to represent the energy value of the // classes of nutrients to which they belong . If , then , we multiply the calculated quantities of digestible protein , carbohydrates and fats by their respective assumed energy factors , we get a number which may be taken as an expression of the available energy of the ration under consideration . This method can not be regarded as entirely accurate , because the calorific value for protein may not be the same as that for any single albuminoid , and the heat units of the nitrogen-free extract are likely to vary materially from those found for the starches and sugars , while the ether extract is very far from representing the pure fats . At the same time , it is possible in this way to learn the energy value of a ration closely enough , perhaps , for all practical purposes . Energy value of digested nutrients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step in the direction of greater accuracy , is to determine by the use of a calorimeter the heat units of the ration and also of the urine and feces . The differences between the food heat units and those found for the excreta are assumed to represent the energy value of that portion of the ration appropriated by the animal . Provided the heat units obtained in calorimeter combustion and physiological combustion are equivalent , this method must be considered as furnishing a reliable energy measurement . However probable this equivalence may seem , it has not been fully demonstrated . We still need more complete experimental proof that the oxidation of the several food compounds in ordinary combustion and in the animal produces identical re-
