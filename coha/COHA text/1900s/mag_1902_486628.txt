Crawford are requested to communicate with Ulrich B Phillips , University of Wisconsin , Madison , Wis The letters of Crawford to G. W. Erving and to John Randolph of Roanoke are particularly desired . The Johns Hopkins Press invites subscriptions to a reprint of four notable economic tracts of the nineteenth century , among those , of great importance in the development of economic thought , which have long been inaccessible to students . Publication will begin in January , 1903 , under the direction of Prof. J. H. Hollander . Ricardo 's three letters on the Price of Gold ( 1809 ) , Malthus 's inquiry into the Nature of Rent ( 1815 ) , Sir E. West 's essay on the Application of Capital to Land ( 1815 ) , and Longe 's refutation of Mill and Fawcett 's Wage-Fund Theory ( 1866 ) . Each tract will have an introduction and ( if necessary ) annotations by the editor . Subscription to the series has been fixed at one dollar , the edition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ series for the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries will be undertaken under the same auspices . The edition of ' Academic Honors in Princeton University , 1748-1902 , ' to issue next week from the press and to present a list of salutatorians , valedictorians , honor-men , etc. , since the founding of the College , in both the academic and the scientific departments , will be limited to 500 copies . This is the first complete list of the kind undertaken by any university . The volume may be had of C. W. McAlpin , Secretary of the University The Bodleian Society , No. 92 Fifth Avenue , New York , are about to bring out a " Classic Library ' of Famous Literatures " in twenty crown octavo volumes , edited by Frederick B. De Berard , with a general introduction by Dr. Rossiter Johnson . By " Literature " in this title is meant Tales . Photogravure illustrations , and indexes , are promised .

The ever-recurring English classics mark the advent of the gift season . Macmillan 's edition of the ' Vicar of Wakefield , ' with Austin Dobson 's brief preface and Hugh Thomson 's agreeable illustrations , is revived in smaller and cheaper form , retaining all the substance of the original . The ' Essays of Richard Steele , ' selected and edited by a namesake , L E. Steele , M.A. of Trinity College , Dublin , swells acceptably the little Golden Treasury Series ( Macmillan ) . The editor traces Steele 's life with the aid of recent information to offset Macaulay 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He remarks that there is not a trace in Steele 's writings " of what it is nowadays the fashion to call the Celtic spirit ; nor , indeed , in those of any of the Irishmen who have taken a high place in the bead-roll of the great English writers . It would seem as if it were not to be in the land of its birth that Irish genius was to find inspiration " The reader is sure to be propitiated by the sympathetic and graceful introduction . A larger page is devoted ? to the selected ' Poems by Percy Bysshe Shelley ' ( London : Bell ; New York . Macmillan ) , to which Walter Raleigh furnishes an introduction , thus referred to in a curious note regarding the decorative drawings by Robert Anning Bell ? " If they be found superfluous or irrelevant , they must share that condemnation with the preface . " The fore-matter is , In fact , rather perfunctory and none too illuminating .

It has no notes or other apparatus than that mentioned . It is a real service to reprint the late Clarence King 's ' Mountaineering in the Sierra Nevada ' as Messrs Scribner have just done . Originally published in 1871 , its extraordinary merit as . narrative gave it a fourth edition in three years . It has since gone out of the trade We reopen the book almost by chance at that well-remembered page of " Cut-off Copples 's , " in which the blond " Pike " moves a stalled team of twelve mules by judicious swearing without the use of the lash , and modestly disclaims all credit for distinction in this branch of the humanities . " You 'd jest orter hear Pete Green . He can exhort the impenitent mule . " This is Mr. King 's humorous vein .

There are-few better books to read aloud Books on musical topics are less abundant than usual at this time of the year . Useful as a gift book is a new edition , in two volumes , of Nathan Haskell Dole 's ' Famous Composers ' ( New York : T. Y. Crowell &; Co . ) . It is not intended for students of music so much as for amateurs who are anxious to familiarize themselves with the principal events in the lives of twenty composers , described in a gossipy style . The third volume of the ' Oxford History of Music , ' written by Hubert Parry and devoted to the music of the seventeenth century ( Clarendon Press ) , will be noticed more fully hereafter . A translation , from the Italian , apparently , of Dr. Alfredo Untersteiner 's ' History of Music ' is supplied by Dodd , Mead &; Co . The author quaintly declares in the preface that " those who know that I have lived in foreign lands , almost from earliest youth , will not expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facts , however , in clear language , and increases the usefulness of his book for students by means of bibliographic lists appended to each of the twenty-three chapters . In his judgments he is impartial . For music students , especially those who wish to compose , is intended ' Counterpoint Applied , ' by Percy Goetschius ( G. Schirmer ) . It treats of the invention-forms , choral-figuration , fugue , and canon . A good book on the life and works of Mozart in the English language has long been a desideratum , and it has been supplied at last by Eustace J. Breakspeare ( E. P. Dutton &; Co . ) . While sometimes undiscriminating in his criticisms , this author does not go to such lengths of adulation as Jahn , and he otherwise improves on that ' ponderous and voluminous German . Mozart 's operas are analyzed in detail . The piano concertos are less satisfactorily treated than they are by Parry in his article on Concertos in Grove 's ' Dictionary of Music and Musicians .

" With a Shakespearian indifference to their fate , they remained ( for varying whiles ) in the hands of those to whom originally sent . This , alone , reveals the state of the music-publishing world in 1791 . Fancy a Sullivan , or a Tosti , doing the like nowadays ! " Mr. Winthrop L. Marvin treats with somewhat incoherent enthusiasm of the maritime interests of this country , under the title ' The American Merchant Marine ' ( Charles Scribner 's Sons ) . He makes it clear that the shipping of the colonies increased wonderfully in spite of the restrictive laws of the mother country , and then proceeds to contend that , after the Revolution , bounties and protective duties were necessary for the preservation of our marine . He insists that a powerful navy is essential for the protection of our commerce , and proves that it throve immensely when we had almost no war-ships . He clinches the argument by showing that our privateers constituted by far the most efficient part of our naval force when we actually engaged in war . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for lack of subsidies , and , of course , winding up with a demand for the payment of bounties . The fallacy of these views was thoroughly exposed by Mr. D. A. Wells , and it would be idle to repeat his facts . When Mr. Marvin forgets his protectionism , he writes entertainingly of ships and their voyages , but his material is taken largely from other works on these subjects which are not likely to be superseded by his own . Several addresses by Mr. Henry Cabot Lodge are reprinted in a volume entitled ' A Fighting Frigate , ' published by Charles Scribner 's Sons . The ' Fighting Frigate ' is , of course , the Constitution , and it is needless to say that Mr. Lodge discourses of her career with martial ardor . The other addresses are on John Marshall , Oliver Ellsworth . Rochambeau , Daniel Webster , and three of the recent Governors of Massachusetts . The essay entitled " Some Impressions of Russia " is adapted to correct many of the vague notions prevalent concerning the economic condition of that empire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's ' Daniel Webster ' ( The Century Co. ) adds much to our knowledge of the character of that statesman Indeed , we fear that readers whose information was derived exclusively from this book would fail to understand a very critical period and a very instructive career . But the account of Webster 's life in its most conspicuous incidents is readable , and the impartial , not to say unsympathetic , attitude of the author is favorable to the formation of an unbiassed judgment by the reader . No attempt is made to criticise Webster 's speeches from a literary point of view , and his public activity is represented rather as that of a politician than of a statesman . The little volume , ' In City Tents , ' by Christine Terhune Herrick ( G. P. Putnam 's Sons ) , holds a deal of wisdom ready for the using by young couples about to go to housekeeping in New York . " The City Tent " is the small flat , and " in city tents , " observes the writer , " every one lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Her pages are full of excellent practical counsel for the young home-makers , from the time they begin to look for their flat till they are ready to give little dinners and modest after-theatre suppers In the matter of summer Sunday outings , the book comes near to being a suburban guide , and a good one Touching food and clothes , it gives sound advice as to the principles of eating and dressing without too closely touching on the receipt-book or the fashion magazine . It is an unpretending manual for unpretending young persons whose lines are cast in narrow spaces . Its matter is sensible , its manner kindly , genial , twaddle-free , its views sane , hopeful , and conciliatory , treating the janitor and the husband as men and brethren . The dictionary arrangement of ' Harper 's Cook Book Encyclopmdia ' will commend itself to all who resort to it . Classification of breads , cakes , fish , gravies , puddings , sausages , etc. , under this scheme goes hand in hand with abundant cross-references . The only fault we have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main alphabet and the sub-rubrics are not distinguished typographically . " Frog 's Legs , Grilled , " for example , is in the same letter as " Fruits in Blanc-mange Border , " the first following entry under " Fruits . " The recipes are very numerous , and some not easy to find in cook books are here given . General remarks on the art of cooking precede the dictionary , and the inside covers contain " the cook 's time-table , " and weights and measures . Sixteen photographic illustrations display the set table or various articles of food as cooked and served . In revising his ' First Manual of Composition ' ( Macmillan ) Prof Edwin H. Lewis has profited by experience and virtually recast the whole One novelty , in the punctuation section , is the introduction of forty typical sentences to be learned by heart .

From the same firm we are glad to greet a reissue of the late Jane Andrews 's ' Seven Little Sisters , ' a series of girl pictures from all over the world that might be regarded as a development of the opening chapter of Judd 's ' Margaret . ' ' Colonial Children ' is the theme of the first of the " Source Readers in American History , " selected and annotated by Prof. Albert Bushnell Hart , with collaboration ( Macmillan ) .

The second volume in the above series , Mabel Hill replacing Blanche E. Hazard as Professor Hart 's helper , deals with ' Camps and Firesides of the Revolution , ' and gives us - dutiful seven-year-old John Quincy Adams 's letter to his father , in 1774 ; something from the Journal of Mme.

We regret to observe that none of these miscellanies has an index , while the table of contents is very meagre The October issue of the Essex Institute Historical Collections is noticeable for a bringing together of authorities regarding " The Affair at the North Bridge , Salem ( Mass ) , February 26 , 1775 " ? an early discomfiture of the King 's troops , about which much has been written by local antiquaries . The article is accompanied by a print of Bridgman 's painting of the historic scene , and by portraits of participants or witflosses to the incident , from Timothy Pickering to Capt Richard Derby . - Among the historical manuscripts published in the November Bulletin of the Boston Public Library is a letter of Gen. Henry Knox , written in 1777 , in which he declares that he is " siirpriz 'd and shock 'd at the supiness shown by the New England States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He is " much diverted , " however , " at the ridiculous exhibition of the Boston ? money makers on the suppos 'd appearance of the enemy in the Bay . " There is an interesting confession of a man who " raised " bills of credit in 1776 , showing the prevalence of the crime in Massachusetts and the lack of appreciation of its dishonesty . Nathaniel Appleton , writing from Boston in 1778 , says in reference to the coming of a British agent , " oh the pittyfull shifts they are put to send over an half begotten illbegotten Hemorphridite which is neither male or female Dependant or Independent not yet born , yet sent across the Atlantic to accomplish more than 60,000 men could do , Oh ! strange .

In ' Stories of Charle'magne and the Twelve Peers of France ' ( Macmillan ) lie leaves the classical period and moves forward to the Middle Ages . Most of the legends which are here recast for popular use come from the chansons ; but one of them at least , the story of Ralph the Collier , seems to be unknown in aFrench version , The Early English Text Society has recently published the Charlemagne romances as they were translated by Caxton and Lord Benders , but , on the whole , the Carolingian cycle is much less familiar to the generality of English readers than is the cycle of the Niebelungen Lied . To the historian the vagaries of folklore are almost as entertaining as they are instructive . In the case of Charlemagne the distortion of fact is less glaring than in that of Attila , but it is still considerable . On the whole , legend tends to abase the great emperor rather than to exalt him Such touches as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ christens Olaf 's son Magnus , after King Karl Magnus , " the best man in the world , " are rare Usually Roland and the peers are the true heroes , while Charlemagne is somewhat belittled by their prominence . Mr. Church recalls the analogy of Agamemnon and Achilles , which is quite to the point . " The real Charlemagne , " he adds , " was a very great personality , one that impressed his age as deeply as any man has ever done , in these stories he often appears petty , capricious , and obstinate ! ' The tales in Mr. Church 's collection present a large number of the cavaliers who figure most prominently in the chansons of the twelfth century ? Roland , Oliver , Fierabras , Turpin , the crafty Mangle , and GeneIon the traitor . For the sake of Shakspere we must also be glad that Huon of Bordeaux is included among the foregoing worthies , all of whom are some what better known than himself .

The last volumes issued by the Selden Society , Volume XIII . for 1899 , the appearance of which was much delayed , and Volume XV . for 1901 , deal with two obscure departments of the English law of the thirteenth century , the peculiar laws applicable under the Angevin kings and their successors to the forests and to the Jews . ' Select Pleas of the Forest ' are extracts from the proceedings of the Justices of the Forest in their " eyres , " or circuits , through the forest counties of England . Their editor , Mr. G. J. Turner , shows that the forest eyre , far from being purely an instrument of tyranny , was a part of the financial machinery of government , and was chiefly concerned with protecting the forests and raising revenue in the shape of fines . He gives a valuable introduction , describing the various forest officers and their functions . In an appendix he supplies a very learned glossary , in which the rich meth. - sevai vocabulary of forest terms is admirably explained . ?

This is a selection of extracts from the records of the Exchequer of the Jews between 1201 and 1290 , namely , from the time of the Jewish Charter of Liberties granted by King John down to the expulsion of the Jews under Edward I. An excellent introduction by the editor describes the various persecutions  --  fiscal by the Crown and physical by the people  --  from which the Jewish community suffered . Indeed , considering the smallness of that community ( about 18,000 in 1290 ) , the fact that they had a monopoly of the moneylending business , and the fact that the legal rate of interest seems to have been 43 per cent . per annum , it is no wonder that they were both hated and persecuted . The anti-Semitism of the present day has far less excuse . The Justices of the Jews , of whose proceedings full specimens are here given , were an outgrowth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that court in dealing with cases affecting these most valuable chattels of the Crown . Considering how little original work has been devoted to the mediaeval history of the English Jews , and how copious are the sources , Mr. Rigg might have done well to illustrate his points by reference to othei. authorities . Prynne 's ' Demurrer ' of 1656 , the pioneer work on the subject , and Mr. Joseph Jacobs 's very learned little book on the ' Jews of Angevin England , ' make one feel that Mr. Rigg has hardly done justice to his material . ? The botanical collections obtained by the Hopkins-Stanford Expedition to the Galapagos Islands on the western coast of South America , were referred to the Gray Herbarium of Harvard University for determination . In the important paper printed in the Proceedings of the American Academy for October , Dr. B. L. Robinson presents the results of careful studies by himself and certain associates , here and abroad , in regard to the peculiar vegetation of this interesting group of islands . In Mr. DarWin 's Life ( I , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study of the peculiarities of the flora of the Galapagos Islands which was " especially the origin of all my views . " With the comparatively rich material now available , in addition to Darwin 's some two hundred plants , Dr. Robinson set himself about the task of ascertaining " ( 1 ) in how far the vegetation of the archipelago is really peculiar , ( 2 ) to what other floras it is most nearly related , and ( 3 ) the complicated affinities existing between the florulae of the different islands . " Besides these interesting questions , he desired to throw new light on the origin of the islands themselves . Concerning the points just enumerated , Dr. Robinson says " While it is thus clear that the Galapagelan flora is only an outlying portion of the American flora with a strong specific differentiation , it is impossible to trace its relationship closely to any one section of the Pacific American vegetation It can only be said in a general way that nearly all the plants of the archipelago are identical with , or obviously related to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pacific Slope , between Lower California on the one hand , and northern Chili on the other " ? Two views have been held regarding the origin of these islands. - The first regards the group as having been raised by volcanic action , and the following facts are urged in support of the suggestion : " ( 1 . ) All parts of the islands now visible are obviously of volcanic origin ( 2 ) The islands are separated from the mainland by a very considerable depth of ocean ( more than 1,500 fathoms ) . ( 3 ) The western coast of South America shows no sign of subsidence , but rather of marked elevation in recent geologic time " Under this view , the clothing of the islands by vegetation has come from seeds , etc. , brought thither by winds , currents , and birds of passage . The second view considers the islands as having resulted from the subsidence of intervening land , and hence as being continental islands , or , as one may say , the tops of mountains once a portion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the curious relations which exist between the plants of the different islands , was led to adopt the theory of subsidence as more satisfactory than that of elevation . Concerning these noteworthy relations Dr. Robinson presents very interesting statements , which , however , are too long for transcription here . He treats the subject with an impartial hand . and finally arrives at the conclusion that " the botanical evidence , so far as it has yet been made out , is ' opposed rather than favorable to the subsidence theory "
