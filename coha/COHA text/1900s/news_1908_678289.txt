txt Coming slowly into port through the thick fog about 8:30 o'clock yesterday morning the big White Star freighter Georgic , from Liverpool , ran down and Sank the Panama Railroad Company 's steamer Finance , outward bound for Cristobal , in the Canal Zone . The vessels came together in the main ship channel , about three miles east of the Sandy Hook Lightship . Fifteen minutes after the bow of the Georgic had torn a great hole in the side of the Panama steamer she was lying on the bottom of the channel , with only a part of her bridge , smokestack , and masts showing iibove water . Three passengers and one of the ship 's ! assistant engineers were drowned . They kvere : IRENE CAMPBELL . a 14-year-old colored girl . living near Cristobal .

The accident was due wholly to the fog . It happened just when the curtain of mist was being dispelled and the fog-bound steamers were beginning to move , either for the open sea or for their city piers . The Georgic. towering high above the Panama liner , caught her fairly amidships on the port side , her great bows cutting Into the Finance like a knife into cheese . The freighter fell away after it was over with only a dent in her great steel cutcrater as a result of the crash . As quickly as possible Capt . Clarke of the Georgic trooped his anchors and the lifeboats from the White Star liner were in the water almost as soon as those from the Finance . The work of rescue was accomplished with remarkable expedition , which spoke well for discipline and boat drill on both liners .

Those who wished to land were brought ashore , but most of the pasVengers stayed on the steamer . Finance Held Up by Fog . The Finance sailed from her pier for iCristobal on Monday afternoon . She did tot get much beyond Quarantine . as Capt . Mowbray was forced to anchor because of the fog that shut off the channel to the open sea . Three different times , when there was a rift in the fog . the Finance ventured a little further on her way out . The Georgic. making her first trip here since the White Star Line temporarily discontinued its Liverpool-New York freight service , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the fog . The Finance had worked her way to the vicinity of Sandy Hook , and there she lay yesterday morning in a fog so thick that nothing could be seen beyond the bowsprit . She was surrounded by a eontinuous volley of fog horns , the discordant . blasts of the whistles trying the nerves of her passengers and crew . About 7:25 o'clock , as the fog began to ! thin , Capt . Mowbray ordered the anchor weighed , and the ship started ahead at a quarter speed sounding her whistle continuously . As the mist parted she passed one or two vessels , dimly outlined through the fog and then , just when those of the passengers on deck figured that they bad left the maze of shipping behind the giant bow of the Georgic , magnified by the mist , loomed from out the dull gray walL There was an exchange of sharp blasts from the whistles on both ships , tnd then the Georgic drove into the side of the Finance .

A. moment later the rattle of her anchor chains told the officers on the Finance that the Georgic had anchored .

A few of her passengers were on deck at the time . // LINER SUNK IN FOR , 4 PERSONS DROWN Confiniiimi from Page I.

Mowbray and tins. , on the bridge ki1C  --  VI. , from the first the Finance was doomed . There was a quick order to the crew , and the men sprang lo the boats . The sailors were rapidly putting them over the side , when from the hold came oilers , engineers , firemen , and stokers , climbing pell-mell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vessel . Scene When the Crash Came . The Finance had listed so that walking her decks was difficult , and the work of launching the boats dangerous . The passengers came running from every part of the vessel , many in their nightclothes , and some with children in their arms . To add to the confusion there came from within the hull a dull boom as the ammonia tank exploded in the forward hold . Then the men ran on deck who had stuck to their posts in the engine room with those who had gone down to investigate the damage done With them came Todd . the third engineer . He was partly overcome by the ammonia fumes , and staggered to the rail . He steadied himself there for a second and then jumped overboard . He was not seen again . Some of the coolest among the passengers procured life preservers and fastened them on . But others , men and women , not waiting , jumped overboard . When the first rush to the deck began Capt . Mowbray disappeared for a second , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a revolver in his hand . " Now , men , " he shouted , meeting the rush from below , " there is going to be no crowding , and the women and children are going to take the boats first . " Captain Drew His Revolver . The revolver was not put to use , for the men for the most part behaved well . Discipline was maintained . and this with the intelligent work of the sailors from the Georgic did much to avert loss of life . As the Finance began to sink she took a heavy list to port , and those left on board had to climb along the slanting upper deck until a boat came along the starboard side . They would then slide down the slanting side of the ship to the water , where they were caught by those In the boat . A woman jumped overboard with her baby in her arms , but a boat was near by , and she was picked up . Another woman threw her five-year-old child from a porthole into a boat . Fortunately , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so were able to keep afloat . Only once , when the Finance appeared to be about to make her final plunge , a few of the crew jumped into a boat just lowered . Capt . Mowbray saw them . " Get out of that , you men , " he shouted . They appeared not to hear . " Get out of that boat , " he said , and this time he pointed his revolver at them . They got out and clambered back to the deck . Women and children took their places . Four boats and two rafts were put over the side of the sinking Finance . The last boat was broken in launching it . From the Georgic a number of boats were lowered and the men rowed about picking the Finance 's passengers from the water .

She hung on with the strength of hysteria and when the water came up to the deck they were forced to leave her while they saved others . Statement by Georgia 's Captain . " Had the Finance kept going ahead there would have been no collision , " said Capt . W. H. M. B. Clarke , the commander of the White Star freighter Georgic , last night as , with Pilot E. P. Nichols , Freight Manager Ridgeway , and Port Captain Smith of the White Star Line , he sat in his quartet% on his ship . " The fog was very thick . It lifted and I started ahead . Suddenly there loomed up in front of me ? not more than a few hundred feet away ? the form of a vessel . I whistled sharply one blast . The other vessel responded . and then started astern . Had she kept ahead she would have passed us . When I saw the situation I rang to atop . But We drifted ahead and the collision occurred . Under the circumstances it could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Finance I ordered my boats lowered . Within one and a half minutes I had the first boat in the water . It was in charge of First Officer Albert Edward Taylor . and took out of the water ten men . Why those men jumped overboard I can not understand . When we struck the Finance she began to settle slowly . There was absolutely no cause for a panic , and it was simply nonsense for the passengers to go overboard . " The first persons seen In the water by our boat crews were several of the Finance 's firemen , with life belts around Them . They were taken on board the boats the same as the passengers . We got them to the Georgic as soon as possible , wrapped them in blankets , and did everything possible for them . Our boats took off 164 men , women , and children from the Finance and from the water . " We had five boats out from the Georgic  --  all in charge of officers  --  and we saved every life that it was possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passengers of the Finance to jump overboard . " The collision , according to all reports , was not the fault of the officers . The first news of the disaster came from the marine observer at Sandy Hook . Through a lift in the fog he made out the sinking Finance , with the Georgic standing by . Word was sent to the Sandy Hook life savers , and they went out to the Finance . The Merritt &; Chapman wrecking boat was also sent down the bay . Most of the Finance 's passengers were transferred to the Alliance , of the Panama Line . but several came ashore , and the trying experience they had been through was shown from their appearance as they climbed up the Panama pier in the dusk last evening . Many wore strange assortments of clothing ; shoes that were not mates , caps that belonged to stokers , and shoes of all sorts , sizes , and shapes . John Schanzenbecker , the mail clerk on the Finance , brought ashore three sacks of mail , all that were saved of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took the last boat away from the Finance , and he saved the sacks at great personal risk . Stories of the Passengers . " We had been anchored in such a confusion of whistles that we were getting used to it , " said M. C. Azima of Alexandria , Va. , a passenger on the Finance . " I understood that our pilot was making his last trip before retirement after forty years of service . I was on deck when the Georgic ran us down . Capt . Mowbray saw the other vessel coming on . and lie shouted , ' Put your helm over . You are going to strike us . ' And then she did . The Captain pulled a gun when the boats were being lowered , and said that the women and children were to go first . " A thrilling story was told by Mrs. Minnie Strothotte , who with her 7-year-old son was on her way to Valparaiso . She was in bed when the shock came . Her room was on the starboard side of the Finance . She said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mamma , the ship is moving again . " Then etime the crash . Mrs. Strothotte ran into the saloon to find the floor flooded with water and everybody hurrying on deck . A Mr. Whitman put a life preserver on her . " I took up my ' boy and ran to the side , intending to jump into the water , " she said , " when some one grabbed me and pulled me back . I can not describe my feelings while the life raft was being lowered . I could feel the vessel settling under us . Finally the raft was ready , and I got on it .. There were other passengers clinging on it ? one a woman with her thirteen months ' old child in her arms .

" Following the listing of the steamer I ran on deck with the baby in my arms and my wife following me . We found the passengers gathering there and the men getting the boats over the side . I worked my way forward along the , deck , clinging with one hand to the rail , and with my wife holding to me . I got pretty well forward , and was waiting , with one arm about some rigging , for the boats to come . The Finance had sunk low in the , water , . and where we stood the deck- was almost awash . A wave broke . Sielit the side a the deckhouse , , and the wash - nearly carried me overboard . Go to the stern ! ' some one ' Shouted , and I worked my way aft again .

When we got to the stern I found a boat there , and we were taken on board . " " I shall not soon forget this day , " said John S. Steward of ** Avenue , who was on his ly to Iquique . Mr. Steward was one of tl e first to bring up life Preservers and blankets and hand them to the women and children . Then he jumped overboard and was picked up . " Muller , who was drowned , was near me , " Mr. Steward continued . " He appeared to me to be in distress , though he could evidently swim . I shouted to him to grab a chair that was drifting near him . He did sao , ebrut. for some reason Iet it go a minute ft Woman Nurse Saves Her Friend . Miss R. G.

This she succeeded in doing , not believing that she would be able to reach the deck herself . She managed , however , to struggle up the companionway , just as Miss Minnie Mahoney , her sister , who occupied an adjoining cabin with some of the children , got them to the deck . Fear of suction as the ship sank caused the women to drop the children overboard near boats which picked them up . Then saved , e'd.both jumped themselves and were aN Mrs. Ira Talbot of Chicago was the woman who jumped overboard with her 14-month-old son in her arms . She reached the upper deck from her stateroom , stumbled and fell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her feet and jumped overboard . She was unconscious when picked up by a White Star boat . When restored to consciousness her first words were an inquiry about the baby . When told that it was saved she fainted again , and when revived wept for joy . A narrow escape from death was that of Mrs. Hattie Schwartzbergh of Lumbertown , S. C. , who was going to ' Panama to join her husband . They were married in September , and the young woman lost all her wedding presents . Like other passengers , Mrs. Schwartzbergh jumped overboard . As she was drifting away and making frantic efforts to keep afloat she grabbed George H. Simmons of Detroit . Simmons was holding up Miss Bertha Gebhart . In her excitement Mrs. Schwartzbergh caught him about the neck , and the three were in danger of sinking , . when Simmons cried out for her to cling to him by his life belt . This she did , and the man kept both women afloat until one was rescued by C. B. Jennings , a freight clerk . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pistol to make them leave a boat was told by J. E. Goldman , a Government Inspector of Commissary in the Canal Zone . " I saw half a dozen coal passers jump into one of the boats , " said Mr. Goldman . " I think It was the second . Then I saw the Captain draw his revolver and point it at the men . I did n't hear what he said , but one of the other passengers told me later that he had heard the Captain yell , ' Get out of there ; women and children first . ' As a matter of fact the women and children , I believe , had all got off in the first boat , but any way those coal passers jumped back to the Finance and went off again later after the passengers .

" When the Georgic reached her pier at the foot of Christopher Street , about 6:30 o'clock , the longshoremen on the pier were startled to hear a terrific racket coming from the ship . Investigation showed the disturbance came from four performing elephants consigned to the Hippodrome . In the time they were marooned down the bay , the four elephants trumpeted so loudly and showed themselves to be so nervous as to cause great anxiety to their mahouts and the crew of the Georgic . The moment they felt the vessel grate against the end of the pier they seemed to recognize that they were safe from fog and storm . Passengers on the Finance . The passengers on the Finance were : J.

A mistake that in Many respects rivals that made by Little Buttercup in the operetta of " Pinafore " was brought to light yesterday by the sinking of the Finance . Among tge children picked , up by the Georgic after the collision is one who was being deported to Colon as the daughter of an insane man , while the little girl who should have been sent Is at the Roman Catholic Orphan Asylum . Nine-year-old Pepita Etommomou had been given to the immigration authorities by the Sisters of Mercy who have charge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in place of Blanche Matara , the eight-yearold child of Tony MataM , who was adjudges insane and unfit for citizenship . He was shipped out of the country , together with his six-year-old son and the little girl who was supposed- to be his daughter . Had the Finance not been wrecked Pepita would now be en route to the Canal Zone In the care of an insane man . The confusion is due to a mistake in identity by one of the sisters at the orphan asylum and the simplicity of the little girl , Pepita . She readily answered all . the questions put to her by the matron , who represented the Immigration Bureau , and was placed on board of Abe Finance , bound for the ' Canal Zone on Monday . The delay in sailing due to the fog impelled the officers of the asylum and the Immigration Inspectors to try to get the girl off the ship , but the haze that held up the ship also hid it ' from the view . of the searchers . - The real - daughter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year ago with her 6-year-old brother . Matara had been a laborer on the canal : but a breakdown in his health compelled him to leave Colon . When lid arrived-here he explained the circumstances to the Inspectors , and they permitted him to place his two children in the Orphan Asylum until he was able to provide a home . The children were.placed in What is known as the Alien Group at the asylum . The youngsters thus known are those who are subject to deportation by the immigration authorities if convinced that the parents are not worthy of citizenship . Among the little girls in the Alien Group of the girls ' department was Pepita Etommomou , daughter of a Cuban who arrived in the country about the same time as Matara . The two children became inseparable , because they were about the same age . They spoke the same language and had many interests in common . The teachers were ' often puzzled to distinguish them from each other , because they both possessed the dark eyes and jet black hair of the Spaniards and v ere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prey upon him and . finally affected his reason . Ile was taken to Bellevue a short time ago so that his mental condition might be inquired into . The authorities reported that his condition was serious , and the immigration officers decided to deport him . The son was taken to the Barge Office on Sunday and placed on board the Finance , On Monday afternoon a matron of the Bureau went to the asylum for the girl . She presented the name of Blanche Matara , and Sister Clotilde went to bring the child . In the playground she saw a group of little girls and called the name of Blanche . Matara 's daughter was not among them at the time , but her chum responded and was delivered by the sister . When the boat pulled out the mistake was discovered by Matara 's son Antonio , but it was impossible to return with the child . The wireless operator , who kept the office of the steamship company informed of the vessel 's whereabouts , also notified his office of the error . With an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers of the asylum , the tugboat Eugene F./Moran. started out on Wednesday night about . 6 o'clock . They scoured the bay for hours . but could not find the Finance . When the collision occurred , Matara , and his son , as well as the little girl whd had been taken by mistake , were picked up by the Georgic and taken In charge by the immigration authorities . WRECKED SHIP REJECTED AID . Most of the Passengers Off When the Orinoco Came Along . Capt . C. P. Langmaid and the pas- I sengers on the Royal Mail Steam Packet Orinoco , which arrived yesterday from the West Indies and Panama . had a close view of the wrecked liner Finance as they came up the bay . The Captain , through his glasses , saw that the passengers were being landed in lifeboats from the Finance . He sang out to Chief Officer Eccleston , who was standing in the bows of the Orinoco , to hail the officers in the pilot house of the wrecked liner , to see if they needed any more boats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the majority of the passengers had left the ship , and there were three more , lifeboats alongside her ready to take off those who were gathered in the pilot I house , Capt . Langmaid 's offer of aid was not accepted . When the Orinoco arrived at her pier 1 Capt . Langmaid said that the gathering of the great merchant fleet of twenty-two ocean liners at anchor off Sandy Hook yesterday morning was the finest sight he had ever seen . The steamships steamed up the harbor toward New York in single column , and they were met by another column of vessels going out that had also ? been detained by the fog , with the Cunarder Lusitanta bringing up the rear .
