The Governor had supper in the Neighborhood House at 267 East 104th Streets , . in the centre of " Little Italy . " The street swarms with children , and there are almst the some cramped conditions fib Obtain in Elizabeth and Mulberry Streets . After supper the Governor went to the museum , and while the meeting of the sociologists was on he studied the exhibit on view there , snowing what New York has to struggle with . One of the exhibits was an Wears dress . It was tagged with a label COplaining that the maker got 6 cents e. dozen for the garments , and that the wag. averaged 3 cents an hour . There was also a baby 's christening robe . embroletered , which brought the east side worker 12% cents and sold for nearly $5 . There were models showing the streets , buildings , and interiors of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sections of the city , and photographs of the tenement house dwellers and their children busy at the work of providing the sweatshop contractors with material . " It is , from one point of view , the saddest sight , and from another point of view , the most encouraging sight , that it has been my duty of late to see , " said the Governor , addressing the large audience assembled to hear him after his view of the exhibit . " ? .. I must say that I come to you oppressed and depressed by the facts that this exhibit makes so clear and that is so eloquent of the wretchedness and rniery which are incident to our progress . A : yet , on the other hand , it Is most eia , , nraging that this exhibit has been brought together . It is another testimonial to the splendid quality of our citizenship which is represented In those who turn aside from the cares of every-day life to thoughtfully consider the needs of the community .

Mistake Often Made . " The best intelligence of the people is directed to those ends , " he said , and he makes a great mistake who looks upon American life and sees nothing but the chase of the Almighty Dollar , knows nothing but the exhibition of love of display and selfish gratification sees nothing but selfishness and cynicism . That is not ** life . American life is represented in an honest , sincere effort to make the best of one 's self , and to help one 's neighbor , and there never was a time when the true spirit of our democracy was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are great problems present for solution in the Nation and in the State , but you will have to have a pretty big one on your heart if you can match this one that is shown in that exhibit . It is discouraging . because you hardly know what remedy ca be suggested . " I do t know whether these distinguishe ladies and gentlemen who have given so much thought to these problems have remedies to propose , but I feel sure of one thing  --  that in some way or another these conditions will be remedied because 1 they are intolerable . They can not last . I " What does congestion mean , congestion of the sort that we see depicted se clearly ? We are accustomed to think , perhaps carelessly , that it means that some people who are very unfortunate , suffer a little discomfort ; that we are sorry for them ; we wish they could be better taken care of , but after all so many people are bound to be unfortunate anyhow we shrug our shoulders and go about our own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Cost of Wretchedness . " Who pays the bill ? The city and the State are paying for the crime , for the disease , for the wretchedness that come from those congested conditions . That is one of the things we have to learn in this country , that no man , however he might pride himself upon his success , can get away from his brethren altogether ; and he can not afford to have plague spots in the city . You have to pay for hospitals . " It is hazardous to talk upon these lines with our present lack of definiteness in programme , and I might say we have hardly begun to realize what a Proper exercise of the police powers of the State under a true theory of government can do with regard to these conditions . Now , I thoroughly believe in individualism .

" We must do a great deal with regard to rapid transit in New York ; we must in some way make it possible to move all the people freely . That is bound to come , attended with great difficulties and over many obstacles .
