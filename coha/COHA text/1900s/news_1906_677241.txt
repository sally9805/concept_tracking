JOHN F. , Engine Company 14 ; perhaps fatally burned and bruised ; at St. Vincent 's Hospital . WASHBURN , GEORGE , Fire Patrol 2 ; partly suffocated In the list of those hurt only of Engine 14 is considered in danger . All the fatalities were caused by the falling of the upper half of the north wail of the factory building . Six men , nearly the whole complement of No. 14 , were buried under it . Men Were on Third Floor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the old building at the southwest corner of Carmine and Bedford Streets . They were pouring water from its rear windows into the windows of the factory building behind it , fighting the flames from this point because the heat was too great to permit of a battle from the roof . - The scene of the disaster was a place famous as a landmark with the old-timers of Greenwich Village . It was Benedict 's undertaking establishment , a concern Which until two years ago had been the centre of mournful occasions to the Greenwich folk for nearly three-quarters of a. century . It was called " The West Side Morgue . " The building itself had been standing for more than a century and was nearly as feeble architecturally as would be a human at its age . When the mass of white-hot brick crashed upon it it crumpled like a house of cardboard and was flattened to the ground , carrying Walsh and his men down in the ruin . The flames and whirling columns of sparks and bits of burning material rose a hundred feet toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold drizzle , driving downward the rolling clouds of black smoke , which filled the- old narrow streets and enveloped the quaint houses of a century ago as they blistered and in turn broke into flames . After the tragedy came stillness . Every engine was stopped in its panting , for every engineer knew that a fellow-fireman might need his help to dig him from the burning pile of wreckage . Men Went to the Rescue . There was no word of command The men of Truck Company No. 5 , with Capt . P.eiley and Deputy Clref Kruger at their head , turned their leather helmets and plunged into the mass of dust , smoke , and fire . Of the six men that had gone down in the crash two were soon calling for help . Reiley and his men worked as if their own lives were at stake , using picks , shovels , poles , and their bare hands . It took ten minutes to get out Cohen and , both of whom were held down by brick and mortar and burning timbers . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were wounded . " I saw one poor devil burning near me , " said Cohen . " When the crash came we did n't know anything at all for a few moments , " he told a TIMES reporter in St. Vincent 's Hospital . " and I were at the nozzle in the back window . I did n't even hear the crash . Johnny fi I went down with the rest . Fore  --  rnThish and the other men were behind us in the same room- We were nearer the wall of the old building , and that is probably what saved us . When we came to Johnny and I hollered . He was worse hurt than I was . Neither of us could move . Rescuers Seemed an Hour . " It seemed an hour before we saw a fireman digging his way toward us . I have a wife and a baby , and I thought of them , I can tell you . I saw the body of one of the men of my company near me . It was burning . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vincent 's it was said last night that his condition was very serious . Father Smith , the department Chaplain , was at the scene when the third man was brought out . He was Dennis Healy . There was a spark of life left in him , but his face and hands were purple , // FOUR FIREMEN KILLED , TWO MEN ARE MISSING // and Ills body battered terribly . Ho had ben under the burning debris for half an hour . He was carried across Carmine Street into a plumber 's shop , where Father Smith administered extreme unction . Healy died in a. few minutes . While this tragedy was being enacted the fire had spread from the factory building to the adjoining building in Downing Street , another Greenwich landmark , an old-fashioned and stately residence turned into a tenement house . Adjoining this building is a. large stable of the Borden Condensed Milk Company . As fast as the reserves could be brought from the downtown police stations men were sent into the many tenements in ' reach of the conflagration to drive out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their lives . The danger of the fire getting beyond control was imminent when Fire Chief Croker reached the scene . Four alarms , one after another , were sent in as the flames leaped across the narrow streets and spread to the adjoining blocks . Two six-story tenement buildings in Downing Street , opposite the Metal Stamping Company 's building , blazed forth in every window ? their cornices of sheet iron shriveling in the heat . The six-story tenement at the corner of Bedford and Downing Streets also caught fire , and a part of a falling wall crashed ' across the street and tore a wide gap in its side , destroying the grocery store of John Curtin on the ground floor and ripping another gap in the building opposite it , across Bedford Street . All the buildings in Bedford Street from Downing to Carmine Street caught fire from the heat , and the little old-fashioned buildings at 60 , 62 , 64 , 66 , and 68 Carmine Street were also soon ablaze . The first companies to face the battle were Engines 24 , 30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The second alarm brought Engines 13 , 33 , 20 , and 72 , and Truck S. 4The third alarm brought Engines 27 , 55 3 , 1 , 3 , 25 , and Truck D. The fourth alarm brought Engines 17 , 29 , 11 , 7 , 9 , and 19 , and Truck 1 . Water Tower No. 2 was also called on . Nearly 200 men were employed in the fight besides the police of the first eighteen precincts of the city and the harbor police , wo were also called in o preven too great h a depletion of the city 's protectt - ive force . Deputy Commissioner Waldo was the ranking police officer at the fire . He had under him Inspector Hogan and most of the Captains from the downtown precincts . They had much work to do , for the fire area was closely surrounded by towering tenements , every exposed bit of woodwork of which crackled and blazed , and the roofs of which frequently burst forth into long spouts of flame . The narrow streets were crowded with weeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes , even their broken Idollies. in and out of the blistering buildings on Carmine , Downing ' , and Bedford Streets they swarmed , dodging under the heads of Fire Department horses , stumbling over the web of hose lines , snatching their little possessions from destruction . A hundred families were forced into the street by the fire , and at Public School No. 113 more than thirty children learned that they had no homes to go to when the school was dismissed . In order to quell the restlessness of the little ones , who sniffed the smoke and heard the distant rumbling of the engines and the resounding crash of falling walls , these children were taken in charge by a teacher and housed in a Downing Street building at a safe distance from the fire , the teacher fearing that they would try to help their parents I at the risk of their lives . . In the factory building , which was owned by the Metal Stamping Company , of ' which John F. Galvin is President , three concerns did business . The metal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floors ; the Standard Thread Company occupied the sixth floor , and the Empire Art Company , which manufactures novelties , occupied the fifth . A fire was discovered On the third floor , and at first it was considered of little importance . An alarm was sent in , but before the engines arrived a terrific explosion shook the building . In the japanning room , where the metal is polished or lacquered , chemicals had been set off by the heat and flames . Nearly 200 Italians employed by the metal company fought their way , trampling one another , down the stairway leading to Downing Street . Overhead on the sixth floor fifty women employed by the Standard Thread Company were cut off . Their only way of exit was by the fire escape on the Bedford Street side . Many of the women were overcome with fright and fainted . Policemen John F. and James Dolan of the Charles Street Station and John J. O'Connell were present when ? the women began crowding the fire escapes . They clambered through smoke to them . and passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Were all on the street . Other policemen were kept busy get ' ting the frightened women away from the building , which was , in a wonderfully short time , a furnace . It was necessary to carry many of them to streets two and three blocks away before they could be left , so bewildered and panic-stricken were they . In the tenements nearest the factory clubs had to be drawn to drive the occupants to places of safety . It was this anxiety to save property on the part of poor tenants tnat kept two Italians in the old " morgue " until the wall crashed to earth . Lucurio. who escaped from this building , says that two of his countrymen were within it when he was thrown out through a window . He does not know their names , and they have not been seen since the tragedy . The fire burned until late last night . Six hours after it began , Chief Croker was still directing men in digging in the burning ruins where Engine Company 14 suffered its disaster . The men were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the two ? living , Cohen and , were brought out , there was not the remotest hope of saving the lives of any of the others , but all were anxious to save their bodies from the flames . While Chief Croker was at work in the ruins with his men about 4 o'clock a toppling fragment of wall compelled him to call the workers away . He resumed work at 5 o'clock , however , searchlights being turned on the ruins . After many tons of burning wood . household material , and hot brick and mortar had been removed , the bodies of Foreman Walsh , Halpin , and Christman were found . They were partly burned , but pot unrecognizable . Foreman Walsh was 42 years old . He Was appointed to the department March 111 , Min , and assigned to Engine Company No. 5 . He was made an engineer in 1896 , Assistant Foreman in 1901 , and Foreman of Company 14 in 1903 . He was married and leaves a family . He was three times on the roll of merit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old . He was born in Ireland . He was appointed in 1903 , and had a good record . Christman and Halpin had each been in the department two years , and their records were good . Company 14 had a roll of fourteen men . Four of them were killed yesterday , a fifth , , probably fatally hurt ; Cohen . disabled by burns and abrasions , although hopeful of getting back to active duty some day , and five others more or less seriously injured . Foreman Walsh was in charge of a fire company seat to Baltimore to help in the fire which destroyed the business section of that city . Healey was injured in a big Broadway fire Sunday morning about six weeks ago . Out of the fourteen there were only six men who answered roll call after the destruction of the old " Morgue " building . The widows and children of the dead firemen will be provided for by the half pay pension allowed them when firemen die at their posts of duty . Foreman Walsh drew $2,100 a year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . A policeman 's overcoat was found in the ruins of 60 Carmine Street . For a time it was feared that a member of the force had been killed , but no policeman has been reported missing . At 9 o'clock last night when Patrick Hogan , a 19-year-old boy , whose home is at 13 Carmine Street , walked near the demolished Carmine Street building he was struck by a piece of falling timber . He was taken to St. Vincent 's Hospital with a fractured skull . DR . BUTTS , WOUNDED , DIES . Coroner Thinks He Had a Stroke and Fell on Razor . Hearing groans in the bathroom of the suite at the Hotel Seville , at Madison Avenue and Twenty-ninth Street , occu. pied by Dr. H. Hoyle Butts , a chambermaid opened the door and found the doctor wounded on the floor . It was about 10 o'clock yesterday morning , and Dr. Butts had evidently gone into the bathroom to shave . Below his right ear was a gash three inches long and very deep . Near by lay a razor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chambermaid said later . The hotel managers summoned Dr. Charles W. Allen of 30 East Thirty-third Street . He could do nothing for Dr. Butts , and some time later the Coroner 's office was notified . Coroner Dooley retched the hotel , shortly after noon . Dr. Butts was barely alive then , and he died soon afterward . A burial permit was issued . Coroner Dooley said last night that he could find nothing to point toward suicide . He thought that Dr. Butts had had an apoplectic stroke , and had fallen on the razor . Detectives Raynes and Weil of the Tenderloin SO. - tion agreed with Coroner Dooley . Mrs. Butts had left the hotel early in the morning . She was there in the afternoon and last night , but would not see any one . Dr. Butts and his wife had occupied Rooms 45 and 46 since last Septembe ? . They had lived there at various times before . Dr. Butts had an office at 45 East Forty-fourth Street . He was a prominent nose and throat specialist . He was a surgeon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Manhattan Eye . Ear and Throat Hospital , and was an instructor in the New York Post-Graduate Hospital . He was a member of a number of medical societies , and belonged to the Calumet Club and the Strollers .
