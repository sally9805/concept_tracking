txt CHAPTER X. LIGHT , HEAT , ELECTRICITY , AND CHEMICAL ACTION . CHEMICAL action is always manifested by one or more of the different forms of energy , such as light , heat , and electricity . This means that a chemical change involves not only a rearrangement of matter , but also a transformation of energy . Thus , when coal is burned , a new compound called carbon dioxide is formed , but heat is also liberated . Sometimes we pay more attention to the resulting matter than to the energy , but both are involved . In the present chapter we shall emphasize the relation of energy to chemical action . The law of the conservation of energy should be recalled in this connection . Energy , like matter , can not be created or destroyed ; we can only transform it . And the transformation involves no loss or gain . Hence , chemical energy , which is the immediate cause of chemical action , will appear as heat , light , or electricity . The Relation of Light to Chemical Action is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and organic matter are quickly blackened by light ( see Photography ) . Sunlight fades many colors . It likewise assists the chemical changes involved in the growth of plants . The formation of the green coloring matter of foliage is partly due to sunlight . A mixture of hydrogen and chlorine gases remains unchanged in the dark , but in direct sunlight it explodes violently . On the other hand , light is often a product of chemical action . Many chemical experiments show this , especially those with oxygen . Sparks , most flames , and the flash of a gun are other illustrations of the close relation between light and chemical action . Combustion in its varied forms is also manifested by light , as well as by heat . 111 // HEAT AND CHEMICAL ACTION . Heat and Chemical Action are closely and definitely related . Every chemical change is attended by the liberation or absorption of heat . Moreover , the heat involved can often be measured . Heat is measured in calories , a calorie being the quantity of heat necessary to raise the temperature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? C. For example , the heat liberated by the burning of t gm. of hydrogen is 34,200 cal. , and of I gm. of pure charcoal is about 8000 cal . Attention has already been called to the high temperature of the hydrogen flame ( see Chapter III ) . Ordinary chemical equations do not express changes in energy . To represent heat changes , the number of calories of heat involved is placed after the equation , thus : ? H2 + 0 = H2O + 68,400 cal . Hydrogen Oxygen Water This is called a thermal equation , and it means that 68,400 cal . of heat are liberated , when 2 gm. of hydrogen unite with 16 gm. of oxygen to form 18 gm. of water . In some changes heat disappears . Thus , when carbon unites with sulphur to form carbon disulphide , heat is absorbed . The equation expressing this fact is ? C + S2 = CSC ? 19,600 cal . Carbon Sulphur Carbon Disulphide Heat involved in the formation of a particular compound is called heat of formation of that compound . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the heat is called positive ( + ) ; and the compound is termed exothermic . Heat of formation which is absorbed is called negative ( ? ) ; and a compound having a negative heat of formation is said to be endothermic . Exothermic compounds are stable , and can be decomposed only by the addition of the same quantity of heat liberated by their formation . Thus , 68.400 cal . of heat , or an equivalent quantity of energy , must be added to 18 gm. of water to decompose it Light , Heat , Electricity , and Chemical Action . i 13 into 2 gm. of hydrogen and i6 gm. of oxygen . Such heat is called heat of decomposition . On the other hand , endothermic compounds are unstable , and often explosive . They decompose easily with the liberation of heat . Ozone is endothermic . Heat is absorbed during its formation from oxygen ; but when ozone decomposes , heat is liberated . Two parts ( by volume ) of ozone form three parts ( by volume ) of oxygen and liberate 72,400 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by chemical action is the slaking of lime . When lime and water are mixed , their union produces sufficient heat to boil water and often to set fire to wood . Steam can be seen escaping from the boxes in which lime is being mixed with water and sand to form plaster or mortar . Buildings in which lime is stored sometimes take fire , if rain leaks in upon the lime . Ships loaded with lime are in constant danger of being burned . Other substances liberate heat when added to water , e.g. sulphuric acid , sodium and potassium hydroxides , and the metals , sodium and potassium . Heat is the initial cause of many chemical changes . It is necessary to start many reactions , just as a stone on top of a hill must be pushed before it will roll toward the bottom . Hydrogen and oxygen mix freely without combining , but union occurs the instant heat is applied in form of a flame or an electric spark . Similarly , illuminating gas must be lighted , i.e. raised to the kindling temperature before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proceed . These facts mean that chemical action often depends upon temperature . This statement has been strikingly illustrated in the last four years . At the extremely low temperature obtained by using liquid air and similar substances , it appears that many chemical reactions cease . While at the exceedingly high temperature produced by electricity many changes , chemical and physical , hitherto impossible , occur quickly and simply . I14 Descriptive Chemistry . The Electric Furnace of Moissan . ? Until recently the heat needed for chemical changes was obtained by burning carbon or its compounds , such as charcoal , illumi nating gas , and oil . Sometimes the blast lamp and oxyhydrogen blowpipe were used . But all these sources have been surpassed in efficiency by the electric furnace . It is well known that an electric arc light produces intense heat . The high temperature of the arc , i.e. space between the glowing ends of the carbons , is unequaled by that of any other source of artificial heat . If the carbon rods are inclosed in a box that prevents the escape of heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is produced inside the box . This apparatus is called an electric furnace . It was devised and perfected by the French chemist , Moissan , and used by him in experimenting at high temperatures One form of the electric furnace is shown in Figure i6 . Moissan 's description of this furnace is as follows : u It consisted of two bricks of quicklime placed one on top of the other . The lower brick contained a longitudinal groove to receive the two electrodes carbon rods , and situated in the center was a small cavity . This cavity might vary in size , and contained a bed some centimeters in depth of the substance to be acted upon by the heat of the arc , or a small crucible of carbon containing the substance to be treated may be placed there . The upper brick was slightly hollowed out in the part just above the arc . As the intense heat of the current soon melted the Light , Heat , Electricity , and Chemical Action . i I S ; u1-face of the lime , giving it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dome was obtained in this way which reflected all the heat on to the ; mall cavity which contained the crucible . " Figure 17 is a vertical sec-tion of the furnace , showing the parts slightly separated . The furnace is small , some being only 16 to 18 cm. ( about 7 in. ) long , 15 cm. wide , and 14 cm. high . The carbon rods are from 1 to 5 cm. in diameter . When a current is passed through the carlion rods , the tremendous heat produced is retained in the space by the mon-conducting walls and acts upon the substance below the arc . The outside of the furnace remains cold enough to be touched by the hand , but the inside is almost twice as hot as the oxyhydrogen , . flame . There is no electrical action upon the chemicals . The intense heat alone pro-duces the remarkable changes , which are often accom-plished in a few minutes . Sand , lime , magnesium oxide , and other refractory oxides melt and volatilize . The ele-tnents carbon , silicon , and boron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ melt and vaporize . Large masses of rare and uncommon elements are quickly reduced from their oxides and obtained in the pure state , e.g. chromium , manganese , tungsten , uranium , and molybdenum . Char-coal becomes graphite . And stable compounds of carbon , boron , and silicon are formed . These are the carbides , hnrides , and silicides . Some of the carbides have an in-dustrial use as well as scientific interest , especially calcium carbide and silicon carbide ( see below ) . Other carbides are the sources of pure metals , since the fusion of a car-bide and oxide of the same metal yields the metal itself . z 1 6 Descriptive Chemistry . Industrial Use of the Electric Furnace . ? Huge electric furnaces constructed on the type devised by Moissan are in active operation . And since electricity is now obtained in many localities by running dynamos by water , new industries requiring intense and continuous heat have recently sprung into existence . Several of these plants are located at Niagara Falls , which furnishes enormous power at a relatively small expense . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mixture of lime and coke ( a form of carbon ) in an electric furnace . The chemical change is caused solely by the intense heat and may be represented thus : ? 3 C + CaO = CaC9 + CO Carbon Lime Calcium Carbide Carbon Monoxide This method of making calcium carbide cheaply was discovered independently and at about the same time ( 1892 ? 1895 ) by Moissan and Willson . The furnaces now in operation vary in details , but all have one essential feature , viz. , the heat is generated by an electric current passing between two carbon electrodes . In most furnaces one electrode is a crucible wholly or partly of carbon , and the other electrode is a stout carbon pillar dipping into the mixture . Calcium carbide is a haid , brittle , dark gray , crystalline solid with a metallic luster . Its specific gravity is 2.2 . The most striking and useful property is its action with water , acetylene being formed , thus : ? CaC2 + 2 H2O = C2H2 + Ca(OH) , Calcium Carbide Water Acetylene Calcium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gas . This gas burns with a brilliant flame , and is coming into general use as an illuminant . Owing to its action with water , Light , Heat , Electricity , and Chemical Action . 117 calcium carbide is packed and sold in air-tight cans ( see Acetylene ) . Carborundum is a compound of silicon and carbon , having the composition SiC . It is made in the electric furnace by fusing sand ( silicon dioxide , SiC ) 2 ) , coke , sawdust , and common salt . The essential chemical change is represented thus : ? SiO2 + 3 C = SiC + 2 CO Silicon Dioxide Carbon Carborundum Carbon Monoxide Carborundum is silicon carbide ( or carbon silicide ) . It is a crystallized solid , varying in color from white to emerald green and is sometimes iridescent . It is extremely hard , being harder than ruby and nearly as hard as diamond . Hence it is made into grinding wheels , whetstones , and polishing cloths . Over three million pounds were made at Niagara Falls in 1902 , and the output @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heat . Its specific gravity is about three . Acids have no action upon it , but it is decomposed by fusing with potassium hydroxide and other alkalies . Carbonmdum is manufactured in a huge electric furnace , shown in Figure 18 . It is an oblong box of bricks with permanent ends and loosely built sides . Each end is provided with a heavy metal plate . The wires for the electric current are attached to the outer ends of these plates , while the huge carbon electrodes fit into the inner ends , and project into the furnace . A cylinder of granulated coke makes an electrical connection between the electrodes . In this furnace the mixture is not heated by an electrical arc , but by the resistance of the carbon core to the passage of the powerful current of electricity . The chemical change , as in the manufacture of calcium carbide , is clue solely to heat . The current k passed through the mixture for about eight hours . When the operation is over and the furnace is cool , the side walls are pulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grade is found around the core . It is crushed , treated with sulphuric acid to remove the impurities , washed , dried , and graded according to the size of the particles . Artificial Graphite is formed in the manufacture of carborundum . It is also made by heating a certain grado of anthracite coal in an electric furnace . It is extensively used in making electrodes for electric furnaces . Over 800,000 lb. were manufactured in 1902 at Niagara Falls . Graphite is a form of carbon ( see Graphite ) . Light , Heat , Electricity , and Chemical Action . 119 ELECTRICITY AND CHEMICAL ACTION . The Relation between Electricity and Chemical Action has always been a fascinating subject . Volta constructed his voltaic pile about 1800 . This was one of the first , per haps the first , source of an electric current . In May , ' Soo , Nicholson and Carlisle decomposed water into hydrogen and oxygen by an electric current obtained from a thermo pile . In the same year Cruikshank obtained lead and copper from solutions of their salts . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by passing an electric current ( obtained from a large battery ) through fused caustic soda and caustic potash respectively . From hat time until the present day , the relation between elec ricity and chemical action has engaged the attention of hemists . And their labors have built up a branch of hemistry called electrochemistry , which as recently attained considerable cotnercial importance . The Voltaic ( or Galvanic ) Cell in its simplest . rm consists of two metals connected by a wire d dipped into a liquid which will interact with . e of the metals ( Fig. 19 ) . Copper , zinc , and ter containing sulphuric acid may be used as illustration . When the connected metals are t into the acid , the zinc slowly disappears and hydrogen bubbles appear on the copper . Further examination would show that the zinc and sulphuric acid interacted , forming zinc sulphate . The chemical change is the one already described under hydrogen , and may be represented thus : ? The connecting wire becomes electrified and exhibits the effects of an electric current , viz. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move , // and a shower of sparks is produced if the wire is cut and one end is drawn down a file while the other is held firmly upon it . The source of the electric current is obviously the chemical action between the acid and zinc . The copper is necessary , otherwise the product of the chemical action would be merely heat . Carbon is often used in place of copper , and other liquids instead of sulphuric acid . The liquid chosen , however , must be one that will interact with zinc or its substitute . Several cells joined together form an electric battery . For many years the battery was the chief source of the electric current . And it is now used , especially for ringing telephone , house , fire alarm , and signal bells , and in operating the telegraph . The dynamo is now widely used to generate powerful currents of electricity . Electrochemical Terms . ? Faraday ( 1791 ? 1867 ) investigated electrochemistry about 1834 , and introduced many terms in common use . He called the decomposing process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wire by which the current entered he called the anode ; and that by which it escaped , the cathode . " Finally , " he says , " I require a term to express those bodies which pass to the electrodes . I propose to distinguish such bodies by calling those anions which go to the anode of the decomposing body ; and those passing to the cathode , cations ; and when I have occasion to speak of these together , I shall call them ions . Thus , chloride of lead is an electrolyte , and when electrolyzed evolves the two ions , chlorine and lead , the former being an anion and the latter a cation . " These terms are so used to-day , but they demand a broader definition . Electrolysis is the series of chemi ? cal changes caused by the passage of an electric current through a dissolved or fused ( i.e. melted ) compound . " 1'hO compound thus decomposed is an electrolyte . The metallic or carbon rods which conduct the current of electricity to and from the electrolyte are called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are usually made of platinum , col ) . Light , Heat , Electricity , and Chemical Action . 121 per , zinc , mercury , or hardened carbon ; they may have any shape ? rod , wire , sheet , plate , box , crucible ; and they may also be solid , liquid , or powder , as well as fixed or movable . The electrodes are connected by wires with the source of the electric current , and serve as " doors " ? to quote Faraday again for the current to flow into and out of the electrolyte and through the wire connecting the electrodes . We speak of a " current " of electricity and of electricity as " flowing , " although we . do not know the nature of electricity , nor do we mean really that it flows , like a river , only in one direction . It is customary to.speak of the current as entering the electrolyte by the anode or positive electrode and leaving by the negative electrode cathode . The anode is the electrode that is often consumed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solids are often deposited upon the cathode , as will soon be described . Ions are those parts of the decomposed electrolyte which are believed to be material carriers of electricity . Ion comes from a Greek word which means wandering or migrating . And a cation is that ion which moves clown or along with the current of electricity to the cathode where it is separated , deposited , or modified ; while an anion is that ion which moves upward or against the current to the triode , where it likewise appears in various forms . Anions are electro-negative ions , but cations are electro-positive ions . Metallic ions are cations ; hence metals are deposited t the negative electrode or cathode . Non-metallic ions re usually anions , therefore oxygen , chlorine , and their xides and hydroxides appear at the anode . Hydrogen is Icctro-positive . In general , metals are electro-positive , d non-metals ( except hydrogen ) are electro-negative. ons follow the law of electric attraction and repulsion , z. , ions with the same kind of electrification repel each // Industrial Applications of Electrolysis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electrotyping and electroplating . These operations consist in depositing a thin film of metal upon a surface . They are fundamentally the same , though copper is the only metal used for producing electrotypes . Electrotypes are exact reproductions of the original objects . The process of electrotyping is substantially as follows : the page of type , or the woodcut , is first reproduced in wax or plaster . This exact impression is next covered with powdered graphite to make it conduct electricity . The coated mold is then suspended as the cathode in an acid solution of copper sulphate ; the anode is a plate or bar of copper . When the current is passed , electrolysis occurs ; copper is dissolved from the anode and deposited upon the mold in a film of any desired thickness . The exact copper copy is stripped from the mold , backed with metal and mounted on a wooden block , and used instead of the type or woodcut itself . By this process exact copies of expensive wood engravings can be cheaply reproduced , and type can be saved from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and newspapers are now printed from electrotypes . The process of electroplating differs from electrotyping in only one essential , viz. , in electroplating , the deposited film is not removed from the object . The object to be plated is carefully cleaned and made the cathode ; the anode is a bar or plate of the metal to be deposited . When the current passes through the system , the metal is firmly deposited upon the object . The electrolysis would take place , of course , if any anode were present ; but anodes of the metal to be deposited are usually used to prevent the solution or " bath " from weakening ; They accomplish the purpose by replenishing the solution with metal Light , Heat , Electricity , and Chemical Action . 125 as fast as it is removed and deposited upon the cathode . Silver , nickel , and gold are the usual metals used in electroplating ( see these metals ) . Electroplating and electrotyping have been done since about 184o . It is only within the last ten or fifteen years , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many industries . But during this time the development of electrochemistry has been very marked . The largest of these industries is the refining of copper . The process is similar to that described under - electrotyping . Other metals , such as gold , silver , and lead , are extracted from their ores and , purified by electricity , though the older processes are still used . All the aluminium , magnesium , and sodium of commerce are now manufactured by passing an electric current through their fused compounds . Nearly all the domestic potassium chlorate and much of the caustic soda are made by electricity . The same is true of barium compounds and many other chemicals . " These electrochemical processes will be fully discussed in the appropriate places . The Theory of Electrolysis.  --  Many theories have been proposed to explain electrolysis . According to the theory now generally held , electrolysis is not the splitting or tearing apart of molecules by the electric current . It is the carrying of electricity from one electrode to the other by ions . Dissolved or fused compounds are more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is introduced , and the current flows simply because the ions are t here to carry it . Since these ions are charged with electricity , the dissociation is called electrolytic dissociation r ionization . Ions are not atoms , but electrically charged Moms or groups of atoms . Thus , when sodium chloride is dissolved in water , much of the salt dissociates into the // ions , sodium and chlorine ; the sodium ions are charged positively , and the chlorine atoms negatively . Now , when an electric current is passed into the solution , the ions move toward their proper electrodes , carrying the electric charges with them . In brief , the current sorts the ions , which in turn migrate with their charges . When the ions reach their respective electrodes , they give up their electric charges and assume their normal conditions . Thus , the positive sodium ions give up their charges at the negative electrode , . or cathode , and become sodium atoms . The latter interact with water to form hydrogen and sodium hydroxide . Similarly , the negative chlorine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or anode , and become neutral atoms , which at once unite to form chlo-rine molecules . Electrolysis and Solution . ? According to the above theory , the properties of many water solutions are closely related to the phenomena of electrolysis . For many years it was believed that a dissolved substance was distributed unchanged throughout the solvent . It was also believed that certain dissolved substances combined in part with the water ? a view held to-day . The first real step toward a settlement of the problem was taken when the electri-cal conductivity of solutions was compared . Experiments show that the electrical conductivity of solutions varies between wide limits . Water itself is practically a non ? actor , a sugar solution is a very poor conductor , while otutions of most acids , bases , and salts are excellent conductors . Water solutions , therefore , are of two kinds : ( i ) those which conduct electricity , and ( 2 ) those which do not , or only very slightly . But we have already seen that the first class consists of electrolytes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( i ) that when Light , Heat , Electricity , and Chemical Action . 127 acids , bases , and salts are dissolved in water , they are dis sociated into ions , and ( 2 ) that when sugar and similar substances are dissolved in water they dissociate very slightly or not at all . The amount of dissociation depends largely upon the relative amounts of solute and solvent , i.e. upon the dilution of the solution . The dissociation is slight in concentrated solutions , but increases as the dilu tion increases . Not all acids , bases , and salts dissociate to the same degree . The percentage of dissociation of some of these compounds in solutions of a certain strength and at the same temperature ( 18 ? C. ) is given in the following ? Numerous facts support the theory of ionization . ( I ) Varying electrical conductivity has already been mentioned . ( 2 ) It has long been known that solutions boil at a higher emperature and freeze at a lower temperature than pure water . A fresh-water river , for example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mineral mat-ter boils at a higher temperature than pure drinking water . It is generally true that a dissolved substance raises the boiling point and lowers the freezing point of a given solu tion . Now , when weights of substances proportional to // their molecular weights are dissolved in the same volume of water , the boiling point of each solution is raised the same number of degrees and the freezing point is lowered the same number of degrees . These facts are now applied experimentally to determine molecular weights . In many cases the molecular weights thus found agree with the values obtained by other methods . Thus , if X is the depression produced by a one per cent solution of sugar , and Y the depression produced by a one per cent solution of urea , the following proportion may be written , because the depressions of the freezing points are inversely proportional to the molecular weights ? Y : X : : mol . wt. of sugar : mol . wt. of urea . The molecular weight of sugar is known to be 342 , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which agrees with that found by other methods . This method is applicable to many compounds and is helpful in deciding whether a molecular weight is a given number or its multiple . There is a marked disagreement to this rule , however , in the case of solutions of acids , bases , and salts . That is , electrolytes are exceptions . In some instances the molecular weight is only half that found by other methods . Thus , the molecular weight of sodium chloride was found to be about 30 , instead of 58.5 ? the correct molecular weight . Hence , it is believed that the solutions of acids , bases , and salts contain ions which act like molecules in their effect upon the freezing and boiling points of solutions . The behavior of acids , bases , and salts in solution led the Swedish chemist Arrhenius , in 1887 , to extend the ideas of Faraday and to propose the present theory of solution , Light , Heat , Electricity , and Chemical Action . 12.9 Application of the Theory of Ionization . ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the theory of ionization. ( r ) Ordinary tests are tests for ions . For example , all chlorides in solution have he same test . That is , they all interact with silver nitrate in solution , because all have chlorine ions in the solution . ' similarly , all soluble sulphates interact with barium chloiide in solution , because all sulphates have SO4 ions in the ; oiution . Both silver chloride and barium sulphate are insoluble , and are removed from the solution as precipitates . A complete illustration will make this fact clearer . The silver nitrate and sodium chloride solutions before mixing consist largely of the ions of silver , NO3 group , sodium , and chlorine . When mixed , the ions of silver ; Ind chlorine unite to form silver chloride , which is insol able and hence not ionized ; the solution still contains ions of sodium and of the N0 group . On the other . md , if solutions of potassium chlorate and silver nitrate rc mixed , no silver chloride is formed , because no chloinc ions are available . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Equations are often . sed to express ionization . Thus , the ionic equation for le interaction of sodium chloride and silver nitrate is ? + - + - + - Na + Cl + Ag + NO3 = AgCl + Na + NO3 . Ionization explains the General Properties of Acids , ases , and Salts . Acids in solution turn litmus red , be-F use their solutions contain hydrogen ions ( H ) . Simirly , bases turn litmus blue , because their solutions contain droxyl ions ( OH ) . But solutions of neutral salts conin neither hydrogen nor hydroxyl ions , hence they do ? t affect litmus . The above principles can be readily // extended to cover acid and basic salts . The other general properties of acids and bases are believed to be due to the above causes . ( 3 ) Neutralization , interpreted by the ionic theory , is fundamentally the union of hydrogen and hy-droxyl ions to form molecules of water . Suppose hydro-chloric acid and potassium hydroxide are mixed . The solution at first contains the hydrogen , chlorine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hydrogen and hy-droxyl immediately unite to form water , leaving the po-tassium and chlorine ions in the solution . This solution is thus rendered neutral by the removal of the hydrogen ion ? its acid constituent ? and of the hydroxyl ion ? its basic constituent . The ionic equation expressing the neutralization of potassium hydroxide by hydrochloric acid is ? + - + + - K+OH+H+Cl=K+C1+ H2O . The potassium and chlorine ions remain free and un . combined until the solution is evaporated . As the con ? centration increases , the ions unite until nothing remainu except the neutral salt potassium chloride . Neutralization , therefore , as interpreted by the ionic theory , is essen tially a union of hydroxyl and hydrogen ions . This view is supporte by much experimental evidence . For example , the heat of neutraliz4l tion produced by the interaction of equivalent quantities of strop acids and bases is approximately the same . CHAPTER XI . CHLORINE AND HYDROCHLORIC ACID . CHLOiz1N1 is an important element , and its compounds are useful , especially hydrochloric acid , sodium chloride , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in nature , because it combines so readily with other elements . But in combination it is widely distributed , since it is one of the components of common- salt , or sodium chloride . Many compounds of chlorine with potassium , magnesium , and calcium are found in the deposits at Stassfurt in Germany ( see these metals ) . The salts found in sea water contain about 2 per cent , and the earth 's crust contains about o.01 per cent of chlorine . Silver chloride " horn " silver ? is mined as an ore in the United States and Mexico . Preparation. ? Chlorine is prepared in the laboratory by heating a mixture of manganese dioxide and hydrochloric acid . This method was used by Scheele , who discovered the gas in 1774 . The equation for the preparation of chlorine is MnO , + 4 HCI = Cl , + MnCl2 + 2 H2O Manganese Hydrochloric Chlorine Manganese Water Dioxide Acid Dichloride This is an oxidizing process , since the hydrogen of the hydrochloric acid is oxidized to water , although only part of the chlorine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chemistry . Sometimes chlorine is prepared in the laboratory by heating a mixture of manganese dioxide , sodium chloride , and sulphuric acid . This method is substantially the same as the other , since a mixture of sulphuric acid and sodium chloride yields hydrochloric acid . The simplest equation for this method of preparing chlorine is ? 2 H2SO4 + 2 NaCl + MnO2 = Cl2 + Na2SO4 + MnSO4 + 2 H2O , Sulphuric Sodium Manganese Chlorine Sodium Manganese Water Acid Chloride Dioxide Sulphate Sulphate Other oxidizing substances besides manganese dioxide may be used , . such as potassium chlorate ( KC1O3 ) , potassium dichromate ( K2Cr2O7 ) y and red lead ( Pb , O4 ) . Chlorine is manufactured by several processes , all of which involve the same principle as the laboratory method . In the Deacon process , hydrochloric acid is oxidized by oxygen obtained from . the atmosphere . A mixture of hydrochloric acid gas and ! air is heated to 500 ? C. and passed through iron tubes containing balls of clay or pieces of brick previously saturated with copper chloride . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understood . It is supposed that the copper chloride facilitates the formation of chlorine by continuously giving and taking this gas . The essential chemical change , however , is the oxidation of the hydrochloric acid , and it may be represented by the equation ? 2 HCI + 0 = Cl ? + H20 Hydrochloric Acid Oxygen Chlorine Water In the Weldon process , an impure native manganese dioxide , known as pyrolusite. is treated with hydrochloric acid in large earthenware retorts or stone tanks heated by hot water or steam . When no more chlorine is liberated , the residue is mainly manganese dichloride . This " stillliquor " was formerly thrown away , but by the Weldon process it is changed into manganese compounds , which are used to prepare more chlorine ( see Manganese Dioxide ) . Chlorine is also prepared on a large scale by the electrolytic process . Sodium chloride is decomposed by electricity in properly constructed cells , and the chlorine which is liberated at the anode is conducted off through pipes to the bleaching powder factory . Sodium hydroxide is produced at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this compound . // Properties .  --  Chlorine is a greenish yellow gas . Its color suggested the name chlorine ( from the Greek word r//lo/'os , meaning greenish yellow ) , which was given to it by Davy about 181o . It has a disagreeable , suffocating odor , which is very penetrating . If breathed , it irritates the sensitive lining of the nose and throat , and a large quantity would doubtless cause death . It is heavier than the other elementary gases , and is about 2.5 times heavier than air . Hence it is easily collected by downward displacement , i.e. by allowing it to fall to the bottom of a bottle and thus fill the latter by displacing the air . A liter of dry chlorine at o ? C. and 76o mm. weighs 3.18 gm . Water dissolves chlorine . The solution is yellowish , smells strongly of chlorine , and is frequently used in the laboratory as a substitute for the gas . Chlorine water , as the solution is called , is unstable even under ordinary conditions , and must be kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sunlight , oxygen is soon liberated and hydrochloric acid is formed . Intermediate changes doubtless occur ; but the simplest equation for the essential change Is ? H2O + CI9 = 2 HCl + 0 Water Chlorine Hydrochloric Acid Oxygen Chlorine is much less soluble in a solution of sodium chloride , over which it is sometimes collected . It attacks mercury and can not be collected over this liquid . Chlorine does not burn in the air , but many substances burn in chlorine . The metals antimony and arsenic , when sprinkled into chlorine , suddenly burst into flame , while phosphorus melts at first and finally burns with a feeble flame . If sodium , iron powder , brass wire , or other metals are heated and then put into chlorine , they burn ; the sodium and iron produce a dazzling light and the brass // glows and emits dense fumes of whitish smoke . Chlorine combines readily with hydrogen . Hence , a jet of burning hydrogen when lowered into chlorine continues to burn , forming hydrochloric acid gas , which appears as a white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ + Cl = HC1 Hydrogen Chlorine Hydrochloric Acid The attraction between chlorine and hydrogen is so great that many compounds of hydrogen are decomposed by chlorine . Thus , compounds containing hydrogen and carbon , such as illuminating gas , paraffin wax , and wood , burn in chlorine with a smoky flame . Chlorine does not combine directly with carbon , hence the flame consists largely of very fine particles of solid carbon . Similarly , a piece of glowing charcoal is extinguished by chlorine . 1 f filter paper is saturated with warm turpentine ( a compound of hydrogen and carbon ) and put into a bottle of chlorine , a flame accompanied by a dense cloud of black smoke bursts from the bottle ; the chlorine withdraws the hydro-gen to form hydrochloric acid , while the carbon is left free . The power to bleach is the most striking and useful property of chlorine . This property depends upon the fact , already mentioned , that chlorine withdraws hydrogen and liberates free oxygen ; the latter then decomposes the coloring matter in the cloth or other material . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the postmark , or a lead pencil mark , is still visible is placed in moist chlorine , these marks will not be bleached be-cause they are largely carbon ; but the writing ink , which is mainly a compound of hydrogen , carbon , and iron , will disappear . Litmus paper and calico are both bleached by moist chlorine . // Bleaching Powder is the source of the chlorine used in t he bleaching industries . It is sometimes called " bleach , " or " chloride of lime . " It is a yellowish white substance leaving a peculiar odor , which resembles that of chlorine . When dry , it is a powder , but on exposure to the air , it absorbs water and carbon dioxide , becomes lumpy and pasty , and loses some of its chlorine . Acids like sulphuric and hydrochloric acid liberate from bleaching powder its " available chlorine , " which varies from 30 to 38 per cent in good qualities . The equations for the interaction of acids and bleaching powder are usually written thus ? CaOCl2 + H2SO4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Calcium Sulphate CaOC12 + 2 HCl = C12 + CaCl2 + H2O Hydrochloric Acid Calcium Chloride The composition of bleaching powder has been much discussed . the most reliable authority gives it the formula CaOC12 . When disvolved in water , bleaching powder forms calcium hypochlorite ( CaO. , C12 ) uid calcium chloride ( CaC2 ) . Bleaching Powder is manufactured by the action of chlorine gas on lime . Lime ( calcium oxide , CaO ) is carefully slaked with water to lurm calcium hydroxide ( Ca(OH)2 ) . This powder is sifted into a large absorption chamber made of iron , lead , or tarred brick until the floor is covered with a layer three or four inches deep . The . chlorine Linters at the top and settles slowly to the floor , where it is absorbed I , V the lime . The simplest equation for the formation of bleaching powder might be written ? Ca ( OH ) . , + CI , . = CaOC1 + HO Calcium Hydroxide Chlorine Bleaching Powder Water Bleaching . ? Immense quantities of bleaching powder are used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pieces of cotton cloth as they come from the mill are // sewed end to end in strips , which are stamped at the extreme ends with some indelible mark to distinguish each owner 's cloth . These strips , which are often several miles long , are drawn by machinery into and out of numerous vats of liquors and water , between rollers , and through machines , until they are snow-white and ready to be finished ( i.e. starched and ironed ) or dyed . The whole operation requires three or four days . The preliminary treatment consists in singeing off the downy pile and loose threads by drawing the cloth over hot copper plates or through a series of gas flames . The object of the remaining operations is threefold , ( i ) to wash out mechanical impurities , the fatty and resinous matter , and the excess of the different chemicals , ( 2 ) to remove matter insoluble in water , and ( 3 ) to oxidize the coloring matter by chlorine . The details of the process differ with the texture of the cloth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentioned involves successively " liming , " " souring , " " chemicking , " and " souring , " interspersed with frequent washing . The " liming " consists in boiling the cloth in a large kier or vat with lime , the " souring " in wetting it with weak sulphuric or hydrochloric acid , and the " chemicking " in impregnating it with a weak solution of bleaching powder . Often the cloth is boiled at a certain stage with resin and sodium carbonate . The " liming " removes the resinous and the fatty matter , the first " souring " neutralizes traces of lime , and the second , which follows the " chemicking , " liberates the chlorine in the fiber of the cloth . Frequent washing is absolutely necessary to remove the impure products of the chemical changes as well as the excess of lime and other alkali , acid , and chlorine . Should these be left , the cloth would be unevenly bleached and its fiber would be weak . The cloth is finally treated with an antichlor , such as sodium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bleaching is chemically an oxidizing process . The oxygen when it is liberated from water by chlorine is said to be in the nascent state . This means that the gas is exceedingly active , because it is not only uncombined , but just ready to unite with those elements for which it has great affinity . Hence this nascent oxygen literally tears // down complex colored substances and changes them into colorless compounds . The nascent state is aptly illustrated by bleaching because both the chlorine and the oxygen are in this active chemical condition . Chlorine Hydrate is formed by cooling chlorine water or by passing chlorine into ice water . It is a yellowish , crystalline solid , and in the air it decomposes quickly into chlorine and water . Its composition corresponds to the formula Cl , ? io H2O . Liquid Chlorine was first prepared by Faraday in 1823 . A little chlorine hydrate was inclosed in one arm of a bent tube ( Fig. 21 ) , which was then sealed . By gently heating the tube , the chlorine hy drate was decomposed into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escape , wa condensed to a liquid by the pressure inside th tube . The liquefaction is more easily accom plished if one end is kept cold during th At the ordinary pressure , chlorine gas be comes liquefied , if its temperature is ? 34 ? C. while at a pressure of six atmospheres the temperature need be only o ? C. Liquid chlorine has a bright yellow color . It is a commercial article , and is stored and shipped in steel cylinders lined with lead . It is used in the laboratory to prepare chlorides , and industrially to extract gold . Solid chlorine has been obtained as a yellow crystalline mass by cooling the liquid to - ' oz .. " C. Uses of Chlorine . ? Chlorine is used directly to prepare some of its compounds , the most important being bleaching powder . The latter is often used as . a deodorizer and dis infectant , since the liberated chlorine destroys putrefying matter by acting on it as on coloring matter . A solution of potassium hypochlorite ( Javelle 's water ) or sodium hy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remove fruit stains from cotton and linen goods . Chlorides are formed when chlorine combines with other elements , and they are in general stable compounds . // The simplest equations illustrating the combination of chlorine with metals and other elements are ? Na + Cl = NaCl Sodium Chlorine Sodium Chloride Sb + 3 Cl = SbCI ; Antimony Antimony Trichloride Cu + CI , = CuCh Copper Copper Chloride P + 3 Cl = PC1. ; Phosphorus Phosphorus Trichloride H + Cl = HC1 Hydrogen Hydrochloric Acid Chlorides form an important class of compounds and they will be considered under the elements with which the chlorine combines . ( See also Chlorides below . ) HYDROCHLORIC ACID . Hydrochloric Acid is the most useful compound of chlorine . It is a gas , very soluble in water . This solution has long been known as muriatic acid ( from the Latin word miria , meaning brine ) . The term hydrochloric acid includes both the gas and its solution , but the solution is usually meant . The early chemists called the gas " spirit of salt . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gas , called it " marine acid air . " Both expressions emphasize its relation to salt ( sodium chloride ) . Occurrence . ? The gas occurs free in volcanic gases . The solution is one constituent of the gastric juice of the stomach . Chlorides , which are salts of hydrochloric acid , are abundant in the earth 's crust . Preparation . ? The gas is prepared in the laboratory by the method devised by Glauber in the seventeenth cenChlorine // fury , viz. , by heating sulphuric acid and sodium chloride . I1 the mixture is gently heated , the chemical change is represented thus ? NaCl + H2SO4 = HCi + HNaSO4 Sodium Sulphuric Hydrochloric Acid Sodium Chloride Acid Acid Sulphate But at a high temperature the equation for the reaction is 2 NaCl + H2SO4 = 2 HC1 + Na9SO4 In either case the gas is readily produced . It may be ollected over mercury or , more easily , by downward displacement . The solution is prepared by passing the gas into water . That sodium sulphate is the other product of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by testing the heated residue as I ? llows : ( a ) Dissolve a portion in water and add a few drops of barium chloride solution ; the immediate formation of the white , insoluble barium sulphate shows that the residue from the experiment must be a sulphate . ( b ) Burn a little of the residue on a platinum wire or piece of porcelain held in the Bunsen flame ; the intense yellow color immediately imparted to the flame shows that the residue contains sodium . ( c ) Hence the compound must be sodium sulphate . Commercial Hydrochloric Acid is manufactured in enormous quantities by the method used in the laboratory . A mixture of salt and sulphuric acid is moderately heated in a large hemispherical cast-iron pan , and the gas passes through an earthenware pipe into an absorbing tower ; the fused mass of acid sodium sulphate and salt is then subjected to a higher temperature , and the liberated gas passes by another pipe into the absorbing tower . These towers are tall and filled with coke or pieces of brick over which water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tower , it is absorbed by the descending water , and flows // out at the bottom of the tower as concentrated acid . The gas is usually cooled before it enters the towers . Sometimes the gas passes through huge earthenware jars before entering the towers . In these jars the gas and water are caused to flow constantly in opposite directions , thus insuring complete absorption . Hydrochloric acid gas is a by-product in the manufacture of sodium carbonate by the Leblanc process . The gas was formerly allowed to escape into the atmosphere , but since it destroyed vegetation and became a nuisance in other ways , a law was passed forbidding the manufacturers to let it escape . Hence it became necessary to absorb the gas in water . The hydrochloric acid , which was once regarded as a waste product , is now the main source of profit , since competition has reduced the price of sodium carbonate ( see Sodium Carbonate ) . Properties . ? Hydrochloric acid gas is colorless and transparent . When it escapes into moist air , it forms fumes which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the moisture of the air . It has a choking , sharp , pungent odor . The gas does not born nor support combustion . It is about 1.25 times heavier than air , and may therefore be collected by downward displacement . One liter at o ? C. and 76o mm. weighs 1.61 gm . The gas can be liquefied at to ? C. and 40 atmospheres pressure ; while at ? 16 ? C. , the pressure need be only 20 atmospheres . The extreme solubility of hydrochloric acid gas in water is one of its most striking properties . One liter of water will dissolve about 500 1 . of gas , if both are at 0 ? C. and 76o mm . At the ordinary temperature about 4501. of gas dissolve in 1 1 . of water , and as the temperature rises the solubility decreases . The solution is the familiar hydrochloric acid . The gas readily escapes , hence the acid forms fumes when exposed to air . Pure hydrochloric acid is a colorless liquid . The commercial acid has a yellow color , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organic matter or to dissolved chlorine . It also contains other impurities . Like most acids , it reddens blue litmus , and gives up its hydrogen when added to metals . The strongest acid contains about 42 per cent ( by weight ) of the gas , and its specific gravity is 1.2 . When the strong acid is heated , the gas is evolved until the solution contains about 20 per cent of the acid , and then the liquid boils at i to ? C. without further change . The dilute acid , on the other hand , loses water until the same conditions prevail . Composition of Hydrochloric Acid Gas . ? In i8 io , Davy showed that hydrochloric acid gas ( which had been regarded as an oxygen compound ) contained only chlorine and hydrogen . Many facts lead us to conclude that hydrochloric acid gas is composed of hydrogen and chlorine in such a ratio that its composition is represented by the formula HC1. ( r ) Hydrogen burns in chlorine , and the only product is hydrochloric acid gas . ( 2 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equal volumes of hydrogen and chlorine are evolved . ( 3 ) When a mixture of equal volumes of hydrogen and chlorine is exposed to the direct sunlight or tolthe action of an electric spark , the gases combine with an explosion , and hydrochloric acid gas is formed with no residue . Furthermore , the volume of the resulting gas equals the sum of the volumes of hydrogen and chlorine used . . ( 4 ) When a given volume of dry hydrochloric acid gas is treated with sodium amalgam , the chlorine is withdrawn by the sodium in the amalgam , and a volume of hydrogen remains which is half the original volume . ( 5 ) No derivative of hydrochloric acid is known which contains less hydrogen or less chlorine in a molecule . ( 6 ) The ratio by weight in which hydrogen and chlorine combine is i : 35.45 . Hence , the lowest molecular weight of hydrochloric acid is 36.45 , a number which has been verified by several different methods . Uses of Hydrochloric Acid . ? Vast-quantities are used to prepare chlorine for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from it , and it is one of the common acids used in chemical laboratories . Chlorides are fo ? med by the direct addition of chlorine to metals , as we have seen . They are also formed when // metals , their oxides , or hydroxides are added to hydrochloric acid . The following equations illustrate this general fact :  - -  Zn + 2 HC1 = ZnCl2 + H2 Zinc Zinc Chloride ZnO + 2 HCl = ZnCl2 + H2O Zinc Oxide Zinc Chloride Zn(OH)2 + 2 HC1 = ZnCl2 + 2 H2O Zinc Hydroxide Zinc Chloride They are also formed by adding other salts to hydrochloric acid . Molecules of chlorides may contain several atoms of chlorine . Occasionally the name of the compound indicates this fact , e.g. manganese dichloride ( MnCl , ) , antimony trichloride ( SbCla ) , phosphorus trichloride and pentachloride ( PCI ; and PCI , ; ) . If a metal forms two chlorides ; the two are distinguished by modifying the name of the metal . The one containing . the smaller proportion of chlorine ends in - ous , the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chloride is HgC1 , but HgClz is mercuric chloride . Similarly , we have ferrous chloride , FeCI , and ferric chloride , FeCI. , . The Test for Hydrochloric Acid and Chlorides . ? Most chlorides are soluble in water . Those of lead , silver , and mercury ( - ous ) are not . If silver nitrate is added to hydrochloric acid , or to the solution of a chloride , a white , curdy precipitate of silver chloride is formed , which ( a ) is insoluble in nitric acid , but soluble in warm ammonium hydroxide , and ( b ) turns purple in the sunlight . The invariable formation of silver chloride is the test for hydrochloric acid and soluble chlorides . Hydrochloric acid gas also forms dense white clouds of ammonium chloride in the presence of ammonia gas . // Miscellaneous . ? The acids of chlorine are tabulated under Acins. fhe compounds of chlorine with sodium , potassium , magnesium , and calcium are described under these metals . Aqua regia , of which chlorine is one constituent , is discussed in ( ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most important compounds of nitrogen are ammonia ( NH3 ) , nitric acid ( HNO3 ) , and compounds related to them . Many animal and vegetable substances essential to life are compounds of nitrogen . AMMONIA . The term ammonia includes both the gas and its solution in water , though the latter is more accurately called ammonium hydroxide . Formation of Ammonia . ? When vegetable and animal matter containing nitrogen decays , the nitrogen and hydrogen are liberated in combination , as ammonia . The odor of ammonia is often noticed near stables . If animal substances containing nitrogen are heated , ammonia is given off . The old custol of preparing ammonia by heating horns and hoofs in a closed vessel , i.e. by dry distillation , gave rise to the term " spirits of hartshorn . " Soft coal contains compounds of nitrogen and of hydrogen , and when the coal is heated to make illuminating gas , one of the products is ammonia . Preparation. ? Ammonia gas is prepared in the laborat ory by heating ammonium chloride with an alkali , usually slaked lime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 NH4C1 + Ca(OH)9 = 2 NH3 + CaC12 + 2 H2O Ammonium Slaked Ammonia Calcium Chloride Lime Gas Chloride 107 + 74 = 34 + III + 36 The gas is usually collected by upward displacement , i.e. by allowing the gas to flow upward into a bottle and displace the air . The solution is prepared by conducting the gas into water . The main source of the ammonia of commerce is the ammoniacal liquor or gas liquor of the gas works . The gases which come from the retorts in which the coal is heated are passed into water , which absorbs the ammonia and some other gases . This impure gas liquor is treated with lime to liberate the ammonia , which is absorbed in tanks containing hydrochloric acid or sulphuric acid . This solutionupon the addition of an alkali gives up its ammonia , which is dissolved in distilled water , forming thereby the ammonium hydroxide or aqua ammonia of commerce . Ammonia is sometimes prepared from the residues of the beet sugar industry , from the refuse of slaughter houses and tanneries , and from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly from the nitrogen of the air . Properties of Ammonia . ? . Ammonia gas is colorless . It has an exceedingly pungent odor , and if inhaled suddenly or in large quantities it brings tears to the eyes and may cause suffocation . It is a light , volatile gas , being only .59 times as heavy as air . A liter of the gas at o ? and 76o mm. weighs .77 gm . It will not burn in the air , nor will it support the combustion of a blazing stick ; but if the air is heated or if its proportion of oxygen is increased , a jet of ammonia gas will burn in it with a yellowish flame , thereby illustrating the broader application of the term combustion . Ammonia gas is easily liquefied if reduced to 9 ? C. and subjected to a pressure of 4.2 atmospheres , while at ? 34 ? C. it liquefies at the ordinary atmospheric pressure . // Liquefied ammonia is often called anhydrous ammonia , because it contains no water . It boils at ? 33.5 ? C. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warmed in any way , it changes back to a gas , and in so doing absorbs considerable heat . This fact has led to the extensive use of liquid ammonia in the manufacture of ice . Ammonia is a strong alkali , and was called formerly the volatile alkali . Priestley , who discovered and studied the gas , called it alkaline air . Another marked property of ammonia gas is its solubility in water . A liter of water at o ? C. dissolves 11481. of gas ( measured at 0 ? C. and 76o mm. ) , and at the ordinary temperature i 1 . of water dissolves abo tut 7001. of gas . This solution of the gas is usually called ammonia , though other names , especially ammonium hydroxide , are sometimes applied to i . ? Commercially it is known as aqua ammonia , ammonia , or ammonia water . It gives off the gas freely , when heated , as may easily be discovered by the odor or by the formation of the dense white fumes of ammonium chloride ( NH4C1 ) when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lighter than water , its specific gravity being about .88 , and contains about 35 per cent ( by weight ) of the gas . It is a strong alkali ? a caustic alkali , neutralizes acids and forms salts , and acts in many respects like soQium hydroxide . Ammonium Hydroxide and Ammonium Compounds. ? When ammonia gas is passed into water , it is believed that the ammonia combines with the water and forms a solution of an unstable compound having the formula NH4OH . This compound is ammonium hydroxide ( or ammonium hydrate ) . Its formation may be represented thus ? NH3 + H2O = NH4OH Ammonia Water Ammonium Hydroxide ISO Descriptive Chemistry . Ammonium hydroxide acts like a base . It has a marked alkaline reaction ; it neutralizes acids and forms salts , thus NH4OH + HCl = NH4C1 + H2O Ammonium Chloride 2 NH4OH + H2SO4 = ( NH4 ) 2SO4 + 2 H2O Ammonium Sulphate These salts , ammonium chloride and ammonium sulphate , have definite properties , and arc strictly analogous to sodium salts . Thus , we have ? Sodium Salts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2SO4 etc. etc . Hence , it is believed that ammonium compounds contain a group of atoms which acts like an atom of a metal . This group of atoms is called ammonium , and its formula is NH4 . Ammonium has never been separated from its compounds , or if it has it is so unstable that it immediately decomposes into ammonia gas and hydrogen . So also ammonium hydroxide has never been obtained free , for it decomposes readily into ammonia gas and water , thus ? NH4OH = NH3 + H2O Ammonium Hydroxide Ammonia Gas Water Ammonium is sometimes called a radical , because it is the root or foundation of a series of compounds . It is likewise called a hypothetical metal , because its existence is assumed and it acts chemically like metals . Compounds of Nitrogen . I 5 i Ammonium Chloride is prepared by passing ammonia gas into dilute hydrochloric acid , by mixing ammonium hydroxide and hydrochloric acid , or by letting the two gases mingle . The equation for the essential reaction is NH3 + HC1 = NH4C1 Ammonia Hydrochloric Acid Ammonium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ammonium salt of hydrochloric acid , as if it were formed by replacing the hydrogen of the acid by ammonium , just as sodium forms sodium chloride . Ammonium chloride is a white , granular or crystalline solid , with a sharp , salty taste . It dissolves easily in water , and in so doing lowers the temperature markedly . When heated to a high temperature it gradually breaks up into ammonia and hydrochloric acid . This kind of decomposition is called dissociation . Large quantities of ammonium chloride are made at one stage of the manufacture of ammonium hydroxide by passing the gas into hydrochloric acid . The crude product is called " muriate of ammonia " to indicate its relation to muriatic ( or hydrochloric ) acid . It is largely used for charging Leclanche batteries , as an ingredient of soldering fluids , in galvanizing iron , and in textile industlies . The crude salt is purified by heating it gently in a large iron or earthenware pot , with a dome-shaped cover ; the ammonium chloride volatilizes easily and then crystallizes in the pure state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the impurities remain behind in the vessel . The process of vaporizing a solid substance and then condensing the vapor directly into the solid state is called sublimation . It differs from distillation in that the substance does not pass through an intermediate liquid state . The product of sublimation is called a sublimate . Sublimed ammonium chloride is known as sal ammoniac . Ammonium Sulphate is made by passing ammonia gas into sulphuric acid , or by adding ammonium hydroxide to the acid , thus ? z NH1OH + H. , SO4 = ( NH4 ) 2SO4 + 2 H2O Ammonium Hydroxide Ammonium Sulphate // The commercial salt is a grayish or yellowish solid . It is used as a constituent of fertilizers , since it is rich in nitrogen , and in making ammonium alum and other ammonium compounds . Ammonium Nitrate is made by passing ammonia into nitric acid , or by allowing ammonia gas and the vapor of nitric acid to mingle , thus // Ammonia Nitric Acid Ammonium Nitrate It is a white salt which forms beautiful crystals . It dissolves easily in water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the preparation of nitrous oxide ( see this compound ) . Ammonium Carbonate is an impure salt as found in commerce , being a mixture of acid ammonium carbonate ( HNHICO3 ) and a related compound . When pure and fresh it is transparent , but on exposure to the air it loses ammonia and turns white . It is used to prepare some kinds of baking powder , to scour wool , as a medicine , and to prepare smelling salts , since it gives off ammonia readily . Other ammonium compounds are sodium ammonium phosphate or microcosmic salt ( HNaNH4PO4 ) , ammonium sulphocyanate ( NH4SCN ) , and ammonium sulphide ( ( NH4 ) ? S ) . Uses of Ammonia. ? Ammonia in the different forms is widely used as a cleansing agent , especially for the removal of grease , as a restorative in cases of fainting or of inhaling irritating gases , in dyeing and calico printing , and in the manufacture of dyestuffs , sodium carbonate , and ice . Its salts have many domestic , industrial , and agricultural uses . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depends upon the fact that many liquids in passing into a gas absorb heat . Liquefied ammonia ( not the ordinary liquid ammonia ) changes rapidly into a gas when its temperature is raised or the pressure reduced . Hence , if anhydrous ammonia is allowed to flow through a pipe surrounded by brine , the ammonia evaporates in the pipe and cools the brine , which may be used as a refrigerant or for // making ice . In some cold storage houses , breweries , packing houses , and sugar refineries , this cold brine is pumped through pipes placed in the rooms where a low temperature is desired . The construction and operation of an ice-making plant are essentially as follows : ? Liquefied ammonia is forced from a tank into a series of pipes which are submerged in an immense vat filled with brine . Large galvanized iron cans containing pure water to be frozen are immersed in the brine , which is being kept below the freezing point of water by the rapid evaporation of the ammonia in the pipes . In about sixty hours the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ice weighing about three hundred pounds . As fast as the ammonia gas forms in the pipes , it is removed by exhaust pumps into another tank , where it is recondensed to liquefied ammonia and conducted , as needed , into the first tank to be used again . The ammonia is thus used over and over without appreciable loss . The pure water is sometimes obtained by condensing the exhaust steam from the boilers used to operate the machinery , though it usually comes from a deep well . Most ocean steamers have an ice plant , and in large cities in warm climates manufactured ice is a common commodity . Composition of Ammonia Gas. ? Numerous experiments show titat ammonia gas has the composition expressed by the formula NH3 . ( I ) Dry ammonia gas passed over heated magnesium decomposes into hydrogen and nitrogen . The hydrogen may be collected and tested , but the nitrogen combines with the magnesium , forming a yellowish green powder called magnesium nitride , thus ? 2 NH3 + 3 Mg = MgsN , . + 3 H. , Magnesium Magnesium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( 2 ) If a bottle is filled with chlorine gas and plunged mouth downward into a vessel containing ammonium hydroxide , dense white fumes fill the bottle , the greenish chlorine gas disappears , and the liquid rises in the bottle ; after the bottle has stood mouth downward in a dish containing dilute hydrochloric acid ( to neutralize the excess of ammonia ) , the gas in the bottle will be found to be nitrogen . The chlorine with154 Descriptive Chemistry . draws the hydrogen from the ammonia of the ammonium hydroxide , leaving the nitrogen free , thus NH ; + 3 CI = N + 3 HC1 Ammonia Chlorine Nitrogen Hydrochloric Acid ( 3 ) The same experiment , if performed accurately , shows that one volume of nitrogen combines with three volumes of hydrogen to form ammonia gas . A tube containing a known volume of chlorine is provided with a funnel through which concentrated ammonium hydroxide is dropped into the chlorine , until the reaction ceases ( Fig. 22 ) . After the excess of ammonia is neutralized with sulphuric acid , the volume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of chlorine gas . Now hydrogen and chlorine com-bine in equal volumes , hence the volume of hydrogen withdrawn from the added ammonia must be equal to the original volume of chlorine . But this volume is three times the volume of nitrogen , therefore there must be three times as much hydrogen as nitrogen in ammonia gas . ( 4 ) When electric sparks are passed through ammonia gas , it is decomposed into nitrogen and hydrogen . Now if oxygen is added , and an electric spark passed through the mixture , the oxygen and hydrogen combine . The volume of the remaining nitrogen is one fourth of the mixture of nitrogen and hydrogen , hence the hydrogen must have been three fourths ; that is , the volume of hydrogen in the original volume ammonia was three times that of the nitrogen . ( 5 ) The gravimetric composition of ammonia , as is found by oxidizing it , and weighing the water and nitrogen , which are the only products . The result shows that fourteen parts of nitrogen combine with three parts of hydrogen . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8.5 . These facts require NH3 as the simplest formula for ammonia and 17 as its molecular weight . Independent experiments verify this molecular weight . NITRIC ACID . Nitric Acid is one of the most useful compounds of nitrogen . It was known to the alchemists , who used it // to prepare a mixture which dissolves gold . Nitric acid is used in the preparation of many nitrogen compounds . Formation of Nitric Acid . ? When moist animal or vegetable matter containing nitrogen decays in the presence of an alkali , nitric acid is formed ; it is neutralized at once by the alkali , so nitrates ? salts of nitric acid ? are the final products . This chemical change is known as nitrification , and it is caused , or largely influenced , by minute living organisms called bacteria . Nitrification is constantly going on in the soil and is an exceedingly helpful process , since it transforms harmful waste matter into valuable plant food . As a result of nitrification , there are vast deposits of nitrates , especially in desert regions and tropical countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found in the soils near large cities in India , Persia , and Egypt . Nitric acid is formed in small quantities when electric sparks are passed through moist air . Hence nitric acid or its salts can be detected in the atmosphere after a thunderstorm . This chemical change is now being applied on a large scale at Niagara Falls . Electric sparks are passed through confined air and the products are forced into a tower . Here they are absorbed in water or in a solution of lime ; thereby forming nitric acid or calcium nitrate . ' The latter is converted into sodium nitrate ( see below ) . Preparation . ? Nitric acid is prepared in the laboratory by heating concentrated sulphuric acid with a nitrate , usually sodium or potassium nitrate . About equal weights of nitrate and acid are put into a glass retort and gently heated . The nitric acid distils into a receiver , which is kept cool by running water , ice , or moist paper . The 4 ? // chemical change at a low temperature is represented by the equation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sulphate // But if the temperature is high and an excess of the nitrate is present , the equation is 2NaNO3 + H2SO4 = 2 HNO3 + Na2SO4 // A high temperature , however , decomposes part of the nitric acid , hence excessive heat is usually avoided . Nitric acid is manufactured on a large scale by heating sodium nitrate and sulphuric acid in a large cast-iron retort ( A ) connected with huge glass or earthenware bottles ( B , B , B ) , arranged as shown in Figure 23 ; the last bottle is connected with a tower filled with coke over which water trickles to absorb the vapors which escape from the bottles . The acid vapors are also often absorbed in earthenware or glass tubes . Properties . ? Pure nitric acid is a colorless liquid , but the commercial acid is yellow or reddish , due to absorbed nitrogen compounds , chlorine , or iron compounds . It decomposes slowly in the sunlight or when heated , and a // brownish gas may often be seen in bottles of nitric acid . 1 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air . The specific gravity of the commercial acid is about 1.42 , and it contains from 6o to 70 per cent of the real acid ( HNO3 ) , the rest being water . If the water is removed by slowly distilling the commercial acid with concentrated sulphuric acid , the product contains from 94 to 99 per cent of the real acid and its specific gravity is about 1.51 . When nitric acid is boiled , it loses either acid or water until the liquid contains approximately 68 per cent of nitric acid , and then it continues to boil unchanged at 12o ? C. Nitric acid is very corrosive . It turns the skin a permanent yellow color , and may cause serious burns . Many organic substances are turned yellow and sometimes completely decomposed by it . It parts readily with its oxygen , especially when hot , and is therefore an energetic oxidizing agent . Charcoal burns brilliantly in hot acid , while straw , sawdust , hair , and similar substances are charred and even inflamed by it . Iron sulphide heated with nitric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thus ? FeS + 2 02 = FeSO4 Iron Sulphide Oxygen Iron Sulphate Uses of Nitric Acid . ? Nitric acid is one of the common laboratory acids . Large quantities are used in the manufacture of nitrates , dyestuffs , sulphuric acid , nitroglycerine , gun cotton , in the refining of gold and silver , and in etching copper plates . Composition of Nitric Acid . ? Although the alchemists knew and valued nitric acid , its composition was a mystery until Lavoisier showed in 1776 that it contained oxygen and probably nitrogen . Its exact composition was determined by Cavendish in 1784-1785 , by passing electric sparks through a mixture of oxygen and nitrogen in the presI58 Descriptive Chemistry . once of water or caustic potash . The same facts had been observed , but not explained , by Priestley . Many independent experiments show that the composition of nitric acid is expressed by the formula HNO , ; . ( i ) When electric sparks are passed through a bottle containing moist air or a solution of potassium hydroxide , the water becomes acid to litmus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of potassium nitrate . ( 2 ) Nitric acid may be reduced to ammonia by nascent hydrogen , thus showing that the acid contains nitrogen . ( 3 ) Conversely , if a mixture of ammonia and air is passed over a mass of hot , porous platinum , nitric acid is formed . ( 4 ) If the acid is allowed to flow through a hot porcelain or clay tube , oxygen is one of the gaseous products . Nitrates . ? Nitric acid is monobasic and forms a series of well-defined salts called nitrates . The interaction of nitric acid and most metals is exceedingly vigorous , and for this reason , probably , the alchemists called the acid aqua fortis ? strong water . The reaction varies with the metal , strength of the acid , temperature , and the presence of resulting compounds . The solid product of the reaction is usually a nitrate , though some metals , such as tin and antimony , form oxides . The gaseous products are usually oxides of nitrogen , especially nitric oxide ( NO ) , which , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air . Hydrogen is never liberated so that it can be collected ; probably it immediately reduces the nitric acid to another compound of nitrogen . Nitrates are also formed by the action of nitric acid upon oxides , hydroxides , and carbonates , thus ? CuO + 2 HNO3 = Cu(NO3)2 + H2O Copper Oxide Copper Nitrate KOH + HNO3 = KNO3 + H2O Potassium Potassium Hydroxide Nitrate Na2CO3 + 2 HNO3 = 2 NaNO3 + CO2 + H2O Sodium Sodium Carbonate Nitrate // When nitric acid is poured upon copper , the liquid bubbles violently and becomes hot , dense fumes of a reddish , brown gas are given off , and the liquid turns blue owing to the dissolved copper nitrate . Other metals ; such as zinc , iron , and silver , act in a similar way , though the nitrate is blue only in the case of copper . The usual equation for the chemical change with copper is ? // Copper Nitrate Nitric Oxide When nitric oxide is exposed to the air , it changes at once into the reddish brown peroxide , thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peroxide Nitrates as a rule are very soluble in water . They behave in various ways when heated . Some , like sodium and potassium nitrates , lose oxygen and pass into nitrites ; others , like copper nitrate , form an oxide of the metal , an oxide of nitrogen , and oxygen ; and one , ammonium nitrate , decomposes into- water and nitrous oxide ( N20 ) . Since many nitrates , when heated , give up oxygen , they are powerful oxidizing agents . Potassium nitrate dropped on hot charcoal burns the charcoal vigorously and rapidly . This kind of chemical action is called deflagration . The Test for Nitrates ( and of course for nitric acid ) is as follows : Add to the solution of the nitrate a little concentrated sulphuric acid , and upon the cool mixture pour carefully a cold , dilute solution of fresh ferrous sulphate . A brown layer is formed where the two liquids meet . Nitrous Acid ( HNO5 ) has never been obtained in the free state , but its salts ? the nitrites ? are well known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NaNO2 ) are formed by removing the oxygen from the corresponding nitrate by heating gently or by heating with lead . Nitrites give off brown fumes when treated with sulphuric acid , thus 16o Descriptive Chemistry . being readily distinguished from nitrates . Nitrites are formed by the decomposition of organic matter , and the presence of a relatively large amount in drinking water indicates contamination by sewage . Aqua Regia is an old term which is still applied to a mixture of concentrated nitric and hydrochloric acids . The expression means " royal water , " and indicates that the mixture dissolves gold and platinum ? the noble metals . Its solvent power depends mainly upon the free chlorine which is produced in the mixture by the oxidizing action of the nitric acid . The product of the action of aqua rcgia on metals is always the chloride of the metal . Oxides of Nitrogen . ? There arc five oxides of nitrogen : ? Only three of these are important , viz. , nitrous and nitric oxides , and nitrogen peroxide . Nitrous Oxide is one of the numerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepared by decomposing ammonium nitrate . This salt , if gently heated in a test tube provided with a delivery tube , first melts and then decomposes into water and nitrous oxide ; the gas may be collected over warm water . The equation of the chemical change is ? NH4NO3 = N20 + 2 H2O Ammonium Nitrate Nitrous Oxide Compounds of Nitrogen . i 6 i This colorless gas has a sweet taste and a faint but pleasant odor . It is less soluble in hot than in cold water . The gas does not burn , but it supports the combustion of many burning substances , though not so vigorously as oxygen does . Sulphur , for example , will not burn in nitrous oxide , unless the sulphur is hot and well ignited at first . The most striking property of nitrous oxide is its effect on the human system . If breathed for a short time , it causes more or less nervous excitement , often manifested by laughter , and on this account the gas was called " laughing gas " by Davy . If breathed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pain . The gas is often used when insensibility is desired for a short time , as in dentistry . It is easily liquefied by cold and pressure , and is often used in this form to furnish the gas itself and to produce very low temperatures . It is a commercial article and is sold in small iron cylinders . Nitrous oxide was discovered by Priestley in 1776 ; but its composition was not explained until 1799 , when Davy . by an extensive study of its properties , proved it to be an oxide of nitrogen . In his enthusiasm Davy wrote a friend : This gas raised my pulse upward of twenty strokes , made me dance about the laboratory as a madman , and has kept my spirits in a glow ever since . " It is needless to say that the usual results are more quieting . The Composition of Nitrous Oxide is shown as follows : By exploding equal volumes of nitrous oxide and hydrogen , only nitrogen remains , and its volume equals the original volume of nitrous oxide . The oxygen unites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just enough oxygen to unite with a volume of hydrogen equal to the volume of the nitrous oxide . Therefore , the oxygen in the nitrous oxide must have been equal to half the volume of the nitrogen , since oxygen and hydrogen combine in the ratio of one to two . Furthermore , experiment has shown that the weights of equal volumes of nitrous oxide and nitrogen are in the ratio of 44 to 28 . Therefore , the smallest part of oxygen united with the nitrogen must weigh 16 ; and since the nitrogen weighs 28 , the formula must be N2O. 1 62 Descriptive Chemistry . Nitric Oxide has long been known , since it is the usual gaseous product of the interaction of nitric acid and metals . It is usually prepared by the interaction of copper and dilute nitric acid ( sp. gr. 1.2 ) . The equation for the complex chemical change is usually written thus ? 3 Cu + 8 HNO3 = 2 NO + Cu(NO3)2 + 4 1-120 Copper Nitric Acid Nitric Oxide Copper Nitrate The gas thus prepared is impure , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a source of the pure gas . Nitric oxide is a colorless gas , but upon exposure to the air , it combines at once with oxygen , forming dense reddish brown fumes of nitrogen peroxide . The simplest equation for this change is N O + 0 = N O2 Nitric Oxide Nitrogen Peroxide This property distinguishes nitric oxide from all other gases . It does not burn , nor does it support combustion unless the burning substance ( e.g. phosphorus or sodium ) introduced is hot enough to decompose the - gas into nitrogen and oxygen , and then , of course , the liberated oxygen assists the combustion . The Composition of Nitric Oxide is determined by heating iron or another metal in it . The oxygen of the oxide combines with the iron , and the nitrogen is left free . The resulting volume of nitrogen is half the volume of the nitric oxide taken . Hence nitric oxide contains equal volumes of nitrogen and oxygen . By an independent experiment the molecular weight is found to be 3o . Hence the formula must be NO . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direct combination of nitric oxide and oxygen . Thus  - -  NO + 0 = NO2 Nitric Oxide Nitrogen Peroxide Compounds of Nitrogen . 163 It is also produced by heating certain nitrates . ThusPb(NO3) , = 2 NO 2 + PbO + 0 Lead Nitrate Nitric Oxide Lead Oxide Oxygen The fumes of nitrogen peroxide always appear when nitric acid and metals interact , but , as already stated , the fumes are not produced at first , being the result of a second chemical change when the real product , nitric oxide , comes in contact with oxygen of the air . Nitrogen peroxide is poisonous . It dissolves in water ; it also dissolves in concentrated nitric acid , forming fuming nitric acid . At very low temperatures nitrogen peroxide is a colorless solid . At about ? to ? C. it is a yellowish liquid , and as the temperature rises the color grows darker , until at 22 ? C. the liquid boils and gives off the familiar reddish brown gas . Above 14o ? C. this gas begins to lose its color , and at 600 ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gas at low temperatures indicates the formula N2O4 , whence the name nitrogen tetroxide , often used . But the density at about 14o ? C. indicates the formula NO0 . Nitrogen Trioxide , NO , and Nitrogen Pentoxide , NO , , are unstable compounds and have no practical importance . They are the anhy-drides of nitrous and nitric acids , thus ? NO ; ; + H2O = 2 HNO2 Nitrogen Trioxide Nitrous Acid // Nitrogen Pentoxide Nitric Acid // a thousand molecules of oxygen weighs 16 times more than a thousand molecules of hydrogen , a single molecule of oxygen must weigh i6 times more than a single molecule of hydrogen . Therefore , in general , in order to find how much heavier any gaseous molecule is than a hydrogen molecule , it is only necessary to compare the weights of equal volumes of hydrogen and the gas under examination . An application of Avogadro 's hypothesis is made in course of the following argument , which proves that a molecule of hydrogen consists of two atoms : ? One volume of hydrogen combines with one volume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Suppose the volume of hydrogen contained too molecules . Then , according to Avogadro 's hypothesis , the equal volume of chlorine will contain 100 molecules , while the two volumes of the product will contain 200 molecules of hydrochloric acid gas . That is ? ioo molecules of Hydrogen + too molecules of Chlorine = 200 molecules of Hydrochloric Acid Gas . Now every molecule of hydrochloric acid gas contains at least one atom each of hydrogen and chlorine , and the 200 molecules must contain zoo atoms each of chlorine and hydrogen . Therefore each molecule of hydrogen and of chlorine must be divisible into two atoms , since the too hydrogen and the too chlorine molecules provide the 200 hydrogen atoms and the 200 chlorine atoms in the 200 molecules of hydrochloric acid gas . Similar reasoning leads to the conclusion that the molecules of oxygen , nitrogen , and most elementary gases consist of two atoms . Vapor Density and Molecular Weight . ? It was stated in a previous chapter that a molecular . weight is the sum of the weights of the atoms in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weight is useless , unless we first know the formula , and in many cases the formula can not be chosen until after the molecular weight has been found by several methods . Hence , the determination of molecular weights is an important matter . In the case // of gaseous or volatile elements and compounds , it is often accomplished by finding the vapor density of the substance . There is a direct and simple relation between molecular weight and vapor density . By vapor density we mean the ratio of the weight of a gas to the weight of an equal volume of hydrogen at the same temperature and pressure . Thus , the vapor density of steam is 9 , because experiment shows that it weighs 9 times more than an equal volume of hydrogen under the same conditions of temperature and pressure . Therefore the molecular weight of steam is 9 times the molecular weight of hydrogen . But the molec ular weight of hydrogen is 2 , since its molecule contains two atoms each weighing i . Therefore , the molecular weight of steam is 18 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the molecular weight of a gaseous com pound is twice its vapor density is clearly seen from the following table showing the ? Hence , a determination of the vapor density of a compound or an element allows us to select the correct molecular weight and assign the proper formula . The vapor densities of the elements mercury and cadmium show that the atom and molecule are identical , while the vapor densities of phosphorus and arsenic indicate that the molecule of each consists of four atoms . A molecule of oxygen contains two atoms , but a molecule of ozone contains three ; therefore , the formula of ozone is O. // Other Methods of determining Molecular Weights . ? Some substances can not be vaporized without decomposition . The molecular weights of such substances can not , of course , be found by the vapor density method . If a substance dissolves without decomposition , its molecular weight can be determined by the boiling-point or freezingpoint method , which was briefly described in Chapter X. The above methods give approximate results . Exact molecular weights are found by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ molecular weight of acetic acid . Silver acetate is analyzed and found to contain 64.65 per cent of silver ; the per cent of the remaining elements of the molecule must be 35.35 . The atomic weight of silver is 107.93 , if the atomic weight of oxygen is 16 . Hence , the weight of the silver acetate molecule , except the silver , is found by the proportion 107.93 : x : : 64.65 i 35.35 , x = 59.02 . Silver acetate is formed by replacing one atom of the hydrogen of the acid by one atom of silver . Therefore , the weight of the molecule of acetic acid is found by adding to 59.02 the weight of one atom of hydrogen . That is , the exact molecular weight of acetic acid is 60.028 ( i.e. 59.02 + 1.008 ) . Determination of Atomic Weights . ? The atomic weight of an element , as already stated , is a relative weight . It is a number expressing the relation of the weight of an atom of a given element to the weight of an atom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if we say that the atomic weight of nitrogen is 14 , we mean that the relation between the weight of the nitrogen atom and that of the hydrogen atom is 14 to I , if we adopt the hydrogen atom as the standard atom ; or we mean that the relation between the weight of the nitrogen atom and that of the oxygen atom is 14 to i6 , if we adopt the oxygen atom as the standard . The approximate atomic weights are usually expressed in round numbers , and do not vary much with the standard . Wherever exact atomic weights are used in this book , the oxygen standard is the basis . // In Chapter IX it was stated that the determination and selection of atomic weights are based on several principles . This subject can now be appropriately considered . One method of selecting the atomic weight is illustrated by the case of chlorine , which has the atomic weight 35.5 . The molecular weights of several chlorine compounds are found by the vapor density method . The compounds are analyzed to find the number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the compound equal to the determined molecular weight . And the highest common factor of these weights of chlorine is taken as the atomic weight of the element . A concise view of the method is shown in the following Thirty-five and five tenths is therefore selected as the approximate atomic weight of chlorine . Atomic weights can also be determined by analysis if we know the proportion in which the atoms combine to form a molecule of the compound analyzed . Thus , the Belgian chemist , Stas , who made masterly determinations of atomic weights , found that 121.4993 gm. of silvel ' // chloride were formed by burning 91.462 gm. of silver in chlorine . He knew that one atom of silver and one of chlorine unite to form silver chloride ; he also accepted 35.453 as the atomic weight of chlorine . Hence , he calculated the atomic weight of silver thus 121.4993 ? 91.462 = 30.0373 , which is the weight of the chlorine used . Therefore ? 91.462 : 30.0373 : : =r : 35.453 , x = 107.95 , the atomic weight of silver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the metals , are checked by applying the law of specific heats . This law was announced by Dulong and Petit in 1819 . It is stated as follows : The product of the specific heat and atomic weight of the solid elements is a constant quantity . By specific heat we mean the quantity of heat necessary to raise the temperature of a substance one degree compared with the quantity necessary to raise the temperature of the same weight of water one degree . If the same quantity of heat is imparted to equal weights of water and mercury , the temperature of the mercury will be much higher ? about 32 times higher than that of the water . That is , the mercury requires only about 32 as much heat as the water . In other words , the specific heat of mercury is 22 , or 0.0312 . The specific heat of other elements is similarly found . The constant quantity found by multiplying the specific heat by atomic weight is approximately 6.25 . This relation is illustrated by the following ? // TABLE OF SPECIFIC HEATS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be illustrated as follows : The specific heat of silver is found by experiment to be 0.057 ; if 6.25 is divided by this number , the quotient is approximately 109 . This result agrees approximately with io8 the accepted atomic weight of silver . Again , the specific heat of mercury is 0.0312 ; if 6.25 is divided by this number , the quotient , 200 , indicates that the atomic weight of mercury is 200. - a value obtained by other methods . This law has been of assistance in the final selection of the approximate atomic weight of several elements . Thus , the atomic weight of uranium was finally accepted as about 238 instead of 119 . Both values agreed with analyses , but only the former conformed to Dulong and Petit 's law . The plan followed in determining the atomic weight of zinc illustrates the methods actually used . ( a ) When zinc interacts with dilute hydrochloric or sulphuric acid , hydrogen is liberated ; and if a known weight of zinc is used , the weight of zinc needed to liberate 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we have already seen , is the equivalent of zinc ( see Equivalents , Chapter IX ) . Now if one atom of zinc replaces one atom // of hydrogen , then the atomic weight of zinc and the atomic weight of hydrogen will have the same ratio as the weight of zinc and the weight of hydrogen found by experiment . According to experiment the equivalent of zinc is about 32.5 . This is its relation , atom for atom , to hydrogen , and , thus far , is its atomic weight . ( b ) When zinc and hydrochloric acid interact , zinc chloride is formed . If it is analyzed , the proportion of zinc to chlorine is about 32.5 to 35.5 . If the elements combine , atom for atom , the atomic weight of zinc is 32.5 ( assuming that 35.5 is the atomic weight of chlorine ) . ( c ) When zinc is burned in air , zinc oxide is formed . If this compound is analyzed , the proportion of zinc to oxygen is about 65 to 16 . If the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zinc is about 65 ( assuming that i6 is the atomic weight of oxygen ) . ( d ) According to these three determinations , the atomic weight of zinc is 32.5 or 65 . We have assumed that the elements unite atom for atom in each compound . This is an incorrect assumption , because an atom of zinc can not have two different weights ? 32.5 and 65 . If the atomic weight is 32.5 , zinc oxide must consist of one atom of oxygen and two of zinc . But if the atomic weight is 65 , zinc chloride must consist of two atoms of chlorine and one of zinc , and two atoms of hydrogen must have been replaced by one of zinc. ( e ) The molecular weight of zinc chloride is found by the vapor density method to be about 133 . If zinc chloride consists of two atoms of chlorine and one of zinc ( weighing 65 ) , its molecular weight is about 136 . In other words , it is evident that our assumption regarding the number of atoms in zinc chloride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolutely positive , however , that the zinc in a molecule of zinc chloride may not be one atom weighing 65 , or two atoms weighing 32.5 each . But the atomic weight of zinc determined by applying the law of specific heats is 66.4 ( i.e. 6.25 - 0.094 ) . This shows clearly that the atomic weight of zinc is approximately 65 . Molecular Formula . ? In Chapter IX a method was given for finding the simplest formula of a compound , viz. , by dividing the percentage of each element by its atomic weight . But the simplest formula is not always the molecular formula ; that is , it does not always express the composition and number of atoms in a molecule of the // compound in the gaseous state . Every formula , however , is designed to be a molecular formula . Since the molecular weight of a compound is twice its vapor density , the molecular formula can be calculated from the simplest formula . Thus , the simplest formula of a compound of carbon and hydrogen was found to be CH2 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its molecular weight must be 162.8 , which is nearly twelve times that corresponding to CH2 . Therefore the molecular formula is C12H24 . Molecular formulas of other compounds may be similarly found. , Molecular Equations . ? Equations which represent reactions between gases are sometimes written as molecular equations . Such equations represent changes as taking place between the smallest possible physical units , that is , between molecules . The molecular equation for the formation of water from hydrogen and oxygen is ? 2 H2 + 02 = 2 H2O . It is read thus : Two molecules of hydrogen unite with one molecule of oxygen to form two molecules of water . Since most elementary gases consist of molecules , such an equation is strictly correct . It should be noted , however , that the proportions are the same as in the simpler form of the equation . For practical purposes the molecular equation is preferable only in the case of gases . Molecular equations are sometimes called volume or gas equations , because such equations tell at a glance the volumes involved in the reaction . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one volume each of hydrogen and chlorine unite to form two volumes of hydrochloric acid gas . This equation is sometimes written ? H2 + Ch = 2 HCI z vol. 1 vol. 2 vol. // Valence . ? An examination of many formulas obtained by the principles just discussed shows certain regularities . Take , for example , some binary compounds of hydrogen . They fall into four groups , thus ? I. II . III . IV . HC1 H9O H3N H4C HBr H2S H3P H4Si Obviously , the atoms of these elements differ in their power of combining with hydrogen atoms . Some unite with one atom , some with two atoms , and so on . Atoms of other elements besides those in the above list differ in their combining power . The power of atoms of an element to hold in combination a certain number of other atoms is called the valence or quantivalence of the element . The valence of hydrogen is always one . Elements which combine atom for atom with one atom of hydrogen have the valence one , and are called univalent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and so is chlorine in hydrochloric acid . Elements which combine with two atoms of hydrogen have the valence two , and are called bivalent elements or dyads ; oxygen , magnesium , and sulphur are bivalent elements . So , also , some elements like aluminium , are trivalent or triads ; others , like carbon and silicon , are quadrivalent or tetrads ; and some , like the nitrogen in nitric acid , are quinquivalent or pentads . Elements of the same valence combine with or replace eachother atom for atom . Thus , one atom of sodium replaces one atom of hydrogen in hydrochloric acid ; and one atom of oxygen combines with one atom of magnesium . Elements of different valence form compounds in which , as a rule , the number of atoms is such that the valences balance . Thus , // a dyad combines with two monads ( as in H20 ) , a triad with three monads ( as in NH3 ) , two triads with three dyads ( as in Al203 ) , one tetrad with two dyads ( as in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which the capacity for further union has ceased , are said to be saturated or to have no free bonds . Compounds in which the valence is not balanced , or in which free bonds exist , are called unsaturated ( see Ethylene ) . The valence of an element is always the same in the same compound , but it often varies . Thus , the valence of nitrogen is one in N2O , two in NO , three in N203 , four in NO2 , and five in HNO3 . Hydrogen , as stated above , always has a valence of one ; it is also believed that the valence of oxygen is always two . If an element forms no hydrogen compound , its valence is determined from compounds containing elements which are univalent , such as chlorine , bromine , and sodium . The valence of elements in saturated compounds of two elements is easily deduced from the formula , because in such compounds the total valence of all the atoms of each element must be equivalent . Thus in the formula CaO , the valence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calcium is combined with a single atom of a bivalent element . The valence of phosphorus in P2O5 is five , because the two atoms furnish a total valence of ten , which is required by the five atoms of the bivalent element oxygen . In CH4 the valence of carbon is four , because the single atom is combined with four atoms of hydrogen . Radicals have a valence , since in chemical changes they act like atoms . The valence of ammonium ( NH4 ) is one , and of hydroxyl ( OH ) is one . Thus , NH4C1 is the formula of ammonium chloride , NaOH of sodium hydroxide , but Ca(OH)2 of calcium hydroxide. // The valence of elements in unsaturated compounds can not be told by mere inspection ; a knowledge of the prop-erties of the compound is necessary . So also the valence of some elements in compounds containing three or more elements is not readily told from the formulas ; some knowledge of the methods of formation , relations to other compounds , and general properties is needed . A discus-sion of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the case of most acids , bases , and salts , an arbitrary rule may be cited . In these compounds the total valence of the oxygen atoms balances the total valence of the other elements . Thus , in nitric acid , H NO3 , the va-lence of nitrogen is live , while in nitrous acid , HNO2 , it is three . Some chemists prefer to regard valence as the quotient obtained by dividing the atomic weight by the equivalent weight . For example , the valence of oxygen is 2 ? the quotient of 16 = 8 . Such a view is not inconsistent with the one generally held , because valence is the direct outcome of composition . The valence of elements may be represented in several ways , e.g. H ' , H ? , ? 0 ? , 0 = , N ? . Sometimes formulas are written to show the valence , e.g. ? / H Hydrochloric acid , H ? Cl , Water , H ? 0 ? H , Ammonia , N ? H. Such formulas are called structural or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formulas . Structural formulas are not intended to show how the atoms are arranged in space . We know very little about the space relations of atoms . They simply indi-cate certain relations not shown by the empirical formulas . They are especially helpful in organic chemistry ( see Chapter XXXI ) . CHAPTER XIV . CARBON AND ITS OXIDES ? CYANOGEN . Occurrence of Carbon . Uncombined carbon is found pure in nature as diamond and graphite ; in a more or less impure state it occurs as coal and similar substances , which are included in the term amorphous ' carbon . Carbon forms a vast number of compounds , natural and artificial . Combined with hydrogen and oxygen , and occasionally with nitrogen also , it is an essential constituent of plants and animals . Meat , starch , fat , sugar , wood , cotton , paper , soap , wool , wax , flour , albumen , and bone contain carbon . It is also a component of carbon dioxide and of carbonates , such as limestone , chalk , and marble . Illuminating gases , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , chloroform , ether , and similar liquids are compounds of carbon . It is estimated that 0.22 per cent of the weight of the earth 's crust is carbon . Diamond is pure crystallized carbon . It is found in only a few places in the earth . When taken from the mine , diamonds are rough-looking stones ; some are crystals , some are rounded like peas , and many are irregular ; they must be cut and polished to bring out the luster and make them sparkle ( Fig. 24 ) . The highly prized diamonds are colorless and without a flaw , and are said to be " of the first water " ; yellow ones from South Africa are common , and occasionally a blue , pink , red , or green one is found ; a very impure variety is black . 181 The diamond is insoluble in all liquids at the ordinary temperature , has the high specific gravity of 3.5 , and is the hardest known substance . It is brittle and may be shattered by a blow with a hammer // by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cooling carbon to crystallize into diamond . The crystals were very small , most of them were black , a few were white , but all had the properties of the diamond ( Fig. 25 ) . Large diamonds have a fascinating history , since most of them have passed through many hands before finding a place among royal jewels . The largest is the Orloff , which weighs 1941 carats , and is in the scepter of the Czar of Russia . ' The Kohinoor , which now weighs about io6 carats , is one of the crown jewels of England . Graphite is a soft , black , shiny solid , which is smooth and soapy to the touch . Pure graphite is carbon . It occurs native in large quantities and in many places . One variety is found in abundance at Ticonderoga , New York . Other famous localities are Ceylon , eastern Siberia , Bavaria , and Italy . Sometimes crystals and grains are found , but it usually occurs in flaky masses or slabs . Unlike diamond , graphite is a good conductor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is so soft that it blackens the fingers and leaves a black mark on paper when drawn across it . This property is indicated by the name graphite , which is derived from a Greek word ( grail/aein ) meaning to write . It resembles diamond in its insolubility in liquids at the ordinary temperature . Its specific gravity is 2.2 , being considerably lighter than diamond . It produces only carbon dioxide when burned in oxygen ; but unlike diamond , it turns into carbon dioxide by heating to a very high temperature in the air . Graphite was once supposed to contain lead , and is even now often incorrectly called " black lead " and plumbago . It is used to make stove polish and protective paints , as a lubricant where oil can not be used , as the principal ingredient of // graphite crucibles , in which metals are often melted , and in making electrodes for the huge electric furnaces . Immense quantities of graphite are consumed in the manufacture of lead pencils . The graphite is washed free from impurities , ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clay , and then pressed through perforated plates , from which the " lead " issues in tiny rods . These are dried , cut into the proper lengths , baked to remove all traces of moisture , and then inserted in the wooden case . In the United States in 1902 over four million pounds of graphite were mined , and over thirty-two million pounds were imported . Molten iron and other metals dissolve carbon , and when the metals cool the carbon crystallizes as graphite . Moissan incidentally obtained considerable graphite in making diamonds . Artificial graphite is now a commercial article ( see Chapter X ) . Amorphous Carbon is a broad term , including all vari-eties of coal and charcoal , lampblack , and gas carbon . They are the non-crystalline forms of impure carbon . The word amorphous means literally " without form , " and it is often used to designate soft , powdery , and uncrys-tallized substances . Coal is a term applied to several varieties of impure carbon . It may be regarded as the final product derived from vegetable matter by heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ periods . Ages ago the vegetation was exceedingly dense and luxuriant upon land slihtlraised above the seaIn rocess of time this veetation decayed , accumulated , and slowly became covered with sand , mud , and water . The heat of the earth and the enormous pressure of the overlaying deposits changed the vegetable matter into more or less Carbon and its Oxides. 18S impure carbon . This series of geological and chemical changes was repeated , and as a result we find in the earth layers or seams of carbonaceous matter varying in thickness and composition ( Fig. 26 ) . These are the coal beds . Coal beds contain proofs of their vegetable origin , viz. , impressions of vines , stems , and leaves of plants , and similar vegetable substances There are three principal kinds of coal . ( I ) Bitumi nous or soft coal is used to make illuminating gas , coke , and as a fuel for steam ; it burns with a smoky flame , and in burning produces much volatile matter . ( 2 ) Anthra cite coal is hard and lustrous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no flame , and produces an intense heat . It is used mainly for domestic purposes , ? heating and cooking , ? especially in eastern United States . ( 3 ) Lig nite or brown coal is the least valuable as fuel . It often shows the woody fiber and was probably formed much later than the other varieties . Peat , strictly speaking , is not coal , though it is used as fuel in some places , espe cially in Ireland and Holland . It is formed by the slow 1 86 Descriptive Chemistry . decay of roots and other vegetable matter under water , and represents an early stage of coal formation . The average composition of different kinds of coal is seen by the following table : more volatile matter . The- volatile matter includes nitro gen , hydrogen , and sulphur . These facts show that vege table matter , in passing through the changes which finally Carbon and its Oxides. 187 end in coal , loses volatile matter . Anthracite coal , which is found at different depths and associated with rocks of different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nous variety by the great pressure caused by mountain building . Hence it loses volatile matter and becomes hard . Coal is widely distributed in the crust of the earth , but the deposits vary in extent and quality . It underlies about one sixth of the area of the United States , the anthracite variety covering less than five hundred square miles in eastern Pennsylvania ( Fig. 29 ) . The United States now leads the world in coal production , furnishing about one third of the total supply . England for many years headed the list , and even now furnishes a large amount , for its deposits are extensive ( Fig. 30 ) . Charcoal is a variety of amor phous carbon obtained by heating wood , bones , ivory , and other organic matter in closed vessels , or by partially burning them in the air . Th ? process consists essentially in driving off the vola tile matter and retaining the carbon . Wood Charcoal is a black , brittle solid , and often has the form of the wood from which it FIG. 30. - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is insoluble , though its mineral impurities may be removed by acids . It burns without flame or much smoke , and leaves a white ash . The compact varieties conduct heat and electricity , but porous charcoal is a poor conductor . It resists the action of many chemicals ; hence fence posts , telegraph poles , and wooden piles are often charred before being // put into the ground . Most varieties are very porous , and when thrown upon water charcoal floats , owing to the presence of air in its pores . Its porosity makes charcoal an excellent absorber of gases , some varieties absorbing ninety times their bulk of ammonia gas . Sewers and foul places are sometimes purified by charcoal . It will also absorb colored substances from solutions . This is especially true of animal charcoal ( see below ) . Foul air and water may be partially purified by charcoal , which forms the essential part of many water filters in houses . Charcoal used for such a purpose , however , must be renewed or often . heated to redness ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pure carbon , the degree of purity depending upon the kind of wood used , as well as the temperature and method employed . Besides the uses of charcoal mentioned above , it is used as a fuel , in the manufacture of steel and of gunpowder , and as a medicine . It reduces oxides when heated with them , thus ? 2 CuO + C = 2 Cu + CO , Copper Oxide Carbon Copper Carbon Dioxide Wood charcoal is made either in a charcoal pit or kiln , or in a large retort . Where wood is plentiful , it is loosely piled into the shape shown in Figure 3i , and covered with turf to prevent free access of air , though small holes are left at the bottom and a larger one at the top of a central flue , so that sufficient air can pass through the pile . The wood is lighted , and as it slowly burns care is taken to regulate the supply of air , so that the wood will smolder but not burn up . The volatile matter escapes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent of the weight of the wood . This method is crude , uncertain , and wasteful . Much charcoal is now made by heating wood in closed retorts , no air whatever being admitted . By this method , which is called dry or destructive distillation , the yield of charcoal is 3o per cent and all the volatile matter is saved . In the // ordinary combustion of wood , the hydrogen forms water and the oxygen forms carbon dioxide ; but in dry distillation , where no oxygen is present , much of the hydrogen forms volatile compounds with the carbon and oxygen . Among these volatile products are methyl alcohol and acetic acid . These are commercial substances , and contribute to the profit of the process . More or less charcoal is obtained by heating any compound of carbon , e.g. sugar or starch , the charring being a test for carbon . Animal Charcoal or Bone Black is made by heating bones in a closed vessel , and by heating a mixture of blood and sodium carbonate . It contains only about ro per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ porous mineral matter of the bone , which is almost entirely calcium phosphate . Under the name of ivory black , animal charcoal is used as a pigment , especially in making shoe-black-ing . It is extensively used to remove the color from sugar sirups , oils , and other liquids colored by organic matter . Coke is made by expelling the volatile matter from soft coal , somewhat as charcoal is made from wood . It is left in the retorts when coal is distilled in the manufacture of illuminating gas . On a large scale it is made by heating a special grade of soft coal in huge brick ovens , shaped like a beehive , from which air is excluded after combus-tion begins . Sometimes the coke is made in closed retorts constructed so as to save the by-products , ? ammonia , tar ,
