 | THE American reader has some difficulty , perhaps , in comprehending the present religious crisis in France because the state under which he exist has little or no continuity with the institutions of the past . We began our political housekeeping , so to speak , in a brand-new mansion with al ! modern improvements and furniture , and it is not filled with lumbering material , accumulation of the ages , which is obviously in the way , yet , for sentimental or other reasons , we find it difficult to part with . When the French people , thirty-five years ago , attempted to set up a real republic . they were so hampered by the connection with the past that the best they could do was to found a cluttered-up , semi-monarchical institution which long ago they realized was an uncomfortable thing to live under , and which they are now trying very hard to get into workable shape . Probably no one thing has contributed more to the present condition of the most enlightened nations than a clear recognition of the principle that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history of opinion and what concerns the history of government . It is impossible to give in few words any idea of the intimate relation between Church and State in Catholic Europe that existed through the Middle Ages and into modern times . There were long quarrels between the French kings and the popes , the latter ? besides being temporal sovereigns ? attempting to uphold the moral order , the former jealous always of papal interference and claiming privileges in Church jurisdiction . Much of the resulting entanglement was cleared away by the famous Concordat between Napoleon and the unlucky Pius VII , but the government still re tained , among other things , rights in the appointment and movements of some the bishops which Leo XIII attempted to ignore . The consequences were disastrous to the Catholic Church in France . With all the great pontiff 's tact and diplomacy it must be admitted that he . failed utterly in dealing with the French republic . The present pope has seen fit to continue his predecessor 's policy until now a bill to abolish the Concordat , and separate Church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this issue the conservative element in France is wringing its hands , the liberals are rejoicing . In order that the COSMOPOLITAN 'S readers may view the situation from both sides , a distinguished representative of each has been asked to sum up his ideas of the ultimate effect of the step . Senator Clemenceau , the liberal , paints a very different picture from that of the orthodox Marquis de Castellane . The impartial reader may draw his own conclusions . He will not lose sight of the fact , however , that the great destructive achievements of modern civilization ? the decay of superstition , the cessation of religious persecution , the secularization of politics , industry , literature and art and the decline of the martial spirit ? have been brought about through the evolution of the reason and not by any change in the emotional nature or the human passions . The gradual retirement of dogmatic belief as a part of the outer life into the sphere of the inner has settled the status of religious opinion as a matter of the individual conscience Therefore it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French government has just taken will in the end mean " liberty , " as Senator Clemenceau says , or spell " anarchy , " according to the Marquis de Castellane. @#  | I am asked to deal briefly for the great American public with the question , " Why ought France to effect the separation of Church and State ? " And at the very moment when I formulate the problem in black and white , it occurs to me that it would to Americans seem much more natural if one asked , " What is the reason why we have not up till now separated the Church from the State ? " Fora people that has in so striking a manner developed all the constitutive elements of social order , in absolute liberty f religious conscience , may have some difficulty in un-derstanding how the anent peoples of Europe , authors of civilization , still cling to old traditions that often enough sorely confine liberty in the narrow grooves of antiquated prejudices . The social organism and laws of Europe bear the same contrasts to those of Ameri a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the modern ones of the New ? the former urban agglomerations , displaying constructions having no utility at the present day , but often altered to modern conditions at the sacrifice of the original plan ; the latter built on lines of elementary simplicity , looking solely to the greatest commodity of the inhabitants . Between Europe and America we see the same contrasts in institutions as in cities . Your destiny was to work freely on a cleared and open field at an epoch when the chief data of modern society were already being evolved . You have begun afresh , from one end to another , whereas the old European nations continued to work on the ancient foundations , lopping , and patching up the shreds of discredited institutions , completing them with new portions more or less adapted to the purpose . A similar heritage came to you , I know , from the old laws of England . But , being good innovators , while not despising the respectable traditions of olden days , you have boldly traced out your own route ? a very modern route @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the matter of religious liberty , your work was the more deserving as your great Puritan ancestors , beginning with the " blue laws " of New England , thought to found their ideal society on an absolute confusion in the political and religious arenas . But into this very religious arena itself , Reform had brought her fertile seed of the New World ? liberty , and with your care the little grain pushed down its timid roots , and spread out toward the sky a frail stem from among the wild rocks of New England . A century and more has passed since then , and now the tree extends its majestic branches over an immense civilized continent . 50 Cosmopolite  | Liberty in the arena of religion , according to the spirit of Reform , leads as a natural corollary to liberty in the political arena . I do not need to tell you what you have done in this respect . But when you turn to us to ask us why we wish to separate the Church from the State , it is enough if we reply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? completely free in every sense of the feeling and the thought . " When I have said this , I have in truth said all . If you still wish to know why this idea did not come to the imaginations of our people sooner , I remark that with the Catholic nations liberty did not issue from the religious arena to invade more or less slowly the political arena , as has happened among Protestant nations . Wherever the power of Rome has been maintained in its full sovereignty , it has been the contrary ? namely , issuing from the political sphere , liberty has sought to conquer the religious . Judge , then , what confusion results when in the Roman Catholic edifice we find politics and religious belief closely bound together . The whole history of the Roman Catholic Church , every decisive utterance of the popes which has given it its life-strength and its machinery , and every act which has been the consequence thereof , have shown it to be the greatest establishment for universal domination that man has been able to conceive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it here ? to speak either of its weakness or its strength . The only thing I am here concerned in noting is that it is a church of authority , whereas the Protestant Church sprang from the protests of liberty . The Catholic organization of Rome is a pure theocracy , whereas the Protestant organization is , if I may use the word , an anthropocracy . God governs man by priests in the one case ; while in the other man governs himself at his own risk and peril in this world and in the next . Do you understand now , my American friends , why we have had so much trouble to free ourselves ? Remember that there is no fundamental question of the political or social system of all times and of all countries for which the Roman Catholic Church has not a solution ? all cut and ready , setting aside all others as incompatible with its dogma . In the Syllabus , the official code of the Church , you will find haughtily condemned in the most for- mal terms both " liberty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and liberalism and modern civilization , with which it is written that the Church can never reconcile itself . It goes without saying that the separation of Church and State is equally repudiated therein , since Church and State should be closely united ? the State being subordinate ? in order to bar the way to " liberty of error , " which threatens that " liberty of truth " of which the Church is the unique depository . Do I need to insist on the consequences ? You see the Roman cardinals taking their place in public ceremonies before ministers of the French Republic in order to show the inferiority of civil power ; you find the Church trying to forestall and to monopolize public instruction and working by the power of the Church against all attempts at private instruction , which are condemned beforehand to failure if the State does not lend its aid . The theocratic authority is propagated by the Roman Catholic school , just as liberty is by the democratic school of America . Do not take it that in my opinion the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No . Wherever the Catholic Church is in a minority , it is condemned by that simple fact to demand liberty , to live by it , and propagate it by a doctrine of compromise between its own ideal absolutism and the practices to which the necessities of time and place force it . Thus in France at the present time the Church is continually demanding liberty ( condemned of all the encyclicals ) , while fighting step by step for its ancient State privileges , which meant money , official prestige and power . The French Chamber has just voted a bill for the separation which has been submitted to the Senate . By it the Churches , which are the property of the communes and of the State , are left to the cult . All property allocated by donors to the exercise of religion ( sixty million dollars ) is transferred to the religious societies which will be founded voluntarily . And the eight million four hundred thousand dollars of salaries of the clergy , which will in two years be suppressed , are to be transformed into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year will be seven million dollars . And Rome talks of persecution ! As for me , I say that we are seeking painfully and by grievous ways for liberty .  | Old nations are like old trees : they will not bear transplanting . Change the earth in which they have flourished , submit them to cold when they have been used to warmth , or to . heat when they have been used to cold , and you will soon see them droop and assume a faded appearance most disquieting for those who have admired and tended them . The condition of France to-day resembles that of an old tree which has been uprooted and replanted in a strange soil . It droops under the treatment of men who , more revolutionary than wise , seek by separating the Church from the State to destroy the conditions under which the country has flourished . For fourteen hundred years ( longi devi spatium ! ) the two powers had lived under the regime of a mitigated union : knowing each other , intermingling , rendering mutual assistance , on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alliances prompted by reason and love . Now , picture to yourself two old people , an aged Philemon and Baucis , who all their lives had been absolutely dependent upon each other , suddenly separated and condemned never to see each other except with the consent of the police and the municipal authorities . What confusion ! What tears ! would ensue . Take , for instance , one of your sons . As soon as he has reached the age of fifteen he goes and comes alone , he knows that in this world everything has its price , that one has a right only to what one has earned by the efforts of one 's intelligence , or by labor . He is taught that whoever has a faith has a right to proclaim it , and must assume the duty of providing for its ministers . In a word , you have carefully taught him responsibility . At the age of twenty-one all American citizens are truly free men : free in their relations with the State ; even more free with regard to their own selves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When he is fifteen he is watched over like a little child and has not learned anything of the strenuousness of life . All difficulties have been cleared from his path . His father and mother may have eaten dry bread : he has not noticed it . All he knows is the routine of conventionality and contempt for individual effort . When he is twenty-one he is the slave of his indolence , his ignorance , and the conditions formed around him by his family . All obstacles have been cleared from his path , and he has never been obliged to make a decision . It is such a creature as this that is suddenly called upon to build up a faith , and to provide for its support with his own money , whereas he has never in all his life been required to undertake such an expense . It is rank madness . He is utterly incapable of accomplishing such a task ! As soon as the State ceases to be high priest of his religion , and to provide for its 52 Cosmopolite  | support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and at most breathe a sigh over its disappearance from the sphere of his daily life . If , on the other hand , all France , fired by a praiseworthy zeal , should take advantage of the withdrawal of Government support to set out upon a campaign of religious propaganda , with all the expenses and sacrifices which such a step would entail ? then it is the State which would be threatened with destruction . Religious conditions in France are totally different from what they are in the United States . We may be said to have only one faith ; among the thirty-eight million inhabitants of this country there are not more than one million two hundred thousand Protestants and Jews . Is it illusory to suppose that the thirty-seven million Catholics enrolled under the same banner , with no counterbalancing power to keep them in check , might at a moment turn against the State which has given them ' their freedom and make war upon it ? This colossal association will suddenly become a redoubtable force when the State loses its power to curb it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be as rich as the State , or able to control it by keeping up a pretense of protection . In a country where unity of faith is absolute , the Government , if it does not defend itself , becomes oppressed . This is why in the majority of cases , under circumstances such as at present exist in France , the State becomes the oppressor . It perceives the approaching battle and is the first to open hostilities . The third difficulty which arises in the problem of the separation of Church and State is what I would term the question of the classes . As soon as the State severs all ' connection with religious organizations , the priesthood , which ought to belong to all classes , and particularly the lower ones , becomes the tool of the aristocracy . This condition of affairs arises invariably in all countries where the separation of Church and State prevails , but among a nation the aristocracy of which is almost unanimously Catholic and Royalist such a state of affairs would fast become intolerable . The foundations of the republic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two others , we arrive at this result : that the regime of the separation can not be implanted without bringing about one of the following alternatives : Either the State will be given a dangerous rival , or the Catholics will be threatened with the scattering , if not the total suppression , of their religion . And yet , liberal or not , dangerous to the State or homicidal to the Church , the separation of Church and State in France will sooner or later take place because it must , since logic is stronger than sentiment , and logic says that a State which has the pretension to declare itself secular ? and which , indeed , is so ? can not possibly know much about religion or how to practice it . It seems difficult enough , in the face of all this , to understand why certain prominent politicians refused to take the matter up . Since it was bound , in the natural course of events , to crop up some day or other , it would have been much more sensible to examine the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oppose its discussion . On the other hand , it is even more difficult to comprehend the brutality with which the question has been treated . It now seems only too clear that the foremost idea of those who started the dispute was one of hatred and intolerance . Approached calmly , with all the consideration which is due the ancient institutions of the French State on the one hand , and the Papacy on the other , the matter might have been brought to a dignified conclusion . The minister who could have brought about the separation of the Church and State on the lines of diplomacy , if not on those of the Concordat , would without doubt have been universally proclaimed a great statesman . Summarily dealt with , as it is at present ? one might almost say insultingly , since the main impulse of its originators was a tardy reply to the pretended provocation of Cardinal Merry del Val , Secretary of State to the Holy See ? it will fatally become an apple of discord , thrown among a nation already overstocked with a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of view , the separation of Church and State spells anarchy . Only the blind can not see it .
