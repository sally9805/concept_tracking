 | The last few years have witnessed a remarkable revival of interest in Southern history . New professorships have been established in our colleges and trained specialists employed to fill them . Courses dealing with one or more of the various phases of Southern history now have a place in nearly every college curriculum . Not only this , but the colleges are constantly sending young men to the Northern universities , where the library facilities enable them to pursue their researches . The work of the Johns Hopkins Lniversity in colonial history and the works of Columbia in the colonial and reconstruction periods will give some idea of what has been done and what may be expected in the future . Along with this movement in the colleges and largely as a result of it there has gone an unwonted activity in the formation of local historical societies and in the collection and preservation of historical material of every description . We need mention only the names of Houston , McCrady , and Schaper to show that South Carolina has not lagged behind in the general revival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the material , original and secondary , for a study of the colonial history of the State . The most valuable sources exist only in manuscript . As these can be of little service to the general student we will refer to them very briefly and then devote our attention chiefly to the material in print . In the first place come the journals of the colonial legislature preserved in the office of the secretary of state at Columbia . There are thirty-eight volumes of the Council journals averaging about three hundred and fifty pages each . About one-half treat of the council in its executive capacity and the remainder in its legislative capacity . The first volume covering the period from 1671 to 1720 is very fragmentary . Volume two begins with 1722 and the records are fairly complete until 1774 . The jour- nals of the Commons House of Assembly , bound in thirty-nine volumes , extend from the final separation of the legislature into two houses in 1692 down to the fall of the royal government in 1775 . There are a few short chasms in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a period of six years from 1728 to 1734 . A second great mine of information is to be found in the Public Records of the colony . In the year 1891 , largely through the efforts of Mayor Courtenay of Charleston , the legislature of South Carolina appointed a Public Record Commission primarily for the purpose of securing copies of all papers in the British Public Record office relating to the colonial history of the State . Mr. W. Noel Sainsbury was selected to do the work and he was instructed to fill in the chasms in the journals already referred to . The entire collection , which is now deposited in the secretary of state 's office , consists of thirty-six bound volumes of the records and four extra volumes of the missing journals averaging about three hundred pages each . The records contain commissions and instructions to the governors , correspondence between the board of trade and the colonial officials , and various other documents that help to make clear the exact relationship existing between the home government and the colony . These journals and records are invaluable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The struggle between the royal governor and the popular branch of the legislature , which is the most conspicuous feature of eighteenth century colonial history , may here be traced in all its wearisome details . Such a study is necessary , too , in order to understand the attitude of South Carolina in the Revolution and in the convention of 1787 . A hundred or more volumes of land grants and plats , some correspondence , mostly of the revolutionary period , and a few maps complete the list of manuscript material at Columbia . In Charleston there are some fragmentary parish records and the proceedings of the court of admiralty preserved in the office  | of the United States district attorney . The Public Library contains an almost complete file of the South Carolina Gazette from 1731 to 1800 , and some very rare pamphlets . Of the printed material more accessible to the student , we will consider first that dealing with the general social and political history , and then in order the legal , ecclesiastical , educational , and local history . The chief source @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Historical Society . Five volumes have been issued . The first three contain abstracts and lists of documents in the British Public Record Office , which will be of considerable value until the State sees fit to publish the collection in full . In the third volume will also be found the Journal of the Second Council of Safety , appointed by the Provincial Congress , from November 30 , 1775 , to February 26 , 1776 . Volume five , issued in 1897 , is the most important of all for a study of the settlement and early history of the colorrv . It is entitled " The Shaftesbury Papers and other Records relating to Carolina and the first settlement on Ashley River prior to the year 1676 . " A brief history of these documents may prove of some interest . In 1871 , Anthony Ashley Cooper , seventh Earl of Shaftesbury , turned the papers of his illustrious ancestor over to the British Public Record Office . They were arranged and catalogued by Mr. Sainsbury , and abstracts of all matter relating to Carolina were prepared for publication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mayor Courtenay secured complete copies of these papers through Mr. Sainsbury and made use of them in his speech at the centennial celebration of Charleston in 1883 . A few of them were published from time to time in the Charleston Year Book , but not until the Historical Society took up the matter in 1897 have all been made accessible in print . Among the many documents of interest to the student of history is a copy of the first set of the Fundamental Constitutions of 1669 , as prepared by John Locke , together with interlineations showing the changes made before its adoption by the Lords Proprietors . The correspondence of Shaftesbury and the other proprietors with the early colonial governors , the commissions and instructions sent out , and the description of the voyage and settlement on the Ashley river are all of historical value and good  | use has been made of them by General McCrady in his volume on the proprietary period . In addition to the Shaftesbury Papers are some fragmentary journals of the Grand Council from July 22 , 1672 , to June 12 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book in Columbia , 1851 , and recently published for the first time . A second printed source is Carroll 's Collections . In 1836 Mr. B. R. Carroll published in two volumes his " Historical Collections of South Carolina , embracing many rare and valuable Pamphlets and other Documents relating to the History of that State from its first Discovery to its Independence in the year 1776 . " The first volume is a reprint of Hewatt 's history . The second is of more importance . It contains a number of pamphlets , such as those of Ash , Archdale , Purry , Yonge , and Glen , describing the social and political conditions of the colony at different periods , together with other material of more or less value . These two collections , made by the Historical Society and by Mr. Carroll , together with Cooper 's " Statutes at Large " and the appendix to Rivers ' history , constitute the chief printed sources for the colonial history of South Carolina . Of less importance , but still worthy of mention , is Robert Mills ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appendix to his " Atlas of the State . " It contains statistical material on the natural , civil , and military history of the State , some of which is taken from sources not entirely reliable . His district statistics are , however , of considerable value , presenting information of a local character which can not be obtained elsewhere . The first general history of the colony was Rev. Alexander Hewatt 's " Historical Account of the Rise and Progress of the Colonies of South Carolina and Georgia , " published in London in 1779 . For many years Dr. Hewatt was pastor of the Scotch Presbyterian Church in Charleston . Like many other tories , he fled to England on the outbreak of the Revolution . Ramsay states that Lieutenant-Governor Bull assisted him in the preparation of his history . The treatment of the proprietary period ( 1670-1719 ) is not very trustworthy , since he had no access to the official papers , but derived his information largely from tra- dition and factional pamphlets . The account of the royal period up to the repeal of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete and more reliable , though still not based upon the sources which can now be obtained in manuscript . The merit of the book lies in the picture which it affords of the social and political condition of the colony in the eighteenth century . The second general history of South Carolina is that of Dr. David Ramsay , published in 1A09 in two volumes . For the colonial period Ramsay 's work is little more than a mere abridgment of Hewatt . The second volume , however , contains some interesting chapters on the ecclesiastical , medical , legal , and commercial history of the State as well as several biographical sketches and some valuable local history . Part of this deals with the later colonial period . Next in order of time is the history by William Gilmore Simms , published in 1842 . This work is of no historical value , being based entirely on secondary sources . The author , however , occasionally exhibits in his history that dramatic power which has given him fame as a novelist . There was no really trustworthy history of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ J. Rivers published his " Sketch of the History of South Carolina to the close of the Proprietary Government , 1719 . " Rivers was a professor in South Carolina College and a very careful and intelligent investigator . His work is based largely on original documents , of which he has published some of the most important in an appendix . The great authority for the colonial history of South Carolina is , of course , the recent works of General Edward McCrady : " South Carolina under the Proprietary Government , 1670-1719 , " and " South Carolina under Royal Government , 1719-1776 . " General McCrady is a leading member of the Charleston bar and president of the Historical Society of South Carolina . The first volume follows pretty closely the work of Rivers . The author , however , has made use of the Shaftesbury papers and the North Carolina Colonial Records . Hence his account of the settlement and early history of the Ashley river colony is much more complete . An interesting feature is the description of the conflict between churchmen and dissenters in 1704 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but his treatment  | is above the suspicion of partisanship . The influence of the settlers from Barbadoes is for the first time duly appreciated . It would seem that they did much more than the over-praised Huguenots to form that aristocratic social and political structure which was the peculiar characteristic of South Carolina in the days before the war . The general arrangement of the volume on the royal period is as follows : Beginning with the overthrow of the proprietary government in 1719 , there is a series of chapters on the political history , arranged in strict chronological order . Then follow a few chapters on the social , industrial , religious , and educational life of the people . These are extremely valuable pictures ? based , as they are , not only on a careful study of family records and contemporary newspapers , but to a large extent upon the personal experience of the author ; for the Charleston of his boyhood days differed little from the Charleston of 1765 . Following up these parenthetical chapters , the political history is again taken up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as governor , in the year 1775 . In the preparation of both these volumes General McCrady has made the mistake of neglecting the Public Records and the Journals of the Council and Assembly at Columbia . The material accessible in Charleston , both published and unpublished , has been very carefully read and digested . A more careful study of the Columbia sources would not be likely to discredit many of his statements and conclusions , but it might have altered the proportions of his work . A third volume , entitled " South Carolina in the Revolution 1775-1780 , " gives a very interesting account of the transition from colonial to State government , as well as the political and military history of the State during the Revolution . There remains to be mentioned a few other works of historical value . The Charleston Year Books , especially those from 1880 to 1886 , contain many articles and rare documents relating to the colonial period . In the Johns Hopkins University studies are three monographs on South Carolina . Prof. Burr J. Ramage has an article on  | " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which has some references to the colonial period , though in the main treating of the early attempts of the State to give a system of local government to the up-country . Mr. Shirley C. Hughson 's " Carolina Pirates and Colonial Commerce " is an excellent account , based on original documents , of the struggles of the young colony with the dreaded sea-rovers . Volume thirteen contains Mr. Edson L. Whitney 's article on the " Government of the Colony of South Carolina . " He treats the subject topically and bases his work almost exclusively on the statutes . Had he devoted more attention to the political history and used it as a clue to interpret the constitutional changes , which the statutes and official reports merely indicate , his narrative would be more interesting to the readers and of more historical value . A more recent contribution is William A. Shaper 's " Sectionalism and Representation in South Carolina , " which was awarded the Justin Winsor prize of the American Historical Association for 1900 . Dr. Schaper discusses the antagonism between the upcountry and the low-country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Going back into the colonial period he finds the origin of the feeling in the differences in natural resources and in the differences in the character of the population in the two sections . The English , French Huguenot , and English Barbadian settlers in the low country had established their aristocratic social and political system on a firm basis when an invasion of Outlanders ? Germans and Scotch-Irish from the colonies to the northward ? threatened to overthrow it . " The idea of limiting the poker of numbers " which developed out of these circumstances had its influence on national affairs . It explains the attitude of the South Carolina delegates in the convention of 1787 and shows why it was that the State became the home of nullification and secession . Mr. Schaper 's style is clear and his reasoning sound . No student of American history should neglect to read this book , for it helps to explain the political philosophy of the South in the days before the war .  | page deleted  | For the ecclesiastical history the leading works are Frederick Dalcho 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carolina , from the First Settlement of the Province to the War of the Revolution , " ( 1820 ) ; Anderson 's " History of the Church of England in the Colonies , " ( 3 vols. , 1856 ) ; George Howe 's " History of the Presbyterian Church in South Carolina , " ( 2 vols. , 1870 ) ; Furman 's " History of the Charleston Association of Baptist Churches , " ( 1811 ) ; L. H. Shuck 's " Historical Sketch of the First Baptist Church of Charleston , " in the Year Book for 1881 ; Nathaniel Levin 's " Historical Sketch of the Congregation Beth Elohim of Charleston , " in the Year Book for 1883 ; Bernheim 's " History of the German Settlements and of the Lutheran Church in North and South Carolina , " ( 1872 ) ; and various pamphlets relating to the Huguenots , published by the Huguenot Society of America . On the subject of colonial education may be mentioned McCrady 's article on " Education in South Carolina prior to and during the Revolution , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Historical Society ; Colyer Meriwether 's " History of Higher Education in South Carolina , " published by the national bureau of education ( 1888 ) ; and Ramage 's article on " Local Government and Free Schools in South Carolina , " already referred to . There are a few good local histories , such as Bishop Gregg 's " History of the Old Cheraws , " ( 1867 ) ; John Belton O'Neall 's " Annals of Newberry , " ( 1859 ) ; Chapman 's " History of Edgefield County , " ( 1897 ) ; Landrum 's " Colonial and Revolutionary History of Upper South Carolina , " ( 1897 ) ; and also some material of a local character in Mill 's " Statistics " and in an appendix to Ramsay . The most complete bibliography of South Carolina colonial history yet published is that by Professor Edson L. Whitney in the Annual Report of the American Historical Association for 1894 . McCrady has a good critical chapter on the subject in his volume on the Proprietary Government .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
