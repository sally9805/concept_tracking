In hitting a mark a great deal depends on clearness of vision . It is advisable to decide , in the first place , at which mark to aim . In the matter of arranging a system of public schools the state is trying to hit a mark , and it behooves it to know just what that is and where it lies . And in the putting of the system into practice , all the way along the line , it would be well if the aim could be kept in mind , distinct and clear . The teacher who assigns the daily lessons , the board that determines curricula , the public that supports and influences schools , need constantly to ask themselves two questions : What is the mark ? and , How can it be reached ? It is , indeed , difficult to keep one 's eyes open all the time , difficult to keep asking these questions and answering them ; it is natural enough , perhaps , that they should go unanswered and unasked now and then . But if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the aim is sure to miss . Then it is time to wake up . And such a moment seems , in a certain point , to be the present . As for the teachers , it may be they do sometimes incline to assign the next lessors because it comes next in the book . We hear much , and need to hear snuck , : shout the necessity of elevating the standard of instruction . But the teachers are the least of this trouble ; they keep their eyes open pretty well ; and they are better than the system . The standard most in need of elevation is that of the intelligence , whether localized in school boards or left at large in the community , by which the system is arranged and directed . From a multitude of causes the direction has gone blind . School boards are all too regularly composed of men ignorant of that which they prescribe ; college councils arc the scene of faction and of misshapen compromise . Blinding to both , and to the public as well , is the confusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notions as to what we want to do in our public schools ; we most separate ? and distinguish our various aims ; we must direct our education straight ; we must find out where we wish to go , or we shall continue to arrive nowhere . The broadest division of the aims of public education gives us two : cultural and vocational . ' Po this division of aims corresponds a like division of the subjects of study , some being properly cultural , others properly vocational . To it , again , corresponds a division of kinds of study for cultural study , as a rule , is general and broad ; while vocational study , as a rule , is special and minute . Vocational studies train to produce ; cultural studies , to appreciate . The proper result of vocational study is skill ; of cultural study , taste . ' Elle confusion of these aims is the chief ? cause of the present blindness of our education . Nearly every course in every school tries for both at once , and consequently misses altogether . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ require vocational courses , dealing with vocational subjects ; cultural aims require cultural courses , dealing with cultural subjects . Is that not almost too obvious a remark ? Yet it needs to be made , and mails , again , and shouted , for education is getting a little deaf ( in the high places ) as well as blind . And to this must be added the insistence that each aim be kept pure . In vocational courses the vocational aim must be supreme . In cultural courses the minimal aim must be supreme . Cultural subjects may at a later period be pursued for vocational ends . This occurs whenever a student determines to specialize , most commonly through a desire to teach . A student who will leach a subject must have special and minute work in it ; he makes it his vocation , and needs vocational instruction . But a course in a cultural subject , when guided by a vocational aim , is a vocational course . hence we shall include such under vocational courses , or , when an exacter term is desirable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two aims are separate and distinct . Partly so by the nature of the various subjects of study appropriate to each ; for vocational subjects may not profitably be taught for cultural purposes , and the vocational end in cultural subjects may on no account be set until the pure cultural aim has been attained . Partly so , again , by the difference of desire on the part of the students ; an intelligent student wants instruction for one purpose or the other , and not for both at once . Hence separate courses are necessary . But this ? in this discrimination ? is where our system of education fails . It teaches vocational subjects partly with the cultural aim , cultural subjects partly with the vocational aim . In theory , indeed , it admits the distinction ; but in practice it has gone off into the jungle . Of course taste results from a vocational course , ? a vocational subject taught with a vocational aim , ? to a slight degree ; and , likewise to a slight degree , a cultural course ? a cultural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Taste and skill are not wholly disjunct . Taste must try its hand before it can fully appreciate ; and skill can not produce well till it has learned to judge . lint the point is that in aim the twe separate , that the routes leading le two are different routes , that the which results from a cultural course . ! he taste which results from a vocati , , , , 11 course , are by-products , not include , in the aim , but wholly adventitious . They are not to be rejected ; but they arc sought . The single thing that should sought is , in the vocational course , in the cultural course , taste . The fault of the vocational cour , s is that they do not give true , practical shill . They talk too much about inculcating virtue . It is not virtue one wants in his carpenter or his lawyer , but virtut , itj . Just as the vocational student , fixing his eye on skill , is about to shoot straight , the theorizing educator nudges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . Then skill escapes , and 0111y a moulted feather flutters down from taste . The nudge spoiled the shot . Vocational courses must leave culture to the cultural courses , and attend to their own business , They must make themselves practical . They must look out into the world and see what it wants of then . They must keep their eye on the market . Manual training , therefore , should pla its products on sale , and fill orders for work it is prepared to do ; business training should secure business work from business men for its students , and professional training , likewise , professional work from professional men . This will serve to keep the training real and of value in the world as well as in the school . Something of this kind is clone in schools of law , where the student is allowed to do law work in offices ; and pedagogy sends its students out to observe actual teaching in the schools . But the practice is merely sporadic , and nowhere is the principle recognized as fundamental . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the world at large . Its the old days of apprenticeship and Wanderjahre this was not so . Then the learner was up against the market Making Education Hit the Hark 4 ; 35 start to finish .

The cultural courses , on the other it aWI. do not give true , vital taste . They talk too much about scientific methods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason ( though only ! he pedagogue cares what it is ) , but it .. , 1110t give taste birth . Taste depends limn liking . To have taste in a matter is , first , to have taste for it . It is , indeed , eolonionly claimed that study of a subject at school will awaken a love for it . This is the common cant of education . It is indulged in by school boards , by hobby-riding pedagogians , by teachers on parade . But everybody knows it is prate , and the schoolboy most of all . Ile does not learn to love anything because he stud-it 's it in school , but , if he does love anything he studies there , it is because of his own natural instinct for it , and distinctly in spite of what he is Made to do with it in school . The charge is , perhaps , especially applicable to the high school . Take it , for instance , in literature . How many learn to love Homer ? What boy carries his . IIneid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Or ask an intelligent and wide-awake boy ? not a crawling high-grade seeker after marks ? why he never reads Shakespeare at home , and he will reply , " Because I get enough of him in school . " This is the attitude of those who are learning to " love " Shakespeare ! It would seem , indeed , from the condition of Shakespeare on our stage , that we all get enough of him in school . A big noise is made on the occasion of a big-priced production by a big-advertised star , that the full house refutes the charge that Americans do not love Shakespeare . It does no such thing . It refutes nothing but the supposition that Americans love anything so linteh as bigness . To take the monetary success of occasional and extraordinary performances , appealing to our liking for the unusual and the demonstrative , as indicative of love , suggests that . We no longer know what love is . Love of Shakespeare on the stage would mean the success of frequent , ordinary performances in every town large enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for instance , as the love of Wagner in Germany . Or , again , of Shakespeare . For it is not only in her own dramatist , but in ours as well , that Germany can teach us what art-love is . The appreciation of Shakespeare is far more general and genuine there than here . The continuousness of his success , despite the frequency and mediocrity of the performances , despite the lack of all bigness and eclat , shows that it is Shakespeare that is loved . But then , what could one expect ? The Germans do not , like us , get enough of biro in school . The dose , it must be confessed , that we receive in school , is hardly such as to taste like more . A glance at the Shakespeare textbooks is sufficient . One quarter introduction , one quarter Shakespeare , too quarters commentary . No healthy-minded boy can relish such a sandwich . lie feels , somewhere in the silent depths of his silent consciousness , that there is something wrong when he is expected to love Shakespeare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think the wrong lies with him . He will admit , therefore , that he ought to like Shakespeare ; but nothing short of the willingness to lie for the sake of shutting off inquiry ? a virtue born of schools ? will compel him to admit that he does . Nor , considering the Shakespeare of the schools , can this be any but an encouraging symptom of the persistent sanity of youth . deleted material well to take lessons from the Gertoiot but it forgot , in attempting to copy , Ina it rests upon a much smaller base nrin its model . The accomplishment 1 , i-ions to college is much greater in Cermany than here . There , on entering a university , students have already acquired a sufficiently , broad acquaintance rt.1 power of observation ; they are ready for analysis and theory . The work of a Gorman university is consequently justified in being , in cultural subjects , chiefly n al vt ic and theoretical . But here , on en - nring college , students have not formed a sufficient acquaintance nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pure analysis and theory . The work of the American college is consequently not justified in being chiefly analytic and theoretical . Here , then , is a discrepancy ; here lies the fault . Lr the way of a remedy , the worst has been selected . Since the trouble is that students in college are not prepared for courses of analysis and theory , lacking too much in observation and acquaint-:ewe , the obvious thing to do is to increase their acquaintance and observation , either by lengthening the period of preparation before college or by postponing in college the advent of analysis and theory to the later years . But neither of these plans was followed . For the dominating influence was that of the graduate school , the present veiled prophet of our ednealion . Its learned investigators , ? was not their word the Sand law ? But they , absorbed in analysis and theory , engaged in running down the Germanic prefix lie , wrestling with ' Folic forms in the dialect of Homer , deciphering the correspondence of a Thomas Cromwell , and such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an aim as the acquisition of culture ? Moreover , they had quite forgotten that their beloved analysis and theory can not properly begin except upon a broad basis of acquaintance and observation . Dominating the college , they made its work chiefly analytic and theoretical , error number one . When they found that the college students could not do the a nil lytie work that they required , they demanded that the high school train in analytic methods , ? error number two . Thus the vocational aim of the graduate school in subjects of culture has been thrust downward through the college and the high school , and even come to permeate the grammar school , so that now the whole of education from start to finish has become a matter of analysis and theory . Culture and taste receive none but an empty attention . The order of learning is thrown into a confusion almost inextricable . The sore point in this graduate school remedy , and one that must make even its tough-skinned inventors occasionally wince , is that it does not remedy . For analysis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exist only , as has been said above , upon a broad and solid basis of acquaintance and observation ; and in curtailing and vitiating these the remedy weakens the very support it was supposed to strengthen . First , then , observation of phenomena to form acquaintance . In analysis there are two steps : study of classified phenomena to gain known theory ; and investigation of unclassified phenomena to establish new theory . Such the unalterable order . It is true , of course , that observation must last throughout . Analysis most he accompanied by fresh observation , and , again , fresh observation must accompany investigation . And upon investigation will attend analysis . But it remains true that observation must make the start and be developed to a certain power before analysis may set in ; and that investigation must be postponed till last of all . In each of tire three stages the aim of the preceding will be present , but subordinated from aim to means ; while the proper aim of each stage will reign supreme . It is impossible to assign each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that each school is to be dominated by one of them . Since , indeed , the first and last aims will naturally fall to the first and last schools , the aim of the grammar school must be observation for acquaintance and that of the graduate school be investigation for theory . But in the intermediate schools , the high school and the college , the aim in this regard depends upon the stage which the particular study has reached . A subject in which a good acquaintance has been gained in the grammar school may aim at theory in the high school . But cultural subjects begun in the high school , or in college , must aim there only at acquaintance . The point is simply that in every subject , Wherevet begun , the order of learning must be followed . At present this order is everywl lent contravened .

' That it is tolerated by the people is largely due to the popular impression that thoroughness of knowledge demands minuteness of detail , ? an impression that is part of the general superstition of the scientific , in which our age delights to debase itself . Even were it true , it would not constitute the final word . For is thoroughness of knowledge the whole of education ? Is there nothing else in the human brain to satisfy than in craving for statistics ? Is there no feeling to be trained up to taste ? Is there no aesthetic side to be awakened , guided , formed ? We are so fearfully under the domination of the scientific spirit , we of this age , that we are blind and deaf to all else . Our aasthelic side , our taste , our feeling , we are in danger of losing . Worst of all , we regard the scientific attitude toward life as something final , conclusive , perfect . This is the superstition of the scientific .. Finality in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blinds us to our faults , and consequently to our need of change and progress . The tyranny of science is not forever ; no more than was the , tyranny of art . We look baeh the Renaissance , an age dominated hy the artistic even as ours by the sciraUhe spirit , and we point out ftlinly enough its dangers and faults . Due , we pronennae , to the predominance of the artistic spirit , to the predominance , ultimately , or ur , , spirit ; for perfection would lie in all terblending of spirits many and diverse , in the union of the scientific , artistic , nu ligious , in the harmony of the good . beautiful , the true ; and progress is lha resting finally in any one of these , but turning incessantly from one to the other , developing , adapting , unifying . Then , leaving the Renaissance and coming to ourselves , we seem to forget our recent wisdom , and , losing our vision at short range , fancy the scientific attitude Mud and complete , fancy the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of knowledge , and , gaining the body , perceive not if it be a carcass . lint , taking thoroughness of ledge not for the single end of education , which it is not , but for the high and essential end it is , it can not be maintained that it demands minuteness of detail . It depends , simply , upon what knowledge you are aiming at . Thus , if you want a general outline of is subject , you can make the knowledge of the outline thorough without going into detail . ' Thoroughness of knowledge is not minuteness , but readiness and accuracy . A thorough general knowledge of our Civil War , for instance , does not require a knowledge of every battle , but , the general outline being fixed , an Accurate and ready knowledge of that . The confusion of thorratgliness with minuteness es-en acts to prevent thoroughness .

For grammar , lacing the analytic and theoretical study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all . The scientific classification of phenomena can not begin until the phenomena have been assembled and mode familiar . To this law of learning language is no exception . The language study proper to the grammar school is observation and acquaintance , that is , mow particularly , practice in reading , milking , composing . Nor for this is the study of grammar necessary . What is necessary is a very large amount of practice ; much reading , much speaking . much composing . The only use of grammar here is a negative one , namely , to correct mistakes . And for this negative purpose the only person in the grammar school who need know grammar is the teacher . The positive , scientific study of grammar must be reserved for the high school . At present this sequence is not preserved . The result is confusion along the whole line of language work , and the loss or all good results . For grammar , being introduced at too early a period , is not apprehended . The grammar school graduates who enter the high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire work of the grammar rehool in grammar is waste . The high school , in consequence , is called on to repair the blunder . And here another blunder follows . It is , indeed , the proper duty of the high school to teach grammar . But the high school does not realize this and make provision for it . When it finds itself called on to do what it feels the grammar school should have done , it makes no real room for the course in grammar , but grudgingly attaches the study of grammar to the study of literature . This blunder is fatal to each side . For grammar is a science , and demands scientific study . Work in grammar as an adjunct to Work in literature fails to give the clear , scientific view which alone means apprehension . And the combination is disastrous to literature also . For thereby literature is led more than ever to subject itself to scientific treatment , and the study of literature for its own sake valislies away . Tisk mixture of grammar and literature together in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the confusion of aim . Grammar and literature should , indeed , both be taught in the high school , but side by side , and not intermixed . If this were done , the study of grammar would find its proper place . But even then there would remain a great evil as the result of the introduction of grammar into the grammar school . For in this way the language study proper to the grammar school , ? a study second to none in importance , and to be successfully pursued only in the grammar school , ? is thrust out , neglected , and lost . Correctness in reading , speaking , composing , is nowhere attained . Our s-cry colleges are full of English students who can neither read , speak , nor compose English . Instead , they are busy criticising Arnold and De Quineey , Tennyson and Drowning ! Certain colleges attempt to escape this istromillous disgrace by setting a universal entrance examination in English composition , and following it up , within the college gates , by a universal prescribed course . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of English remains common , even in their upper classes . The only time to form correct habits of reading , speaking , composing , is before incorrect habits have been ingrained , that is , in the grammar school . But so long as the grammar school persists in trying to teach grammar , we stall remain , in speech and composition , ungrammatical . Correctness in the use of language , anti in a use that shall lie fluent , is aim enough for one school along this line . From beginning to end the grammar school needs to devote itself to its attainment by daily practice in reading , in speaking , in composing , until ease and accuracy be won . And this attainment is worth while . It is better that our children , our men and women , read and speak and compose correctly , and remain ignorant of scientific grammar and of scientific criticism , than that , as they now are on the whole , they remain incorrect in reading , speech , and composition , and possessed of a grammatical and critical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grammar school is found in its work in mathematics . Like its language study , the mathematics of the grammar school should aim at primary , universally necessary knowledge . This means , chiefly , facility in performing the fundamental operations . It is for this that ordinary life finds a universal use for mathematics . Vet this is what the grammar school refuses to give . It is too little concerned with life and its needs , and too much with an arithmetic which , to be scientifically complete , shall contain all the varieties of problems ever cunningly devised by clever arithmeticians . The result is that it is only an occasional grammar school graduate who can be relied upon to add a column of figures with certainty and despatch . What they most want of arithmetic , it has failed to give them . Nor need it be imagined that the power for training the mind peculiar to arithmetic will go unused through confining it to the field of the useful , and forbidding its excursions off into the regions of the ingenious . The training which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much practice in easy operations . Its profound and subtle powers do not develop until later , and the effort of the trick-problem to arouse them at this ii it . is premature and harmful . Trainim ; more difficult mathematical work must be left till later years , when the //Mid is ready , and when this will properly be larded by algebra and geometry . These are but illustrations of the gra to-mar school 's need to ask itself the clues flans : What is the mark ? and , How eau it be reached ? As for the high school . it needs the same clarification of view . We have seen how it misses its aim in literature , being led astray by the prevailing tendency toward the slough of the prematurely scientific . Called upon here to awaken love , it has totally lost sense of its high calling . The formation of taste being with difficulty amenable to analysis and theory , it has been abandoned as unscientific ; and the study of literature bits undertaken in its stead training in dissection and accuracy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to its proper and higher purposes . Analytic study of language for purposes of science shoiffil be disjoined from its synthetic study for purposes of taste , and left to a separate course . And , in general , the inculcation of accuracy should be left to the exacter sciences , such as logic and mathematics . These are sufficient for this end . But they will not give taste . If the aim of taste is to be crowded out of those studies fitted to attain it , where shall it come in ? Or are WC , after all , to abandon taste , as something hardly scientific ? Let us hope not . Let us hope that the study of English literature will some time awake to its high calling ; that it will free itself from the shackles of scientific methods ; that its teachers will desire , and school boards allow , the restoration of the aim of taste ; and that its students will come to know what it is to read fine books for the love of them .

Accuracy is indeed necessary in learning a language : and to its attainment analysis and grammar are essential . But only as steps to the single aim . AI present it would seem that the high school has forgotten the aim and remaineil enmeshed in the means . Students who have had four successful years in Latin can parse and analyze ( after a fashion ) and recite rules from the grammar book . lInt give them a fresh page , and then watch their mental process ! It is that of putting a puzzle together . Everything moves by conscious rule , nothing by spontaneous feeling . Properly speaking , they can neither read nor write . Is this knowing Latin as a language ? And as for liking it ! The fond instructor dotes . The inculcation of accuracy , ? so loud a part of the despairing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must admit , within its power . But there are three fatal objections sgainst making it the paramount aim and justification of Latin in the high school . First , this aim , still more properly and efficaciously , is within the power of mathematics , and must be left , as the paramount and justifying aim , on the ethical side , to that study . Second , this aim , when it does enter into the study of Latin , belongs to a later stage , to the stage of analysis and theory , which must be preceded , in the high school , where Latin is begun , by the preliminary stage of observation and acquaintance . Third , the aim of accuracy must rest , from start to finish of the Latin course , subordinate to the more appropriate and higher aim of taste . In a day like the present , when the need is to reduce the curriculum , ? and , indeed , in every day , if a curriculum is to be rightly put together , ? every study must justify its claim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better than any other study , something admittedly wort II doing . What , then , we ask , is the unique power of Latin ? In view of logic and mathematics , its claim to inculcate accuracy can not set up to be unique . The whole treatment of Latin as a mere science , to which the linguistic of to-day , masquerading as philology , has degraded it , must , so far , at least , as beginners are concerned , be totally abandoned . The language must be taught as language . and find its justification in its revelation of the Roman race . This is the only thing admittedly worth doing which Latin does better than any other study . And the justification , how magnificent ! To know the language as language , to familiarize the brain with its processes , so that it moves freely forward in them , is to give the mind new paths of thought , and paths that shall increase , in a manner that is unique , its power of thinking . And to know the spirit of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatest incarnations ; is to gain a view of life , at an angle so widely divergent from our own that we obtain thereby an insight and an apprehension wholly new . But this mental process comes only when the brain is made to move through Latin as Latin ; deleted material clement or law , the investigator , u of touch with the general student , .. o : .1 his range of interest and compreI a : he has quite forgotten where , on le . long path of learning , the general stulso ! stands , and fails to make connection s'en the student and himself ; he on the advanced , minute points in h he is himself absorbed , and , as a keloter for general students , he proves , , e , tly judged , a failure .

Hence our college towns are full of young instructors sitting up late of nights , before countless slips of " collected cases , " tabulating nonsense The investigator , on the other hand , is required to address general classes and give to mediocre teaching the time he wants for investigation .
