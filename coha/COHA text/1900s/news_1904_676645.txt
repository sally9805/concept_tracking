txt The friends of Japan all over the world are warning her against intoxication with success , and particularly , as one of them , the military correspondent or The London Times , pelts it , against " seeking to penetrate into the recesses of Asia , in chase of a receding will of the wisp . " In fact , if peace were to be made to-day , on the basis of the " uti possidetis , " Japan would obtain much , and much the most important part , of that for which she went to war . For she is in secure possession , so far as we can see , of nil Korea . She went to war primatily to prevent Russia from gaining a lodgment in the peninsula of which Russian possession would be a perpetual menace to the independent national existence of Japan . This object is gained if Japan maintains her present position . Add a free port on the Gulf of Liautung , equal trading rights in Manchuria , and the reduction of Russia 's occupation of that province to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anj objects in Manchuria  --  and Japan we- .. , d have won her case . To demand much beyond this would be to imperil w.iat she has . What is supposed to be particularly tempting to the statesmen of Tokio is the pospect of wielding all the power of China , latent and inchoate as that power is in a military sense , in addition to her own and raining the cry of " Asia for the Asiatics , " a cry that would be far more popular in China than in Japan . The friends of Japan point out that the raising of this cry would be to " run counter to the interests of Europe and America . " It would be a notice to quit served upon every nation owning possessions east of Suez . But it is a gratifying proof that the Japanese are not overelated that they have not raised this cry . They have foregone the very tempting opportunity that seemed to be offered to them by the incompetent polAicians of China to add . the resources of that great and rich and populous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their prompt acquiescence in Mr. HAT 'S proposal to neutralize China by a guarantee of all the Powers , including the belligerents . In this view the assent of Japan was a " self-denying ordinance " for which she should have credit . The military correspondent of The London Times adds : When Mr. HAY 'S proposals fell like a bombshell in the diplomatic dovecote there was a great fluttering among the doves . In view of the previous action of the United States , Russia was suspicious of the motive , while the friends of Japan only saw her deprived of an eventual and valuable coadjutor . There were hesitation and demur . History may say that the Initiative of the United States was the most remarkable act of statesmanship of the opening years of the century , and let us hope it may add that it saved the world from the greatest menace of modern times . Reflection will surely induce all men of sense to agree that not only was Mr. HAY in the right , but that in the interests of the world 's peace , neutrality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ultima ratio " has to be resorted to in the process . Neither of the combatants would have any reason to complain , since one would be saved from a danger that is obvious and imminent , and the other from an equal danger , though one superficially less obvious and more remote .
