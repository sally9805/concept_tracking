txt Supreme Court Justice Betts , sitting in Eingston , N. Y. , decided yesterday that the Hamilton Bank may reopen at once for business , and the news threw Harlem into a flurry of joyful excitement last night Almost within an hour after the decision had been handed down every one of the bank 's 18,000 depositors knew that Justice Betts had appointed Clarence E. Bloodgood of Catskill referee for the purpose of passing on the rcceiver's'accounts and directing Receiver Frank White , who since Nov. 16 has had the affairs of the bank in his bands , to turn over the bank 's property for resumption of business , according to the modified plan as accepted by 83 to 90 per cent . of the depositors . In twos and in larger groups the elated depositors began to gather in front of the Tremont branch of the bank , until by 9 o'clock last night there were more than 1,000 men in the crowd . Capt . of the Tremont Police Station supplied a squad or reserves , and , headed by a big brass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , toward the home of President William R. Montgomery , at 1,851 Anthony Place , the Bronx . The band played popular airs , and be ? hind it the marchers sang and cheered until the procession passed the building of the Borough Bank . This Institution has ever been a rival of the Hamilton , and as the band drew near it suddenly ceased the lively airs it had been playing and swung into Chopin 's funeral march . With uncovered heads , the Hamilton depositors marched by . Once beyond , however . the singing and cheering commenced again , and it was a hilarious crowd that finally drew up before the Mine of President Montgomery . The cheers soon brought the President to the window of his home , and a moment later he stood upon his front steps . He raised his hand for silence and after a round of cheers for him this was accorded him . Then Mr. Montgomery made a speech . " I am grateful , " he said , " for this remarkable demonstration of confidence . This could not have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the depositors of the Hamilton Bank who believed , and in my judgment still believe , in the solvency of the bank and the probity of its officers and Directors . " I do not regard this as the time or place for any personal defense . My vindication will come from other quarters . I court the closest investigation that the Grand Jury can make . From the time the Hamilton Bank closed its doors to the present moment I have labored night and day for the reopening of the bank and the payment of every depositor in full . Such zeal as / have displayed has necessarily brought me scurrilous attacks from enemies of the Hamilton Bank , wino have reasons for trying to keep the institution closed . " I do not owe the Hamilton Bank a dollar , and I have never owed the bank a dollar . The technical overdrafts so widely advertised were inadvertent on my part , and upon my attention being called to them were Immediately made good . I never kept my business account In the Hamilton Bank , It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ es scores of business men before me who had received the checks knew full well , they were signed by no Montgomery . " Mr. Montgomery referred abruptly to the fact that his wife had burned some of her own vouchers , and of the construction that had been placed on this act by some . Then he said : " If she saw fit to destroy her own canceled vouchers she had a perfect right to do so . They were her own property . The bank had no control over her interest in them . " " Now that the court has granted permission for the bank to reopen , I feel Oat my efforts have not been in vain . " Mr. Montgomery was loudly cheered and applauded , and then several of the more prominent among the depositors spoke in praise of his actions while President of the Hamilton Bank . William C. Mulligan was among these , and following him came his wife , Mrs. Agnes C. Murphy Mulligan , who asserted that she should be the first in line to deposit money in the Hamilton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there with 3145.000 , the fruits of a lucky real estate deal , " she exclaimed , " and I shall put every cent of that money in the Hamilton Bank . " After a few others had spoken , the procession reformed and moved down to the home of the Rev. Peter Farrell , Father of St. Joseph 's Church , at Bathgate and Tremont Avenues . Many of Father Farrell 's parishioners were depositors in the Hamilton Bank , and the priest has been prominent in the movement to have the bank reopened . The band played more popular airs , and with songs and cheers the crowd serenaded Father Farrell . The procession then marched through the streets of the Bronx , led by the band , and always singing and cheering . The lines had not broken up to a lath hour last night One stop was made , however , at a telegraph office to send this dispatch , signed by a committee , to Justice Betts : " God bless you and yours for your act of justice in the matter of the Hamilton Bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was said to be the best of authority that the date of reopening the bank had been fixed for Thursday , Jan. 2.
