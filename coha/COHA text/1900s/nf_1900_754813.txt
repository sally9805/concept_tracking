txt //n and contests of mankind outside her orbit , which make up the history of the rest of the Old World . The long struggles for supremacy in Western Asia between Assyrian , Babylonian and Persian , the triumphs of the Greek , followed by the absorption of what remained of the Macedonian conquests in the Empire of Rome , even the appearance of Islam and the Mohammedan conquerors , who changed the face of Southern Asia from the Ganges to the Levant , and long threatened to overrun Europe , had no significance for the people of China , and reacted as little on their destiny as if they had happened in another planet . Whatever advantages the Chinese may have derived from this isolation , it has entailed the penalty that the early history of their country is devoid of interest for the lest of the world , and it is only when the long independent courses of China and Europe are brought into proximity by the Mongol conquests , the efforts of the medieval travelers , the development of commerce , and the wars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for foreigners in China  --  four distinct phases covering the last seven centuries  --  that any confidence can be felt in successfully attracting notice to the affairs of China . Yet , as a curiosity in human existence , the earlier history of that country may justly receive some notice . Even though the details are not recited , the recollection of the antiquity of China ' s institutions must be ever present with the student , as affording an indispensable clew to the character of the Chinese people and the composition of their government. @# The first Chinese are supposed to have been a nomad tribe in the province of Shensi , which lies in the northwest of China , and among them at last appeared a ruler , Fohi , whose name at least has been preserved . His deeds and his person are mythical , but he is credited with having given his country its first regular institutions . One of his successors was Hwangti ( which means Heavenly Emperor ) , who was the first to employ the imperial style of Emperor , the earlier rulers having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prince . He adopted the convenient decimal division in his administration as well as his coinage . His dominions were divided into ten provinces , each of these into ten departments , these again into ten districts , each of which held ten towns . He regulated the calendar , originating the Chinese cycle of sixty years , and he encouraged commerce . He seems to have been a wise prince and to have been the first of the great emperors . His grandson , who was also emperor , continued his good work and earned the reputation of being " the restorer or even founder of true astronomy. " @# But the most famous of Hwangti ' s successors was his great-grandson Yao who is still one of the most revered of all Chinese rulers . He was " diligent , enlightened , polished and prudent , " and if his words reflected his actions he must have been most solicitous of the welfare of his people . He is specially remarkable for his anxiety to discover the best man to succeed him in the government , and during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chun with him for that purpose . On his death he left the crown to him , and Chun , after some hesitation , accepted the charge ; but he in turn hastened to secure the co-operation of another minister named Yu in the work of administration , just as he had been associated with Yao . The period covered by the rule of this triumvirate is considered one of the most brilliant and perfect in Chinese history , and it bears a resemblance to the age of the Antonines . These rulers seem to have passed their leisure from practical work in framing moral axioms , and in carrying out a model scheme of government based on the purest ethics . They considered that " a prince intrusted with the charge of a State has a heavy task . The happiness of his subjects absolutely depends upon him . To provide for everything is his duty ; his ministers are only put in office to assist him , " and also that " a prince who wishes to fulfill his obligations , and to long preserve his people in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the laws are observed with exactitude . " They were stanch upholders of temperance , and they banished the unlucky discoverer of the fact that an intoxicating drink could be obtained from rice . They also held fast to the theory that all government must be based on the popular will . In fact , the reigns of Yao , Chun and Yu are the ideal period of Chinese history , when all questions were decided by moral right and justice , and even now Chinese philosophers are said to test their maxims of morality by the degree of agreement they may have with the conduct of those rulers. @# With them passed away the practice of letting the most capable and experienced minister rule the State . Such an impartial and reasonable mode of selecting the head of a community can never be perpetuated . The rulers themselves may see its advantages and may endeavor as honestly as these three Chinese princes to carry out the arrangement , but the day must come when the family of the able ruler will assert its rights to the succession , and take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government to carry out its ends . The Emperor Yu , true to the practice of his predecessors , nominated the president of the council as his successor , but his son Tiki seized the throne , and became the founder of the first Chinese dynasty , which was called the Hia , from the name of the province first ruled by his father . This event is supposed to have taken place in the year 2197 B.C. , and the Hia dynasty , of which there were seventeen emperors , ruled down to the year 1776 B.C. These Hia princes present no features of interest , and the last of them , named Kia , was deposed by one of his principal nobles , Ching Tang , Prince of Chang. @# This prince was the founder of the second dynasty , known as Chang , which held possession of the throne for 654 years , or down to 1122 B.C. With the exception of the founder , who seems to have been an able man , this dynasty of twenty-eight emperors did nothing very noteworthy . The public morality deteriorated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that when one of the emperors wanted an honest man as minister he could only find one in the person of a common laborer . At last , in the twelfth century before our era , the enormities of the Chang rulers reached a climax in the person of Chousin , who was deposed by a popular rising headed by Wou Wang , Prince of Chow. @# This successful soldier , whose name signifies the Warrior King , founded the third Chinese dynasty of Chow , which governed the empire for the long space of 867 years down to 266 B.C. During that protracted period there were necessarily good and bad emperors , and the Chow dynasty was rendered specially illustrious by the appearance of the great social and religious reformers , Laoutse , Confucius and Mencius , during the existence of its power . The founder of the dynasty instituted the necessary reforms to prove that he was a national benefactor , and one of his successors , known as the Magnificent King , extended the authority of his family over some of the States of Turkestan . But , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not particularly distinguished , and one of them in the eighth century B.C. was weak enough to resign a portion of his sovereign rights to a powerful vassal , Siangkong , the Prince of Tsin , in consideration of his undertaking the defense of the frontier against the Tartars . At this period the authority of the central government passed under a cloud . The emperor ' s prerogative became the shadow of a name , and the last three centuries of the rule of this family would not call for notice but for the genius of Laoutse and Confucius , who were both great moral teachers and religious reformers. @# Laoutse , the founder of Taouism , was the first in point of time , and in some respects he was the greatest of these reformers . He found his countrymen sunk in a low state of moral indifference and religious infidelity which corresponded with the corruption of the times and the disunion in the kingdom . He at once set himself to work with energy and devotion to repair the evils of his day , and to raise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been called the Chinese Pythagoras , the most erudite of sinologues have pronounced his text obscure , and the mysterious Taouism which he founded holds the smallest or the least assignable part in what passes for the religion of the Chinese . As a philosopher and minister Laoutse will always attract attention and excite speculation , but as a practical reformer and politician he was far surpassed by his younger and less theoretical contemporary Confucius. @# Confucius was an official in the service of one of the great princes who divided the governing power of China among themselves during the whole of the seventh century before our era , which beheld the appearance of both of these religious teachers and leaders . He was a trained administrator with long experience when he urged upon his prince the necessity of reform , and advocated a policy of union throughout the States . His exhortations were in vain , and so far ill-timed that he was obliged to resign the service of one prince after another . In his day the authority of the Chow emperor had been reduced to the lowest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yet one cardinal point of the policy of Confucius was submission to the emperor , as implicit obedience to the head of the State throughout the country as was paid to the father of every Chinese household . Although he failed to find a prince after his own heart , his example and precepts were not thrown away , for in a later generation his reforms were executed , and down to the present day the best points in Chinese government are based on his recommendations . If " no intelligent monarch arose " in his time , the greatest emperors have since sought to conform with his usages and to rule after the ideal of the great philosopher . His name and his teachings were perpetuated by a band of devoted disciples , and the book which contained the moral and philosophical axioms of Confucius passed into the classic literature of the country and stood in the place of a Bible for the Chinese . The list of the great Chinese reformers is completed by the name of Mencius , who , coming two centuries later , carried on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left behind him in his Sheking the most popular book of Chinese poetry and a crowning tribute to the great Master. @# From teachers we must again pass to the chronicle of kings , although few of the later Chow emperors deserve their names to be rescued from oblivion . One emperor suffered a severe defeat while attempting to establish his authority over the troublesome tribes beyond the frontier ; of another it was written that " his good qualities merited a happier day , " and the general character of the age may be inferred from its being designated by the native chroniclers " The warlike period . " At last , after what seemed an interminable old age , marked by weakness and vice , the Chow dynasty came to an end in the person of Nan Wang , who , although he reigned for nearly sixty years , was deposed in ignominious fashion by one of his great vassals , and reduced to a humble position . His conqueror became the founder of the fourth Chinese dynasty. @# During the period of internal strife which marked the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steadily waxed stronger and stronger among the princes of China : the princes of Tsin , by a combination of prudence and daring , gradually made themselves supreme among their fellows . It was said of one of them that " like a wolf or a tiger he wished to draw all the other princes into his claws , so that he might devour them . " Several of the later Tsin princes , and particularly one named Chow Siang Wang , showed great capacity , and carried out a systematic policy for their own aggrandizement . When Nan Wang was approaching the end of his career , the Tsin princes had obtained everything of the supreme power short of the name and the right to wear the imperial yellow robes . Ching Wang , or , to give him his later name as emperor , Tsin Chi Hwangti , was the reputed great-grandson of Chow Siang Wang , and under him the fame and power of the Tsins reached their culminating point . This prince also proved himself one of the greatest rulers who ever sat on the Dragon throne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by internal strife , and the authority of the emperor had been reduced to such a shadow , that peace was welcomed under any ruler , and the hope was indulged that the Tsin princes , who had succeeded in making themselves the most powerful feudatories of the empire , might be able to restore to the central government something of its ancient power and splendor . Nor was the expectation unreasonable or ungratified . The Tsins had fairly earned by their ability the confidence of the Chinese nation , and their principal representative showed no diminution of energy on attaining the throne , and exhibited in a higher post , and on a wider field , the martial and statesmanlike qualities his ancestors had displayed when building up the fabric of their power as princes of the empire . Their supremacy was not acquiesced in by the other great feudatories without a struggle , and more than one campaign was fought before all rivals were removed from their path , and their authority passed unchallenged as occupants of the Imperial office. @# It was in the middle of this final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubtful , that Tsin Chi Hwangti began his eventful reign . When he began to rule he was only thirteen years of age , but he quickly showed that he possessed the instinct of a statesman , and the courage of a born commander of armies . On the one hand he sowed dissension between the most formidable of his opponents , and brought about by a stratagem the disgrace of the ablest general in their service , and on the other he increased his army in numbers and efficiency , until it became unquestionably the most formidable fighting force in China . While he endeavored thus to attain internal peace , he was also studious in providing for the general security of the empire , and with this object he began the construction of a fortified wall across the northern frontier to serve as a defense against the troublesome Hiongnou tribes , who are identified with the Huns of Attila . This wall , which he began in the first years of his reign , was finished before his death , and still exists as the Great Wall of China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world . He was careful in his many wars with the tribes of Mongolia not to allow himself to be drawn far from his own border , and at the close of a campaign he always withdrew his troops behind the Great Wall . Toward Central Asia he was more enterprising , and one of his best generals , Moungtien , crossed what is now the Gobi Desert , and made Hami the frontier fortress of the empire. @# In his civil administration Hwangti was aided by the minister Lisseh , who seems to have been a man of rare ability , and to have entered heartily into all his master ' s schemes for uniting the empire . While Hwangti sat on the throne with a naked sword in his hand , as the emblem of his authority , dispensing justice , arranging the details of his many campaigns , and superintending the innumerable affairs of his government , his minister was equally active in reorganizing the administration and in supporting his sovereign in his bitter struggle with the literary classes who advocated archaic principles , and whose animosity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unmixed with ferocity , with which he treated them . The empire was divided into thirty-six provinces , and he impressed upon the governors the importance of improving communications within their jurisdiction . Not content with this general precept , he issued a special decree ordering that " roads shall be made in all directions throughout the empire , " and the origin of the main routes in China may be found with as much certainty in his reign as that of the roads of Europe in the days of Imperial Rome . When advised to assign some portion of his power to his relatives and high officials in the provinces he refused to repeat the blunders of his predecessors , and laid down the permanent truth that " good government is impossible under a multiplicity of masters . " He centralized the power in his own hands , and he drew up an organization for the civil service of the State which virtually exists at the present day . The two salient features in that organization are the indisputable supremacy of the emperor and the non-employment of the officials in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years has proved their practical value. @# When he conquered his internal enemies he resolved to complete the pacification of his country by effecting a general disarmament , and he ordered that all weapons should be sent in to his capital at Hienyang . This " skillful disarming of the provinces added daily to the wealth and prosperity of the capital , " which he proceeded to embellish . He built one palace within the walls , and the Hall of Audience was ornamented with twelve statues , each of which weighed twelve thousand pounds . But his principal residence named the Palace of Delight , was without the walls , and there he laid out magnificent gardens , and added building to building . In one of the courts of this latter palace , it is said he could have drawn up 10 , 000 soldiers . This eye to military requirements in even the building of his residence showed the temper of his mind , and , in his efforts to form a regular army , he had recourse to " those classes in the community who were without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physical strength . " He was thus the earliest possessor in China of what might be called a regular standing army . With this force he succeeded in establishing his power on a firm basis , and he may have hoped also to insure permanence for his dynasty ; but , alas ! for the fallacy of human expectations , the structure he erected fell with him. @# Great as an administrator , and successful as a soldier , Hwangti was unfortunate in one struggle that he provoked . At an early period of his career , when success seemed uncertain , he found that his bitterest opponents were men of letters , and that the literary class as a body was hostile to his interests and person . Instead of ignoring this opposition or seeking to overcome it by the same agency , Hwangti expressed his hatred and contempt , not only of the literary class , but of literature itself , and resorted to extreme measures of coercion . The writers took up the gage of battle thrown down by the emperor , and Hwangti became the object of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pencil . His birth was aspersed . It was said that he was not a Tsin at all , that his origin was of the humblest , and that he was a substituted child foisted on the last of the Tsin princes . These personal attacks were accompanied by unfavorable criticism of all his measures , and by censure where he felt that he deserved praise . It would have been more prudent if he had shown greater indifference and patience , for although he had the satisfaction of triumphing by brute force over those who jeered at him , the triumph was accomplished by an act of Vandalism , with which his name will be quite as closely associated in history as any of the wise measures or great works that he carried out . His vanquished opponents left behind them a legacy of hostility and revenge of the whole literary class of China , which has found expression in all the national histories. @# The struggle , which had been in progress for some years , reached its culminating point in the year 213 B.C. , when a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At this council were present not only the emperor ' s chief military and civil officers from the different provinces , but also the large literary class , composed of aspirants to office and the members of the academies and College of Censors . The opposing forces in China were thus drawn up face to face , and it would have been surprising if a collision had not occurred . On the one side were the supporters of the man who had made China again an empire , believers in his person and sharers in his glory ; on the other were those who had no admiration for this ruler , who detested his works , proclaimed his successes dangerous innovations , and questioned his right to bear the royal name . The purpose of the emperor may be detected when he called upon speakers in this assembly of his friends and foes to express their opinions of his administration , and when a member of his household rose to extol his work and to declare that he had " surpassed the very greatest of his predecessors . " This courtier-like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had had a less basis of truth than it unquestionably possessed in the case of Hwangti , was received with murmurs and marks of dissent by the literati . One of them rose and denounced the speaker as " a vile flatterer , " and proceeded to expatiate on the superior merit of several of the earlier rulers . Not content with this unseasonable eulogy , he advocated the restoration of the empire to its old form of principalities , and the consequent undoing of all that Hwangti had accomplished . Hwangti interrupted this speaker and called upon his favorite minister Lisseh to reply to him and explain his policy . Lisseh began by stating what has often been said since , and in other countries , that " men of letters are , as a rule , very little acquainted with what concerns the government of a country , not that government of pure speculation which is nothing more than a phantom , vanishing the nearer we approached to it , but the practical government which consists in keeping men within the sphere of their proper duties . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the State , and to recommend the destruction of their works , declaring that " now is the time or never to close the mouths of these secret enemies and to place a curb on their audacity . " The emperor at once from his throne ratified the policy and ordered that no time should be lost in executing the necessary measures . All books were proscribed , and orders were issued to burn every work except those relating to medicine , agriculture , and such science as then existed . The destruction of the national literature was carried out with terrible completeness , and such works as were preserved are not free from the suspicion of being garbled or incomplete versions of their original text . The burning of the books was accompanied by the execution of five hundred of the literati , and by the banishment of many thousands . By this sweeping measure , to which no parallel is to be found in the history of other countries , Hwangti silenced during the last few years of his life the criticisms of his chief enemies , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand years the sully of an inexcusable act of tyranny and narrow-mindedness . The price will be pronounced too heavy for what was a momentary gratification. @# The reign of Hwangti was not prolonged many years after the burning of the books . In 210 B.C. he was seized with a serious illness , to which he succumbed , partly because he took no precautions , and partly , no doubt , through the incompetence of his physicians . His funeral was magnificent , and , like the Huns , his grave was dug in the bed of a river , and with him were buried his wives and his treasure . This great ruler left behind him an example of vigor such as is seldom found in the list of Chinese kings of effete physique and apathetic life . He is the only Chinese emperor of whom it is said that his favorite exercise was walking , and his vigor was apparent in every department of State . On one occasion when he placed a large army of , it is said , 600 , 000 men at the disposal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear as to how this huge force was to be fed . Hwangti at once replied , " Leave it to me . I will provide for everything . There shall be want rather in my palace than in your camp . " He does not seem to have been a great general himself , but he knew how to select the best commanders , and he was also so quick in discovering the merits of the generals opposed to him , that some of his most notable victories were obtained by his skill in detaching them from their service or by ruining their reputation by some intrigue more astute than honorable . Yet , all deductions made , Tsin Chi Hwangti stands forth as a great ruler and remarkable man. @# The Tsin dynasty only survived its founder a few years . Hwangti ' s son Eulchi became emperor , but he reigned no more than three years . He was foolish enough to get rid of the general Moungtien , who might have been the buttress of his throne ; and the minister Lisseh was poisoned , either with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fate , and his successor , Ing Wang , reigned only six weeks , committing suicide after losing a battle , and with him the Tsin dynasty came to an end . Its chief , nay its only claim to distinction , arises from its having produced the great ruler Hwangti , and its destiny was Napoleonic in its brilliance and evanescence. @# Looking back at the long period which connects the mythical age with what may be considered the distinctly historical epoch of the Tsins , we find that by the close of the third century before the Christian era China possessed settled institutions , the most remarkable portion of its still existing literature , and mighty rulers . It is hardly open to doubt that the Chinese annalist finds in these remote ages as much interest and instruction as we should in the record of more recent times , and proof of this may be discovered in the fact that the history of the first four dynasties , which we must dismiss in these few pages , occupies as much space in the national history as the chronicle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ming dynasty in 1644 , at which date the official history of China stops , because the history of the Manchu dynasty , which has occupied the throne ever since , will only be given to the world after it has ceased to rule . We must not be surprised at this discursiveness , because the teachings of human experience are as clearly marked in those early times as they have been since , and Chinese historians aim as much at establishing moral and philosophical truths as at giving a complete record of events . The consequences of human folly and incompetence are as patent and conspicuous in those days as they are now . The ruling power is lost by one family and transferred to another because the prince neglects his business , gives himself over to the indulgence of pleasure , or fails to see the signs of the times . Cowardice and corruption receive their due and inevitable punishment . The founders of the dynasties are all brave and successful warriors , who are superior to the cant of a hypercivilized state of society , which covers declining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who see that as long as there are human passions they may be molded by genius to make the many serve the few and to build up an autocracy . Nor are the lessons to be learned from history applicable only to individuals . The faults of an emperor are felt in every household of the community , and injure the State . Indifference and obtuseness at the capital entailed weakness on the frontier and in the provincial capitals . The barbarians grew defiant and aggressive , and defeated the imperial forces . The provincial governors asserted their independence , and founded ruling families . The empire became attenuated by external attack and internal division . But , to use tho phrase of the Chinese historians , " after long abiding disunion , union revived . " The strong and capable man always appears in one form or another , and the Chinese people , impressed with a belief in both the divine mission of their emperor and also in the value of union , welcome with acclaim the advent of the prince who will restore their favorite and ideal system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a far-distant and undiscoverable future when it will be otherwise , and when the Chinese will be drawn away from their consistent and ancient practice to pursue the ignis fatuus of European politics that seeks to combine human equality with good practical government and national security . The Chinese have another and more attainable ideal , nor is there any likelihood of their changing it . The fall of dynasties may , needs must , continue in the ordinary course of nature , but in China it will not pave the way to a republic . The imperial authority will rise triumphant after every struggle above the storm. @# @# CHAPTER II @# THE FIRST NATIONAL DYNASTY @# As the Chinese are still proud to call themselves the sons of Han , it will be understood that the period covered by the Han rulers must be an important epoch in their history , and in more than one respect they were the first national dynasty , When the successors of Tsin Chi Hwangti proved unable to keep the throne , the victorious general who profited by their discomfiture was named Liu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emperor Hwangti , but on finding that his descendants could not bear the burden of government , he resolved to take his own measures , and he lost no time in collecting troops and in making a bid for popularity by endeavoring to save all the books that had not been burned . His career bears some resemblance to that of Macbeth , for a soothsayer meeting him on the road predicted , " by the expression of his features , that he was destined to become emperor . " He began his struggle for the throne by defeating another general named Pawang , who was also disposed to make a bid for supreme power . After this success Liu Pang was proclaimed emperor as Kao Hwangti , meaning Lofty and August Emperor , which has been shortened into Kaotsou . He named his dynasty the Han , after the small state in which he was born. @# Kaotsou began his reign by a public proclamation in favor of peace , and deploring the evils which follow in the train of war . He called upon his subjects to aid his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many works of public utility , among which roads and bridges occupied the foremost place . He removed his capital from Loyang in Honan to Singanfoo in Shensi , and as Singan was difficult of access in those days , he constructed a great highroad from the center of China to this somewhat remote spot on the western frontier . This road still exists , and has been described by several travelers in our time . It was constructed by the labor of one hundred thousand men through the most difficult country , crossing great mountain chains and broad rivers . The Chinese engineers employed on the making of this road , which has excited the admiration of all who have traversed it , first discovered and carried into execution the suspension bridge , which in Europe is quite a modern invention . One of these " flying bridges , " as the Chinese called them , is one hundred and fifty yards across a valley five hundred feet below , and is still in use . At regular intervals along this road Kaotsou constructed rest-houses for travelers , and postal-stations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more useful or remarkable than this admirable road from Loyang to Singanfoo . He embellished his new capital with many fine buildings , among which was a large palace , the grandeur of which was intended to correspond with the extent of his power. @# The reign of Kaotsou was , however , far from being one of uncheckered prosperity . Among his own subjects his popularity was great because he promoted commerce and improved the administration of justice . He also encouraged literature , and was the first ruler to recognize the claims of Confucius , at whose tomb he performed an elaborate ceremony . He thus acquired a reputation which induced the King of Nanhai  --  a state composed of the southern provinces of China , with its capital at or near the modern Canton  --  to tender his allegiance . But he was destined to receive many slights and injuries at the hands of a foreign enemy , who at this time began a course of active aggression that entailed serious consequences for both China and Europe. @# Reference has been made to the Hiongnou or Hun tribes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the interval between the death of that ruler and the consolidation of the power of Kaotsou , a remarkable chief named Meha , or Meta , had established his supremacy among the disunited clans of the Mongolian Desert , and had succeeded in combining for purposes of war the whole fighting force of what had been a disjointed and barbarous confederacy . The Chinese rulers had succeeded in keeping back this threatening torrent from overflowing the fertile plains of their country , as much by sowing dissension among these clans and by bribing one chief to fight another , as by superior arms . But Meha ' s success rendered this system of defense no longer possible , and the desert chieftain , realizing the opportunity of spoil and conquest , determined to make his position secure by invading China . If the enterprise had failed , there would have been an end to the paramounce of Meha , but his rapid success convinced the Huns that their proper and most profitable policy was to carry on implacable war with their weak and wealthy neighbors . Meha ' s success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the districts taken from the Tartars by the general Moungtien . He turned the western angle of the Great Wall , and brought down his frontier to the river Hoangho . His light cavalry raided past the Chinese capital into the province of Szchuen , and returned laden with the spoil of countless cities . These successes were crowned by a signal victory over the emperor in person . Kaotsou was drawn into an ambuscade in which his troops had no chance with their more active adversaries , and , to save himself from capture , Kaotsou had no alternative but to take refuge in the town of Pingching , where he was closely beleaguered . It was impossible to defend the town for any length of time , and the capture of Kaotsou seemed inevitable , when recourse was had to a stratagem . The most beautiful Chinese maiden was sent as a present to propitiate the conqueror , and Meha , either mollified by the compliment , or deeming that nothing was to be gained by driving the Chinese to desperation , acquiesced in a convention which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rescued their sovereign from his predicament. @# This disaster , and his narrow personal escape , seem to have unnerved Kaotsou , for when the Huns resumed their incursions in the very year following the Pingching convention , he took no steps to oppose them , and contented himself with denouncing in his palace Meha as " a wicked and faithless man , who had risen to power by the murder of his father , and one with whom oaths and treaties carried no weight . " Notwithstanding this opinion , Kaotsou proceeded to negotiate with Meha as an equal , and gave this barbarian prince his own daughter in marriage as the price of his abstaining from further attacks on the empire . Never , wrote a historian , " was so great a shame inflicted on the Middle Kingdom , which then lost its dignity and honor . " Meha observed this peace during the life of Kaotsou , who found that his reputation was much diminished by his coming to terms with his uncivilized opponent , but although several of his generals rebelled , until it was said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apprehension , " he succeeded in overcoming them all without serious difficulty . His troubles probably shortened his life , for he died when he was only fifty-three , leaving the crown to his son , Hoeiti , and injunctions to his widow , Liuchi , as to the conduct of the administration. @# The brief reign of Hoeiti is only remarkable for the rigor and terrible acts of his mother , the Empress Liuchi , who is the first woman mentioned in Chinese history as taking a supreme part in public affairs . Another of Kaotsou ' s widows aspired to the throne for her son , and the chief direction for herself . Liuchi nipped their plotting in the bud by poisoning both of them . She marked out those who differed from her , or who resented her taking the most prominent part in public ceremonies , as her enemies , to be removed from her path by any means . At a banquet she endeavored to poison one of the greatest princes of the empire , but her plot was detected and baffled by her son . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long after this episode , and then Liuchi ruled in her own name , and without filling up the vacancy on the throne , until the public dissatisfaction warned her that she was going too far . She then adopted a supposititious child as her grandson and governed as regent in his name . The mother of this youth seems to have made inconvenient demands on the empress , who promptly put her out of the way , and when the son showed a disposition to resent this action , she caused him to be poisoned . She again ruled without a puppet emperor , hoping to retain power by placing her relatives in the principal offices ; but the dissatisfaction had now reached an acute point , and threatened to destroy her . It may be doubted whether she would have surmounted these difficulties and dangers , when death suddenly cut short her adventurous career . The popular legend is that this Chinese Lucretia Borgia died of fright at seeing the apparitions of her many victims , and there can be no doubt that her crimes did not conduce to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much for the excellence of Kaotsou ' s work , and for the hold the Han family had obtained on the Chinese people , that when it became necessary to select an emperor after the death of Liuchi the choice should have fallen unanimously on the Prince of Tai , who was the illegitimate son of Kaotsou . On mounting the throne , he took the name of Wenti . He began his reign by remitting taxes and by appointing able and honest governors and judges . He ordered that all old men should be provided with corn , meat and wine , besides silk and cotton for their garments . At the suggestion of his ministers , who were alive to the dangers of a disputed succession , he proclaimed his eldest son heir to the throne . He purified the administration of justice by declaring that prince and peasant must be equally subject to the law ; he abolished the too common punishment of mutilation , and had the satisfaction of seeing crime reduced to such low proportions in the empire that the jails contained only four hundred prisoners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , indeed , necessary to China , as it had not recovered from the effects of the last Hun invasion . He succeeded by diplomacy in inducing the Prince at Canton , who had shown a disposition to assert his independence , to recognize his authority , and thus averted a civil war . In his relations with the Huns , among whom the authority of Meha had passed to his son , Lao Chang , he strove to preserve the peace , giving that chief one of his daughters in marriage , and showing moderation in face of much provocation . When war was forced upon him by their raids he did everything he could to mitigate its terrors , but the ill success of his troops in their encounters with the Tartars broke his confidence , and he died prematurely after a reign of twenty-three years , which was remarkable as witnessing the consolidation of the Hans . The good work of Wenti was continued during the peaceful reign of sixteen years of his son Kingti. @# The next emperor was Vouti , a younger son of Kingti @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the difficult and inaccessible province of Fuhkien to the empire . He also endeavored to propitiate the Huns by giving their chief one of the princesses of his family as a wife , but the opinion was gaining ground that it would be better to engage in a war for the overthrow of the national enemy than to purchase a hollow peace . Wang Kua , a general who had commanded on the frontier , and who knew the Hun mode of warfare , represented that success would be certain , and at last gained the emperor ' s ear . Vouti decided on war , and raised a large army for the purpose . But the result was not auspicious . Wang Kua failed to bring the Huns to an engagement , and the campaign which was to produce such great results ended ingloriously . The unlucky general who had promised so much anticipated his master ' s displeasure by committing suicide . Unfortunately for himself , his idea of engaging in a mortal struggle with the Tartars gained ground , and became in time the fixed policy of China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to expand . He annexed Szchuen , a province exceeding in size and population most European states , and he received from the ruler of Manchuria a formal tender of submission . In the last years of his reign the irrepressible Hun question again came up for discussion , and the episode of the flight of the Yuchi from Kansuh affords a break in the monotony of the struggle , and is the first instance of that western movement which brought the tribes of the Gobi Desert into Europe . The Yuchi are believed to have been allied with the Jats of India , and there is little or no doubt that the Sacae , or Scythians , were their descendants . They occupied a strip of territory in Kansuh from Shachow to Lanchefoo , and after suffering much at the hands of the Huns under Meha , they resolved to seek a fresh home in the unknown regions of Western Asia . The Emperor Vouti wished to bring them back , and he sent an envoy named Chang Keen to induce them to return . That officer discovered them in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incline them to leave a quarter in which they had recovered power and prosperity . Powerless against the Huns , they had more than held their own against the Parthians and the Greek kingdom of Bactria . They retained their predominant position in what is now Bokhara and Balkh , until they were gathered up by the Huns in their western march , and hurled , in conjunction with them , on the borders of the Roman Empire . Meantime , the war with the Huns themselves entered upon a new phase . A general named Wei Tsing obtained a signal victory over them , capturing 15 , 000 prisoners and the spoil of the Tartar camp . This success restored long-lost confidence to the Chinese troops , and it was followed by several other victories . One Chinese expedition , composed entirely of cavalry , marched through the Hun country to Soponomo on the Tian Shan , carrying everything before it and returning laden with spoil , including some of the golden images of the Hun religion . Encouraged by these successes , Vouti at last took the field in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ king to make his submission to China . His reply was to imprison the bearer of the message , and to defy the emperor to do his worst . This boldness had the effect of deterring the emperor from his enterprise . He employed his troops in conquering Yunnan and Leaoutung instead of in waging another war with the Huns . But he had only postponed , not abandoned , his intention of overthrowing , once and for all , this most troublesome and formidable national enemy . He raised an enormous force for the campaign , which might have proved successful but for the mistake of intrusting the command to an incompetent general . In an ill-advised moment , he gave his brother-in-law , Li Kwangli , the supreme direction of the war . His incompetence entailed a succession of disasters , and the only redeeming point amid them was that Li Kwangli was taken prisoner and rendered incapable of further mischief . Liling , the grandson of this general , was intrusted with a fresh army to retrieve the fortunes of the war ; but , although successful at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unpleasant pass of surrendering to the enemy . Both Li Kwangli and Liling adapted themselves to circumstances , and took service under the Tartar chief . As this conduct obtained the approval of the historian Ssematsien , it is clear that our views of such a proceeding would not be in harmony with the opinion in China of that day . The long war which Vouti waged with the Huns for half a century , and which was certainly carried on in a more honorable and successful manner than any previous portion of that historic struggle , closed with discomfiture and defeat , which dashed to the ground the emperor ' s hopes of a complete triumph over the most formidable national enemy. @# After a reign of fifty-four years , which must be pronounced glorious , Vouti died , amid greater troubles and anxieties than any that had beset him during his long reign . He was unquestionably a great ruler . He added several provinces to his empire , and the success he met with over the Huns was far from being inconsiderable . He was a Nimrod among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wildest animals without any attendants . Like many other Chinese princes , Vouti was prone to believe in the possibility of prolonging human life , or , as the Chinese put it , in the draught of immortality . In connection with this weakness an anecdote is preserved that will bear telling . A magician offered the emperor a glass containing the pretended elixir of eternal life , and Vouti was about to drink it when a courtier snatched it from his hand and drained the goblet . The enraged monarch ordered him to prepare for instant death , but the ready courtier at once replied , " How can I be executed , since I have drunk the draught of immortality ? " To so convincing an argument no reply was possible , and Vouti lived to a considerable age without the aid of magicians or quack medicines . Of him also it may be said that he added to the stability of the Han dynasty , and he left the throne to Chaoti , the youngest of his sons , a child of eight , for whom he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As these ministers were true to their duty , the interregnum did not affect the fortunes of the State adversely , and several claimants to the throne paid for their ambition with their lives . The reign of Chaoti was prosperous and successful , but , unfortunately , he died at the early age of thirty-one , and without leaving an heir. @# After some hesitation , Chaoti ' s uncle Liucho was proclaimed emperor , but he proved to be a boor with low tastes , whose sole idea of power was the license to indulge in coarse amusements . The chief minister , Ho Kwang , took upon himself the responsibility of deposing him , and also of placing on the throne Siuenti , who was the great-grandson , or , according to another account , the grandson , of Vouti . The choice was a fortunate one , and " Ho Kwang gave all his care to perfecting the new emperor in the science of government . " As a knowledge of his connection with the Imperial family had been carefully kept from him , Siuenti was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Chinese , and his greater energy and more practical disposition were probably due to his not having been bred in the enervating atmosphere of a palace . He , too , was brought at an early stage of his career face to face with the Tartar question , and he had what may be pronounced a unique experience in his wars with them . He sent several armies under commanders of reputation to wage war on them , and the generals duly returned , reporting decisive and easily obtained victories . The truth soon leaked out . The victories were quite imaginary . The generals had never ventured to face the Tartars , and they were given no option by their enraged and disappointed master but to poison themselves . Other generals were appointed , and the Tartars were induced to sue for peace , partly from fear of the Chinese , and partly because they were disunited among themselves . Such was the reputation of Siuenti for justice that several of the Tartar chiefs carried their grievances to the foot of his throne , and his army became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is said that all the tribes and countries of Central Asia as far west as the Caspian sent him tribute , and to celebrate the event he built a kilin or pavilion , in which he placed statues of all the generals who had contributed toward his triumph . Only one incident marred the tranquillity of Siuenti ' s reign . The great statesman , Ho Kwang , had sunk quietly into private life as soon as he found the emperor capable of governing for himself ; but his wife Hohien was more ambitious and less satisfied with her position , although she had effected a marriage between her daughter and Siuenti . This lady was only one of the queens of the ruler , and not the empress . Hohien , to further her ends , determined to poison the empress , and succeeded only too well . Her guilt would have been divulged by the doctor she employed , but that Ho Kwang , by an exercise of his authority , prevented the application of torture to him when thrown into prison . This narrow escape from detection did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of seeing her daughter proclaimed empress , but her gratification was diminished by the son of the murdered Hiuchi being selected as heir to the throne . Hohien resolved to poison this prince , but her design was discovered , and she and all the members of her family were ordered to take poison . The minister , Ho Kwang , had taken no part in these plots , which , however , injured his reputation , and his statue in the Imperial pavilion was left without a name. @# Siuenti did not long survive these events , and Yuenti , the son of Hiuchi , became emperor . His reign of sixteen years presents no features of interest beyond the signal overthrow of the Tartar chief , Chichi , whose head was sent by the victorious general to be hung on the walls of Singan . Yuenti was succeeded by his son Chingti , who reigned twenty-six years , and who gained the reputation of a Chinese Vitellius . His nephew Gaiti , who was the next emperor , showed himself an able and well-intentioned prince , but his reign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permanent work being accomplished . One measure of his was not without its influence on the fate of his successors . He had disgraced and dismissed from the service an official named Wang Mang , who had attained great power and influence under Chingti . The ambition of this individual proved fatal to the dynasty . On Gaiti ' s death he emerged from his retirement , and , in conjunction with that prince ' s mother , seized the government . They placed a child , grandson of Yuenti , on the throne , and gave him the name of Pingti , or the Peaceful Emperor , but he never governed . Before Pingti was fourteen , Wang Mang resolved to get rid of him , and he gave him the poisoned cup with his own hands . This was not the only , or perhaps the worst , crime that Wang Mang perpetrated to gain the throne . Pressed for money to pay his troops , he committed the sacrilege of stripping the graves of the princes of the Han family of the jewels deposited in them . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was soon got rid of , and Wang Mang proclaimed himself emperor . He also decreed that the Han dynasty was extinct , and that his family should be known as the Sin. @# Wang Mang the usurper was certainly a capable administrator , but in seizing the throne he had attempted a task to which he was unequal . As long as he was minister or regent , respect and regard for the Han family prevented many from revolting against his tyranny , but when he seized the throne he became the mark of popular indignation and official jealousy . The Huns resumed their incursions , and , curiously enough , put forward a proclamation demanding the restoration of the Hans . Internal enemies sprang up on every side , and Wang Mang ' s attempt to terrify them by severity and wholesale executions only aggravated the situation . It became clear that the struggle was to be one to the death , but this fact did not assist Wang Mang , who saw his resources gradually reduced and his enemies more confident as the contest continued . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Singan . The city was soon carried by storm , and Wang Mang retired to the palace to put an end to his existence . But his heart failed him , and he was cut down by the foe . His last exclamation and the dirge of his short-lived dynasty , which is denied a place in Chinese history , was , " If Heaven had given me courage , what could the family of the Hans have done ? " @# The eldest of the surviving Han princes , Liu Hiuen , was placed on the throne , and the capital was removed from Singan to Loyang , or Honan . Nothing could have been more popular among the Chinese people than the restoration of the Hans . It is said that the old men cried for joy when they saw the banner of the Hans again waving over the palace and in the field . But Liu Hiuen was not a good ruler , and there might have been reason to regret the change if he had not wisely left the conduct of affairs to his able cousin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sieou should be emperor , and when Liu Hiuen attempted to form a faction of his own he was murdered by Fanchong , the leader of a confederacy known as the Crimson Eyebrows , on whose co-operation he counted . The Crimson Eyebrows were so called from the distinguishing mark which they had adopted when first organized as a protest against the tyranny of Wang Mang . At first they were patriots , but they soon became brigands . After murdering the emperor , Fanchong , their leader , threw off all disguise , and seizing Singan , gave it over to his followers to plunder . Liu Sieou , on becoming emperor , took the style of Kwang Vouti , and his first task was to overthrow the Crimson Eyebrows , who had become a public enemy . He intrusted the command of the army he raised for this purpose to Fongy , who justified his reputation as the most skillful Chinese general of his day by gaining several victories over a more numerous adversary . Within two years Kwang Vouti had the satisfaction of breaking up the formidable faction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leader Fanchong as a prisoner in his capital. @# Kwang Vouti was engaged for many more years in subduing the numerous potentates who had repudiated the imperial authority . His efforts were invariably crowned with success , but he acquired so great a distaste for war that it is said when his son asked him to explain how an army was set in battle array he refused to reply . But the love of peace will not avert war when a State has turbulent or ambitious neighbors who are resolved to appeal to arms , and so Kwang Vouti was engaged in almost constant hostilities to the end of his days . Chingtse , the Queen of Kaochi , which may be identified with the modern Annam , defied the Chinese , and defeated the first army sent to bring her to reason . This reverse necessitated a still greater effort on the part of the Chinese ruler to bring his neighbor to her senses . The occupant of the Dragon throne could not sit down tamely under a defeat inflicted by a woman , and an experienced general named Mayuen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boadicea of Annam made a valiant defense , but she was overthrown , and glad to purchase peace by making the humblest submission . The same general more than held his own on the northern and northwest frontiers . When Kwang Vouti died , in A.D. 57 , after a brilliant reign of thirty-three years , he had firmly established the Han dynasty , and he left behind him the reputation of being both a brave and a just prince. @# His son and successor , Mingti , was not unworthy of his father . His acts were characterized by wisdom and clemency , and the country enjoyed a large measure of peace through the policy of Mingti and his father . A general named Panchow , who was perhaps the greatest military commander China ever produced , began his long and remarkable career in this reign , and , without the semblance of an effort , kept the Huns in order , and maintained the imperial authority over them . Among other great and important works , Mingti constructed a dike , thirty miles long , for the relief of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Du Halde , states that so long as this was kept in repair there were no floods . The most remarkable event of Mingti ' s reign was undoubtedly the official introduction of Buddhism into China . Some knowledge of the great Indian religion and of the teacher Sakya Muni seems to have reached China through either Tibet , or , more probably , Burma , but it was not until Mingti , in consequence of a dream , sent envoys to India to study Buddhism , that its doctrine became known in China . Under the direct patronage of the emperor it made rapid progress , and although never unreservedly popular , it has held its ground ever since its introduction in the first century of our era , and is now inextricably intertwined with the religion of the Chinese state and people . Mingti died after a successful reign of eighteen years in 75 A.D. His son , Changti , with the aid of his mother , Machi , the daughter of the general Mayuen , enjoyed a peaceful reign of thirteen years , and died at an early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his son , Hoti , who was only ten at the time of his accession , and who reigned for seventeen years . He was a virtuous and well-intentioned prince , who instituted many internal reforms , and during his reign a new writing paper was invented , which is supposed to have been identical with the papyrus of Egypt . But the reign of Hoti is rendered illustrious by the remarkable military achievements of Panchow . The success of that general in his operations with the Huns has already been referred to , and he at last formed a deliberate plan for driving them away from the Chinese frontier . Although he enjoyed the confidence of his successive sovereigns , the imperial sanction was long withheld from this vast scheme , but during the life of Changti he began to put in operation measures for the realization of this project that were only matured under Hoti . He raised and trained a special army for frontier war . He enlisted tribes who had never served the emperor before , and who were specially qualified for desert warfare . He formed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were probably the ancestors of the present Manchus , and thus arranged for a flank attack on the Huns . This systematic attack was crowned with success . The pressure brought against them compelled the Hiongnou to give way , and as they were ousted from their possessions , to seek fresh homes further west . In this they were , no doubt , stimulated by the example of their old opponents , the Yuchi , but Panchow ' s energy supplied a still more convincing argument . He pursued them wherever they went , across the Gobi Desert and beyond the Tian Shan range , taking up a strong position at modern Kuldja and Kashgar , sending his expeditions on to the Pamir , and preparing to complete his triumph by the invasion of the countries of the Oxus and Jaxartes . When Hoti was still a youth , he completed this programme by overrunning the region as far as the Caspian , which was probably at that time connected with the Aral , and it may be supposed that Khiva marked the limit of the Chinese general ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show of truth that he came into contact with the Roman empire or the great Thsin , as the Chinese called it , and that he wished to establish commercial relations with it . But however uncertain this may be , there can be no doubt that he inflicted a most material injury on Rome , for before his legions fled the Huns , who , less than four centuries later , debased the majesty of the imperial city , and whose leader , Attila , may have been a descendant of that Meha at whose hands the Chinese suffered so severely. @# After this brilliant and memorable war , Panchow returned to China , where he died at the great age of eighty . With him disappeared the good fortune of the Han dynasty , and misfortunes fell rapidly on the family that had governed China so long and so well . Hoti ' s infant son lived only a few months , and then his brother , Ganti , became emperor . The real power rested in the hands of the widow of Hoti , who was elevated to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 124 by his son , Chunti , in whose time several rebellions occurred , threatening the extinction of the dynasty . Several children were then elevated to the throne , and at last an ambitious noble named Leangki , whose sister was one of the empresses , acquired the supreme direction of affairs . He gave a great deal of trouble , but at last , finding that his ambitious schemes did not prosper , he took poison , thus anticipating a decree passed for his execution . Hwanti , the emperor who had the courage to punish this powerful noble , was the last able ruler of the Hans . His reign was , on the whole , a brilliant one , and the Sienpi tribes , who had taken the place of the Hiongnou , were , after one arduous campaign , defeated in a pitched battle . The Chinese were on the verge of defeat when their general , Twan Kang , rushed to the front , exclaiming : " Recall to your minds how often before you have beaten these same opponents , and teach them again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After Hwanti ' s death the decline of the Hans was rapid . They produced no other ruler worthy of the throne . In the palace the eunuchs , always numerous at the Chinese court , obtained the upper hand , and appointed their own creatures to the great governing posts . Fortunately this dissension at the capital was not attended by weakness on the frontier , and the Sienpi were again defeated . The battle is chiefly memorable because the Sienpi endeavored to frighten the Chinese general by threatening to kill his mother , who was a prisoner in their hands , if he attacked . Not deterred by this menace , Chow Pow attacked the enemy , and gained a decisive victory , but at the cost of his mother ' s life , which so affected him that he died of grief shortly afterward . After some time dissensions rose in the Han family , and two half-brothers claimed the throne . Pienti became emperor by the skillful support of his uncle , General Hotsin , while his rival , Hienti , enjoyed the support of the eunuchs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was aggravated by the murder of Hotsin , who rashly entered the palace without an escort . His soldiers avenged his death , carrying the palace by storm and putting ten thousand eunuchs to the sword . After this the last emperors possessed only the name of emperor . The practical authority was disputed among several generals , of whom Tsow Tsow was the most distinguished and successful ; and he and his son Tsowpi founded a dynasty , of which more will be heard hereafter . In A.D. 220 Hienti , the last Han ruler , retired into private life , thus bringing to an end the famous Han dynasty , which had governed China for four hundred and fifty years. @# Among the families that have reigned in China none has obtained as high a place in popular esteem as the Hans . They rendered excellent work in consolidating the empire and in carrying out what may be called the imperial mission of China . Yunnan and Leaoutung were made provinces for the first time . Cochin China became a vassal state . The writ of the emperor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade of the country increased with the progress of its armies . Some of the greatest public works , in the shape of roads , bridges , canals , and aqueducts , were constructed during this period , and still remain to testify to the glory of the Hans . As has been seen , the Hans produced several great rulers . Their fame was not the creation of one man alone , and as a consequence the dynasty enjoyed a lengthened existence equaled by few of its predecessors or successors . No ruling family was ever more popular with the Chinese than this , and it managed to retain the throne when less favored rulers would have expiated their mistakes and shortcomings by the loss of the empire . With the strong support of the people , the Hans overcame innumerable difficulties , and even the natural process of decay ; and when they made their final exit from history it was in a graceful manner , and without the execration of the masses . That this feeling retains its force is shown in the pride with which the Chinese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @# CHAPTER III @# A LONG PERIOD OF DISUNION @# The ignominious failure of the usurper Wang Mang to found a dynasty was too recent to encourage any one to take upon himself the heavy charge of administering the whole of the Han empire , and so the state was split up into three principalities , and the period is known from this fact as the Sankoue . One prince , a member of the late ruling family , held possession of Szchuen , which was called the principality of Chow . The southern provinces were governed by a general named Sunkiuen , and called Ou . The central and northern provinces , containing the greatest population and resources , formed the principality of Wei , subject to Tsowpi , the son of Tsow Tsow . A struggle for supremacy very soon began between these princes , and the balance of success gradually declared itself in favor of Wei . It would serve no useful purpose to enumerate the battles which marked this struggle , yet one deed of heroism deserves mention , the defense of Sinching by Changte , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the place was insignificant , and , after a siege of ninety days , several breaches had been made in the walls . In this strait Changte sent a message to the besieging general that he would surrender on the hundredth day if a cessation of hostilities were granted , " as it was a law among the princes of Wei that the governor of a place which held out for a hundred days and then surrendered , with no prospect of relief visible , should not be considered as guilty . " The respite was short and it was granted . But the disappointment of the besieger , already counting on success , was great when a few days later he saw that the breaches had been repaired , that fresh defenses had been improvised , and that Sinching was in better condition than ever to withstand a siege . On sending to inquire the meaning of these preparations , Changte gave the following reply : " I am preparing my tomb and to bury myself in the ruins of Sinching . " Of such gallantry and resource the internecine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the progress of the struggle steadily pointed in the direction of the triumph of Wei. @# The Chow dynasty of the Later Hans was the first to succumb to the princes of Wei , and the combined resources of the two states were then directed against the southern principality of Ou . The supreme authority in Wei had before this passed from the family of Tsowpi to his best general , Ssemachow , who had the satisfaction of beginning his reign with the overthrow of the Chow dynasty . If he had earned out the wishes of his own commander , Tengai , by attacking Ou at once , and in the flush of his triumph over Chow , he might have completed his work at a stroke , for as Tengai wrote , " An army which has the reputation of victory flies from one success to another . " But Ssemachow preferred a slower and surer mode of action , with the result that the conquest of Ou was put off for twenty years . Ssemachow died in A.D. 265 , and his son Ssemachu founded the new dynasty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the warrior prince. @# The main object with Vouti was to add the Ou principality to his dominions , and the descendants of Sunkiuen thought it best to bend before the storm . They sent humble embassies to Loyang , expressing their loyalty and submission , but at the same time they made strenuous preparations to defend their independence . This double policy precipitated the collision it was intended to avert . Vouti paid more heed to the acts than the promises of his neighbor , and he ordered the invasion of his territory from two sides . He placed a large fleet of war junks on the Yangtsekiang to attack his opponent on the Tunting Lake . The campaign that ensued was decided before it began . The success of Vouti was morally certain from the beginning , and after his army had suffered several reverses Sunhow threw up the struggle and surrendered to his opponent . Thus was China again reunited for a short time under the dynasty of the Later Tsins . Having accomplished his main task , Vouti gave himself up to the pursuit of pleasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhat severe fellow-countrymen by entertaining a theatrical company of five thousand female comedians , and by allowing himself to be driven in a car drawn by sheep through the palace grounds . Vouti lived about ten years after the unity of the empire was restored , and his son , Ssemachong , or Hweiti , became emperor on his death in A.D. 290 . One of the great works of his reign was the bridging of the Hoangho at Mongtsin , at a point much lower down its course than is bridged at the present time. @# The reign of Hweiti was marred by the ambitious vindictiveness of his wife , Kiachi , who murdered the principal minister and imprisoned the widow of the Emperor Vouti . The only good service she rendered the state was to discern in one of the palace eunuchs named Mongkwan a great general , and his achievements bear a strong resemblance to those of Narses , who was the only other great commander of that unfortunate class mentioned in history . Wherever Mongkwan commanded in person victory attended his efforts , but the defeats of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At this moment there was a recrudescence of Tartar activity which proved more fatal to the Chinese ruler than his many domestic enemies . Some of the Hiongnou tribes had retired in an easterly direction toward Manchuria when Panchow drove the main body westward , and among them , at the time of which we are speaking , a family named Lin had gained the foremost place . They possessed all the advantages of Chinese education , and had married several times into the Han family . Seeing the weakness of Hweiti these Lin chiefs took the title of Kings of Han , and wished to pose as the liberators of the country . Hweiti bent before the storm , and would have made an ignominious surrender but that death saved him the trouble. @# His brother and successor , Hwaiti , fared somewhat better at first , but notwithstanding some flashes of success the Lin Tartars marched further and further into the country , capturing cities , defeating the best officers of the Tsins , and threatening the capital . In A.D. 310 Linsong , the Han chief , invaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war at a blow . He succeeded in capturing Loyang , and carrying off Hwaiti as his prisoner . The capital was pillaged and the Prince Royal executed . Hwaiti is considered the first Chinese emperor to have fallen into the hands of a foreign conqueror . Two years after his capture , Hwaiti was compelled to wait on his conqueror at a public banquet , and when it was over he was led out to execution . This foul murder illustrates the character of the new race and men who aspired to rule over China . The Tartar successes did not end here , for a few years later they made a fresh raid into China , capturing Hwaiti ' s brother and successor , Mingti , who was executed , twelve months after his capture , at Pingyang , the capital of the Tartar Hans. @# After these reverses the enfeebled Tsin rulers removed their capital to Nankin , but this step alone would not have sufficed to prolong their existence had not the Lin princes themselves suffered from the evils of disunion and been compelled to remove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their name from Han to Chow , but the work of disintegration once begun proceeded rapidly , and in the course of a few years the Lin power crumbled completely away . Released from their most pressing danger by the fall of this family , the Tsin dynasty took a new lease of life , but it was unable to derive any permanent advantage from this fact . The last emperors of this family were weak and incompetent princes , whose names need not be given outside a chronological table . There would be nothing to say about them but that a humble individual named Linyu , who owed everything to himself , found in the weakness of the government and the confusion in the country the opportunity of distinction . He proved himself a good soldier and able leader against the successors of the Lin family on one side , and a formidable pirate named Sunghen on the other . Dissatisfied with his position , Linyu murdered one emperor and placed another on the throne , and in two years he compelled his puppet , the last of the Later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For a considerable portion of their rule they governed the whole of China , and it is absolutely true to say that they were the least worthy family ever intrusted with so great a charge . Of the fifteen emperors who ruled for one hundred and fifty-five years there is not more than the founder whose name calls for preservation on his own merits. @# Although Linyu ' s success was complete as far as it went , his dynasty , to which he gave the name of Song , never possessed exclusive power among the Chinese . It was only one administration among many others , and during his brief reign of three years he could do nothing toward extending his power over his neighbors , although he may have established his own the more firmly by poisoning the miserable Tsin emperor whom he deposed . His son and successor , Chowti , was deposed and murdered after a brief reign of one year . His brother Wenti succeeded him , and he was soon drawn into a struggle for power , if not existence , with his northern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most powerful potentates in the empire . The principal and immediate bone of contention between them was the great province of Honan , which had been overrun by the Wei ruler , but which Wenti was resolved to recover . As the Hoangho divides this province into two parts , it was extremely difficult for the Wei ruler to defend the portion south of it , and when Wenti sent him his declaration of war , he replied , " Even if your master succeeds in seizing this province I shall know how to retake it as soon as the waters of the Hoangho are frozen . " Wenti succeeded in recovering Honan , but after a protracted campaign , during which the Wei troops crossed the river on the ice , his armies were again expelled from it , and the exhausted combatants found themselves at the close of the struggle in almost the same position they had held at the commencement . For a time both rulers devoted their attention to peaceful matters , although Topatao , king of Wei , varied them by a persecution of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the view of overwhelming the Song emperor . When success seemed certain , victory was denied him , and the Wei forces suffered severely during their retreat to their own territory . This check to his triumphant career injured his reputation and encouraged his enemies . A short time after this campaign , Topatao was murdered by some discontented officers. @# Nor was the Song ruler , Wenti , any more fortunate , as he was murdered by his son . The parricide was killed in turn by a brother who became the Emperor Vouti . This ruler was fond of the chase and a great eater , but , on the whole , he did no harm . The next two emperors were cruel and bloodthirsty princes , and during their reigns the executioner was constantly employed . Two more princes , who were , however , not members of the Song family , but only adopted by the last ruler of that house , occupied the throne , but this weakness and unpopularity  --  for the Chinese , unlike the people of India , scout the idea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administered the finishing stroke to the Songs , who now give place to the Tsi dynasty , which was founded by a general named Siaotaoching , who took the imperial name of Kaoti . The change did not bring any improvement in the conditions of China , and it was publicly said that the Tsi family had attained its pride of place not by merit , but by force . The Tsi dynasty , after a brief and ignominious career , came to an end in the person of a youthful prince named Hoti . After his deposition , in A.D. 502 , his successful enemies ironically sent him in prison a present of gold . He exclaimed , " What need have I of gold after my death ? a few glasses of wine would be more valuable . " They complied with his wish , and while he was drunk they strangled him with his own silken girdle. @# After the Tsi came the Leang dynasty , another of those insignificant and unworthy families which occupy the stage of Chinese history during this long period of disunion . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state of Wei , which during these years had regained all its power , and had felt strong enough to transfer its capital from the northern city of Pingching to Honan , while the Leang capital remained at Nankin . The progress of this contest was marked by the consistent success of Wei , and the prince of that kingdom seems to have been as superior in the capacity of his generals as in the resources of his state . One incident will be sufficient to show the devotion which he was able to inspire in his officers . During the absence of its governor , Vouti attempted to capture the town of Ginching , and he would certainly have succeeded in his object had not Mongchi , the wife of that officer , anticipating by many centuries the conduct of the Countess of Montfort and of the Countess of Derby , thrown herself into the breach , harangued the small garrison , and inspired it with her own indomitable spirit . Vouti was compelled to make an ignominious retreat from before Ginching , and his troops became so disheartened that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their marching round the imperial camp with the head of a dead person decked out in a widow ' s cap and singing a doggerel ballad to the effect that none of Vouti ' s generals was to be feared . In the next campaign Vouti was able to restore his declining fortunes by the timely discovery of a skillful general in the person of Weijoui , who , taking advantage of the division of the Wei army into two parts by a river , gained a decisive victory over each of them in turn . If Vouti had listened to his general ' s advice , and followed up this success , he might have achieved great and permanent results , but instead he preferred to rest content with his laurels , with the result that the Wei prince recovered his military power and confidence . The natural consequences of this was that the two neighbors once more resorted to a trial of strength , and , notwithstanding the valiant and successful defense of a fortress by another lady named Liuchi , the fortune of war declared in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most remarkable periods for the display of female capacity in China , as the great state of Wei was governed by a queen named Houchi ; but the general condition of the country does not support an argument in favor of female government. @# The tenure of power by Houchi was summarily cut short by the revolt of the Wei commander-in-chief , Erchu Jong , who got rid of his mistress by tying her up in a sack and throwing her into the Hoangho . He then collected two thousand of her chief advisers in a plain outside the capital , and there ordered his cavalry to cut them down . Erchu Jong then formed an ambitious project for reuniting the empire , proclaiming to his followers his intention in this speech : " Wait a little while , and we shall assemble all the braves from out our western borders . We will then go and bring to reason the six departments of the north , and the following year we will cross the great Kiang , and place in chains Siaoyen , who calls himself emperor . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Erchu Jong . Although the death of its great general signified much loss to the Wei state , the Emperor Vouti experienced bitter disappointment and a rude awakening when he attempted to turn the event to his own advantage . His army was defeated in every battle , his authority was reduced to a shadow , and a mutinous officer completed in his palace the overthrow begun by his hereditary enemy . Vouti was now eighty years of age , and ill able to stand so rude a shock . On being deposed he exclaimed : " It was I who raised my family , and it was I who have destroyed it . I have no reason to complain " ; and he died a few days later , from , it is said , a pain in his throat which his jailers refused to alleviate with some honey . On the whole , Vouti was a creditable ruler , although the Chinese annalists blame him for his superstition and denounce his partiality for Buddhism. @# Vouti ' s prediction that his family was destroyed proved correct . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but all of these died a violent death . A general named Chinpasien founded a fresh dynasty known as the Chin , but he died before he had enjoyed power many years . At this period also disappeared the Wei state , which was dissolved by the death of Erchu Jong , and now merged itself into that of Chow . The growth of this new power proved very rapid , and speedily extinguished that of the unfortunate Chins . The Chow ruler took the name of Kaotsou Wenti , and ruled over a great portion of China . He changed the name of his dynasty to the Soui , which , although it did not hold possession of the throne for long , vindicated its claim to supremacy by successful wars and admirable public works . This prince showed himself a very capable administrator , and his acts were marked by rare generosity and breadth of view . His son and successor , Yangti , although he reached the throne by the murder of a brother , proved himself an intelligent ruler and a benefactor of his people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he resolved to make the most magnificent city in the world . It is declared that he employed two million men in embellishing it , and that he caused fifty thousand merchants to take up their residence there . But of all his works none will compare with the great system of canals which he constructed , and in connection with which his name will live forever in history . Although he reigned no more than thirteen years , he completed nearly five thousand miles of canals . Some of these , such as the Grand Canal , from the Hoangho to the Yangtsekiang , are splendid specimens of human labor , and could be made as useful today as they were when first constructed . The canal named is forty yards wide and is lined with solid stone . The banks are bordered with elms and willows . These works were constructed by a general corvee or levy en masse , each family being required to provide one able-bodied man , and the whole of the army was also employed on this public undertaking . It is in connection with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as his wars , especially one with Corea , were not successful , and an ignominious end was put to his existence by a fanatic . His son and successor was also murdered , when the Soui dynasty came to an end , and with it the magnificent and costly palace erected at Loyang , which was denounced as only calculated " to soften the heart of a prince and to foment his cupidity. " @# There now ensues a break in the long period of disunion which had prevailed in China , and for a time the supreme authority of the emperor recovered the general respect and vigor which by right belonged to it . The deposer of the Souis was Liyuen , who some years before had been given the title of Prince of Tang . In the year A.D. 617 he proclaimed himself emperor under the style of Kaotsou , and he began his reign in an auspicious manner by proclaiming an amnesty and by stating his " desire to found his empire only on justice and humanity . " While he devoted his attention to the reorganization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his capital , his second son , Lichimin , was intrusted with the command of the army in the field , to which was assigned the task of subjecting all the provinces . Lichimin proved himself a great commander , and his success was both rapid and unqualified . He was equally victorious over Chinese rebels and foreign enemies . His energy and skill were not more conspicuous than his courage . At the head of his chosen regiment of cuirassiers , carrying black tiger skins , he was to be found in the front of every battle , and victory was due as often to his personal intrepidity as to his tactical skill . Within a few years the task of Lichimin was brought to a glorious completion , and on his return to Singan he was able to assure his father that the empire was pacified in a sense that had not been true for many centuries . His entry into Singan at the head of his victorious troops reminds the reader of a Roman triumph . Surrounded by his chosen bodyguard , and followed by forty thousand cavalry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the most important of his captives , rode through the streets to make public offering of thanks for victory achieved , at the Temple of his ancestors . His success was enhanced by his moderation , for he granted his prisoners their lives , and his reputation was not dimmed by any acts of cruelty or bloodshed. @# The magnitude of Lichimin ' s success and his consequent popularity aroused the envy and hostility of his elder brother , who aspired to the throne . The intrigues against him were so far successful that he fell into disgrace with the emperor , and for a time withdrew from the court . But his brother was not content with anything short of taking his life , and formed a conspiracy with his other brothers and some prominent officials to murder him . The plot was discovered , and recoiled upon its authors , who were promptly arrested and executed . Then Lichimin was formally proclaimed heir to the throne ; but the event sinks into comparative insignificance beside the abdication of the throne by Kaotsou in the same year . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plot against Lichimin , but the official statement was that Kaotsou felt the weight of years , and that he wished to enjoy rest and the absence of responsibility during his last days . Kaotsou must be classed among the capable rulers of China , but his fame has been overshadowed by and merged in the greater splendor of his son . He survived his abdication nine years , dying in A.D. 635 at the age of seventy-one. @# On ascending the throne , Lichimin took the name of Taitsong , and he is one of the few Chinese rulers to whom the epithet of Great may be given without fear of its being challenged . The noble task to which he at once set himself was to prove that the Chinese were one people , that the interests of all the provinces , as of all classes of the community , were the same , and that the pressing need of the hour was to revive the spirit of national unity and patriotism . Before he became ruler in his own name he had accomplished something toward this end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognition of his father ' s authority . But Taitsong saw that much more remained to be done , and the best way to do it seemed to him to be the prosecution of what might be called a national war against those enemies beyond the northern frontier , who were always troublesome , and who had occasionally founded governments within the limits of China like the Topa family of Wei . In order to achieve any great or lasting success in this enterprise , Taitsong saw that it was essential that he should possess a large and well-trained standing army , on which he could rely for efficient service beyond the frontier as well as in China itself . Before his time Chinese armies had been little better than a rude militia , and the military knowledge of the officers could only be described as contemptible . The soldiers were , for the most part , peasants , who knew nothing of discipline , and into whose hands weapons were put for the first time on the eve of a war . They were not of a martial temperament , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such active opponents as the Tartars they would only engage when superiority of numbers promised success . They were easily seized with a panic , and the celerity and dash of Chinese troops only became perceptible when their backs were turned to the foe . So evident had these faults become that more than one emperor had endeavored to recruit from among the Tartar tribes , and to oppose the national enemy with troops not less brave or active than themselves . But the employment of mercenaries is always only a half remedy , and not free from the risk of aggravating the evil it is intended to cure . But Taitsong did not attempt any such palliation ; he went to the root of the question , and determined to have a trained and efficient army of his own . He raised a standing army of nine hundred thousand men , which he divided into three equal classes of regiments , one containing one thousand two hundred men , another one thousand , and the third eight hundred . The total number of regiments was eight hundred and ninety-five , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service and two hundred and sixty-one for foreign . By this plan he obtained the assured services of more than a quarter of a million of trained troops for operations beyond the frontier . Taitsong also improved the weapons and armament of his soldiers . He lengthened the pike and supplied a stronger bow . Many of his troops wore armor ; and he relied on the co-operation of his cavalry , a branch of military power which has generally been much neglected in China . He took special pains to train a large body of officers , and he instituted a Tribunal of War , to which the supreme direction of military matters was intrusted . As these measures greatly shocked the civil mandarins , who regarded the emperor ' s taking part in reviews and the physical exercises of the soldiers as " an impropriety , " it will be allowed that Taitsong showed great moral courage and surmounted some peculiar difficulties in carrying out his scheme for forming a regular army . He overcame all obstacles , and gathered under his banner an army formidable by reason of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numerical strength. @# Having acquired what he deemed the means to settle it , Taitsong resolved to grapple boldly with the ever-recurring danger from the Tartars , Under different names , but ever with the same object , the tribes of the vast region from Corea to Koko Nor had been a trouble to the Chinese agriculturist and government from time immemorial . Their sole ambition and object in life had been to harry the lands of the Chinese , and to bear back to their camps the spoils of cities . The Huns had disappeared , but in their place had sprung up the great power of the Toukinei or Turks , who were probably the ancestors of the Ottomans . With these turbulent neighbors , and with others of different race but of the same disposition on the southern frontier , Taitsong was engaged in a bitter and arduous struggle during the whole of his life ; and there can be little or no doubt that he owed his success to the care he bestowed on his army . The Great Wall of Tsin Hwangti had been one barrier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a weak and cowardly garrison , it had proved inadequate for its purpose . Taitsong supplied another and a better defense in a consistent and energetic policy , and in the provision of a formidable and confident army. @# The necessity for this military reform was clearly shown by the experience of his first campaign with these implacable enemies , when , in the year of his accession and before his organization had been completed , a horde of these barbarians broke into the empire and carried all before them , almost to the gates of the capital . On this occasion Taitsong resorted to diplomacy and remonstrance . He rode almost unattended to the Tartar camp , and reproached their chiefs with their breach of faith , reminding them that on his sending one of his sisters to be the bride of their chief they had sworn by a solemn oath to keep the peace . He asked : " Are these proceedings worthy , I will not say of princes , but of men possessing the least spark of honor ? If they forget the benefits they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be mindful of their oaths . I had sworn a peace with them ; they are now violating it , and by that they place the justice of the question on my side . " The Chinese chroniclers declare that the Tartars were so impressed by Taitsong ' s majestic air and remonstrances that they agreed to retire , and fresh vows of friendship and peace were sworn over the body of a white horse at a convention concluded on the Pienkiao bridge across the Weichoui River . The only safe deduction from this figurative narrative is that there was a Tartar incursion , and that the Chinese army did not drive back the invaders . Their retreat was probably purchased , but it was the first and last occasion on which Taitsong stooped to such a measure. @# The peace of Pienkiao was soon broken . The tribes again drew their forces to a head for the purpose of invading China , but before their plans were complete Taitsong anticipated them by marching into their territory at the head of a large army . Taken by surprise , the Tartars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surrendered , and at a general assembly Taitsong proclaimed his intention to govern them as Khan of their khans , or by the title of Tien Khan , which means Celestial Ruler . This was the first occasion on which a Chinese ruler formally took over the task of governing the nomad tribes and of treating their chiefs as his lieutenants . Down to the present day the Chinese emperor continues to govern the Mongol and other nomadic tribes under this very title , which the Russians have rendered as Bogdo Khan . The success of this policy was complete , for not only did it give tranquillity to the Chinese borders , but it greatly extended Chinese authority . Kashgaria was then , for the first time , formed into a province under the name of Lonugsi , and Lichitsi , one of the emperor ' s best generals , was appointed Warden of the Western Marches . Some of the most influential of Taitsong ' s advisers disapproved of this advanced policy , and attempted to thwart it , but in vain . Carried out with the vigor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its wisdom and efficacy. @# During this reign the relations between China and two of its neighbors , Tibet and Corea , were greatly developed , and the increased intercourse was largely brought about by the instrumentality of war . The first envoys from Tibet , or , as it was then called , Toufan or Toupo , are reported to have reached the Chinese capital in the year 634 . At that time the people of Tibet were rude and unlettered , and their chiefs were little better than savages . Buddhism had not taken that firm hold on the popular mind which it at present possesses , and the power of the lamas had not arisen in what is now the most priest-ridden country in the world . A chief , named the Sanpou  --  which means the brave lord  --  had , about the time of which we are speaking , made himself supreme throughout the country , and it was said that he had crossed the Himalaya and carried his victorious arms into Central India . Curiosity , or the desire to wed a Chinese princess , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a favored footing , induced the Sanpou to send his embassy to Singan ; but although the envoys returned laden with presents , Taitsong declined to trust a princess of his family in a strange country and among an unknown people . The Sanpou chose to interpret this refusal as an insult to his dignity , and he declared war with China . But success did not attend his enterprise , for he was defeated in the only battle of the war , and glad to purchase peace by paying five thousand ounces of gold and acknowledging himself a Chinese vassal . The Sanpou also agreed to accept Chinese education , and as his reward Taitsong gave him one of his daughters as a wife . It is stated that one of his first reforms was to abolish the national practice of painting the face , and he also built a walled city to proclaim his glory as the son-in-law of the Emperor of China . During Taitsong ' s life there was no further trouble on the side of Tibet. @# Taitsong was not so fortunate in his relations with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imposed a bar to his ambition . Attempts had been made at earlier periods to bring Corea under the influence of the Chinese ruler , and to treat it as a tributary state . A certain measure of success had occasionaly attended these attempts , but on the whole Corea had preserved its independence . When Taitsong in the plenitude of his power called upon the King of Corea to pay tribute , and to return to his subordinate position , he received a defiant reply , and the Coreans began to encroach on Sinlo , a small state which threw itself on the protection of China . The name of Corea at this time was Kaoli , and the supreme direction of affairs at this period was held by a noble named Chuen Gaisoowun , who had murdered his own sovereign . Taitsong , irritated by his defiance , sent a large army to the frontier , and when Gaisoowun , alarmed by the storm he had raised , made a humble submission and sent the proper tribute , the emperor gave expression to his displeasure and disapproval of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his resolve to prosecute the war . It is never prudent to drive an opponent to desperation , and Gaisoowun , who might have been a good neighbor if Taitsong had accepted his offer , proved a bitter and determined antagonist . The first campaign was marked by the expected success of the Chinese army . The Coreans were defeated in several battles , several important towns were captured , but Taitsong had to admit that these successes were purchased at the heavy loss of twenty-five thousand of his best troops . The second campaign resolved itself into the siege and defense of Anshu , an important town near the Yaloo River . Gaisoowun raised an enormous force with the view of effecting its relief , and he attempted to overwhelm the Chinese by superior numbers . But the better discipline and tactics of the Chinese turned the day , and the Corean army was driven in rout from the field . But this signal success did not entail the surrender of Anshu , which was gallantly defended . The scarcity of supplies and the approach of winter compelled the Chinese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the place for several months , and it is stated that as the Chinese broke up their camp the commandant appeared on the walls and wished them " a pleasant journey . " After this rebuff Taitsong did not renew his attempt to annex Corea , although to the end of his life he refused to hold any relations with Gaisoowun. @# During the first portion of his reign Taitsong was greatly helped by the labors of his wife , the Empress Changsun-chi , who was a woman of rare goodness and ability , and set a shining example to the whole of her court . She said many wise things , among which the most quotable was that " the practice of virtue conferred honor upon men , especially on princes , and not the splendor of their appointments . " She was a patron of letters , and an Imperial Library and College in the capital owed their origin to her . She was probably the best and most trustworthy adviser the emperor had , and after her death the energy and good fortune of Taitsong seemed to decline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the art of government , called the " Golden Mirror , " which bears the name of Taitsong as its author . Taitsong was an ardent admirer of Confucius , whom he exalted to the skies as the great sage of the world , declaring emphatically that " Confucius was for the Chinese what the water is for the fishes . " The Chinese annalists tell many stories of Taitsong ' s personal courage . He was a great hunter , and in the pursuit of big game he necessarily had some narrow escapes , special mention being made of his slaying single-handed a savage boar . Another instance was his struggle with a Tartar attendant who attempted to murder him , and whom he killed in the encounter . He had a still narrower escape at the hands of his eldest son , who formed a plot to assassinate him which very nearly succeeded . The excessive anxiety of Prince Lichingkien to reach the crown cost him the succession , for on the discovery of his plot he was deposed from the position of heir-apparent and disappeared from the scene. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he accomplished a great deal more than other rulers had done in twice the time , Taitsong died in A.D. 649 , leaving the undisturbed possession of the throne to his son , known as the Emperor Kaotsong . There need be no hesitation in calling Taitsong one of the greatest rulers who ever sat on the Dragon Throne , and his death was received with extraordinary demonstrations of grief by the people he had ruled so well . Several of his generals wished to commit suicide on his bier , the representatives of the tributary nations at his capital cut off their hair or sprinkled his grave with their blood , and throughout the length and breadth of the land there was mourning and lamentation for a prince who had realized the ideal character of a Chinese emperor . Nor does his claim to admiration and respect seem less after the lapse of so many centuries . His figure still stands out boldly as one of the ablest and most humane of all Chinese rulers . He not only reunited China , but he proved that union was for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Under Kaotsong the power of the Tangs showed for thirty years no diminution , and he triumphed in directions where his father had only pointed the way to victory . He began his reign with a somewhat risky act by marrying one of his father ' s widows , who then became the Empress Won . She was perhaps the most remarkable woman in the whole range of Chinese history , acquiring such an ascendency over her husband that she practically ruled the state , and retained this power after his death . In order to succeed in so exceptional a task she had to show no excessive delicacy or scrupulousness , and she began by getting rid of the other wives , including the lawful empress of Kaotsong , in a summary fashion . It is stated that she cast them into a vase filled with wine , having previously cut off their hands and feet to prevent their extricating themselves . But on the whole her influence was exerted to promote the great schemes of her husband. @# The Tibetan question was revived by the warlike proclivities of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Chinese emperor , sought to extend his dominion at his expense toward the north and the east . A desultory war ensued , in which the Chinese got the worst of it , and Kaotsong admitted that Tibet remained " a thorn in his side for years . " A satisfactory termination was given to the struggle by the early death of the Sanpou , whose warlike character had been the main cause of the dispute . Strangely enough the arms of Kaotsong were more triumphant in the direction of Corea , where his father had failed . From A.D. 658 to 670 China was engaged in a bitter war on land and sea with the Coreans and their allies , the Japanese , who thus intervened for the first time in the affairs of the continent . Owing to the energy of the Empress Wou victory rested with the Chinese , and the Japanese navy of four hundred junks was completely destroyed . The kingdom of Sinlo was made a Chinese province , and for sixty years the Coreans paid tribute and caused no trouble . In Central Asia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extent of China ' s authority and reputation may be inferred from the King of Persia begging the emperor ' s governor in Kashgar to come to his aid against the Arabs , who were then in the act of overrunning Western Asia in the name of the Prophet . Kaotsong could not send aid to such a distance from his borders , but he granted shelter to several Persian princes , and on receiving an embassy from the Arabs , he impressed upon them the wisdom and magnanimity of being lenient to the conquered . Kaotsong died in 683 , and the Empress Wou retained power until the year 704 , when , at the age of eighty , she was compelled to abdicate . Her independent rule was marked by as much vigor and success as during the life of Kaotsong . She vanquished the Tibetans and a new Tartar race known as the Khitans , who appeared on the northern borders of Shensi . She placed her son in confinement and wore the robes assigned for an emperor . The extent of her power may be inferred from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imperial sacrifice to heaven , and by her erecting temples to her ancestors . Yet it was not until she was broken down by age and illness that any of her foes were bold enough to encounter her . She survived her deposition one year , and her banished son Chongtsong was restored to the throne. @# Chongtsong did not reign long , being poisoned by his wife , who did not reap the advantage of her crime . Several emperors succeeded without doing anything to attract notice , and then Mingti brought both his own family and the Chinese empire to the verge of ruin . Like other rulers , he began well , quoting the maxims of the " Golden Mirror " and proclaiming Confucius King of Literature . But defeats at the hands of the Khitans and Tibetans imbittered his life and diminished his authority . A soldier of fortune named Ganlochan revolted and met with a rapid and unexpected success owing to " the people being unaccustomed , from the long peace , to the use of arms . " He subdued all the northern provinces , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seek safety in Szchuen , when he abdicated in favor of his son . The misfortunes of Mingti , whose most memorable act was the founding of the celebrated Hanlin College and the institution of the " Pekin Gazette , " the oldest periodical in the world , both of which exist at the present day , foretold the disruption of the empire at no remote date . His son and successor Soutsong did something to retrieve the fortunes of his family , and he recovered Singan from Ganlochan . The empire was then divided between the two rivals , and war continued unceasingly between them . The successful defense of Taiyuen , where artillery is said to have been used for the first time , A.D. 757 , by a lieutenant of the Emperor Soutsong , consolidated his power , which was further increased by the murder of Ganlochan shortly afterward . The struggle continued with varying fortune between the northern and southern powers during the rest of the reign of Soutsong , and also during that of his successor , Taitsong the Second . This ruler showed himself unworthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when a small Tibetan army advanced upon it . The census returns threw an expressive light on the condition of the empire during this period . Under Mingti the population was given at fifty- two million ; in the time of the second Taitsong it had sunk to seventeen million . A great general named Kwo Tsey , who had driven back the Tibetan invaders , enabled Tetsong , the son and successor of Taitsong , to make a good start in the government of his dominion , which was sadly reduced in extent and prosperity . This great statesman induced Tetsong to issue an edict reproving the superstitions of the times , and the prevalent fashion of drawing auguries from dreams and accidents . The edict ran thus : " Peace and the general contentment of the people , the abundance of the harvest , skill and wisdom shown in the administration , these are prognostics which I hear of with pleasure ; but ' extraordinary clouds , ' ' rare animals , ' ' plants before unknown , ' ' monsters , ' and other astonishing productions of nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ auguries of the future ? I forbid such things to be brought to my notice . " The early death of Kwo Tsey deprived the youthful ruler of his best adviser and the mainstay of his power . He was a man of magnificent capacity and devotion to duty , and when it was suggested to him that he should not be content with any but the supreme place , he proudly replied that he was " a general of the Tangs . " It seems from the inscription on the stone found at Singan that he was a patron of the Nestorian Christians , and his character and career have suggested a comparison with Belisarius. @# Tetsong lived twenty-four years after the death of his champion , and these years can only be characterized as unfortunate . The great governors claimed and exacted the privilege that their dignities should be made hereditary , and this surrender of the imperial prerogative entailed the usual deterioration of the central power which preceded a change of dynasty . Unpopularity was incurred by the imposition of taxes on the principal articles of production and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all , the eunuchs again became supreme in the palace . Although the dynasty survived for another century , it was clear that its knell was sounded before Tetsong died . Under his grandson Hientsong the mischief that had been done became more clearly apparent . Although he enjoyed some military successes , his reign on the whole was unfortunate , and he was poisoned by the chief of the eunuchs . His son and successor , Moutsong , from his indifference may be suspected of having been privy to the occurrence . At any rate , he only enjoyed power for a few years before he was got rid of in the same summary fashion . Several other nonentities came to the throne , until at last one ruler named Wentsong , whose intentions at least were stronger than those of his predecessors , attempted to grapple with the eunuchs and formed a plot for their extermination . His courage failed him and the plot miscarried . The eunuchs exacted a terrible revenge on their opponents , of whom they killed nearly three thousand , and Wentsong passed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their hands . He was not allowed even to name his successor . The eunuchs ignored his two sons , and placed his brother Voutsong on the throne. @# The evils of the day became specially revealed during the reign of Ytsong , who was scarcely seated on the throne before his troops suffered several defeats at the hands of a rebel prince in Yunnan , who completely wrested that province from the empire . He was as pronounced a patron of Buddhism as some of his predecessors had been oppressors , and he sent , at enormous expense , to India a mission to procure a bone of Buddha ' s body , and on its arrival he received the relic on bended knees before his whole court . His extravagance of living landed the Chinese government in fresh difficulties , and he brought the exchequer to the verge of bankruptcy . Nor was he a humane ruler . On one occasion he executed twenty doctors because they were unable to cure a favorite daughter of his . His son Hitsong came to the throne when he was a mere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which his family had sunk . He was driven out of his capital by a rebel named Hwang Chao , and if he had not found an unexpected ally in the Turk chief Likeyong , there would then have been an end to the Tang dynasty . This chief of the Chato immigrants  --  a race supposed to be the ancestors of the Mohammedan Tungani of more recent times  --  at the head of forty thousand men of his own race , who , from the color of their uniform , were named " The Black Crows , " marched against Hwang Chao , and signally defeated him . The condition of the country at this time is painted in deplorable colors . The emperor did not possess a palace , and all the great towns of Central China were in ruins . Likeyong took in the situation at a glance , when he said , " The ruin of the Tangs is not far distant . " Likeyong , who was created Prince of Tsin , did his best to support the emperor , but his power was inadequate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leang , in whose hands the emperor became a mere puppet . At the safe moment Chuwen murdered his sovereign , and added to this crime a massacre of all the Tang princes upon whom he could lay his hands . Chao Siuenti , the last of the Tangs , abdicated , and a few months later Chuwen , to make assurance doubly sure , assassinated him . Thus disappeared , after two hundred and eighty-nine years and after giving twenty rulers to the state , the great Tang dynasty which had restored the unity and the fame of China . It forms a separate chapter in the long period of disunion from the fall of the Hans to the rise of the Sungs. @# After the Tangs came five ephemeral and insignificant dynasties , with the fate of which we need not long detain the reader . In less than sixty years they all vanished from the page of history . The struggle for power between Chuwen , the founder of the so-called Later Leang dynasty , and Likeyong was successfully continued by the latter ' s son , Litsunhiu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a decisive victory at Houlieoupi , and extinguished the Leang dynasty by the capture of its capital and of Chuwen ' s son , who committed suicide . Litsunhiu ruled for a short time as emperor of the Later Leangs , but he was killed during a mutiny of his turbulent soldiers . This dynasty had a very brief existence ; the last ruler of the line , finding the game was up , retired with his family to a tower in his palace , which he set on fire , and perished , with his wives and children , in the flames . Then came the Later Tsins , who only held their authority on the sufferance of the powerful Khitan king , who reigned over Leaoutung and Manchuria . The fourth and fifth of these dynasties , named the Later Hans and Chows , ran their course in less than ten years ; and when the last of these petty rulers was deposed by his prime minister a termination was at last reached to the long period of internal division and weakness which prevailed for more than seven hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firmer ground in the history of China as an empire , and his interest in the subject must assume a more definite form on coming to the beginning of that period of united government and settled authority which has been established for nearly one thousand years , during which no more than four separate families have held possession of the throne. @# @# CHAPTER IV @# THE SUNGS AND THE KINS @# One fact will have been noticed during the latter portion of the period that has now closed , and that is the increasing interest and participation in Chinese affairs of the races neighboring to , but still outside , the empire . A large number of the successful generals , and several of the princely families which attained independence , were of Tartar or Turk origin ; but the founder of the new dynasty , which restored the unity of the empire , was of pure Chinese race , although a native of the most northern province of the country . Chow Kwang Yu was born in Pechihli , at the small town of Yeoutou , on the site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His family had provided the governor of this place for several generations , and Chow himself had seen a good deal of military service during the wars of the period . He is described as a man of powerful physique and majestic appearance , to whose courage and presence of mind the result of more than one great battle was due , and who had become in consequence the idol of the soldiery . The ingenuity of later historians , rather than the credulity of his contemporaries , may have discovered the signs and portents which indicated that he was the chosen of Heaven ; but his army had a simple and convincing method of deciding the destiny of the empire . Like the legionaries of Rome , they exclaimed , " The empire is without a master , and we wish to give it one . Who is more worthy of it than our general ? " Thus did Chow Kwang Yu become the Emperor Taitsou and the founder of the Sung dynasty. @# Taitsou began his reign by proclaiming a general amnesty , and he sent the proclamation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of authority . The step was a politic one , for it informed the Chinese people that they again had an emperor . At the same time he ordered that the gates and doors of his palace should always be left open , so that the humblest of his subjects might have access to him at any time . His own words were that " his house should resemble his heart , which was open to all his subjects . " He also devoted his attention to the improvement of his army , and particularly to the training of his officers , who were called upon to pass an examination in professional subjects as well as physical exercises . A French writer said , forty years ago , that " The laws of military promotion in the states of Europe are far from being as rational and equitable as those introduced by this Chinese ruler . " His solicitude for the welfare of his soldiers was evinced during a campaign when the winter was exceedingly severe . He took off his own fur coat , and sent it to the general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry that he had not one to send to every soldier in the camp . A soldier himself , he knew how to win a soldier ' s heart , and the affection and devotion of his army never wavered nor declined . He had many opportunities of testing it . His first war was with the Prince of Han , aided by the King of Leaoutung , whom he speedily vanquished , and whose capacity for aggression was much curtailed by the loss of the frontier fortress of Loochow . His next contest was with an old comrade-in-arms named Li Chougsin , whom he had treated very well , but who was seized with a foolish desire to be greater than his ability or power warranted . The struggle was brief , and Li Chougsin felt he had no alternative save to commit suicide. @# The tranquillity gained by these successes enabled Taitsou to institute a great reform in the civil administration of the empire , and one which struck at the root of the evil arising from the excessive power and irresponsibility of the provincial governors . Up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and death without reference to the capital . It had enabled them to become tyrants , and had simplified their path to complete independence . Taitsou resolved to deprive them of this prerogative and to retain it in his own hands , for , he said , " As life is the dearest thing men possess , should it be placed at the disposal of an official who is often unjust or wicked ? " This radical reform greatly strengthened the emperor ' s position , and weakened that of the provincial viceroys ; and Taitsou thus inaugurated a rule which has prevailed in China down to the present day , where the life of no citizen can be taken without the express authority and order of the emperor . Taitsou then devoted his attention to the subjugation of those governors who had either disregarded his administration or given it a grudging obedience . The first to feel the weight of his hand was the viceroy of Honan ; but his measures were so well taken , and the military force he employed so overwhelming , that he succeeded in dispossessing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a single man . The governor of Szchuen , believing his power to be greater than it was , or trusting to the remoteness of his province , publicly defied Taitsou , and prepared to invade his dominions . The emperor was too quick for him , and before his army was in the field sixty thousand imperial troops had crossed the frontier and had occupied the province . By these triumphs Taitsou acquired possession of some of the richest provinces and forty millions of Chinese subjects. @# Having composed these internal troubles with enemies of Chinese race , Taitsou resumed his military operations against his old opponents in Leaoutung . Both sides had been making preparations for a renewal of the struggle , and the fortress of Taiyuen , which had been specially equipped to withstand a long siege , was the object of the emperor ' s first attack . The place was valiantly defended by a brave governor and a large garrison , and although Taitsou defeated two armies sent to relieve it , he was compelled to give up the hope of capturing Taiyuen on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the capture of Canton and the districts dependent on that city . He next proceeded against the governor of Kiangnan , the dual province of Anhui and Kiangsu , who had taken the title of Prince of Tang , and striven to propitiate the emperor at the same time that he retained his own independence . The two things were , however , incompatible . Taitsou refused to receive the envoys of the Prince of Tang , and he ordered him to attend in person at the capital . With this the Tang prince would not comply , and an army was at once sent to invade and conquer Kiangnan . The campaign lasted one year , by which time the Tang power was shattered , and his territory resumed its old form as a province of China . With this considerable success Taitsou ' s career may be said to have terminated , for although he succeeded in detaching the Leaoutung ruler from the side of the Prince of Han , and was hastening at the head of his forces to crush his old enemy at Taiyuen , death cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edward the First of England . Taitsou died in his camp , in the midst of his soldiers ; and , acting on the advice of his mother , given on her death-bed a few years before , " that he should leave the throne to a relation of mature age , " he appointed his brother his successor , and as his last exhortation to him said , " Bear yourself as becomes a brave prince , and govern well . " Many pages might be filled with the recitation of Taitsou ' s great deeds and wise sayings ; but his work in uniting China and in giving the larger part of his country tranquillity speaks for itself . His character as a ruler may be gathered from the following selection , taken from among his many speeches : " Do you think , " he said , " that it is so easy for a sovereign to perform his duties ? He does nothing that is without consequence . This morning the thought occurs to me that yesterday I decided a case in a wrong manner , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The new emperor took the style of Taitsong , and during his reign of twenty-three years the Sung dynasty may be fairly considered to have grown consolidated . One of his first measures was to restore the privileges of the descendant of Confucius , which included a hereditary title and exemption from taxation , and which are enjoyed to the present day . After three years ' deliberation Taitsong determined to renew his brother ' s enterprise against Taiyuen , and as he had not assured the neutrality of the King of Leaoutung , his task was the more difficult . On the advance of the Chinese army , that ruler sent to demand the reason of the attack on his friend the Prince of Han , to which the only reply Taitsong gave was as follows : " The country of the Hans was one of the provinces of the empire , and the prince having refused to obey my orders I am determined to punish him . If your prince stands aside , and does not meddle in this quarrel , I am willing to continue to live at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do this we will fight him . " On this the Leaou king declared war , but his troops were repulsed by the covering army sent forward by Taitsong , while he prosecuted the siege of Taiyuen in person . The fortress was well defended , but its doom was never in doubt . Taitsong , moved by a feeling of humanity , offered the Prince of Han generous terms before delivering an assault which was , practically speaking , certain to succeed , and he had the good sense to accept them . The subjugation of Han completed the pacification of the empire and the triumph of Taitsong ; but when that ruler thought to add to this success the speedy overthrow of the Khitan power in Leaoutung he was destined to a rude awakening . His action was certainly precipitate , and marked by overconfidence , for the army of Leaoutung was composed of soldiers of a warlike race accustomed to victory . He advanced against it as if it were an army which would fly at the sight of his standard , but instead of this he discovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banks of the Kaoleang River , where he suffered a serious defeat . Taitsong was fortunate enough to retain his conquests over the southern Han states and to find in his new subjects in that quarter faithful and valiant soldiers . The success of the Leaou army was also largely due to the tactical skill of its general , Yeliu Hiuco , who took a prominent part in the history of this period . When Taitsong endeavored , some years later , to recover what he had lost by the aid of the Coreans , who , however , neglected to fulfill their part of the contract , he only invited fresh misfortunes . Yeliu Hiuco defeated his army in several pitched battles with immense loss ; on one occasion it was said that the corpses of the slain checked the course of a river . The capture of Yangyeh , the old Han defender of Taiyuen , who died of his wounds , completed the triumph of the Leaou general , for it was said , " If Yangyeh can not resist the Tartars they must be invincible . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reverses ; but , on the whole , it was successful and creditable , marking an improvement in the condition of the country and the people , and the triumph of the Sungs over at least one of their natural enemies. @# His son and successor , Chintsong , must be pronounced fortunate in that the first year of his reign witnessed the death of Yeliu Hiuco . The direct consequence of his death was that the Chinese were , for the first time , successful in their campaign against the Leaous . But this satisfactory state of things did not long continue , and the Leaous became so aggressive and successful that there was almost a panic among the Chinese , and the removal of the capital to a place of greater security was suggested . The firm counsel and the courageous demeanor of the minister Kaochun prevented this course being adopted . He figuratively described the evil consequences of retreat by saying , " Your majesty can , without serious consequences , advance a foot further than is absolutely necessary , but you can not retire , even to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harm . " Chintsong , fortunately for himself and his state , adopted this course ; and the Tartars thought it best to come to terms , especially as the Chinese emperor was willing to pay annually an allowance in silk and money as the reward of their respecting his frontier . The arrangement could not have been a bad one , as it gave the empire eighteen years of peace , The country , no doubt , increased greatly in prosperity during this period ; but the reputation of Chintsong steadily declined . He seems to have been naturally superstitious , and he gave himself up to fortune tellers and soothsayers during the last years of his reign ; and when he died , in A.D. 1022 , he had impaired the position and power of the imperial office . Yet , so far as can be judged , the people were contented , and the population rose to over one hundred million. @# Chintsong was succeeded by his sixth son , Jintsong , a boy of thirteen , for whom the government was carried on by his mother , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off objectionable taxes on tea and salt  --  prime necessaries of life in China  --  and she instituted surer measures against the spiritualists and magicians who had flourished under her husband and acquired many administrative offices under his patronage . After ruling for ten peaceful years she died and Jintsong assumed the personal direction of affairs . During the tranquillity that had now prevailed for more than a generation a new power had arisen on the Chinese frontier in the principality of Tangut or Hia . This state occupied the modern province of Kansuh , with some of the adjacent districts of Koko Nor and the Gobi Desert . Chao Yuen , the prince of this territory , was an ambitious warrior , who had drawn round his standard a force of one hundred and fifty thousand fighting men . With this he waged successful war upon the Tibetans , and began a course of encroachments on Chinese territory which was not to be distinguished from open hostility . Chao Yuen was not content with the appellation of prince , and " because he came of a family several of whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he adopted the title of emperor . Having taken this step , Chao Yuen wrote to Jintsong expressing " the hope that there would be a constant and solid peace between the two empires . " The reply of the Chinese ruler to this insult , as he termed it , was to declare war and to offer a reward for the head of Chao Yuen. @# It was soon made evident that Chao Yuen possessed the military power to support an imperial dignity . He defeated the emperor ' s army in two pitched battles at Sanchuen and Yang Moulong , and many years elapsed before the Sung rulers can be held to have recovered from the loss of their best armies . The Khitans of Leaoutung took advantage of these misfortunes to encroach , and as Jintsong had no army with which to oppose them , they captured ten cities with little or no resistance . The Chinese government was compelled to purchase them back by increasing the annual allowance it paid of gold and silk . A similar policy was resorted to in the case of Chao @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year one hundred thousand pieces of silk and thirty thousand pounds of tea . Not content with this payment , Chao Yuen subsequently exacted the right to build fortresses along the Chinese frontier . Soon after this Chao Yuen was murdered by one of his sons , whose betrothed he had taken from him . If Jintsong was not fortunate in his wars he did much to promote education and to encourage literature . He restored the colleges founded by the Tangs , he built a school or academy in every town , he directed the public examinations to be held impartially and frequently , and he gave special prizes as a reward for elocution . Some of the greatest historians China has produced lived in his reign , and wrote their works under his patronage ; of these Szemakwang was the most famous . His history of the Tangs is a masterpiece , and his " Garden of Szemakwang " an idyll . He was remarkable for his sound judgment as well as the elegance of his style , and during the short time he held the post of prime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The character of Jintsong was , it will be seen , not without its good points , which gained for him the affection of his subjects despite his bad fortune against the national enemies , and his reign of thirty years was , generally speaking , prosperous and satisfactory . After the brief reign of his nephew , Yngtsong , that prince ' s son , Chintsong the Second , became emperor. @# The career of Wanganchi , an eccentric and socialistic statesman , who wished to pose as a great national reformer , and who long possessed the ear and favor of his sovereign , lends an interest to the reign of the second Chintsong . Wanganchi did not possess the confidence or the admiration of his brother officials , and subsequent writers have generally termed him an impostor and a charlatan . But he may only have been a misguided enthusiast when he declared that " the State should take the entire management of commerce , industry , and agriculture into its own hands , with the view of succoring the working classes , and preventing their being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advocacy of such a scheme is calculated to earn popularity , as few of those who are to benefit by it stop to examine its feasibility , and Wanganchi might have been remembered as an enlightened thinker and enthusiastic advocate of the rights of the masses if he had not been called upon to carry out his theories . But the proof of experience , like the touch of Ithuriel ' s spear , revealed the practical value of his suggestions , and dissolved the attractive vision raised by his perfervid eloquence and elevated enthusiasm . His honesty of purpose can not , however , be disputed . On being appointed to the post of chief minister he took in hand the application of his own project . He exempted the poor from all taxation . He allotted lands , and he supplied the cultivators with seeds and implements . He also appointed local boards to superintend the efforts of the agricultural classes , and to give them assistance and advice . But this paternal government , this system of making the state do what the individual ought to do for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Those who counted on the agricultural laborer working with as much intelligence and energy for himself as he had done under the direction of a master were doomed to disappointment . Want of skill , the fitfulness of the small holder , aggravated perhaps by national calamities , drought , flood , and pestilence , being felt more severely by laborers than by capitalists , led to a gradual shrinkage in the area of cultivated land , and at last to the suffering of the classes who were to specially benefit from the scheme of Wanganchi . The failure of his scheme , which , to use his own words , aimed at preventing there being any poor or over-rich persons in the state , entailed his disgrace and fall from power . But his work and his name have continued to excite interest and speculation among his countrymen down to the present day . His memory has been aspersed by the writers of China , who have generally denounced him as a free-thinker and a nihilist , and although , twenty years after his death , a tablet bearing his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatest Chinese thinker since Mencius , it was removed after a brief period , and since then both the name and the works of Wanganchi have been consigned to an oblivion from which only the curiosity of European writers has rescued them. @# Chintsong ' s reign was peaceful , but he seems to have only avoided war by yielding to all the demands of the Tartars , who encroached on the frontier and seized several Chinese cities . His son Chetsong was only ten when he became emperor , and the administration was carried on by his mother , the Empress Tefei , another of the capable women of Chinese history . Her early death left Chetsong to rule as he listed , and his first acts of independent authority were not of happy augury for the future . He had not been on the throne many months before he divorced his principal wife without any apparent justification , and when remonstrated with he merely replied that he was imitating several of his predecessors . The censor ' s retort was , " You would do better to imitate their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have any long opportunity of doing either , for he died of grief at the loss of his favorite son , and it is recorded that , as " he did not expect to die so soon , " he omitted the precaution of selecting an heir . Fortunately the mischief of a disputed successor was avoided by the unanimous selection of his brother Hoeitsong as the new emperor . He proved himself a vain and superstitious ruler , placing his main faith in fortune tellers , and expecting his subjects to yield implicit obedience to his opinions as " the master of the law and the prince of doctrine . " Among other fallacies , Hoeitsong cherished the belief that he was a great soldier , and he aspired to rank as the conqueror of the old successful enemy of China , the Khitans of Leaoutung . He had no army worthy of the name , and the southern Chinese who formed the mass of his subjects were averse to war , yet his personal vanity impelled him to rush into hostilities which promised to be the more serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ northern frontier. @# The Niuche or Chorcha Tartars , who had assumed a distinct name and place in the vicinity of the modern Kalgan , about the year 1000 A.D. , had become subservient to the great Khitan chief Apaoki , and their seven hordes had remained faithful allies of his family and kingdom for many years after his death . But some of the clan had preferred independence to the maintenance of friendly relations with their greatest neighbor , and they had withdrawn northward into Manchuria . For some unknown reason the Niuche became dissatisfied with their Khitan allies , and about the year 1100 A.D. they had all drawn their forces together as an independent confederacy under the leadership of a great chief named Akouta . The Niuche could only hope to establish their independence by offering a successful resistance to the King of Leaoutung , who naturally resented the defection of a tribe which had been his humble dependents . They succeeded in this task beyond all expectation , as Akouta inflicted a succession of defeats on the hitherto invincible army of Leaoutung . Then the Niuche conqueror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empire ' s destiny , and to found a dynasty of his own . He collected his troops , and he addressed them in a speech reciting their deeds and his pretensions . " The Khitans , " he said , " had in the earlier days of their success taken the name of Pintiei , meaning the iron of Pinchow , but although that iron may be excellent , it is liable to rust and can be eaten away . There is nothing save gold which is unchangeable and which does not destroy itself . Moreover , the family of Wangyen , with which I am connected through the chief Hanpou , had always a great fancy for glittering colors such as that of gold , and I am now resolved to take this name as that of my imperial family . I therefore give it the name of Kin , which signifies gold . " This speech was made in the year 1115 , and it was the historical introduction of the Kin dynasty , which so long rivaled the Sung , and which , although it attained only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was remarkable as being the first appearance of the ancestors of the present reigning Manchus. @# Like other conquerors who had appeared in the same quarter , the Kins , as we must now call them , owed their rise to their military qualifications and to their high spirit . Their tactics , although of a simpler kind , were as superior to those of the Leaous as the latter ' s were to the Chinese . Their army consisted exclusively of cavalry , and victory was generally obtained by its furious attacks delivered from several sides simultaneously . The following description , taken from Mailla ' s translation of the Chinese official history , gives the best account of their army and mode of fighting : @# " At first the Niuche had only cavalry . For their sole distinction they made use of a small piece of braid on which they marked certain signs , and they attached this to both man and horse . Their companies were usually composed of only fifty men each , twenty of whom , clothed in strong cuirasses , and armed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and behind those came the remaining thirty in less weighty armor , and with bows and arrows or javelins for weapons . When they encountered an enemy , two men from each company advanced as scouts , and then arranging their troops so as to attack from four sides , they approached the foe at a gentle trot until within a hundred yards of his line . Thereupon charging at full speed , they discharged their arrows and javelins , again retiring with the same celerity . This maneuver they repeated several times until they threw the ranks into confusion , when they fell upon them with sword and pike so impetuously that they generally gained the victory. " @# The novelty , as well as the impetuosity , of their attack supplied the want of numbers and of weapons , and when the Khitans raised what seemed an overwhelming force to crush the new power that ventured to play the rival to theirs in Northern China , Akouta , confident in himself and in his people , was not dismayed , and accepted the offer of battle . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threatened with early extinction the once famous dynasty of Leaoutung . When the Sung emperor heard of the defeats of his old opponents , he at once rushed to the conclusion that the appearance of this new power on the flank of Leaoutung must redound to his advantage , and , although warned by the King of Corea that " the Kins were worse than wolves and tigers , " he sent an embassy to Akouta proposing a joint alliance against the Khitans . The negotiations were not at first successful . Akouta concluded a truce with Leaoutung , but took offense at the style of the emperor ' s letter . The peace was soon broken by either the Kins or the Khitans , and Hoeitsong consented to address Akouta as the Great Emperor of the Kins . Then Akouta engaged to attack Leaoutung from the north , while the Chinese assailed it on the south , and a war began which promised a speedy termination . But the tardiness and inefficiency of the Chinese army prolonged the struggle , and covered the reputation of Hoeitsong and his troops with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disastrous retreat , and the peasants of Leaoutung sang ballads about its cowardice and insufficiency. @# But if it fared badly with the Chinese , the armies of Akouta continued to be victorious , and the Khitans fled not less precipitately before him than the Chinese did before them . Their best generals were unable to make the least stand against the Kin forces . Their capital was occupied by the conqueror , and the last descendant of the great Apaoki fled westward to seek an asylum with the Prince of Hia or Tangut . He does not appear to have received the protection he claimed , for after a brief stay at the court of Hia , he made his way to the desert , where , after undergoing incredible hardships , he fell into the hands of his Kin pursuers . With his death soon afterward the Khitan dynasty came to an end , after enjoying its power for two hundred years , but some members of this race escaped across the Gobi Desert , and founded the brief-lived dynasty of the Kara Khitay in Turkestan . Akouta died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his brother Oukimai ruled in his place. @# The ill-success of Hoeitsong ' s army in its joint campaign against Leaoutung cost the emperor his share in the spoil . The Kins retained the whole of the conquered territory , and the Sung prince was the worse off , because he had a more powerful and aggressive neighbor . The ease of their conquest , and the evident weakness of the Chinese , raised the confidence of the Kins to such a high point that they declared that the Sungs must surrender to them the whole of the territory north of the Hoangho , and they prepared to secure what they demanded by force of arms . The Chinese would neither acquiesce in the transfer of this region to the Kins nor take steps to defend it . They were driven out of that portion of the empire like sheep , and they even failed to make any stand at the passage of the Hoangho , where the Kin general declared that " there could not be a man left in China , for if two thousand men had defended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in crossing it . " Hoeitsong quitted his capital Kaifong to seek shelter at Nankin , where he hoped to enjoy greater safety , and shortly afterward he abdicated in favor of his son Kintsong . The siege of Kaifong which followed ended in a convention binding the Chinese to pay the Kins an enormous sum  --  ten millions of small gold nuggets , twenty millions of small silver nuggets , and ten million pieces of silk ; but the Tartar soldiers soon realized that there was no likelihood of their ever receiving this fabulous spoil , and in their indignation they seized both Hoeitsong and Kintsong , as well as any other members of the royal family on whom they could lay their hands , and carried them off to Tartary , where both the unfortunate Sung princes died as prisoners of the Kins. @# Although the Kins wished to sweep the Sungs from the throne , and their general Walipou went so far as to proclaim the emperor of a new dynasty , whose name is forgotten , another of the sons of Hoeitsong , Prince Kang Wang , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preserving the Sung dynasty . He even succeeded in imparting a new vigor to it , for on the advice of his mother , who pointed out to him that " for nearly two hundred years the nation appears to have forgotten the art of war , " he devoted all his attention to the improvement of his army and the organization of his military resources . Prince Kang Wang , on becoming emperor , took the name of Kaotsong , and finally removed the southern capital to Nankin . He was also driven by his financial necessities to largely increase the issue of paper money , which had been introduced under the Tangs . As both the Kins and the Mongols had recourse to the same expedient , it is not surprising that the Sungs should also have adopted the simplest mode of compensating for a depleted treasury . Considering the unexpected difficulties with which he had to cope , and the low ebb to which the fortunes of China had fallen , much might be forgiven to Kaotsong , who found a courageous counselor in the Empress Mongchi , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Although the whole of your august family has been led captive into the countries of the north , none the less does China , which knows your wisdom and fine qualities , preserve toward the Sungs the same affection , fidelity , and zeal as in the past . She hopes and expects that you will prove for her what Kwang Vouti was for the Hans . " If Kaotsong did not attain the height of this success , he at least showed himself a far more capable prince than any of his immediate predecessors. @# The successful employment of cavalry by the Kins naturally led the Chinese to think of employing the same arm against them , although the inhabitants of the eighteen provinces have never been good horsemen . Kaotsong also devoted his attention especially to the formation of a corps of charioteers . The chariots , four-wheeled , carried twenty-four combatants , and these vehicles drawn up in battle array not only presented a very formidable appearance , but afforded a very material shelter for the rest of the army . Kaotsong seems to have been better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . After he had originated much good work he allowed it to languish for want of definite support , and he quarreled with and disgraced the minister chiefly responsible for these reforms . A short time after this the Kins again advanced southward , but thanks to the improvement effected in the Chinese army , and to the skill and valor of Tsongtse , one of Kaotsong ' s lieutenants , they did not succeed in gaining any material advantage . Their efforts to capture Kaifong failed , and their general Niyamoho , recognizing the improvement in the Chinese army , was content to withdraw his army with such spoil as it had been able to collect . Tsongtse followed up this good service against the enemy by bringing to their senses several rebellious officials who thought they saw a good opportunity of shaking off the Sung authority . At this stage of the war Tsongtse exhorted Kaotsong , who had quitted Nankin for Yangchow , to return to Kaifong to encourage his troops with his presence , especially as there never was such a favorable opportunity of delivering his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tsongtse is reported to have sent as many as twenty formal petitions to his sovereign to do this , but Kaotsong was deaf to them all , and it is said that his obtuseness and want of nerve caused Tsongtse so much pain that he died of chagrin. @# The death of Tsongtse induced the Kins to make a more strenuous effort to humiliate the Sungs , and a large army under the joint command of Akouta ' s son , Olito , and the general Niyamoho , advanced on the capital and captured Yangchow . Kaotsong , who saved his life by precipitate flight , then agreed to sign any treaty drawn up by his conqueror . In his letter to Niyamoho he said , " Why fatigue your troops with long and arduous marches when I will grant you of my own will whatever you demand ? " But the Kins were inexorable , and refused to grant any terms short of the unconditional surrender of Kaotsong , who fled to Canton , pursued both on land and sea . The Kin conquerors soon found that they had advanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some advantage during their retreat . Some return of confidence followed this turn in the fortune of the war , and two Chinese generals , serving in the hard school of adversity , acquired a military knowledge and skill which made them formidable to even the best of the Kin commanders . The campaigns carried on between 1131 and 1134 differed from any that had preceded them in that the Kin forces steadily retired before Oukiai and Changtsiun , and victory , which had so long remained constant in their favor , finally deserted their arms . The death of the Kin emperor , Oukimai , who had upheld with no decline of luster the dignity of his father Akouta , completed the discomfiture of the Kins , and contributed to the revival of Chinese power under the last emperor of the Sung dynasty . The reign of Oukimai marks the pinnacle of Kin power , which under his cousin and successor Hola began steadily to decline. @# The possession of Honan formed the principal bone of contention between the Kins and Sungs , but after considerable negotiation and some fighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Kins , and also to pay them a large annual subsidy in silk and money . He also agreed to hold the remainder of his states as a gift at the hands of his northern neighbor . Thus , notwithstanding the very considerable successes gained by several of the Sung generals , Kaotsong had to undergo the mortification of signing a humiliating peace and retaining his authority only on sufferance . Fortunately for the independence of the Sungs , Hola was murdered by Ticounai , a grandson of Akouta , whose ferocious character and ill-formed projects for the subjugation of the whole of China furnished the Emperor Kaotsong with the opportunity of shaking off the control asserted over his actions and recovering his dignity . The extensive preparations of the Kin government for war warned the Sungs to lose no time in placing every man they could in the field , and when Ticounai rushed into the war , which was all of his own making , he found that the Sungs were quite ready to receive him and offer a strenuous resistance to his attack . A peace of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forces and recovering from an unreasoning terror of the Kins . Moreover , there was a very general feeling among the inhabitants of both the north and the south that the war was an unjust one , and that Ticounai had embarked upon a course of lawless aggression which his tyrannical and cruel proceedings toward his own subjects served to inflame. @# The war began in 1161 A. D. , with an ominous defeat of the Kin navy , and when Kaotsong nerved himself for the crisis in his life and placed himself at the head of his troops , Ticounai must have felt less sanguine of the result than his confident declaration that he would end the war in a single campaign indicated . Before the two armies came into collision Ticounai learned that a rebellion had broken out in his rear , and that his cousin Oulo challenged both his legitimacy and his authority . He believed , and perhaps wisely , that the only way to deal with this new danger was to press on , and by gaining a signal victory over the Sungs annihilate all his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be gained , and he seems to have underestimated his opponent . He reached the Yangtsekiang , and the Sungs retired behind it . Ticounai had no means of crossing it , as his fleet had been destroyed and the Sung navy stood in his path . Such river junks as he possessed were annihilated in another encounter on the river . He offered sacrifices to heaven in order to obtain a safe passage , but the powers above were deaf to his prayers . Discontent and disorder broke out in his camp . The army that was to have carried all before it was stopped by a mere river , and Ticounai ' s reputation as a general was ruined before he had crossed swords with the enemy . In this dilemma his cruelty increased , and after he had sentenced many of his officers and soldiers to death he was murdered by those who found that they would have to share the same fate . After this tragic ending of a bad career , the Kin army retreated . They concluded a friendly convention with the Sungs , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this grave peril , abdicated the throne , which had proved to him no bed of roses , in favor of his adopted heir Hiaotsong . Kaotsong ruled during the long period of thirty-six years , and when we consider the troubled time through which he passed , and the many vicissitudes of fortune he underwent , he probably rejoiced at being able to spend the last twenty-five years of his life without the responsibility of governing the empire and free from the cares of sovereignty. @# The new Kin ruler Oulo wished for peace , but a section of his turbulent subjects clamored for a renewal of the expeditions into China , and he was compelled to bend to the storm . The Kin army , however , had no cause to rejoice in its bellicoseness , for the Chinese general , Changtsiun , defeated it in a battle the like of which had not been seen for ten years . After this a peace was concluded which proved fairly durable , and the remainder of the reigns of both Oulo and Hiaotsong were peaceful and prosperous for northern and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to war and an appreciation of peace which was rare in their day . The Kin ruler is stated to have made this noble retort when he was solicited by a traitor from a neighboring state to seize it : " You deceive yourself if you believe me to be capable of approving an act of treason whatever the presumed advantage it might procure me . I love all peoples of whatever nation they may be , and I wish to see them at peace with one another . " It is not surprising to learn that a prince who was so thoroughly imbued with the spirit of civilization should have caused the Chinese classics to be translated into the Kin language . Of all the Kin rulers he was the most intellectual and the most anxious to elevate the standard of his people , who were far ruder than the inhabitants of southern China. @# Hiaotsong was succeeded by his son Kwangtsong , and Oulo by his grandson Madacou , both of whom continued the policy of their predecessors . Kwangtsong was saved the trouble of ruling by his wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space he resigned the empty title of emperor , which brought him neither satisfaction nor pleasure . Ningtsong , the son and successor of Kwangtsong , ventured on one war with the Kins in which he was worsted . This the last of the Kin successes , for Madacou died soon afterward , just on the eve of the advent of the Mongol peril , which threatened to sweep all before it , and which eventually buried both Kin and Sung in a common ruin . The long competition and the bitter contest between the Kins and Sungs had not resulted in the decisive success of either side . The Kins had been strong enough to found an administration in the north but not to conquer China . The Sungs very naturally represent in Chinese history the national dynasty , and their misfortunes rather than their successes appeal to the sentiment of the reader . They showed themselves greater in adversity than in prosperity , and when the Mongol tempest broke over China they proved the more doughty opponent , and the possessor of greater powers of resistance than their uniformly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ V @# THE MONGOL CONQUEST OF CHINA @# While the Kins were absorbed in their contest with the Southern Chinese , they were oblivious of the growth of a new and formidable power on their own borders . The strength of the Mongols had acquired serious dimensions before the Kins realized that they would have to fight , not only for supremacy , but for their very existence . Before describing the long wars that resulted in the subjection of China by this northern race , we must consider the origin and the growth of the power of the Mongols , who were certainly the most remarkable race of conquerors Asia , or perhaps the whole world , ever produced. @# The home of the Mongols , whose name signifies " brave men , " was in the strip of territory between the Onon and Kerulon rivers , which are both tributaries or upper courses of the Amour . They first appeared as a separate clan or tribe in the ninth century , when they attracted special attention for their physical strength and courage during one of China ' s many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was on that occasion they gained the appellation under which they became famous . The earlier history of the Mongol tribe is obscure , and baffles investigation , but there seems no reason to doubt their affinity to the Hiongnou , with whose royal house Genghis himself claimed blood relationship . If this claim be admitted , Genghis and Attila , who were the two specially typical Scourges of God , must be considered members of the same race , and the probability is certainly strengthened by the close resemblance in their methods of carrying on war . Budantsar is the first chief of the House of Genghis whose person and achievements are more than mythical . He selected as the abode of his race the territory between the Onon and the Kerulon , a region fertile in itself , and well protected by those rivers against attack . It was also so well placed as to be beyond the extreme limit of any triumphant progress of the armies of the Chinese emperor . If Budantsar had accomplished nothing more than this , he would still have done much to justify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But he seems to have incited his followers to pursue an active and temperate life , to remain warriors rather than to become rich and lazy citizens . He wrapped up this counsel in the exhortation , " What is the use of embarrassing ourselves with wealth ? Is not the fate of man decreed by heaven ? " He sowed the seed of future Mongol greatness , and the headship of his clan remained vested in his family. @# In due order of succession the chief ship passed to Kabul Khan , who in the year 1135 began to encroach on the dominion of Hola , the Kin emperor . He seems to have been induced to commit this act of hostility by a prophecy , to the effect that his children should be emperors , and also by discourteous treatment received on the occasion of his visit to the court of Oukimai . Whatever the cause of umbrage , Kabul Khan made the Kins pay dearly for their arrogance or short-sighted policy . Hola sent an army under one of his best generals , Hushahu , to bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his home stood him in good stead . The Kin army suffered greatly in its futile attempt to cross the desert , and during its retreat it was harassed by the pursuing Mongols . When the Kin army endeavored to make a stand against its pursuers , it suffered a crushing overthrow in a battle at Hailing , and on the Kins sending a larger force against the Mongols in 1139 , it had no better fortune . Kabul Khan , after this second success , caused himself to be proclaimed Great Emperor of the Mongols . His success in war , and his ambition , which rested satisfied with no secondary position , indicated the path on which the Mongols proceeded to the acquisition of supreme power and a paramount military influence whithersoever they carried their name and standards . The work begun by Kabul was well continued by his son Kutula , or Kublai . He , too , was a great warrior , whose deeds of prowess aroused as much enthusiasm among the Mongols as those of Coeur de Lion evoked in the days of the Plantagenets . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the execution of several Mongols of importance , who happened to fall into the hands of the Kins . When Kutula died the chiefship passed to his nephew , Yissugei , who greatly extended the influence and power of his family among the tribes neighboring to the Mongol home . Many of these , and even some Chinese , joined the military organization of the dominant tribe , so that what was originally a small force of strictly limited numbers became a vast and ever-increasing confederacy of the most warlike and aggressive races of the Chinese northern frontier . Important as Yissugei ' s work in the development of Mongol power undoubtedly was , his chief historical interest is derived from the fact that he was the father of Genghis Khan. @# There are several interesting fables in connection with the birth of Genghis , which event may be safely assigned to the year 1162 . One of these reads as follows : " One day Yissugei was hunting in company with his brothers , and was following the tracks of a white hare in the snow . They struck upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to a spot where a woman ' s yart was pitched . Then said Yissugei , ' This woman will bear a valiant son . ' He discovered that she was the damsel Ogelen Eke ( i. e. , the mother of nations ) , and that she was the wife of Yeke Yilatu , chief of a Tartar tribe . Yissugei carried her off and made her his wife . " Immediately after his overthrow of Temujin , chief of one of the principal Tartar tribes , Yissugei learned that the promised " valiant son " was about to be born , and in honor of his victory he gave him the name of Temujin , which was the proper name of the great Genghis . The village or encampment in which the future conqueror first saw the light of day still bears the old Mongol name , Dilun Boldak , on the banks of the Onon . When Yissugei died , Temujin , or Genghis , was only thirteen , and his clan of forty thousand families refused to recognize him as their leader . At a meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes to stand by the son of their former chief , but the majority of them mocked at him , exclaiming , " The deepest wells are sometimes dry , and the hardest stone is sometimes broken , why should we cling to thee ? " Genghis owed to the heroic attitude of his mother , who flung abroad the cow-tailed banner of his race , the acceptance of his authority by about half the warriors who had obeyed his father . The great advantage of this step was that it gave Genghis time to grow up to be a warrior as famous as any of his predecessors , and it certainly averted what might have easily become the irretrievable disintegration of the Mongol alliance. @# The youth of Genghis was passed in one ceaseless struggle to regain the whole of his birthright . His most formidable enemy was Chamuka , chief of the Juriats , and for a long time he had all the worst of the struggle , being taken prisoner on one occasion , and undergoing the indignity of the cangue . On making his escape he rallied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and on the advice of his mother , Ogelen Eke , who was his principal adviser and stanchest supporter , he divided his forces into thirteen regiments of one thousand men each , and confined his attention to the defense of his own territory . Chamuka , led away by what he deemed the weakness of his adversary , attacked him on the Onon with as he considered the overwhelming force of thirty thousand men ; but the result dispelled his hopes of conquest , for Genghis gained a decisive victory . Then was furnished a striking instance of the truth of the saying that " nothing succeeds like success . " The despised Temujin , who was thought to be unworthy of the post of ruling the Mongols , was lauded to the skies , and the tribes declared with one voice , " Temujin alone is generous and worthy of ruling a great people . " At this time also he began to show the qualities of a statesman and diplomatist . He formed in 1194 a temporary alliance with the Kin emperor , Madacou , and the richness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while his experience of the Kin army went to prove that they were not so formidable as had been imagined . The discomfiture of Chamuka has been referred to , but he had not abandoned the hope of success , and when he succeeded in detaching the Kerait chief , Wang Khan , from the Mongols , to whom he was bound by ties of gratitude , he fancied that he again held victory in his grasp . But the intrigue did not realize his expectations . Wang Khan deserted Genghis while engaged in a joint campaign against the Naimans , but he was the principal sufferer by his treachery , for the enemy pursued his force , and inflicted a heavy defeat upon it . In fact , he was only rescued from destruction by the timely aid of the man he had betrayed. @# But far from inspiring gratitude , this incident inflamed the resentment of Wang Khan , who , throwing off the cloak of simulated friendship , declared publicly that either the Kerait or the Mongol must be supreme on the great steppe , as there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbers of the Kerait , that in the first battle of this long and keenly- contested struggle , Wang Khan defeated Temujin near Ourga , where the mounds that cover the slain are still shown to the curious or skeptical visitor . After this serious , and in some degree unexpected reverse , the fortunes of Genghis sank to the lowest ebb . He was reduced to terrible straits , and had to move his camp rapidly from one spot to another . A small section of his followers , mindful of his past success and prowess , still clung to him , and by a sudden and daring coup he changed the whole aspect of the contest . He surprised Wang Khan in his camp at night , and overwhelmed him and his forces . Wang Khan escaped to his old foes , the Naimans , who , disregarding the laws of hospitality , put him to death . The death of Wang Khan signified nothing less than the wholesale defection of the Kerait tribe , which joined Genghis to the last man . Then Genghis turned westward to settle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both hostile and defiant . The Naiman chief shared the opinion of Wang Khan , that there could not be two masters on the Tian Shan , and with that vigorous illustration which has never been wanting to these illiterate tribes , he wrote , " There can not be two suns in the sky , two swords in one sheath , two eyes in one eyepit , or two kings in one empire . " Both sides made strenuous efforts for the fray , and brought every fighting man they could into the field . The decisive battle of the war was fought in the heart of Jungaria , and the star of Genghis rose in the ascendant . The Naimans fought long and well , but they were borne down by the heavier armed Mongols , and their desperate resistance only added to their loss . Their chief died of his wounds , and the triumph of Genghis was rendered complete by the capture of his old enemy , Chamuka . As Genghis had sworn the oath of friendship with Chamuka , he would not slay him , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exacted the rough revenge his past hostility and treachery seemed to call for . On his way back from this campaign the Mongol chief attacked the Prince of Hia , who reigned over Kansuh and Tangut , and thus began the third war he waged for the extension of his power . Before this assumed serious proportions he summoned a Grand Council or Kuriltai , at his camp on the Onon , and then erected outside his tent the royal Mongol banner of the nine white yak-tails . It was on this occasion that Temujin took , and was proclaimed among the Mongol chiefs by , the highly exalted name of Genghis Khan , which means Very Mighty Khan . The Chinese character for the name signifies " Perfect Warrior , " and the earlier European writers affirm that it is supposed to represent the sound of " the bird of heaven . " At this assemblage , which was the first of a long succession of Mongol councils summoned at the same place on critical occasions , it was proposed and agreed that the war should be carried on with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Among soldiers it is necessary to preserve the spirit of pre-eminence and warlike zeal by granting rewards and decorations . Genghis realized the importance of this matter , and instituted the order of Baturu or Bahadur , meaning warrior . He also made his two leading generals Muhula and Porshu princes , one to sit on his right hand and the other on his left . He addressed them before the council in the following words : " It is to you that I owe my empire . You are and have been to me as the shafts of a carriage or the arms to a man ' s body . " Seals of office were also granted to all the officials , so that their authority might be the more evident and the more honored. @# In 1207 Genghis began his war with the state of Hia , which he had determined to crush as the preliminary to an invasion of China . In that year he contented himself with the capture of Wuhlahai , one of the border fortresses of that principality , and in the following year he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully , thus gaining many Kirghiz and Naiman auxiliaries . In 1209 he resumed the war with Hia in a determined spirit , and placed himself in person at the head of all his forces . Although the Hia ruler prepared as well as he could for the struggle , he was really unnerved by the magnitude of the danger he had to face . His army was overthrown , his best generals were taken prisoners , and he himself had no resource left but to throw himself on the consideration of Genghis . For good reasons the Mongol conqueror was lenient . He married one of the daughters of the king , and he took him into subsidiary alliance with himself . Thus did Genghis absorb the Hia power , which was very considerable , and prepared to enroll it with all his own resources against the Kin empire . If the causes of Mongol success on this occasion and afterward are inquired for , I can not do better than repeat what I previously wrote on this subject : " The Mongols owed their military success to their admirable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war . Their military supremacy arose from their superiority in all essentials as a fighting power to their neighbors . Much of their knowledge was borrowed from China , where the art of disciplining a large army and maneuvering it in the field had been brought to a high state of perfection many centuries before the time of Genghis . But the Mongols carried the teaching of the past to a further point than any of the former or contemporary Chinese commanders , indeed , than any in the whole world , had done ; and the revolution which they effected in tactics was not less remarkable in itself , and did not leave a smaller impression upon the age , than the improvements made in military science by Frederick the Great and Napoleon in their day . The Mongol played in a large way in Asia the part which the Normans on a smaller scale played in Europe . Although the landmarks of their triumph have now almost wholly vanished , they were for two centuries the dominant caste in most of the states of Asia. " @# Having thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remained to find a plausible pretext for attacking the Kins . With or without a pretext Genghis would no doubt have made war , but even the ruthless Mongol sometimes showed a regard for appearances . Many years before the Kins had sent as envoy to the Mongul encampment Chonghei , a member of their ruling house , and his mission had been not only unsuccessful , but had led to a personal antipathy between the two men . In the course of time Chonghei succeeded Madacou as emperor of the Kins , and when a Kin messenger brought intelligence of this event to Genghis , the Mongol ruler turned toward the south , spat upon the ground , and said , " I thought that your sovereigns were of the race of the gods , but do you suppose that I am going to do homage to such an imbecile as that ? " The affront rankled in the mind of Chonghei , and while Genghis was engaged with Hia , he sent troops to attack the Mongol outposts . Chonghei thus placed himself in the wrong , and gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began the war . The reputation of the Golden dynasty , although not as great as it once was , still stood sufficiently high to make the most adventurous of desert chiefs wary in attacking it . Genghis had already secured the co- operation of the ruler of Hia in his enterprise , and he next concluded an alliance with Yeliu Liuko , chief of the Khitans , who were again manifesting discontent with the Kins . Genghis finally circulated a proclamation among all the desert tribes , calling upon them to join him in his attack on the common enemy . This appeal was heartily and generally responded to , and it was at the head of an enormous force that Genghis set out in March , 1211 , to effect the conquest of China . The Mongol army was led by Genghis in person , and under him his four sons and his most famous general , Chepe Noyan , held commands. @# The plan of campaign of the Mongol ruler was as simple as it was bold . From his camp at Karakoram , on the Kerulon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ongut country to Taitong , securing an unopposed passage through the Great Wall by the defection of the Ongut tribe . The Kins were unprepared for this sudden and vigorous assault directed on their weakest spot , and successfully executed before their army could reach the scene . During the two years that the forces of Genghis kept the field on this occasion , they devastated the greater portion of the three northern provinces of Shensi , Shansi , and Pechihli . But the border fortress of Taitong and the Kin capital , Tungking , successfully resisted all the assaults of the Mongols , and when Genghis received a serious wound at the former place , he reluctantly ordered the retreat of his army , laden with an immense quantity of spoil , but still little advanced in its main task of conquering China . The success of the Khitan Yeliu Liuko had not been less considerable , and he was proclaimed King of Leaou as a vassal of the Mongols . The planting of this ally on the very threshold of Chinese power facilitated the subsequent enterprises of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result of this war. @# In 1213 Genghis again invaded the Kin dominions , but his success was not very striking , and in several engagements of no very great importance the Kin arms met with some success . The most important events of the year were , however , the deposition and murder of Chonghei , the murder of a Kin general , Hushahu , who had won a battle against the Mongols , and the proclamation of Utubu as emperor . The change of sovereign brought no change of fortune to the unlucky Kins . Utubu was only able to find safety behind the walls of his capital , and he was delighted when Genghis wrote him the following letter : " Seeing your wretched condition and my exalted fortune , what may your opinion be now of the will of heaven with regard to myself ? At this moment I am desirous to return to Tartary , but could you allow my soldiers to take their departure without appeasing their anger with presents ? " In reply Utubu sent Genghis a princess of his family as a wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of girls , three thousand horses , and a vast quantity of precious articles . " Then Genghis retired once more to Karakoram , but on his march he stained his reputation by massacring all his prisoners  --  the first gross act of inhumanity he committed during his Chinese wars. @# When Utubu saw the Mongols retreating , he thought to provide against the most serious consequences of their return by removing his capital to a greater distance from the frontier , and with this object he transferred his residence to Kaifong . The majority of his advisers were against this change , as a retirement could not but shake public confidence . It had another consequence , which they may not have contemplated , and that was its providing Genghis with an excuse for renewing his attack on China . The Mongol at once complained that the action of the Kin emperor implied an unwarrantable suspicion of his intentions , and he sent his army across the frontier to recommence his humiliation . On this occasion a Kin general deserted to them , and thenceforward large bodies of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who were steadily acquiring a unique reputation for power as well as military prowess . The great event of this war was the siege of Yenking  --  on the site of which now stands the capital Pekin  --  the defense of which had been intrusted to the Prince Imperial ; but Utubu , more anxious for his son ' s safety than the interests of the state , ordered him to return to Kaifong . The governor of Yenking offered a stout resistance to the Mongols , and when he found that he could not hold out , he retired to the temple of the city and poisoned himself . His last act was to write a letter to Utubu begging him to listen no more to the pernicious advice of the man who had induced him to murder Hushahu. @# The capture of Yenking , where Genghis obtained a large supply of war materials , as well as vast booty , opened the road to Central China . The Mongols advanced as far as the celebrated Tunkwan Pass , which connects Shensi and Honan , but when their general , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong were the Kin defenses and garrison , he declined to attack it , and , making a detour through very difficult country , he marched on Kaifong , where Utubu little expected him . The Mongols had to make their own road , and they crossed several ravines by improvised " bridges made of spears and the branches of trees bound together by strong chains . " But the Mongol force was too small to accomplish any great result , and the impetuosity of Samuka nearly led to his destruction . A prompt retreat , and the fact that the Hoangho was frozen over , enabled him to extricate his army , after much fatigue and reduced in numbers , from its awkward position . The retreat of the Mongols inspired Utubu with sufficient confidence to induce him to attack Yeliu Liuko in Leaoutung , and the success of this enterprise imparted a gleam of sunshine and credit to the expiring cause of the Kins . Yeliu Liuko was driven from his newly-created kingdom , but Genghis hastened to the assistance of his ally by sending Muhula , the greatest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large army to recover Leaoutung . His success was rapid and remarkable . The Kins were speedily overthrown , Yeliu Liuko was restored to his authority , and the neighboring King of Corea , impressed by the magnitude of the Mongol success , hastened to acknowledge himself the vassal of Genghis . The most important result of this campaign was that Genghis intrusted to Muhula the control of all military arrangements for the conquest of China . He is reported to have said to his lieutenant : " North of the Taihing Mountains I am supreme , but all the regions to the south I commend to the care of Muhula , " and he " also presented him with a chariot and a banner with nine scalops . As he handed him this last emblem of authority , he spoke to his generals , saying , ' Let this banner be an emblem of sovereignty , and let the orders issued from under it be obeyed as my own . ' " The principal reason for intrusting the conquest of China to a special force and commander was that Genghis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prosecution of his new war with the King of Khwaresm and the other great rulers of Western Asia. @# Muhula more than justified the selection and confidence of his sovereign . In the year 1218-19 he invaded Honan , defeated the best of the Kin commanders , and not merely overran , but retained possession of the places he occupied in the Kin dominions . The difficulties of Utubu were aggravated by an attack from Ningtsong , the Sung emperor , who refused any longer to pay tribute to the Kins , as they were evidently unable to enforce the claim , and the Kin armies were as equally unfortunate against their southern opponents as their northern . Then Utubu endeavored to negotiate terms with Muhula for the retreat of his army , but the only conditions the Mongol general would accept were the surrender of the Kin ruler and his resignation of the imperial title in exchange for the principality of Honan . Utubu , low as he had sunk , declined to abase himself further and to purchase life at the loss of his dignity . The sudden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chinese potentate , but the advantage was not of any permanent significance ; first of all because the Kins were too exhausted by their long struggle , and , secondly , because Genghis hastened to place himself at the head of his army . The news of the death of Muhula reached him when he was encamped on the frontier of India and preparing to add the conquest of that country to his many other triumphs in Central and Western Asia . He at once came to the conclusion that he must return to set his house in order at home , and to prevent all the results of Muhula ' s remarkable triumphs being lost . What was a disadvantage for China proved a benefit for India , and possibly for Europe , as there is no saying how much further the Mongol encroachment might have extended westward , if the direction of Genghis had not been withdrawn . While Genghis was hastening from the Cabul River to the Kerulon , across the Hindoo Koosh and Tian Shan ranges , Utubu died and Ninkiassu reigned in his stead. @# One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the young king of Hia , believing that the fortunes of the Mongols would then wane , and that he might obtain a position of greater power and independence , threw off his allegiance , and adopted hostile measures against them . The prompt return of Genghis nipped this plan in the bud , but it was made quite evident that the conquest of Hia was essential to the success of any permanent annexation of Chinese territory , and as its prince could dispose of an army which he boasted numbered half a million of men , it is not surprising to find that he took a whole year in perfecting his arrangements for so grave a contest . The war began in 1225 and continued for two years . The success of the Mongol army was decisive and unqualified . The Hias were defeated in several battles , and in one of them fought upon the frozen waters of the Hoangho . Genghis broke the ice by means of his engines , and the Hia army was almost annihilated . The king Leseen was deposed , and Hia became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was immediately after this successful war that Genghis was seized with his fatal illness . Signs had been seen in the heavens which the Mongol astrologers said indicated the near approach of his death . The five planets had appeared together in the southwest , and so much impressed was Genghis by this phenomenon that on his death-bed he expressed " the earnest desire that henceforth the lives of our enemies shall not be unnecessarily sacrificed . " The expression of this wish undoubtedly tended to mitigate the terrors of war as carried on by the Mongols . The immediate successors of Genghis conducted their campaigns after a more humane fashion , and it was not until Timour revived the early Mongol massacres that their opponents felt there was no chance in appealing to the humanity of the Mongols . Various accounts have been published of the cause of his death ; some authorities ascribing it to violence , either by an arrow , lightning , or drowning , and others to natural causes . The event seems to have unquestionably happened in his camp on the borders of Shansi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sixty-five years of age , during more than fifty of which he had enjoyed supreme command of his own tribe. @# The area of the undertakings conducted under his eye was more vast and included a greater number of countries than was the case with any other conqueror . Not a country from the Euxine to the China Sea escaped the tramp of the Mongol horsemen , and if we include the achievements of his immediate successors , the conquest of Russia , Poland , and Hungary , the plundering of Bulgaria , Roumania , and Bosnia , the final subjection of China and its southern tributaries must be added to complete the tale of Mongol triumph . The sphere of Mongol influence extended beyond this large portion of the earth ' s surface , just as the consequence of an explosion can not be restricted to the immediate scene of the disaster . If we may include the remarkable achievements of his descendant Baber , and of that prince ' s grandson Akbar , in India three centuries later , not a country in Asia enjoyed immunity from the effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their great outpouring into Western Asia  --  which certainly was the arrest of the Mohammedan career in Central Asia , and the diversion of the current of the fanatical propagators of the Prophet ' s creed against Europe  --  is not yet as fully recognized as it should be . The doubt has been already expressed whether the Mongols would ever have risen to higher rank than that of a nomad tribe but for the appearance of Genghis . Leaving that supposition in the category of other interesting but problematical conjectures , it may be asserted that Genghis represented in their highest forms all the qualities which entitled his race to exercise governing authority . He was , moreover , a military genius of the very first order , and it may be questioned whether either Caesar or Napoleon can as commanders be placed on a par with him . Even the Chinese said that he led his armies like a god . The manner in which he moved large bodies of men over vast distances without an apparent effort , the judgment he showed in the conduct of several wars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in unknown regions , always on the alert , yet never allowing hesitation or overcaution to interfere with his enterprise , the sieges which he brought to a successful termination , his brilliant victories , a succession of " suns of Austerlitz , " all combined make up the picture of a career to which Europe can offer nothing that will surpass , if indeed she has anything to bear comparison with it . After the lapse of centuries , and in spite of the indifference with which the great figures of Asiatic history have been treated , the name of Genghis preserves its magic spell . It is still a name to conjure with when recording the great revolutions of a period which beheld the death of the old system in China , and the advent in that country of a newer and more vigorous government which , slowly acquiring shape in the hands of Kublai and a more national form under the Mings , has attained the pinnacle of its utility and strength under the influence of the great emperors of the Manchu dynasty . But great as is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his merits . He is remembered as a relentless and irresistible conqueror , a human scourge ; but he was much more . He was one of the greatest instruments of destiny , one of the most remarkable molders of the fate of nations to be met with in the history of the world . His name still overshadows Asia with its fame , and the tribute of our admiration can not be denied. @# The death of Genghis did not seriously retard the progress of the war against the Kins . He expressed the wish that war should be carried on in a more humane and less vindictive manner , but he did not advocate there being no war or the abandonment of any of his enterprises . His son and successor Ogotai was indeed specially charged to bring the conquest of China to a speedy and victorious conclusion . The weakness of the Mongol confederacy was the delay connected with the proclamation of a new Khan and the necessity of summoning to a Grand Council all the princes and generals of the race , although it entailed the suspension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Genghis saved India but not China . Almost his last instructions were to draw up the plan for attacking and turning the great fortress of Tunkwan , which had provided such an efficient defense for Honan on the north , and in 1230 , Ogotai , who had already partitioned the territory taken from the Kins into ten departments , took the field in person , giving a joint command to his brother Tuli , under whom served the experienced generals Yeliu Chutsia , Antchar , and Subutai . At first the Mongols met with no great success , and the Kins , encouraged by a momentary gleam of victory , ventured to reject the terms offered by Ogotai and to insult his envoy . The only important fighting during the years 1230-31 occurred round Fongsian , which after a long siege surrendered to Antchar , and when the campaign closed the Kins presented a bold front to the Mongols and still hoped to retain their power and dominions. @# In 1232 the Mongols increased their armies in the field , and attacked the Kins from two sides . Ogotai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marching through Shensi into Szchuen , assailed them on their western flank . The difficulties encountered by Tuli on this march , when he had to make his own roads , were such that he entered the Kin territories with a much reduced and exhausted army . The Kin forces gained some advantage over it , but by either a feigned or a forced retreat , Tuli succeeded in baffling their pursuit , and in effecting a junction with his brother Ogotai , who had met with better fortune . Tuli destroyed everything along his line of march , and his massacres and sacks revived the worst traditions of Mongol ferocity . In these straits the Kins endeavored to flood the country round their capital , to which the Mongols had now advanced , but the Mongols fell upon the workmen while engaged in the task , and slew ten thousand of them . When the main Kin army accepted battle before the town of Yuchow , it was signally defeated , with the loss of three of its principal generals , and Ninkiassu fled from Kaifong to a place more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ townspeople of Kaifong  --  an immense city with walls thirty-six miles in circumference , and a population during the siege , it is said , of one million four hundred thousand families , or nearly seven million people  --  offered a stubborn resistance to the Mongols , who intrusted the conduct of the attack to Subutai , the most daring of all their commanders . The Mongols employed their most formidable engines , catapults hurling immense stones , and mortars ejecting explosives and combustibles , but twelve months elapsed before the walls were shattered and the courage and provisions of the defenders exhausted . Then Kaifong surrendered at discretion , and Subutai wished to massacre the whole of the population . But fortunately for the Chinese , Yeliu Chutsai was a more humane and a more influential general , and under his advice Ogotai rejected the cruel proposal. @# At this moment , when it seemed impossible for fate to have any worse experience in store for the unfortunate Kins , their old enemies , the Sungs , wishing to give them the coup de grace , declared war upon them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their best general , Mongkong , of whom more will be heard . The relics of the Kin army , under their sovereign Ninkiassu , took shelter in Tsaichau , where they were closely besieged by the Mongols on one side and the Sungs on the other . Driven thus into a corner , the Kins fought with the courage of despair and long held out against the combined efforts of their enemies . At last Ninkiassu saw that the struggle could not be prolonged , and he prepared himself to end his life and career in a manner worthy of the race from which he sprang . When the enemy broke into the city , and he heard the stormers at the gate of his palace , he retired to an upper chamber and set fire to the building . Many of his generals , and even of his soldiers , followed his example , preferring to end their existence rather than to add to the triumph of their Mongol and Sung opponents . Thus came to an end in 1234 the famous dynasty of the Kins , who under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eighteen years , and whose power and military capacity may best be gauged by the fact that without a single ally they held out against the all-powerful Mongols for more than a quarter of a century . Ninkiassu , the last of their rulers , was not able to sustain the burden of their authority , but he at least showed himself equal to ending it in a worthy and appropriately dramatic manner. @# The folly of the Sungs had completed the discomfiture of the Kins , and had brought to their own borders the terrible peril which had beset every other state in Asia , and which had in almost every case entailed destruction . How could the Sungs expect to avoid the same fate , or to propitiate the most implacable and insatiable of conquering races ? They had done this to a large extent with their eyes open . More than once in the early stages of the struggle the Kin rulers had sent envoys to beg their alliance , and to warn them that if they did not help in keeping out the Mongols , their time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common ruin . But Ningtsong did not pay heed to the warning , and scarcely concealed his gratification at the misfortunes of his old opponents . The nearer the Mongols came , and the worse the plight to which the Kins were reduced , the more did he rejoice . He forgave Tuli the violation of Sung territory , necessary for his flank attack on Honan , and when the knell of the Kins sounded at the fall of Kaifong , he hastened to help in striking the final blow at them , and to participate , as he hoped , in the distribution of the plunder . By this time Litsong had succeeded his cousin Ningtsong as ruler of the Sungs , and it is said that he received from Tsaichau the armor and personal spoils of Ninkiassu , which he had the satisfaction of offering up in the temple of his ancestors . But when he requested the Mongols to comply with the more important part of the convention , by which the Sung forces had joined the Mongols before Tsaichau , and to evacuate the province of Honan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the overthrow of the Kins would redound to his advantage , and he soon realized what value the Mongols attached to his alliance . The military capacity of Mongkong inspired the Sung ruler with confidence , and he called upon the Mongols to execute their promises , or to prepare for war . The Mongol garrisons made no movement of retreat , and the utmost that Litsong was offered was a portion of Honan , if it could be practically divided . The proposition was probably meant ironically , but at all events Litsong rejected it , and sent Mongkong to take by force possession of the disputed province . The Mongol forces on the spot were fewer than the Chinese , and they met with some reverses . But the hope of the Sungs that the fortune of war would declare in their favor was soon destroyed by the vast preparations of the Mongols , who , at a special kuriltai , held at Karakoram , declared that the conquest of China was to be completed . Then Litsong ' s confidence left him , and he sent an appeal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Honan , and only asking to be left in undisturbed possession of his original dominions . It was too late . The Mongols had passed their decree that the Sungs were to be treated like the Kins , and that the last Chinese government was to be destroyed. @# In 1235 , the year following the immolation of Ninkiassu , the Mongols placed half a million men in the field for the purpose of destroying the Sung power , and Ogotai divided them into three armies , which were to attack Litsong ' s kingdom from as many sides . The Mongol ruler intrusted the most difficult task to his son Kutan , who invaded the inaccessible and vast province of Szchuen , at the head of one of these armies . Notwithstanding its natural capacity for offering an advantageous defense , the Chinese turned their opportunities to poor account , and the Mongols succeeded in capturing all its frontier fortresses , with little or no resistance . The shortcomings of the defense can be inferred from the circumstances of the Chinese annalists making special mention of one governor having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some reason not clearly stated the Mongols did not attempt to retain possession of Szchuen on this occasion . They withdrew when they were in successful occupation of the northern half of the province , and when it seemed as if the other lay at their mercy . In the two dual provinces of Kiangnan and Houkwang , the other Mongol armies met with considerable success , which was dimmed , however , by the death of Kuchu , the son and proclaimed heir of Ogotai . This event , entailing no inconsiderable doubt and long-continued disputes as to the succession , was followed by the withdrawal of the Mongol forces from Sung territory , and during the last six years of his life Ogotai abstained from war , and gave himself up to the indulgence of his gluttony . He built a great palace at Karakoram , where his ancestors had been content to live in a tent , and he intrusted the government of the old Kin dominions to Yeliu Chutsai , who acquired great popularity among the Chinese for his clemency and regard for their customs . Yeliu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ogotai ' s widow , Turakina , who acted as regent after her husband ' s death , ordered him to alter his system and to farm out the revenues , he sent in his resignation , and , it is said , died of grief shortly afterward . Ogotai was one of the most humane and amiable of all the Mongol rulers , and Yeliu Chutsai imitated his master . Of the latter the Chinese contemporary writers said " he was distinguished by a rare disinterestedness . Of a very broad intellect , he was able , without injustice and without wronging a single person , to amass vast treasures ( D ' Ohsson says only of books , maps , and pictures ) , and to enrich his family , but all his care and labors had for their sole object the advantage and glory of his masters . Wise and calculating in his plans , he did little of which he had any reason to repent. " @# During the five years following the death of Ogotai , the Mongols were absorbed in the question who should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a warm and protracted discussion , which threatened to entail the disruption of Mongol power , and the revelation of many rivalries among the descendants of Genghis , that Kuyuk , the eldest son of Ogotai , was proclaimed emperor . At the kuriltai held for this purpose , all the great Mongol leaders were present , including Batu , the conqueror of Hungary , and after the Mongol chiefs had agreed as to their chief , the captive kings , Yaroslaf of Russia and David of Georgia , paid homage to their conqueror . We owe to the monk Carpino , who was sent by the Pope to convert the Mongol , a graphic account of one of the most brilliant ceremonies to be met with in the whole course of Mongol history . The delay in selecting Kuyuk , whose principal act of sovereignty was to issue a seal having this inscription : " God in Heaven and Kuyuk on earth ; by the power of God the ruler of all men , " had given the Sungs one respite , and his early death procured them another . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the son of Tuli , was appointed his successor . By this time the Mongol chiefs of the family of Genghis in Western Asia were practically independent of the nominal Great Khan , and governed their states in complete sovereignty , and waged war without reference to Karakoram . This change left the Mongols in their original home of the Amour absolutely free to devote all their attention to the final overthrow of the Sungs , and Mangu declared that he would know no rest until he had finally subjected the last of the Chinese ruling families . In this resolution Mangu received the hearty support of his younger but more able brother , Kublai , to whom was intrusted the direction in the field of the armies sent to complete the conquest of China. @# Kublai received this charge in 1251 , so that the Sungs had enjoyed , first through the pacific disposition of Ogotai , and , secondly , from the family disputes following his death , peace for more than fifteen years . The advantage of this tranquillity was almost nullified by the death of Mongkong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but who certainly enjoyed the confidence of his soldiers , and who was thought by his countrymen to be the best commander of his day . When the Chinese emperor , Litsong , saw the storm again approaching his northern frontier , he found that he had lost the main support of his power , and that his military resources were inferior to those of his enemy . He had allowed himself to be lulled into a false sense of security by the long inaction of the Mongols , and although he seems to have been an amiable prince , and a typical Chinese ruler , honoring the descendants of Confucius with the hereditary title of duke , which still remains in that family , and is the only title of its kind in China , and encouraging the literary classes of his country , he was a bad sovereign to be intrusted with the task of defending his realm and people against a bold and determined enemy. @# Kublai prepared the way for his campaigns in Southern China by following a very wise and moderate policy in Northern China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with greater effect by Yeliu Chutsai . He had enjoyed the advantage of a Chinese education , imparted by an able tutor named Yaochu , who became the prince ' s private secretary and mentor in all Chinese matters . At his instigation , or , at least , with his co-operation , Kublai took in hand the restoration of the southern portion of Honan , which had been devastated during the wars , and he succeeded in bringing back its population and prosperity to that great province of Central China . He thus secured a base for his operations close to the Sung frontier , while he attached to his person a large section of the Chinese nation . There never was any concealment that this patronage of Chinese officials , and these measures for the amelioration of many millions of Chinese subjects , were the well calculated preliminaries to the invasion of Southern China and the extinction of the Sung dynasty. @# If Kublai had succeeded in obtaining a wise adviser in Yaochu , he was not less fortunate in procuring a great general in the person of Uriangkadai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unvarying successes were largely due to the efforts of those two men in the cabinet and the field . The plan of campaign , drawn up with great care and forethought by the prince and his lieutenant , had the double merit of being both bold and original . Its main purpose was not one that the Sung generals would be likely to divine . It was determined to make a flank march round the Sung dominions , and to occupy what is now the province of Yunnan ; and , by placing an army in the rear of their kingdom , to attack them eventually from two sides . At this time Yunnan formed an independent state , and its ruler , from his position behind the Sung territory , must have fancied himself secure against any attack by the Mongols . He was destined to a rude awakening . Kublai and Uriangkadai , marching across Szchuen and crossing the Kinchakiang , or " river of golden sand , " which forms the upper course of the Great River , on rafts , burst into Yunnan , speedily vanquished the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Talifoo . That town did not hold out long , and soon Kublai was in a position to return to his own state , leaving Uriangkadai with a considerable garrison in charge of Yunnan . That general , believing that his position would be improved by his resorting to an active offensive , carried the standard of his race against the many turbulent tribes in his neighborhood , and invaded Burma whose king , after one campaign , was glad to recognize the supremacy of the Mongols . The success and the boldness , which may have been considered temerity , of this campaign , raised up enemies to Kublai at the court of Karakoram , and the mind of his brother Mangu was poisoned against him by many who declared that Kublai aspired to complete independence . These designs so far succeeded , that in 1257 Mangu finally deprived Kublai of all his commands , and ordered him to proceed to Karakoram . At this harsh and unmerited treatment Kublai showed himself inclined to rebel and dispute his brother ' s authority . If he had done this , although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charges of his accusers , and a war would have broken out among the Mongols which would probably have rent their power in twain in Eastern Asia . But fortunately Yaochu was at hand to give prudent advice , and after much hesitation Kublai yielded to the impressive exhortations of his experienced and sagacious minister . He is reported to have addressed Kublai in the following terms : " Prince ! You are the brother of the emperor , but you are not the less his subject . You can not , without committing a crime , question his decisions , and , moreover , if you were to do so , it would only result in placing you in a more dangerous predicament , out of which you could hardly succeed in extricating yourself , as you are so far distant from the capital where your enemies seek to injure you . My advice is that you should send your family to Mangu , and by this step you will justify yourself and remove any suspicions there may be. " @# Kublai adopted this wise course , and proceeded in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innocence and in discomfiting his enemies . It is said that Mangu was so affected at the mere sight of his brother that he at once forgave him without waiting for an explanation and reinstated him in all his offices . To ratify this reconciliation Mangu proclaimed that he would take the field in person , and that Kublai should hold joint command with himself . When he formed this resolution to proceed to China in person , he appointed his next brother , Arikbuka , to act as his lieutenant in Mongolia . It is necessary to recollect this arrangement , as Mangu died during the campaign , and it led to the separation of the Chinese empire and the Mongolian , which were divided after that event between Kublai and Arikbuka. @# Mangu did not come to his resolution to prosecute the war with the Sungs any too soon , for Uriangkadai was beginning to find his isolated position not free from danger . Large as the army of that general was , and skillfully as he had endeavored to improve his position by strengthening the fortresses and recruiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threatened by the collected armies of the Sungs , who occupied Szchuen with a large garrison and menaced the daring Mongol general with the whole of their power . There seems every reason to believe that if the Sungs had acted with only ordinary promptitude they might have destroyed this Mongol army long before any aid could have reached it from the north . Once Mangu had formed his resolution the rapidity of his movements left the Sungs little or no chance of attacking Uriangkadai . This campaign began in the winter of 1257 , when the troops were able to cross the frozen waters of the Hoangho , and the immense Mongol army was divided into three bodies , while Uriangkadai was ordered to march north and effect a junction with his old chief Kublai in Szchuen . The principal fighting of the first year occurred in this part of China , and Mangu hastened there with another of his armies . The Sung garrison was large , and showed great courage and fortitude . The difficulty of the country and the strength of several of their fortresses seconded their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt so doubtful of success that they held a council of war to decide whether they should retreat or continue to prosecute the struggle . It has been said that councils of war do not come to bold resolutions , but this must have been an exception , as it decided not to retreat , and to make one more determined effort to overcome the Chinese . The campaign of 1259 began with the siege of Hochau , a strong fortress , held by a valiant garrison and commander , and to whose aid a Chinese army under Luwenti was hastening . The governor , Wangkien , offered a stout resistance , and Luwenti succeeded in harassing the besiegers ; but the fall of the fortress appeared assured , when a new and more formidable defender arrived in the form of dysentery . The Mongol camp was ravaged by this foe , Mangu himself died of the disease , and those of the Mongols who escaped beat a hasty and disorderly retreat back to the north . Once more the Sungs obtained a brief respite. @# The death of Mangu threatened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kublai was his brother ' s lawful heir , but Arikbuka , the youngest of the brothers was in possession of Karakoram , and supreme throughout Mongolia . He was hostile to Kublai , and disposed to assert all his rights and to make the most of his opportunities . No Great Khan could be proclaimed anywhere save at Karakoram , and Arikbuka would not allow his brother to gain that place , the cradle of their race and dynasty , unless he could do so by force of arms . Kublai attempted to solve the difficulty by holding a grand council near his favorite city of Cambaluc , the modern Pekin , and he sent forth his proclamation to the Mongols as their Khan . But they refused to recognize one who was not elected in the orthodox fashion at Karakoram ; and Arikbuka not merely defied Kublai , but summoned his own kuriltai at Karakoram , where he was proclaimed Khakhan in the most formal manner and with all the accustomed ceremonies . Arikbuka was undoubtedly popular among the Mongols , while Kublai , who was regarded as half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far greater reputation south of the wall than north of it . Kublai could not tolerate the open defiance of his authority , and the contempt shown for what was his birthright , by Arikbuka ; and in 1261 he advanced upon Karakoram at the head of a large army . A single battle sufficed to dispose of Arikbuka ' s pretensions , and that prince was glad to find a place of refuge among the Kirghiz . Kublai proved himself a generous enemy . He sent Arikbuka his full pardon , he reinstated him in his rank of prince , and he left him virtually supreme among the Mongol tribes . He retraced his steps to Pekin , fully resolved to become Chinese emperor in reality , but prepared to waive his rights as Mongol Khan . Mangu Khan was the last of the Mongol rulers whose authority was recognized in both the east and the west , and his successor , Kublai , seeing that its old significance had departed , was fain to establish his on a new basis in the fertile , ancient and wide-stretching dominions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had resumed his operations against the Sungs , and even before Mangu ' s death he had succeeded in establishing some posts south of the Yangtsekiang , in the impassability of which the Chinese fondly believed . During the year 1260 he laid siege to Wochow , the modern Wouchang , but he failed to make any impression on the fortress on this occasion , and he agreed to the truce which Litsong proposed . By the terms of this agreement Litsong acknowledged himself a Mongol vassal , just as his ancestors had subjected themselves to the Kins , paid a large tribute , and forbade his generals anywhere to attack the Mongols . The last stipulation was partly broken by an attack on the rear of Uriangkadai ' s corps , but no serious results followed , for Kublai was well satisfied with the manner in which the campaign terminated , as there is no doubt that his advance across the Yangtsekiang had been precipitate , and he may have thought himself lucky to escape with the appearance of success and the conclusion of a gratifying treaty . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by having made the Sungs his tributaries , that Kublai hastened northward to settle his rivalry with Arikbuka . Having accomplished that object with complete success , he decided to put an end to the Sung dynasty . The Chinese emperor , acting with strange fatuity , had given fresh cause of umbrage , and had provoked a war by many petty acts of discourtesy , culminating in the murder of the envoys of Kublai , sent to notify him of his proclamation as Great Khan of the Mongols . Probably the Sung ruler could not have averted war if he had shown the greatest forbearance and humility , but this cruel and inexcusable act precipitated the crisis and the extinction of his attenuated authority . If there was any delay in the movements of Kublai for the purpose of exacting reparation for this outrage , it was due to his first having to arrange a difficulty that had arisen in his relations with the King of Corea . That potentate had long preserved the peace with his Mongol neighbors , and perhaps he would have remained a friend without any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ construed as an infraction of Corean liberty . The Corean love of independence took fire at the threatened diminution of their rights , they rose en masse in defense of their country , and even the king , Wangtien , who had been , well disposed to the Mongol rulers , declared that he could not continue the alliance , and placed himself at the head of his people . Seeing himself thus menaced with a costly war in a difficult country on the eve of a more necessary and hopeful contest , Kublai resorted to diplomacy . He addressed Wangtien in complimentary terms and disclaimed all intention of injuring the Coreans , with whom he wished to maintain friendly relations , but at the same time he pointed out the magnitude of his power and dilated on the extent of the Mongol conquests . Half by flattery and half by menace Kublai brought the Corean court to reason , and Wangtien again entered into bonds of alliance with Cambaluc and renewed his old oaths of friendship. @# At this point of the long struggle with the Sungs it will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with regard to his own Chinese subjects , who now formed the backbone of his power . By this time Kublai had become to all practical intents and purposes a Chinese emperor . He had accepted all the traditional functions of the typical Hwangti , and the etiquette and splendor of his court rivaled that of the Sungs . He had not merely adopted the Chinese system of taxation and the form of administration to which the larger portion of his officials , being of Chinese race , had been accustomed , but he declared himself the patron of learning and of Buddhism , which had gained a hold on the minds of the Mongols that it has not lost to the present day . One of the most popular of his early measures had been the order to liberate all the literate class among his Chinese prisoners , and they had formed the nucleus of the civil service Kublai attached to his interests and utilized as his empire expanded . In his relations with Buddhism Kublai showed not less astuteness , and in realizing that to attain durable success he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he showed that he had the true instincts of a statesman. @# At this time two facts were clearly apparent . The Chinese were sunk in a low state of religious disbelief , and the Sung rulers were not disposed to play the part of regenerators of their country . The second fact was that the only vigorous religion in China , or , indeed , in Eastern Asia , was Buddhism , which , since the establishment of Brahmanism in India , had taken up its headquarters in Tibet , where , however , the supreme authority was still secular  --  that is to say , it was invested in the hands of a prince or king , and not in those of a priest or Grand Lama . It so happened that there was resident at Kublai ' s court a Tibetan priest , of the family which had always supplied the Sanpou with his minister , who gained the ear of Kublai , and convinced him how politic and advantageous to him personally it would be if he were to secure the co-operation and sympathy of his priestly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proclaimed his friend Pakba Lama , and sent him back to Tibet , there to establish the ecclesiastical authority , which still exists in that country , in intimate alliance and sympathy with the Chinese rulers . By this and other similar proceedings Kublai gained over to his side several influential classes among the Chinese people , and many reflecting persons thought they saw in him a true regenerator of the empire , and a worthy successor of their greatest rulers . It was , therefore , with a thoroughly pacified country , and to a great extent a contented people , that Kublai began his last war with the rulers of Southern China. @# In 1263 Kublai issued his proclamation of war , calling on his generals " to assemble their troops , to sharpen their swords and their pikes , and to prepare their bows and arrows , " for he intended to attack the Sungs by land and sea . The treason of a Chinese general in his service named Litan served to delay the opening of the campaign for a few weeks , but this incident was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ executed . Brief as was the interval , it was marked by one striking and important event  --  the death of Litsong , who was succeeded by his nephew , Chowki , called the Emperor Toutsong . Litsong was not a wise ruler , but , compared with many of his successors , he might be more accurately styled unfortunate than incompetent . Toutsong , and his weak and arrogant minister , Kiassetao , hastened to show that there were greater heights of folly than any to which he had attained . Acting on the advice of a renegade Sung general , well acquainted with the defenses of Southern China , Kublai altered his proposed attack , and prepared for crossing the Yangtsekiang by first making himself supreme on its tributary , the Han River . His earlier attack on Wouchang has been described , and his compulsory retirement from that place had taught him the evil of making a premature attack . His object remained the same , but instead of marching direct to it across the Yangtsekiang he took the advice of the Sung general , arid attacked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ object of making himself supreme on that stream , and wresting from the Sungs the last first-class fortress they possessed in the northwest . By the time all these preliminaries were completed and the Mongol army had fairly taken the field it was 1268 , and Kublai sent sixty thousand of his best troops , with a large number of auxiliaries , to lay siege to Sianyang , which was held by a large garrison and a resolute governor . The Mongol lines were drawn up round the town , and also its neighbor of Fanching , situated on the opposite bank of the river , with which communication was maintained by several bridges , and the Mongols built a large fleet of fifty war junks , with which they closed the Han River and effectually prevented any aid being sent up it from Hankow or Wouchang . Liuwen Hoan , the commandant of Sianyang , was a brave man , and he commanded a numerous garrison and possessed supplies , as he said , to stand a ten years ' siege . He repulsed all the assaults of the enemy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the threats of the Mongols , to give him no quarter if he persisted in holding out , by boasting that he would hang their traitor general in chains before his sovereign . The threats and vaunts of the combatants did not bring the siege any nearer to an end . The utmost that the Mongols could achieve was to prevent any provisions or re- enforcements being thrown into the town . But on the fortress itself they made no impression . Things had gone on like this for three years , and the interest in the siege had begun to languish , when Kublai determined to make a supreme effort to carry the place , and at the same moment the Sung minister came to the conclusion to relieve it at all hazards. @# The campaign of 1270 began with a heroic episode  --  the successful dispatch of provisions into the besieged town , under the direction of two Chinese officers named Changkoua and Changchun , whose names deserve to be long remembered for their heroism . The flotilla was divided into two bodies , one composed of the fighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made every preparation to blockade the river , but the suddenness and vigor of the Chinese attack surprised them , and , at first , the Chinese had the best of the day . But soon the Mongols recovered , and from their superior position threatened to overwhelm the assailing Chinese squadron . In this perilous moment Changchun , devoting himself to death in the interest of his country collected all his war-junks , and making a desperate attack on the Mongols , succeeded in obtaining sufficient time to enable the storeships under Changkoua to pass safely up to Sianyang . The life of so great a hero as Changchun was , however , a heavy price to pay for the temporary relief of Sianyang , which was more closely besieged than ever after the arrival of Kublai in person. @# After this affair the Mongols pushed the siege with greater vigor , and instead of concentrating their efforts on Sianyang they attacked both that fortress and Fanching from all sides . The Mongol commander , Alihaya , sent to Persia , where the Mongols were also supreme , for engineers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capable of throwing stones of 160-pounds ' weight with precision for a considerable distance . By their aid the bridges across the river were first destroyed , and then the walls of Sianyang were so severely damaged that an assault appeared to be feasible . But Fanching had suffered still more from the Mongol bombardment , and Alihaya therefore attacked it first . The garrison offered a determined resistance , and the fighting was continued in the streets . Not a man of the garrison escaped , and when the slaughter was over the Mongols found that they had only acquired possession of a mass of ruins . But they had obtained the key to Sianyang , the weakest flank of which had been protected by Fanching , and the Chinese garrison was so discouraged that Liuwen Hoan , despairing of relief , agreed to accept the terms offered by Kublai . Those terms were expressed in the following noble letter from the Mongol emperor : " The generous defense you have made during five years covers you with glory . It is the duty of every faithful subject to serve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the straits to which you are reduced , your strength exhausted , deprived of succor and without hope of receiving any , would it be reasonable to sacrifice the lives of so many brave men out of sheer obstinacy ?

" @# It will not excite surprise that Liuwen Hoan , who had been , practically speaking , deserted by his own sovereign , should have accepted the magnanimous terms of his conqueror , and become as loyal a lieutenant of Kublai as he had shown himself to be of the Sung Toutsong . The death of that ruler followed soon afterward , but as the real power had been in the hands of the Minister Kiassetao , no change took place in the policy or fortunes of the Sung kingdom . At this moment Kublai succeeded in obtaining the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquired a great reputation under Khulagu in Persia . Bayan , whose name signifies the noble or the brave , and who was popularly known as Bayan of the Hundred Eyes , because he was supposed to see everything , was one of the greatest military leaders of his age and race . He was intrusted with the command of the main army , and under him served , it is interesting to state , Liuwen Hoan . Several towns were captured after more or less resistance , and Bayan bore down with all his force on the triple cities of Hankow , Wouchang , and Hanyang . Bayan concentrated all his efforts on the capture of Hanyang , while the Mongol navy under Artchu compelled the Chinese fleet to take refuge under the walls of Wouchang . None of these towns offered a very stubborn resistance , and Bayan had the satisfaction of receiving their surrender one after another . Leaving Alihaya with 40 , 000 men to guard these places , Bayan marched with the rest of his forces on the Sung capital , Lingan or Hangchow , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ army of the Sungs carried with them fear of the Mongols , and the ever-increasing representation of their extraordinary power and irresistible arms . In this juncture public opinion compelled Kiassetao to take the lead , and he called upon all the subjects of the Sung to contribute arms and money for the purpose of national defense . But his own incompetence in directing this national movement deprived it of half its force and of its natural chances of success . Bayan ' s advance was rapid . Many towns opened their gates in terror or admiration of his name , and Liuwen Hoan was frequently present to assure them that Kublai was the most generous of masters , and that there was no wiser course than to surrender to his generals. @# The Mongol forces at last reached the neighborhood of the Sung capital , where Kiassetao had succeeded in collecting an army of 130 , 000 men ; but many of them were ill-trained , and the splendor of the camp provided a poor equivalent for the want of arms and discipline among the men . Kiassetao seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for he sent an arrogant summons to the Mongols to retire , stating also that he would grant a peace based on the Yangtsekiang as a boundary . Bayan ' s simple reply to this notice was , " If you had really aimed at peace you would have made this proposition before we crossed the Kiang . Now that we are the masters of it , it is a little too late . Still if you sincerely desire it , come and see me in person , and we will discuss the necessary conditions . " Very few of the Sung lieutenants offered a protracted resistance , and even the isolated cases of devotion were confined to the official class , who were more loyal than the mass of the people . Chao Maofa and his wife Yongchi put an end to their existence sooner than give up their charge at Chichow , but the garrison accepted the terms of the Mongols without compunction , and without thinking of their duty . Kiassetao attempted to resist the Mongol advance at Kien Kang , the modern Nankin , but after an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and their fleet only escaped destruction by retiring precipitately to the sea . After this success Nankin , surrendered without resistance , although its governor was a valiant and apparently a capable man . He committed suicide sooner than surrender , and among his papers was found a plan of campaign , after perusing which Bay an exclaimed , " Is it possible that the Sungs possessed a man capable of giving such prudent counsel ? If they had paid heed to it , should we ever have reached this spot ? " After this success Bayan pressed on with increased rather than diminished energy , and the Sung emperor and his court fled from the capital . Kublai showed an inclination to temporize and to negotiate , but Bayan would not brook any delay . " To relax your grip even for a moment on an enemy whom you have held by the throat for a hundred years would only be to give him time to recover his breath , to restore his forces , and in the end to cause us an infinity of trouble. " @# The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was disgraced , and a more competent general was found in the person of Chang Chikia . But the Mongols never abated the vigor of their attack or relaxed in their efforts to cut off all possibility of succor from the Sung capital . When Chang Chikia hoped to improve the position of his side by resuming the offensive he was destined to rude disappointment . Making an attack on the strong position of the Mongols at Nankin he was repulsed with heavy loss . The Sung fleet was almost annihilated and 700 war-junks were taken by the victors . After this the Chinese never dared to face the Mongols again on the water . This victory was due to the courage and capacity of Artchu . Bayan now returned from a campaign in Mongolia to resume the chief conduct of the war , and he signalized his return by the capture of Changchow . At this town he is said to have sanctioned a massacre of the Chinese troops , but the facts are enwrapped in uncertainty ; and Marco Polo declares that this was only done after the Chinese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fall of Changchow , the Sung ministers again sued for peace , sending an imploring letter to this effect : " Our ruler is young and can not be held responsible for the differences that have arisen between the peoples . Kiassetao the guilty one has been punished ; give us peace and we shall be better friends in the future . " Bayan ' s reply was severe and uncompromising . " The age of your prince has nothing to do with the question between us . The war must go on to its legitimate end . Further argument is useless . " The defenses of the Sung capital were by this time removed , and the unfortunate upholders of that dynasty had no option save to come to terms with the Mongols . Marco Polo describes Kincsay as the most opulent city of the world , but it was in no position to stand a siege . The empress-regent , acting for her son , sent in her submission to Bayan , and agreed to proceed to the court of the conqueror . She abdicated for herself and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accepted the favors of the Mongol with due humility , saying , " The Son of Heaven ( thus giving Kublai the correct imperial style ) grants you the favor of sparing your life ; it is just to thank him for it and to pay him homage . " Bayan made a triumphal entry into the city , while the Emperor Kongtsong was sent off to Pekin . The majority of the Sung courtiers and soldiers came to terms with Bayan , but a few of the more desperate or faithful endeavored to uphold the Sung cause in Southern China under the general , Chang Chikia . Two of the Sung princes were supported by this commander , and one was proclaimed by the empty title of emperor . Capricious fortune rallied to their side for a brief space , and some of the Mongol detachments which had advanced too far or with undue precipitancy were cut up and destroyed. @# The Mongols seem to have thought that the war was over , and the success of Chang Chikia ' s efforts may have been due to their negligence rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there remained a flickering flame of opposition among the supporters of the Sungs they sent two armies , one into Kwantung and the other into Fuhkien , and their fleet against Chang Chikia . Desperate as was his position , that officer still exclaimed , " If heaven has not resolved to overthrow the Sungs , do you think that even now it can not restore their ruined throne ? " but his hopes were dashed to the ground by the capture of Canton , and the expulsion of all his forces from the mainland . One puppet emperor died , and then Chang proclaimed another as Tiping . The last supporters of the cause took refuge on the island of Tai in the Canton estuary , where they hoped to maintain their position . The position was strong and the garrison was numerous ; but the Mongols were not to be frightened by appearances . Their fleet bore down on the last Sung stronghold with absolute confidence , and , although the Chinese resisted for three days and showed great gallantry , they were overwhelmed by the superior engines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chikia with a few ships succeeded in escaping from the fray , but the emperor ' s vessel was less fortunate , and finding that escape was impossible , Lousionfoo , one of the last Sung ministers , seized the emperor in his arms and jumped overboard with him . Thus died Tiping , the last Chinese emperor of the Sungs , and with him expired that ill-fated dynasty . Chang Chikia renewed the struggle with aid received from Tonquin , but when he was leading a forlorn hope against Canton he was caught in a typhoon and he and his ships were wrecked . His invocation to heaven , " I have done everything I could to sustain on the throne the Sung dynasty . When one prince died I caused another to be proclaimed emperor . He also has perished , and I still live ! Oh , heaven , shall I be acting against thy desires if I sought to place a new prince of this family on the throne ? " sounded the dirge of the race he had served so well. @# Thus was the conquest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century of warfare the kingdom of the Sungs shared the same fate as its old rival the Kin , and Kublai had the personal satisfaction of completing the work begun by his grandfather Genghis seventy years before . Of all the Mongol triumphs it was the longest in being attained . The Chinese of the north and of the south resisted with extraordinary powers of endurance the whole force of the greatest conquering race Asia had ever seen . They were not skilled in war and their generals were generally incompetent , but they held out with desperate courage and obstinacy long after other races would have given in . The student of history will not fail to see in these facts striking testimony of the extraordinary resources of China , and of the capacity of resistance to even a vigorous conqueror possessed by its inert masses . Even the Mongols did not conquer until they had obtained the aid of a large section of the Chinese nation , or before Kublai had shown that he intended to prove himself a worthy Emperor of China and not merely a great Khan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AND THE MONGOL DYNASTY @# While Bayan was winning victories for his master and driving the Chinese armies from the field , Kublai was engaged at Pekin in the difficult and necessary task of consolidating his authority . In 1271 he gave his dynasty the name of Yuen or Original , and he took for himself the Chinese title of Chitsou , although it will never supersede his Mongol name of Kublai . Summoning to his court the most experienced Chinese ministers , and aided by many foreigners , he succeeded in founding a government which was imposing by reason of its many-sidedness as well as its inherent strength . It satisfied the Chinese and it was gratifying to the Mongols , because they formed the buttress of one of the most imposing administrations in the world . All this was the distinct work of Kublai , who had enjoyed the special favor of Genghis , who had predicted of him that " one day he will sit in my seat and bring you good fortune such as you have had in my time . " He resolved to make his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cambaluc or Khanbalig  --  " the city of the Khan "  --  stood on or near the present site of Pekin , and was made for the first time capital of China by the Mongols . There were , according to Marco Polo , twelve gates , at each of which was stationed a guard of 1 , 000 men , and the streets were so straight and wide that you could see from one end to the other , or from gate to gate . The extent given of the walls varies : according to the highest estimate they were twenty-seven miles round , according to the lowest eighteen . The khan ' s palace at Chandu or Kaipingfoo , north of Pekin , where he built a magnificent summer palace , kept his stud of horses , and carried out his love of the chase in the immense park and preserves attached , may be considered the Windsor of this Chinese monarch . The position of Pekin had , and still has , much to recommend it as the site of a capital . The Mings , after proclaiming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Chuntche , the first of the Manchus , adopted it as his . It has since remained the sole metropolis of the empire. @# When Kublai permanently established himself at Pekin he drew up consistent lines of policy on all the great questions with which it was likely he would have to deal , and he always endeavored to act upon these set principles . In framing this system of government he was greatly assisted by his old friend and tutor Yaochu , as well as by other Chinese ministers . He was thus able to deal wisely and also vigorously with a society with which he was only imperfectly acquainted ; and the impartiality and insight into human character , which were his main characteristics , greatly simplified the difficult task before him . His impartiality was shown most clearly in his attitude on the question of religion ; but it partook very largely of a hard materialism which concealed itself under a nominal indifference . At first he treated with equal consideration Buddhism , Mohammedanism , Christianity , and even Judaism , and he said that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the greatest among them would help him in heaven . If some doubt may be felt as to the sincerity of this statement , there can be none as to Kublai ' s effort to turn all religions to a political use , and to make them serve his turn . Some persons have thought he showed a predilection for Christianity , but his measures in support of Buddhism , and of his friend the Pakba Lama , are a truer indication of his feelings . But none were admitted into his private confidence , and his acts evinced a politic tolerance toward all creeds . But his religious tolerance or indifference did not extend to personal matters . He insisted on the proper prayers being offered to himself and the extreme reverence of the kow-tow . Priests were appointed and specially enjoined to offer up prayers on his behalf before the people , who were required to attend these services and to join in the responses . Images of himself were also sent to all the provincial towns for reverence to be offered . He also followed the Chinese custom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coins that passed current bore his effigy . Thus did Kublai more and more identify himself with his Chinese subjects , and as he found his measures crowned with success he became himself more wedded to Chinese views , less tolerant of adverse opinions , and more disposed to assert his sovereign majesty. @# Having embellished his capital , it is not surprising to find that he drew up a strict court ceremonial , and that he proscribed gorgeous dresses for those who were to be allowed to approach him . His banquets were of the most sumptuous description . Strangers from foreign states were admitted to the presence , and dined at a table set apart for travelers , while the great king himself feasted in the full gaze of his people . His courtiers , guard , and ministers attended by a host of servitors , and protected from enemies by 20 , 000 guards , the flower of the Mongol army ; the countless wealth seized in the capitals of numerous kingdoms ; the brilliance of intellect among his chief adherents and supporters ; the martial character of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pageantry of a court as to the stern reality of battle ; and finally the majesty of the great king himself  --  all combined to make Kublai ' s court and capital the most splendid , at that time , in the world . Although Kublai ' s instincts were martial , he gave up all idea of accompanying his armies in the field after his war with Arikbuka . As he was only forty-four when he formed this decision , it must be assumed that he came to it mainly because he had so many other matters to attend to , and also , no doubt , because he felt that he possessed in Bayan a worthy substitute. @# The most fortunate and successful monarch rarely escapes without some misfortune , and Kublai was not destined to be an exception to the rule . The successes of the Mongol navy undoubtedly led Kublai to believe that his arms might be carried beyond the sea , and he formed the definite plan of subjecting Japan to his power . The ruling family in that kingdom was of Chinese descent , tracing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the twelfth century before our era . The Chinese in their usual way had asserted the superior position of a Suzerain , and the Japanese had as consistently refused to recognize the claim , and had maintained their independence . As a rule the Japanese abstained from all interference in the affairs of the continent , and the only occasion on which they departed from this rule was when they aided Corea against China . In 1266 Kublai sent two embassadors by way of Corea to Japan with a letter from himself complaining that the Japanese court had taken no notice of his accession to power , and treated him with indifference . The mission never had a chance of success , for the Coreans succeeded in frightening the Mongol envoys with the terrors of the sea , and by withholding their assistance prevented them reaching their destination . The envoys returned without having been able to deliver their letter . Kublai decided that the Japanese were hostile to him , and he resolved to humble them . He called upon the King of Corea to raise an auxiliary force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ships and 10 , 000 men . In 1274 he sent a small force of 300 ships and 15 , 000 men to begin operations in the direction of Japan ; but the Japanese navy came out to meet it , and attacking it off the island of Tsiusima , inflicted a crushing defeat . As this expedition was largely composed of the Corean contingent Kublai easily persuaded himself that this defeat did not indicate what would happen when he employed his own Mongol troops . He also succeeded in sending several envoys to Japan after his first abortive attempt , and they brought back consistent reports as to the hostility and defiance of the Japanese , who at last , to leave no further doubt on the subject , executed his envoy in 1280 . For this outrage the haughty monarch swore he would exact a terrible revenge , and in 1280-81 , when the last of his campaigns with the Sungs had been brought to a triumphant conclusion , he collected all his forces in the eastern part of the kingdom , and prepared to attack Japan with all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised an army of over 100 , 000 men , of whom about one-third were Mongols ; and a fleet large enough to carry this host and its supplies was gathered together with great difficulty in the harbors of Chekiang and Fuhkien . It would have been wiser if the expedition had started from Corea , as the sea voyage would have been greatly reduced ; but the difficulty of getting his army to that country , and the greater difficulty of feeding it when it got there , induced him to make his own maritime possessions the base of his operations . From the beginning misfortunes fell thick upon it , and the Japanese , not less than the English when assailed by the Spanish armada and Boulogne invasions , owed much to the alliance of the sea . Kublai had felt bound to appoint a Chinese generalissimo as well as a Mongol to this host , but it did not work well . One general fell ill and was superseded , another was lost in a storm , and there was a general want of harmony in the Mongol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the elements declared themselves against Kublai . His shattered fleet was compelled to take refuge off the islets to the north of Japan , where it attempted to refit , but the Japanese granted no respite , and assailed them both by land and sea . After protracted but unequal fighting the Mongol commander had no choice left but to surrender . The conquerors spared the Chinese and Coreans among their prisoners , but they put every Mongol to the sword . Only a stray junk or two escaped to tell Kublai the tale of the greatest defeat the Mongols had ever experienced . Thirty thousand of their best troops were slaughtered , and their newly-created fleet , on which they were founding such great expectations , was annihilated , while 70 , 000 Chinese and Coreans remained as prisoners in the hands of the victor . Kublai executed two of his generals who escaped , but it is clear no one was to blame . The Mongols were vanquished because they undertook a task beyond their power , and one with which their military experience did not fit them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was cavalry , and they had no knowledge of the sea . Nor could their Chinese auxiliaries supply this deficiency ; for , strange as it may appear , the Chinese , although many of them are good fishermen and sailors , have never been a powerful nation at sea . On the other hand , the Japanese have always been a bold and capable race of mariners . They have frequently proved that the sea is their natural element , and all the power and resources of Kublai availed not against the skill and courage of these hardy islanders . Kublai was reluctant to acquiesce in his defeat , and he endeavored to form another expedition , but the Chinese sailors mutinied and refused to embark . They were supported by all the Chinese ministers at Pekin , and Kublai felt himself compelled to yield and abandon all designs of conquest beyond the sea. @# The old success of the Mongols did not desert them on land , and Kublai received some consolation for his rude repulse by the Japanese in the triumph of his arms in Burmah . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as it was , and is still , called by the Chinese , had been followed by a fit of truculence and open hostility . This monarch had crossed over into Indian territory , and had assumed the title of King of Bengala in addition to his own . Emboldened by his success , he did not conceal his hostility to the Mongols , sent a defiant reply to all their representations , and even assumed the offensive with his frontier garrisons . He then declared open war . The Mongol general , Nasiuddin , collected all the forces he could , and when the Burmese ruler crossed the frontier at the head of an immense host of horse , foot , and elephants , he found the Mongol army drawn up on the plain of Yungchang . The Mongols numbered only 12 , 000 select troops , whereas the Burmese exceeded 80 , 000 men with a corps of elephants , estimated between 800 and 2 , 000 , and an artillery force of sixteen guns . Notwithstanding this numerical disadvantage the Mongols were in no way dismayed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggle between disciplined and brute force proved closer or more keenly contested . At first the charge of the Burmese cavalry , aided by the elephants and artillery , carried all before it . But Nasiuddin had provided for this contingency . He had dismounted all his cavalry , and had ordered them to fire their arrows exclusively against the elephant corps ; and as the Mongols were then not only the best archers in the world , but used the strongest bows , the destruction they wrought was considerable , and soon threw the elephants into hopeless confusion . The crowd of elephants turned tail before this discharge of arrows , as did the elephants of Pyrrhus , and threw the whole Burmese army into confusion . The Mongols then mounting their horses , charged and completed the discomfiture of the Burmese , who were driven from the field with heavy loss and tarnished reputation . On this occasion the Mongols did not pursue the Burmese very far , and the King of Burmah lost little or no part of his dominions , but Nasiuddin reported to Pekin that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mien to the Mongol empire . Kublai did not act on this advice until six years later , when he sent his kinsman Singtur with a large force to subdue Burmah . The king took shelter in Pegu , leaving his capital Amien at the mercy of the conqueror . The Mongol conquests were thus brought down to the very border of Assam . In Tonquin and Annam the arms of Kublai were not so successful . Kublai ' s son Togan made an abortive campaign in these regions . Whenever an open force had to be overcome , the Mongol army was successful , but when the Mongols encountered the difficulties of a damp and inclement climate , of the absence of roads , and other disadvantages , they were disheartened , and suffered heavily in men and morale . With the loss of his two generals , and the main portion of his army , Togan was lucky in himself escaping to China . Kublai wished to make another effort to subdue these inhospitable regions and their savage inhabitants , but Chinese public opinion proved too strong , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @# Kublai was the more compelled to sacrifice his feelings on this point , because there were not wanting indications that if he did not do so he would find a Chinese rebellion on his hands . Notwithstanding his many successes , and his evident desire to stand well with his Chinese subjects , it was already clear that they bore their new leader little love . Several of the principal provinces were in a state of veiled rebellion , showing that the first opportunity would be taken to shake off the Mongol yoke , and that Kublai ' s authority really rested on a quicksand . The predictions of a fanatic were sufficient to shake the emperor on his throne , and such was Kublai ' s apprehension that he banished all the remaining Sung prisoners to Mongolia , and executed their last faithful minister , who went to the scaffold with a smile on his face , exclaiming , " I am content ; my wishes are about to be realized . " It must not be supposed from this that Kublai ' s authority had vanished or become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but below the surface was seething an amount of popular hostility and discontent ominous to the longevity of the Mongol dynasty . The restless ambition of Kublai would not be satisfied with anything short of recognition , in some form or other , of his power by his neighbors , and he consequently sent envoys to ail the kingdoms of Southern Asia to obtain , by lavish presents or persuasive language , that recognition of his authority on which he had set his heart . In most cases he was gratified , for there was not a power in Eastern Asia to compare with that of the Mongol prince seated on the Dragon Throne of China , and all were flattered to be brought into connection with it on any terms. @# These successful and gratifying embassies had only one untoward result : they induced Kublai to revert to his idea of repairing the overthrow of his son Togan in Annam , and of finally subjugating that troublesome country . The intention was not wise , and it was rendered more imprudent by its execution being intrusted to Togan again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as was his initial success , he could not hope to permanently succeed . Togan began as he formerly commenced by carrying all before him . He won seventeen separate engagements , but the further he advanced into the country the more evident did it appear that he only controlled the ground on which he stood . The King of Annam was a fugitive ; his capital was in the hands of the Mongols , and apparently nothing more remained to be done . Apachi , the most experienced of the Mongol commanders , then counseled a prompt retreat . Unfortunately the Mongol prince Togan would not take his advice , and the Annamites , gathering fresh forces on all sides , attacked the exhausted Mongols , and compelled them to beat a precipitate retreat from their country . All the fruits of early victory were lost , and Togan ' s disgrace was a poor consolation for the culminating discomfiture of Kublai ' s reign . The people of Annam then made good their independence , and they still enjoy it , so far as China is concerned ; though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We can not doubt that the failure of the emperor ' s endeavor to popularize his rule was as largely due to the tyrannical acts and oppressive measures of some of his principal ministers as to unpopular and unsuccessful expeditions . Notwithstanding the popular dislike of the system , and Kublai ' s efforts to put it down , the Mongols resorted to the old plan of farming the revenue , and the extortion of those who purchased the right drove the Chinese to the verge of rebellion , and made the whole Mongol regime hateful . Several tax farmers were removed from their posts , and punished with death , but their successors carried on the same system . The declining years of Kublai ' s reign were therefore marred by the growing discontent of his Chinese subjects , and by his inability or unwillingness to put down official extortion and mismanagement . But he had to cope with a still greater danger in the hostility of some members of his own family . The rivalry between himself and his brother Arikbuka formed one incident of his earlier career , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peril when Kublai was stricken in years , and approaching the end of his long reign. @# Kaidu was one of the sons of Ogotai , and consequently first cousin to Kublai . He held some high post in Mongolia , and he represented a reactionary party among the Mongols , who wished the administration to be less Chinese , and who , perhaps , sighed for more worlds to conquer . But he hated Kublai , and was jealous of his pre-eminence , which was , perhaps , the only cause of his revolt . The hostility of Kaidu might have remained a personal grievance if he had not obtained the alliance of Nayan , a Mongol general of experience and ability , who had long been jealous of the superior reputation of Bayan . He was long engaged in raising an army , with which he might hope to make a bid for empire , but at last his preparations reached the ear of Kublai , who determined to crush him before his power had grown too great . Kublai marched against him at the head of 100 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the field were 40 , 000 , while Kaidu , although hastily gathering his forces , was too far off to render any timely aid . Kublai commanded in person , and arranged his order of battle from a tower supported on the backs of four elephants chained together . Both armies showed great heroism and ferocity , but numbers carried the day , and Nayan ' s army was almost destroyed , while he himself fell into the hands of the victor . It was contrary to the practice of the Mongols to shed the blood of their own princes , so Kublai ordered Nayan to be sewn up in a sack , and then beaten to death . The war with Kaidu dragged on for many years , and there is no doubt that Kublai did not desire to push matters to an extremity with his cousin . Having restored the fortunes of the war by assuming the command in person , Kublai returned in a short time to Pekin , leaving his opponent , as he hoped , the proverbial golden bridge by which to retreat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conduct of the campaign , favored more vigorous action , and was anxious to bring the struggle to a speedy and decisive termination . He had gained one remarkable victory under considerable disadvantage , when Kublai , either listening to his detractors or desirous of restraining his activity , dismissed him from his military posts and , summoning him to Pekin , gave him the uncongenial office of a minister of State . This happened in 1293 , and in the following year Kublai , who was nearly eighty , and who had occupied the throne of China for thirty-five years , sickened and died , leaving behind him a great reputation which has survived the criticism of six centuries in both Europe and China. @# Kublai ' s long reign marked the climax of the Mongol triumph which he had all the personal satisfaction of extending to China . Where Genghis failed , or attained only partial success , he succeeded to the fullest extent , thus verifying the prophecy of his grandfather . But although he conquered their country , he never vanquished the prejudices of the Chinese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completely to propitiate the good will of the historiographers of the Hanlin . Of Kublai they take some recognition , as an enlightened and well-meaning prince , but for all the other emperors of the Yuen line they have nothing good to say . Even Kublai himself could not assure the stability of his throne , and when he died it was at once clear that the Mongols could not long retain the supreme position in China. @# But Kublai ' s authority was sufficiently established for it to be transmitted , without popular disturbance or any insurrection on the part of the Chinese , to his legal heir , who was his grandson . Such risk as presented itself to the succession arose from the dissensions among the Mongol princes themselves , but the prompt measures of Bayan arrested any trouble , and Prince Timour was proclaimed emperor under the Chinese style of Chingtsong . A few months after this signal service to the ruling family , Bayan died , leaving behind him the reputation of being one of the most capable of all the Mongol commanders . Whether because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s place , or because his temperament was naturally pacific , Timour carried on no military operations , and the thirteen years of his reign were marked by almost unbroken peace . But peace did not bring prosperity in its train , for a considerable part of China suffered from the ravages of famine , and the cravings of hunger drove many to become brigands . Timour ' s anxiety to alleviate the public suffering gained him some small measure of popularity , and he also endeavored to limit the opportunities of the Mongol governors to be tyrannical by taking away from them the power of life and death . Timour was compelled by the sustained hostility of Kaidu to continue the struggle with that prince , but he confined himself to the defensive , and the death of Kaidu , in 1301 , deprived the contest of its extreme bitterness although it still continued. @# Timour was , however , unfortunate in the one foreign enterprise which he undertook . The ease with which Burmah had been vanquished and reduced to a tributary state emboldened some of his officers on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a state which may be identified with the modern Laos . The enterprise , commenced in a thoughtless and light- hearted manner , revealed unexpected peril and proved disastrous . A large part of the Mongol army perished from the heat , and the survivors were only rescued from their perilous position , surrounded by the numerous enemies they had irritated , by a supreme effort on the part of Koko , the viceroy of Yunnan , who was also Timour ' s uncle . The insurrectionary movement was not confined to the outlying districts of Annam and Burmah , but extended within the Chinese border , and several years elapsed before tranquillity was restored to the frontier provinces. @# Timour died in 1306 without leaving a direct legitimate heir , and his two nephews Haichan and Aiyuli Palipata were held to possess an equal claim to the throne . Haichan was absent in Mongolia when his uncle died , and a faction put forward the pretensions of Honanta , prince of Gansi , who seems to have been Timour ' s natural son , but Aiyuli Palipata , acting with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emperor . Haichan reigned five years , during which the chief reputation he gained was as a glutton . When he died , in 1311 , his brother Palipata was proclaimed emperor , although Haichan left two sons . Palipata ' s reign of nine years was peaceful and uneventful , and his son Chutepala succeeded him . Chutepala was a young and inexperienced prince who owed such authority as he enjoyed to the courage of Baiju , a brave soldier , who was specially distinguished as the lineal descendant of the great general , Muhula . The plots and intrigues which compassed the ruin of the Yuen dynasty began during this reign , and both Chutepala and Baiju were murdered by conspirators . The next emperor , Yesun Timour , was fortunate in a peaceful reign , but on his death , in 1328 , the troubles of the dynasty accumulated , and its end came clearly into view . In little more than a year , three emperors were proclaimed and died . Tou Timour , one of the sons of Haichan , who ruled before Palipata , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the most interesting episode in his barren reign was the visit of the Grand Lama of Tibet to Pekin , where he was received with exceptional honor ; but when Tou Timour attempted to compel his courtiers to pay the representative of Buddhism special obeisance he encountered the opposition of both Chinese and Mongols. @# After Tou Timour ' s death the imperial title passed to Tohan Timour , who is best known by his Chinese title of Chunti . He found a champion in Bayan , a descendant of the general of that name , who successfully defended the palace against the attack of a band of conspirators . In 1337 the first distinct rebellion on the part of the Chinese took place in the neighborhood of Canton , and an order for the disarmament of the Chinese population aggravated the situation because it could not be effectually carried out . Bayan , after his defense of the palace , became the most powerful personage in the state , and to his arrogance was largely due the aggravation of the Mongol difficulties and the imbittering of Chinese opinion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and outshone the emperor in his apparel and equipages , as if he were a Wolsey or a Buckingham . For the last offense Chunti could not forgive him , and Bayan was deposed and disgraced . While these dissensions were in progress at Pekin the Chinese were growing more daring and confident in their efforts to liberate themselves from the foreign yoke . They had adopted red bonnets as the mark of their patriotic league , and on the sea the piratical confederacy of Fangkue Chin vanquished and destroyed such navy as the Mongols ever possessed . But in open and regular fighting on land the supremacy of the Mongols was still incontestable , and a minister , named Toto , restored the sinking fortunes of Chunti until he fell the victim of a court intrigue  --  being poisoned by a rival named Hamar . With Toto disappeared the last possible champion of the Mongols , and the only thing needed to insure their overthrow was the advent of a capable leader who could give coherence to the national cause , and such a leader was not long in making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mongols was an individual named Choo Yuen Chang , who , being left an orphan , entered a monastery as the easiest way of gaining a livelihood . In the year 1345 , when Chunti had been on the throne twelve years , Choo quitted his retreat and joined one of the bands of Chinese who had thrown off the authority of the Mongols . His physique and fine presence soon gained for him a place of authority , and when the chief of the band died he was chosen unanimously as his successor . He at once showed himself superior to the other popular leaders by his humanity , and by his wise efforts to convince the Chinese people that he had only their interests at heart . Other Chinese so-called patriots thought mainly of plunder , and they were not less terrible to peaceful citizens than the most exacting Mongol commander or governor . But Choo strictly forbade plundering , and any of his band caught robbing or ill-using the people met with prompt and summary punishment . By this conduct he gained the confidence of the Chinese , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most popular and attracted the largest number of recruits . In 1356 he captured the city of Nankin , which thereupon became the base of his operations , as it was subsequently the capital of his dynasty . He then issued a proclamation declaring that his sole object was to expel the foreigners and to restore the national form of government . In this document he said , " It is the birthright of the Chinese to govern foreign peoples and not of these latter to rule in China . It used to be said that the Yuen or Mongols , who came from the regions of the north , conquered our empire not so much by their courage and skill as by the aid of Heaven . And now it is sufficiently plain that Heaven itself wishes to deprive them of that empire , as some punishment for their crimes , and for not having acted according to the teaching of their forefathers . The time has now come to drive these foreigners out of China . " While the Mongols were assailed in every province of the empire by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their expulsion , and his alliance with the pirate , Fangkue Chin , added the command of the sea to the control he had himself acquired over some of the wealthiest and most populous provinces of Central China . The disunion among the Mongols contributed to their overthrow as much as the valor of the Chinese . The Emperor Chunti had quite given himself up to pleasure , and his debaucheries were the scandal of the day . The two principal generals , Chahan Timour and Polo Timour , hated each other , and refused to co-operate . Another general , Alouhiya , raised the standard of revolt in Mongolia , and , while he declared that his object was to regenerate his race , he , undoubtedly , aggravated the embarrassment of Chunti. @# In 1366 , Choo , having carefully made all the necessary preparations for war on a large scale , dispatched from Fankin two large armies to conquer the provinces north of the Yangtsekiang , which were all that remained in the possession of the Mongols . A third army was intrusted with the task of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was accomplished with rapidity and without a check . Such Mongol garrisons as were stationed in this quarter were annihilated . The main Chinese army of 250 , 000 men was intrusted to the command of Suta , Choo ' s principal lieutenant and best general , and advanced direct upon Pekin . In 1367 Suta had overcome all resistance south of the Hoangho , which river he crossed in the autumn of that year . The Mongols appeared demoralized , and attempted little or no resistance . Chunti fled from Pekin to Mongolia , where he died in 1370 , and Suta carried the capital by storm from the small Mongol garrison which remained to defend it . Choo hastened to Pekin to receive the congratulations of his army , and to prove to the whole Chinese nation that the Yuen dynasty had ceased to rule . The resistance offered by the Mongols proved surprisingly slight , and , considering the value of the prize for which they were fighting , quite unworthy of their ancient renown . The real cause of their overthrow was that the Mongols never succeeded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chinese , who regarded them to the end as barbarians , and it must also be admitted that the main force of the Mongols had drifted to Western Asia , where the great Timour revived some of the traditions of Genghis . At the end of his career that mighty conqueror prepared to invade China , but he died shortly after he had begun a march that boded ill to the peace and welfare of China . Thus , with the flight of Chunti , the Mongol or Yuen dynasty came to an end , and the Mongols only reappear in Chinese history as the humble allies of the Manchus , when they undertook the conquest of China in the seventeenth century. @# @# CHAPTER VII @# THE MING DYNASTY @# Having expelled the Mongols , Choo assumed the style of Hongwou , and he gave his dynasty the name of Ming , which signifies " bright . " He then rewarded his generals and officers with titles and pecuniary grants , and in 1369 , the first year of his reign after the capture of Pekin , he erected a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generals who had been slain , while vacant places were left for the statues of those generals who still held command . But while he rewarded his army , Hongwou very carefully avoided giving his government a military character , knowing that the Chinese resent the superiority of military officials , and he devoted his main efforts to placing the civil administration on its old and national basis . In this he received the cordial support of the Chinese themselves , who had been kept in the background by their late conquerors , whose administration was essentially military . Hongwou also patronized literature , and endowed the celebrated Hanlin College , which was neglected after the death of Kublai . He at once provided a literary task of great magnitude in the history of the Yuen dynasty , which was intrusted to a commission of eighteen writers . But a still greater literary work was accomplished in the codified Book of Laws , which is known as the Pandects of Yunglo , and which not merely simplified the administration of the law , but also gave the people some idea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great measure of gratuitous national education , and , in order to carry out this reform in a thoroughly successful manner , he appointed all the masters himself . He also founded many public libraries , and he wished to establish one in every town , but this was beyond the extent of his power . Not content with providing for the minds of his subjects , Hongwou did his utmost to supply the needs of the aged . He cut down the court expenses and issued sumptuary laws , so that he might devote the sums thus economized to the support of the aged and sick . His last instructions to the new officials , on proceeding to their posts , were to " take particular care of the aged and the orphan . " Thus did he show that the Chinese had found in him a ruler who would revive the ancient glories of the kingdom. @# The frugality and modesty of his court have already been referred to . The later Mongols were fond of a lavish display , and expended large sums on banquets and amusements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grounds of the palace a lofty tower of porcelain , at enormous expense , and had arranged an ingenious contrivance at its base for denoting the time . Two statues sounded a bell and struck a drum at every hour . When Hongwou saw this edifice , he exclaimed , " How is it possible for men to neglect the most important affairs of life for the sole object of devoting their attention to useless buildings ? If the Mongols in place of amusing themselves with these trifles had applied their energies to the task of contenting the people , would they not have preserved the scepter in their family ? " He then ordered that this building should be razed to the ground . Nor did this action stand alone . He reduced the size of the harem maintained by all the Chinese as well as the Mongol rulers , and he instituted a rigid economy in all matters of state ceremonial . Changtu , the Xanadu of Coleridge , the famous summer palace of Kublai , had been destroyed during the campaigns with the Mongols , and Hongwou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pekin , which , under the Kin and Yuen dynasties , had become identified with foreign rulers . Pekin , during the whole of the Ming dynasty , was only a second-rate city , and all the attention of the Ming rulers was given to the embellishment of Nankin , the truly national capital of China. @# The expulsion of the Mongols beyond the Great Wall and the death of Chunti , the last of the Yuen emperors , by no means ended the struggle between the Chinese and their late northern conquerors . The whole of the reign of Hongwou was taken up with a war for the supremacy of his authority and the security of his frontiers , in which he , indeed , took little personal part , but which was carried on under his directions by his great generals , Suta and Fuyuta . The former of these generals was engaged for nearly twenty years , from 1368 to 1385 , in constant war with the Mongols . His first campaign , fought when the Chinese were in the full flush of success , resulted in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The neighboring province of Shensi , which is separated from the other by the river Hoangho , was at the time held by a semi-independent Mongol governor named Lissechi , who believed that he could hold his ground against the Mings . The principal fact upon which this hope was based was the breadth and assumed impassability of that river . Lissechi believed that this natural advantage would enable him to hold out indefinitely against the superior numbers of the Chinese armies . But his hope was vain if not unreasonable . The Chinese crossed the Hoangho on a bridge of junks , and Tsinyuen , which Lissechi had made his capital , surrendered without a blow . Lissechi abandoned one fortress after another on the approach of Suta . Expelled from Shensi he hoped to find shelter and safety in the adjoining province of Kansuh , where he took up his residence at Lintao . For a moment the advance of the Chinese army was arrested while a great council of war was held to decide the further course of the campaign . The majority of the council favored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wished Suta to abandon the pursuit of Lissechi and complete the conquest of Shensi , where several fortresses still held out . But Suta was of a more resolute temper , and resolved to ignore the decision of the council and to pursue Lissechi to Lintao . The vigor of Suta ' s decision was matched by the rapidity of his march . Before Lissechi had made any arrangements to stand a siege he found himself surrounded at Lintao by the Ming army . In this plight he was obliged to throw himself on the mercy of the victor , who sent him to the capital , where Hongwou granted him his life and a small pension. @# The overthrow of Lissechi prepared the way for the more formidable enterprise against Ninghia , where the Mongols had drawn their remaining power to a head . Ninghia , the old capital of Tangut , is situated in the north of Kansuh , on the western bank of the Hoangho , and the Great Wall passes through it . Strongly fortified and admirably placed , the Mongols , so long as they possessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might hope to recover what they had lost , and to make a fresh bid for power in Northern China . North and west of Ninghia stretched the desert , but while it continued in their possession the Mongols remained on the threshold of China and held open a door through which their kinsmen from the Amour and Central Asia might yet re-enter to revive the feats of Genghis and Bayan . Suta determined to gain this place as speedily as possible . Midway between Lintao and Ninghia is the fortified town of Kingyang , which was held by a strong Mongol garrison . Suta laid close siege to this town , the governor of which had only time to send off a pressing appeal for aid to Kuku Timour , the governor at Ninghia , before he was shut in on all sides by the Ming army . Kuku Timour apparently did his best to aid his compatriot , but his forces were not sufficient to oppose those of Suta in the open field , and Kingyang was at last reduced to such straits that the garrison is said to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At last the place made an unconditional surrender , and the commandant was executed , not on account of his stubborn defense , but because at the beginning of the siege he had said he would surrender and had not kept his word . After the fall of Kingyang the Chinese troops were granted a well-earned rest , and Suta visited Nankin to describe the campaign to Hongwou. @# The departure of Suta emboldened Kuku Timour so far as to lead him to take the field , and he hastened to attack the town of Lanchefoo , the capital of Kansuh , where there was only a small garrison . Notwithstanding this the place offered a stout resistance , but the Mongols gained a decisive success over a body of troops sent to its relief . This force was annihilated and its general taken prisoner . The Mongols thought to terrify the garrison by parading this general , whose name should be preserved , Yukwang , before the walls , but he baffled their purpose by shouting out , " Be of good courage , Suta is coming to your rescue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ timely and courageous exclamation , like that of D ' Assas , saved his countrymen . Soon after this incident Suta reached the scene of action , and on his approach Kuku Timour broke up his camp and retired to Ninghia . The Chinese commander then hastened to occupy the towns of Souchow and Kia-yu-kwan , important as being the southern extremity of the Great Wall , and as isolating Ninghia on the west . Their loss was so serious that the Mongol chief felt compelled to risk a general engagement . The battle was keenly contested , and at one moment it seemed as if success was going to declare itself in favor of the Mongols . But Suta had sent a large part of his force to attack the Mongol rear , and when this movement was completely executed , he assailed the Mongol position at the head of all his troops . The struggle soon became a massacre , and it is said that as many as 80 , 000 Mongols were slain , while Kuku Timour , thinking Ninghia no longer safe , fled northward to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete by the capture of a large number of the ex-Mongol ruling family by Ly Wenchong , another of the principal generals of Hongwou . Among the prisoners was the eldest grandson of Chunti , and several of the ministers advised that he should be put to death . But Hongwou instead conferred on him a minor title of nobility , and expressed his policy in a speech equally creditable to his wisdom as a statesman and his heart as a man : @# " The last ruler of the Yuens took heed only of his pleasures . The great , profiting by his indolence , thought of nothing save of how to enrich themselves ; the public treasures being exhausted by their malpractices , it needed only a few years of dearth to reduce the people to distress , and the excessive tyranny of those who governed them led to the forming of parties which disturbed the empire even to its foundations . Touched by the misfortunes with which I saw them oppressed , I took up arms , not so much against the Yuens as against the rebels who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same foe that I gained my first successes . And if the Yuen prince had not departed from the rules of wise government in order to give himself up to his pleasures , and had the magnates of his court performed their duty , would all honorable men have taken up arms as they did and declared against him ? The misconduct of the race brought me a large number of partisans who were convinced of the rectitude of my intentions , and it was from their hands and not from those of the Yuens that I received the empire . If Heaven had not favored me should I have succeeded in destroying with such ease those who withdrew into the desert of Shamo ? We read in the Chiking that after the destruction of the Chang family there remained more than ten thousand of their descendants who submitted themselves to the Chow , because it was the will of Heaven . Can not men respect its decrees ? Let them put in the public treasure-house all the spoil brought back from Tartary , so that it may serve to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Maitilipala ( Chunti ' s grandson ) , although former ages supply examples of similar sacrifice , did Wou Wang , I ask you , when exterminating the Chang family , resort to this barbarous policy ? The Yuen princes were the masters of this empire for nearly one hundred years , and my forefathers were their subjects , and even although it were the constant practice to treat in this fashion the princes of a dynasty which has ceased to reign , yet could I not induce myself to adopt it. " @# These noble sentiments , to which there is nothing contradictory in the whole life of Hongwou , would alone place his reign high among the most civilizing and humanly interesting epochs in Chinese history . To his people he appeared as a real benefactor as well as a just prince . He was ever studious of their interests , knowing that their happiness depended on what might seem trivial matters , as well as in showy feats of arms and high policy . He simplified the transit of salt , that essential article of life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dearth fell on the land he devoted all the resources of his treasury to its mitigation . His thoughtfulness for his soldiers was shown by sending fur coats to all the soldiers in garrison at Ninghia where the winter was exceptionally severe . A final instance of his justice and consideration may be cited in his ordering certain Mongol colonies established in Southern China , to whom the climate proved uncongenial , to be sent back at his expense to their northern homes , when his ministers exhorted him to proceed to extremities against them and to root them out by fire and sword. @# The pacification of the northern borders was followed by the dispatch of troops into the southern provinces of Szchuen and Yunnan , where officials appointed by the Mongols still exercised authority . One of these had incurred the wrath of Hongwou by assuming a royal style and proclaiming himself King of Hia . He was soon convinced of the folly of taking a title which he had not the power to maintain , and the conquest of Szchuen was so easily effected that it would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ providing Hongwou ' s other great general Fuyuta with the first opportunity of displaying his skill as a commander . The self-created King of Hia presented himself laden with chains at the Chinese camp and begged the favor of his life . The conquest of Szchuen was little more than completed when the attention of Hongwou was again directed to the northwest frontier , where Kuku Timour was making one more effort to recover the footing he had lost on the fringe of the Celestial Empire , and for a time fortune favored his enterprise . Even when Suta arrived upon the scene and took the command of the Chinese forces in person , the Mongols more than held their own . Twice did Suta attack the strong position taken up by the Mongol chief in the desert , and twice was his assault repulsed with heavy loss . A detachment under one of his lieutenants was surprised in the desert and annihilated . Supplies were difficult to obtain , and discouraged by defeat and the scarcity of food the Chinese army was placed in an extremely dangerous position . Out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who , on the news of the Mongol recrudescence , had marched northward at the head of the army with which he had conquered Szchuen . He advanced boldly into the desert , operated on the flank and in the rear of Kuku Timour , vanquished the Mongols in many engagements , and so monopolized their attention that Suta was able to retire in safety and without loss . The war terminated with the Chinese maintaining all their posts on the frontier , and the retreat of the Mongols , who had suffered too heavy a loss to feel elated at their repulse of Suta . At the same time no solid peace had been obtained , and the Mongols continued to harass the borders , and to exact blackmail from all who traversed the desert . When Hongwou endeavored to attain a settlement by a stroke of policy his efforts were not more successful . His kind reception of the Mongol Prince Maitilipala has been referred to , and about the year 1374 he sent him back to Mongolia , in the hope that he would prove a friendly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Maitilipala seems to have been unaffected ; but , although he was the legitimate heir , the Mongols refused to recognize him as Khan on the death of his father . Gradually tranquillity settled down on those borders . The Chinese officials were content to leave the Mongols alone , and the Mongols abandoned their customary raids into Chinese territory . The death of Kuku Timour was followed by the abandonment of all ideas of reviving Mongol authority in China . Not long after that event died the great general , Suta , of whom the national historians give the following glowing description which merits preservation : " Suta spoke little and was endowed with great penetration . He was always on good terms with the generals acting with him , sharing the good and bad fortune alike of his soldiers , of whom there was not one who , touched by his kindness , would not have done his duty to the death . He was not less pronounced in his modesty . He had conquered a capital , three provinces , several hundred towns , and on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he went without show and without retinue to his own house , received there some learned professors and discussed various subjects with them . Throughout his life he was in the presence of the emperor respectful , and so reserved that one might have doubted his capacity to speak . " Hongwou was in the habit of speaking thus in his praise : " My orders received , he forthwith departed ; his task accomplished , he returned without pride and without boasting . He loves not women , he does not amass wealth . A man of strict integrity , without the slightest stain , as pure and clear as the sun and moon , there is none like my first general Suta. " @# Hongwou had the satisfaction of restoring amicable relations with the King of Corea , a state in which the Chinese have always taken naturally enough a great interest from its proximity , as well as from an apprehension that the Japanese might make use of it as a vantage ground for the invasion of the continent . The King of Corea sent a formal embassy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for and received investiture in his authority with the royal yellow robes at the hands of the Ming ruler . During this period it will be convenient here to note that the ruling power in Corea passed from the old royal family to the minister Li Chungwei , who was the ancestor of the present king . The last military episode of the reign of Hongwou was the conquest of Yunnan , which had been left over after the recovery of Szchuen , in consequence of the fresh outbreak of the Mongols in the north . This task was intrusted to Fuyuta , who at the head of an army of 100 , 000 men , divided into two corps , invaded Yunnan . The prince of that state offered the utmost resistance he could , but in the one great battle of the war his army fighting bravely was overthrown , and he was compelled to abandon his capital . The conquest of Yunnan completed the pacification of the empire , and the authority of Hongwou was unchallenged from the borders of Burmah to the Great Wall and the Corean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not much exceed sixty millions . The last ten years of the reign of Hongwou were passed in tranquillity , marred by only one unpleasant incident , the mutiny of a portion of his army under an ambitious general . The plot was discovered in good time , but it is said that the emperor did not consider the exigencies of the case to be met until he had executed twenty thousand of the mutineers. @# In 1398 Hongwou was attacked with the illness which ended his life . He was then in his seventy-first year , and had reigned more than thirty years since his proclamation of the Ming dynasty at Nankin . The Emperor Keen Lung , in his history of the Mings , states that Hongwou possessed most of the virtues and few of the vices of mankind . He was brave , patient under suffering , far-seeing , studious of his people ' s welfare , and generous and forbearing toward his enemies . It is not surprising that he succeeded in establishing the Ming dynasty on a firm and popular basis , and that his family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the possible exception of the Hans . In his will , which is a remarkable document , he recites the principal events of his reign , how he had " pacified the empire and restored its ancient splendor . " With the view of providing for the stability of his empire , he chose as his successor his grandson Chuwen , because he had remarked in him much prudence , a gentle disposition , good intelligence , and a readiness to accept advice . He also selected him because he was the eldest son of his eldest son , and as his other sons might be disposed to dispute their nephew ' s authority he ordered them to remain at their posts , and not to come to the capital on his death . They were also enjoined to show the new emperor all the respect and docility owed by subjects to their sovereign . Through these timely precautions Chuwen , who was only sixteen years of age , was proclaimed emperor without any opposition , and took the title of Kien Wenti. @# Hongwou had rightly divined that his sons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and his policy of employing them in posts at a distance from the capital was only half successful in attaining its object . If it kept them at a distance it also strengthened their feeling of independence , and enabled them to collect their forces without attracting much attention . Wenti , as it is most convenient to call the new emperor , felt obliged to send formal invitations to his uncles to attend the obsequies of their father . Most of them had the tact to perceive that the invitation was dictated by regard for decency , and not by a wish that it should be accepted , and gave the simplest excuse for not attending the funeral . But Ty , Prince of Yen , the most powerful and ambitious of them all , declared that he accepted the emperor ' s invitation . This decision raised quite a flutter of excitement , almost amounting to consternation , at Nankin , where the Prince of Yen was regarded as a bitter and vindictive enemy . The only way Wenti saw out of this dilemma was to send his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not be desirable . Before he had been many weeks on the throne Wenti was thus brought into open conflict with the most powerful and ambitious of all his relatives . He resolved , under the advice of his ministers , to treat all his uncles as his enemies , and he sent his officers with armies at their back to depose them , and bring them as prisoners to his court . Five of his uncles were thus summarily dealt with , one committed suicide , and the other four were degraded to the rank of the people . But the Prince of Yen was too formidable to be tackled in this fashion . Taking warning from the fate of his brothers , he collected all the troops he could , prepared to defend his position against the emperor , and issued a proclamation stating that it was lawful for subjects to revolt for the purpose of removing the pernicious advisers of the sovereign . The last was , he announced , the cause of his taking up arms , and he disclaimed any motive of ambitious turbulence for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endeavoring to avert the ruin of my family , and to maintain the emperor on a throne which is placed in jeopardy by the acts of traitors . My cause ought , therefore , to be that of all those who keep the blood of the great Hong-wou , now falsely aspersed , in affectionate remembrance . " A large number of the inhabitants of the northern provinces joined his side , and proclaimed him as " The Prince . " Wenti had recourse to arms to bring his uncle back to his allegiance , and a civil war began , which was carried on , with exceptional bitterness , during five years . The resources of the emperor , in men and money , were the superior , but he did not seem able to turn them to good account ; and the prince ' s troops were generally victorious , and his power gradually increased . In the year 1401 both sides concentrated all their strength for deciding the contest by a single trial of arms . The two armies numbered several hundred thousand men , and it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong . The battle  --  which was fought at Techow in Shantung  --  considering the numbers engaged , it is not surprising to learn , lasted several days , and its fortune alternated from one side to the other . At last victory declared for the prince , and the imperial army was driven in rout from the field with the loss of 100 , 000 men. @# After this great victory the further progress of the prince was arrested by a capable general named Chinyong , who succeeded in gaining one great victory . If Wenti had known how to profit by this success he might have turned the course of the struggle permanently in his own favor . But instead of profiting by his good fortune , Wenti , believing that all danger from the prince was at an end , resumed his old practices , and reinstated two of the most obnoxious of his ministers , whom he had disgraced in a fit of apprehension . Undoubtedly this step raised against him a fresh storm of unpopularity , and at the same time brought many supporters to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , found himself stronger than he had been before . The struggle must have shown little signs of a decisive issue , for in 1402 the prince made a voluntary offer of peace , with a view to putting an end to all strife and of giving the empire peace ; but Wenti could not make up his mind to forgive him . The success of his generals in the earlier part of the struggle seemed to warrant the belief that there was no reason in prudence for coming to terms with his rebellious uncle , and that he would succeed in establishing his indisputable supremacy . The prince seemed reduced to such straits that he had to give his army the option of retreat . Addressing his soldiers he said : " I know how to advance , but not to retreat " ; but his army decided to return to their homes in the north , when the extraordinary and unexpected retreat of the greater part of the army of Wenti revived their courage and induced them to follow their leader through one more encounter . Like Frederick the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in defeat . He surprised the lately victorious army of Wenti , smashed it in pieces , and captured Tingan , the emperor ' s best general . The occupation of Nankin and the abdication of Wenti followed this victory in rapid succession . Afraid to trust himself to the mercy of his relative , he fled , disguised as a priest , to Yunnan , where he passed his life ignominiously for forty years , and his identity was only discovered after that lapse of time by his publishing , in his new character of a Buddhist priest , a poem reciting and lamenting the misfortunes of Wenti . Then he was removed to Pekin , where he died in honorable confinement . As a priest he seems to have been more fortunate than as a ruler , and history contains no more striking example of happiness being found in a private station when unattainable on a throne. @# After some hesitation the Prince of Yen allowed himself to be proclaimed emperor , and as such he is best known as Yonglo , a name signifying " Eternal Joy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reform and not to destroy the administration of his nephew , his first act obliterating the reign of Wenti from the records and constituting himself the immediate successor of Hongwou was not calculated to support his alleged indifference to power . He was scarcely seated on the throne before he was involved in serious troubles on both his northern and his southern frontiers . In Mongolia he attempted to assert a formal supremacy over the khans through the person of an adventurer named Kulitchi , but the agent was unable to fulfill his promises , and met with a speedy overthrow . In Tonquin an ambitious minister named Likimao deposed his master and established himself as ruler in his place . The emperor sent an army to bring him to his senses , and it met with such rapid success that the Chinese were encouraged to annex Tonquin and convert it into a province of the empire . When Yonglo ' s plans failed on the steppe he was drawn into a struggle with the Mongols , which necessitated annual expeditions until he died . During the last of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his return march he died in his camp at the age of sixty-five . Although he bore arms so long against the head of the state there is no doubt that he greatly consolidated the power of the Mings , which he extended on one side to the Amour and on the other to the Songcoi . It was during his reign that Tamerlane contemplated the reconquest of China , and perhaps it was well for Yonglo that that great commander died when he had traversed only a few stages of his march to the Great Wall . One of his sons succeeded Yonglo as emperor , but he only reigned under the style of Gintsong for a few months. @# Then Suentsong , the son of Gintsong , occupied the throne , and during his reign a vital question affecting the constitution of the civil service , and through it the whole administration of the country , was brought forward , and fortunately settled without recourse to blows , as was at one time feared would be the case . Before his reign the public examinations had been open to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had become noticeable that all the honors were being carried off by students from the southern provinces , who were of quicker intelligence than those of the north . It seemed as if in the course of a short time all the posts would be held by them , and that the natives of the provinces north of the Hoangho would be gradually driven out of the service . Naturally this marked tendency led to much agitation in the north , and a very bitter feeling was spreading when Suentsong and his minister took up the matter and proceeded to apply a sound practical remedy . After a commission of inquiry had certified to the reality of the evil , Suentsong decreed that all competitors for literary honors should be restricted to their native districts , and that for the purpose of the competitive examinations China should be divided into three separate divisions , one for the north , another for the center , and the third for the south . The firmness shown by the Emperor Suentsong in this matter was equally conspicuous in his dealings with an uncle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field in person , and before the country was generally aware of the revolt , Suentsong was conducting his relative to a state prison . The rest of Suentsong ' s reign was peaceful and prosperous , and he left the crown to his son , Yngtsong , a child eight years old. @# During his minority the governing authority was exercised by his grandmother , the Empress Changchi , the mother of the Emperor Suentsong . At first it seemed as if there would be a struggle for power between her and the eunuch Wangchin , who had gained the affections of the young emperor ; but after she had denounced him before the court and called for his execution , from which fate he was only rescued by the tears and supplications of the young sovereign , the feud was composed by Wangchin gaining such an ascendency over the empress that she made him her associate in the regency . Unfortunately Wangchin did not prove a wise or able administrator . He thought more of the sweets of office than of the duties of his lofty station . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military posts without regard to their qualifications or ability . To his arrogance was directly due the commencement of a disastrous war with Yesien , the most powerful of the Mongol chiefs of the day . When that prince sent the usual presents to the Chinese capital , and made the customary request for a Chinese princess as wife , Wangchin appropriated the gifts for himself and sent back a haughty refusal to Yesien ' s petition , although it was both customary and rarely refused . Such a reception was tantamount to a declaration of war , and Yesien , who had already been tempted by the apparent weakness of the Chinese frontier to resume the raids which were so popular with the nomadic tribes of the desert , gathered his fighting men together and invaded China . Alarmed by the storm he had raised , Wangchin still endeavored to meet it , and summoning all the garrisons in the north to his aid , he placed himself at the head of an army computed to number half a million of men . In the hope of inspiring his force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , but his own incompetence nullified the value of numbers , and rendered the presence of the emperor the cause of additional ignominy instead of the inspiration of invincible confidence . The vast and unwieldy Chinese army took up a false position at a place named Toumon , and it is affirmed that the position was so bad that Yesien feared that it must cover a ruse . He accordingly sent some of his officers to propose an armistice , but really to inspect the Chinese lines . They returned to say that there was no concealment , and that if an attack were made at once the Chinese army lay at his mercy . Yesien delayed not a moment in delivering his attack , and it was completely successful . The very numbers of the Chinese , in a confined position , added to their discomfiture , and after a few hours ' fighting the battle became a massacre and a rout . Wangchin , the cause of all this ruin , was killed by Fanchong , the commander of the imperial guards , and the youthful ruler , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a more disastrous day in the long annals of the Chinese empire than the rout at Toumon. @# would only restore him for a ransom of 100 taels of gold , 200 taels of silver , and 200 pieces of the finest silk . For some unknown reason the Empress Changchi did not feel disposed to pay this comparatively low ransom , and instead of reclaiming Yngtsong from his conqueror she placed his brother , Kingti , on the throne . The struggle with the Mongols under Yesien continued , but his attention was distracted from China by his desire to become the great Khan of the Mongols , a title still held by his brother-in-law , Thotho Timour , of the House of Genghis . Yesien , suddenly releasing of his own accord Yngtsong  --  who returned to Pekin  --  hastened to the Kerulon country , where he overthrew and assassinated Thotho Timour , and was in turn himself slain by another chieftain . While the Mongol was thus pursuing his own ambition , and reaching the violent death which forms so common a feature in the history of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the refusal of his brother Kingti to resign the throne , he sank quietly into private life . Kingti died seven years after his brother ' s return , and then , failing a better or nearer prince , Yngtsong was brought from his confinement and restored to the throne . He reigned eight years after his restoration , but he never possessed any real power , his authority being wielded by unscrupulous ministers , who stained his reign by the execution of Yukien , the most honest and capable general of the period . If his reign was not remarkable for political or military vigor , some useful reforms appear to have been instituted . Among others may be named the formation of state farms on waste or confiscated lands , the establishment of military schools for teaching archery and horsemanship , and the completion of some useful and elaborate educational works , of which a geography of China , in ninety volumes , is the most famous. @# Yngtsong died in the year 1465 , and was succeeded by his son , Hientsong , who began his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his subjects . He also rendered posthumous honors to the ill- used general , Yukien , and established his fame as a national benefactor . During the twenty-eight years that he occupied the throne he was engaged in a number of petty wars , none of which requires specific mention . The only unpopular measure associated with his name was the creation of a Grand Council of Eunuchs , to which was referred all questions of capital punishment , and this body soon acquired a power which made it resemble the tyrannical and irresponsible British Star Chamber . After five years this institution became so unpopular and was so deeply execrated by the nation that Hientsong , however reluctantly , had to abolish his own creation , and acquiesce in the execution of some of its most active members. @# During Hientsong ' s reign a systematic attempt was made to work the gold mines reputed to exist in Central China , but although half a million men were employed upon them it is stated that the find did not exceed thirty ounces . More useful work was accomplished in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which thus enabled grain junks to reach the northern capital by the Euho and Shaho canals from the Yangtsekiang . Another useful public work was the repairing of the Great Wall , effected along a considerable portion of its extent , by the efforts of 50 , 000 soldiers , which gave the Chinese a sense of increased security . In connection with this measure of defense , it may be stated that the Chinese advanced into Central Asia and occupied the town of Hami , which then and since has served them as a useful watch-tower in the direction of the west . The death of Hientsong occurred in 1487 , at a moment when the success and prosperity of the country under the Mings may be described as having reached its height. @# During the reign of his son and successor , Hiaotsong , matters progressed peacefully , for , although there was some fighting for the possession of Hami , which was coveted by several of the desert chiefs , but which remained during the whole of this reign subject to China , the empire was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black aborigines of the island of Hainan was put down without any very serious difficulty . These events do not throw any very clear light on the character and personality of Hiaotsong , who died in 1505 at the early age of thirty-six ; but his care for his people , and his desire to alleviate the misfortunes that might befall his subjects , was shown by his ordering every district composed of ten villages to send in annually to a State granary , a specified quantity of grain , until 100 , 000 bushels had been stored in every such building throughout the country . The idea was an excellent one ; but it is to be feared that a large portion of this grain was diverted to the use of the peculating officials , whence arose the phrase , " The emperor is full of pity , but the Court of Finance is like the never-dying worm which devours the richest crops . " To Hiaotsong succeeded his son , Woutsong , during whose reign many misfortunes fell upon the land . The emperor ' s uncles had designs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to naught , rather through Woutsong ' s good fortune than the excellence of his arrangements . In Szchuen a peasant war threatened to assume the dimensions of a rebellion , and in Pechihli bands of mounted robbers , or Hiangmas , raided the open country . He succeeded in suppressing these revolts , but his indifference to the disturbed state of his realm was shown by his passing most of his time in hunting expeditions beyond the Great Wall . His successors were to reap the result of this neglect of business for the pursuit of pleasure ; and when he died in 1519 , without leaving an heir , the outlook was beginning to look serious for the Ming dynasty . One event , and perhaps the most important of Woutsong ' s reign , calls for special mention , and that is the arrival at Canton of the first native of Europe to reach China by sea . Of course it will be recollected that Marco Polo and others reached the Mongol court by land , although the Venetian sailed from China on his embassy to southern India @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China , and in 1517 the Portuguese officer , Don Fernand Perez D ' Andrade , arrived in the Canton River with a squadron , and was favorably received by the mandarins . D ' Andrade visited Pekin , where he resided for some time as embassador . The commencement of intercourse between Europeans and China was thus effected most auspiciously ; and it might have continued so but that a second Portuguese fleet appeared in Chinese waters , and committed there numerous outrages and acts of piracy . Upon this D ' Andrade was arrested by order of Woutsong , and after undergoing imprisonment , was executed by his successor in 1523 . It was a bad beginning for a connection which , after nearly four hundred years , is neither as stable nor as general as the strivers after perfection could desire. @# The death of Woutsong without children , or any recognized heir , threatened to involve the realm in serious dangers ; but the occasion was so critical that the members of the Ming family braced themselves to it , and under the auspices of the Empress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secret council was held , when the grandson of the Emperor Hientsong , a youth of fourteen , was placed on the throne under the name of Chitsong . It is said that his mother gave him good advice on being raised from a private station to the lofty eminence of emperor , and that she told him that he was about to accept a heavy burden ; but experience showed that he was unequal to it . Still , his shortcomings were preferable to a disputed succession . The earlier years of his reign were marked by some successes over the Tartars , and he received tribute from chiefs who had never paid it before . But Chitsong had little taste for the serious work of administration . He showed himself superstitious in matters of religion , and he cultivated poetry , and may even have persuaded himself that he was a poet . But he did not pay any heed to the advice of those among his ministers who urged him to take a serious view of his position , and to act in a manner worthy of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of his people , and even on the course of his country ' s history , was small , and such reigns as his inspire the regret expressed at there being no history of the Chinese people ; but such a history is impossible. @# It might be more instructive to trace the growth of thought among the masses , or to indicate the progress of civil and political freedom ; yet , not only do the materials not exist for such a task , but those we possess all tend to show that there has been no growth to describe , no progress to be indicated , during these comparatively recent centuries . It is the peculiar and distinguishing characteristic of Chinese history that the people and their institutions have remained practically unchanged and the same from a very early period . Even the introduction of a foreign element has not tended to disturb the established order of things . The supreme ruler possesses the same attributes and discharges the same functions ; the governing classes are chosen in the same manner ; the people are bound in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberty ; all is now as it was . Neither under the Tangs nor the Sungs , under the Yuens nor the Mings , was there any change in national character or in political institutions to be noted or chronicled . The history of the empire has always been the fortunes of the dynasty , which has depended , in the first place , on the passive content of the subjects , and , in the second , on the success or failure of its external and internal wars . This condition of things may be disappointing to those who pride themselves on tracing the origin of a constitution and the growth of civil rights , and also would have a history of China a history of the Chinese people ; although the fact is undoubted that there is no history of the Chinese people apart from that of their country to be recorded . The national institutions and character were formed , and had attained in all essentials their present state , more than two thousand years ago , or before the destruction of all trustworthy materials for the task @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China . Without them we must fain content ourselves with the history of the country and the empire. @# Chitsong was engaged in three serious operations beyond his frontier , one with a Tartar chief named Yenta , another with the Japanese , and the third in Cochin China . Yenta was of Mongol extraction , and enjoyed supreme power on the borders of Shansi . His brother was chief of the Ordus tribe , which dwells within the Chinese frontier . Changtu , the old residence of Kublai , was one of his camps , and it was said that he could bring 100 , 000 horsemen into the field . The success of his raids carried alarm through the province of Shansi , and during one of them he laid siege to the capital , Taiyuen . Then the emperor placed a reward on his head and offered an official post to the person who would rid him of his enemy by assassination . The offer failed to bring forward either a murderer or a patriot , and Yenta ' s hostility was increased by the personal nature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sinister fate . He invaded China on a larger scale than ever , and carried his ravages to the southern extremity of Shansi , and returned laden with the spoil of forty districts , and bearing with him 200 , 000 prisoners to a northern captivity . After this success Yenta seems to have rested on his laurels , although he by no means gave up his raids , which , however , assumed more and more a local character . The Chinese annalists state that never was the frontier more disturbed , and even the establishment of horse fairs for the benefit of the Mongols failed to keep them quiet . In Cochin China the emperor gained some gratifying if not very important successes , and asserted his right as suzerain over several disobedient princes . But a more serious and less satisfactory question had to be settled on the side of Japan. @# The Japanese had never forgiven the formidable and unprovoked invasion of their country by Kublai Khan . The Japanese are by nature a military nation , and the Chinese writers themselves describe them as " intrepid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well how to face death ; although inferior in number a hundred of them would blush to flee before a thousand foreigners , and if they did they would not dare to return to their country . Sentiments such as these , which are instilled into them from their earliest childhood , render them terrible in battle . " Emboldened by their success over the formidable Mongols the Japanese treated the Chinese with contempt , and fitted out piratical expeditions from time to time with the object of preying on the commerce and coasting towns of China . To guard against the descents of these enterprising islanders the Chinese had erected towers of defense along the coast , and had called out a militia which was more or less inefficient . On the main they did not so much as attempt to make a stand against their neighbors , whose war junks exercised undisputed authority on the Eastern Sea . While this strife continued a trade also sprang up between the two peoples , who share in an equal degree the commercial instinct ; but as the Chinese government only admitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent every ten years from Japan , this trade could only be carried on by smuggling . A regular system was adopted to secure the greatest success and profit . The Japanese landed their goods on some island off the coast , whence the Chinese removed them at a safe and convenient moment to the mainland . The average value of the cargo of one of the small junks which carried on this trade is said to have been $20 , 000 , so that it may be inferred that the profits were considerable . But the national antipathies would not be repressed by the profitable character of this trade , and the refusal of a Chinese merchant to give a Japanese the goods for which he had paid lit the embers of a war which went on for half a century , and which materially weakened the Ming power . During the last years of Chitsong ' s long reign of forty-five years this trouble showed signs of getting worse , although the Japanese confined their efforts to irregular and unexpected attacks on places on the coast , and did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ midst of these troubles , and when it was hoped that the exhortation of his ministers would produce some effect , Chitsong died , leaving behind him a will or public proclamation to be issued after his death , and which reads like a long confession of fault . Mea culpa , exclaimed this Eastern ruler at the misfortunes of his people and the calamities of his realm , but he could not propound a remedy for them. @# His third son succeeded him as the Emperor Moutsong , and the character and capacity of this prince gave promise that his reign would be satisfactory if not glorious . Unfortunately for his family , and perhaps for his country , the public expectations were dispelled in his case by an early death . The six years during which he reigned were rendered remarkable by the conclusion of a stable peace with the Tartar Yenta , who accepted the title of a Prince of the Empire . Moutsong when he found that he was dying grew apprehensive lest the youth of his son might not stir up dissension and provoke that internal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empire and involved the wreck of many of its dynasties . He exhorted his ministers to stand by his son who was only a boy , to give him the best advice in their power , and to render him worthy of the throne . That the apprehensions of Moutsong were not without reason was clearly shown by the mishaps and calamities which occurred during the long reign of his son and successor Wanleh . With the death of Moutsong the period ends when it was possible to state that the majesty of the Mings remained undimmed , and that this truly national dynasty wielded with power and full authority the imperial mandate . When they had driven out the Mongol the Mings seem to have settled down into an ordinary and intensely national line of rulers . The successors of Hongwou did nothing great or noteworthy , but the Chinese acquiesced in their rule , and even showed that they possessed for it a special regard and affection. @# @# CHAPTER VIII @# THE DECLINE OP THE MINGS @# The reign of Wanleh covers the long and important epoch from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarkable events in the history of the country , including the first movements of the Manchus with a view to the conquest of the empire . The young prince was only six when he was placed on the throne , but he soon showed that he had been well-trained to play the part of ruler . The best indication of the prosperity of the realm is furnished by the revenue , which steadily increased until it reached the great total , excluding the grain receipts , of seventy-five millions of our money . But a large revenue becomes of diminished value unless it is associated with sound finance . The public expenditure showed a steady increase ; the emperor and his advisers were incapable of checking the outlay , and extravagance , combined with improvidence , soon depleted the exchequer . Internal troubles occurred to further embarrass the executive , and the resources of the state were severely strained in coping with more than one serious rebellion , among which the most formidable was the mutiny of a mercenary force under the command of a Turk officer named Popai , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time was favorable to found an administration of his own . His early successes encouraged him to believe that he would succeed in his object ; but when he found that all the disposable forces of the empire were sent against him , he abandoned the field , and shut himself up in the fortress at Ninghia , where he hoped to hold out indefinitely . For many months he succeeded in baffling the attacks of Wanleh ' s general , and the siege might even have had to be raised if the latter had not conceived the idea of diverting the course of the river Hoangho , so that it might bear upon the walls of the fortress . Popai was unable to resist this form of attack , and when the Chinese stormers made their way through the breach thus caused , he attempted to commit suicide by setting fire to his residence . This satisfaction was denied him , for a Chinese officer dragged him from the flames , slew him , and sent his head to the general Li Jusong , who conducted the siege , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The gratification caused by the overthrow of Popai had scarcely abated when the attention of the Chinese government was drawn away from domestic enemies to a foreign assailant who threatened the most serious danger to China . Reference was made in the last chapter to the relations between the Chinese and the Japanese , and to the aggressions of the latter , increased , no doubt , by Chinese chicane and their own naval superiority and confidence . But nothing serious might have come out of these unneighborly relations if they had not furnished an ambitious ruler with the opportunity of embarking on an enterprise which promised to increase his empire and his glory . The old Japanese ruling family was descended , as already described , from a Chinese exile ; but the hero of the sixteenth century could claim no relationship with the royal house , and owed none of his success to the accident of a noble birth . Fashiba , called by some English writers Hideyoshi ; by the Chinese Pingsiuki ; and by the Japanese , on his elevation to the dignity of Tycoon , Taiko @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that he first attracted attention by refusing to make the prescribed obeisance to one of the daimios or lords . He was on the point of receiving condign punishment , when he pleaded his case with such ingenuity and courage that the daimio not only forgave him his offense , but gave him a post in his service . Having thus obtained honorable employment , Fashiba devoted all his energy and capacity to promoting the interests of his new master , knowing well that his position and opportunities must increase equally with them . In a short time he made his lord the most powerful daimio in the land , and on his death he stepped , naturally enough , into the position and power of his chief . How long he would have maintained himself thus in ordinary times may be matter of opinion , but he resolved to give stability to his position and a greater luster to his name by undertaking an enterprise which should be popular with the people and profitable to the state . The Japanese had only attempted raids on the coast , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But Fashiba proposed the conquest of China , and he hoped to effect his purpose through the instrumentality of Corea . With this view he wrote the king of that country the following letter : " I will assemble a mighty host , and , invading the country of the Great Ming , I will fill with hoar-frost from my sword the whole sky over the 400 provinces . Should I carry out this purpose , I hope that Corea will be my vanguard . Let her not fail to do so , for my friendship to your honorable country depends solely on your conduct when I lead my army against China. " @# Fashiba began with an act of aggression at Corea ' s expense , by seizing the important harbor of Fushan . Having thus secured a foothold on the mainland and a gateway into the kingdom , Fashiba hastened to invade Corea at the head of a large army . The capital was sacked and the tombs of Lipan ' s ancestors desecrated , while he himself fled to the Chinese court to implore the assistance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrest the progress of the Japanese invader , who had by this reached Pingyang , a town 400 miles north of Fushan . An action was fought outside this town . The advantage rested with the Japanese , who succeeded in destroying a Chinese regiment . After this a lull ensued in the campaign , and both sides brought up fresh forces . Fashiba came over from Japan with further supplies and troops to assist his general , Hingchang , while on the Chinese side , Li Jusong , the captor of Ninghia , was placed at the head of the Chinese army . A second battle was fought in the neighborhood of Pingyang , and after some stubborn fighting the Japanese were driven out of that town. @# The second campaign was opened by a brilliant feat on the part of Li Jusong , who succeeded in surprising and destroying the granaries and storehouses constructed by the Japanese , near Seoul . The loss of their stores compelled the Japanese to retire on Fushan , but they did not with such boldness and confidence that the Chinese did not venture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was still doubtful when the sudden death of Fashiba completely altered the complexion of the situation . The Japanese army then withdrew , taking with it a vast amount of booty and the ears of 10 , 000 Coreans . The Chinese troops also retired , leaving the Corean king at liberty to restore his disputed authority , and his kingdom once more sank into its primitive state of exclusion and semi- darkness. @# For the first time in Chinese history the relations between the Middle Kingdom and Europeans became of importance during the reign of Wanleh , which would alone give it a special distinction . The Portuguese led the way for European enterprise in China , and it was very unfortunate that they did so , for it was soon written of them that " the Portuguese have no other design than to come under the name of merchants to spy the country , that they may hereafter fall upon it with fire and sword . " As early as the year 1560 they had obtained from the local officials the right to found a settlement and to erect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known as Macao . In a few years it became of so much importance that it was the annual restort of five or six hundred Portuguese merchants ; and the Portuguese , by paying a yearly rent of 500 taels , secured the practical monopoly of the trade of the Canton River , which was then and long afterward the only vent for the external trade of China . No doubt the Portuguese had to supplement this nominal rent by judicious bribes to the leading mandarins . Next after the Portuguese came the Spaniards , who , instead of establishing themselves on the mainland , made their headquarters in a group of the Philippine Islands. @# The promotion of European interests in China owed little or nothing to the forbearance and moderation of either the Spaniards or Portuguese . They tyrannized over the Chinese subject to their sway , and they employed all their resources in driving away other Europeans from what they chose to consider their special commercial preserves . Thus the Dutch were expelled from the south by the Portuguese and compelled to take refuge in Formosa , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except by occasional visits , until a much later period , although it should be recorded that the English Captain Weddell was the first to discover the mouth of the Canton River , and to make his way up to that great city. @# One of the principal troubles of the Emperor Wanleh arose from his having no legitimate heir , and his ministers impressed upon him , for many years , the disadvantage of this situation before he would undertake to select one of his children by the inferior members of the harem as his successor . And then he made what may be termed a divided selection . He proclaimed his eldest son heir-apparent , and declared the next brother to be in the direct order of succession , and conferred on him the title of Prince Fou Wang . The latter was his real favorite , and , encouraged by his father ' s preference , he formed a party to oust his elder brother and to gain the heritage before it was due . The intrigues in which he engaged long disturbed the court and agitated the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prince Fou Wang threatened the position and even the life of the heir-apparent , Prince Chu Changlo , but the plot was discovered and Fou Wang ' s rank would not have saved him from the executioner if it had not been for the special intercession of his proposed victim , Chu Changlo . In the midst of these family troubles , as well as those of the state , the Emperor Wanleh died , after a long reign , in 1620 . The last years of his life were rendered unhappy and miserable by the reverses experienced at the hands of the new and formidable opponent who had suddenly appeared upon the northern frontier of the empire. @# Some detailed account of the Manchu race and of the progress of their arms before the death of Wanleh will form a fitting prelude to the description of the long wars which resulted in the conquest of China and in the placing of the present ruling family on the Dragon Throne. @# The first chief of the Manchu clan was a mythical personage named Aisin Gioro , who flourished in the middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Mings , was employed in the task of driving out the Mongols . Aisin Gioro is said to mean Golden Family Stem , and thus the connection with the Kin dynasty finds recognition at an early stage . His birth is described in mythical terms  --  it is said that a magpie dropped a red fruit into the lap of a maiden of the Niuche , who straightway ate it and conceived a son . The skeptical have interpreted this as meaning that Aisin Gioro was a runaway Mongol , who was granted shelter by the Niuche of Hootooala . At all events he became lord of the valley , and five generations later , in the reign of Wanleh , his descendant , Huen , was head of the Manchus . His grandson , the great Noorhachu , was born in the year 1559 , and his birth was attended by several miraculous circumstances . He is said " to have been a thirteen-months ' child , to have had the dragon face and the phenix eye , an enormous chest , large ears , and a voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief named Haida was the first to stir up the embers of internecine strife among the Niuche clans . To gratify his own ambition or to avenge some blood feuds , he obtained the assistance of one of the principal Chinese officers on the Leaoutung borders , and thus overran the territory of his neighbors . Encouraged by his first successes , Haida proceeded to attack the chief of Goolo , who was married to a cousin of Noorhachu , and who at once appealed to Hootooala for assistance . The whole Manchu clan marched to his rescue , and it was on this occasion that Noorhachu had his first experience of war on a large scale . The Manchus presented such a bold front that there is every reason to believe that Haida and his Chinese allies would have failed to conquer Goolo by force , but they resorted to fraud , which proved only too successful . Haida succeeded in enticing the old chief Huen and his son , the father of Noorhachu , into a conference , when he murdered them and many of their companions . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid for by the incentive it gave Noorhachu to exact revenge for the brutal and cowardly murder of his father and grandfather . Haida constructed a fortified camp at Toolun , but he did not feel secure there against the open attacks of Noorhachu or the private plots he formed to gain possession of his person . Several times Haida fled from Toolun to Chinese territory , where he hoped to enjoy greater safety , until at last the Chinese became tired of giving him shelter and protecting one who could not support his own pretensions . Then , with strange inconstancy , they delivered him over into the hands of Noorhachu , who straightway killed him , thus carrying out the first portion of his vow to avenge the massacre at Goolo. @# Then Noorhachu turned all his attention and devoted all his energy to the realization of the project which Haida had conceived , the union of the Niuche clans ; but whereas Haida had looked to Chinese support and patronage for the attainment of his object , Noorhachu resolved to achieve success as an enemy of China and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measure was to carefully select a site for his capital on a plain well supplied with water , and then to fortify it by surrounding it with three walls . He then drew up simple regulations for the government of his people , and military rules imposing a severe discipline on his small army . The Chinese appear to have treated him with indifference , and they continued to pay him the sums of money and the honorary gifts which had been made to Haida . Several of the Niuche clans , won over by the success and reputation of Noorhachu , voluntarily associated themselves with him , and it was not until the year 1591 that the Manchu chief committed his first act of open aggression by invading the district of Yalookiang . That territory was soon overrun and annexed ; but it roused such a fear among the other Niuche chiefs , lest their fate should be the same , that seven of them combined , under Boojai , to overthrow the upstart who aspired to play the part of a dictator . They brought into the field a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own followers , a considerable contingent from the Mongols ; and as Noorhachu ' s army numbered only 4 , 000 men , it seemed as if he must certainly be overwhelmed . But , small as was his force , it enjoyed the incalculable advantage of discipline ; and seldom has the superiority of trained troops over raw levies been more conspicuously illustrated than by this encounter between warriors of the same race . This battle was fought at Goolo Hill , and resulted in the decisive victory of Noorhachu . Boojai and 4 , 000 of his men were killed , a large number of his followers were taken prisoners and enrolled in the ranks of the victor , and the spoil included many suits of mail and arms of offense which improved the state of Noorhachu ' s arsenal . Several of the districts which had been subject to these confederated princes passed into the hands of the conqueror , and he carried his authority northward up the Songari River over tribes who had never recognized any southern authority . These successes paved the way to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was reputed to be the most powerful of all the Niuche states ; and on this occasion it vindicated its reputation by repelling the attack of Noorhachu . Its success was not entirely due to its own strength , for the Chinese governor of Leaoutung , roused at last to the danger from Noorhachu , sent money and arms to assist the Yeho people in their defense. @# The significance of this repulse was diminished by other successes elsewhere , and Noorhachu devoted his main attention to disciplining the larger force he had acquired by his later conquests , and by raising its efficiency to the high point attained by the army with which he had gained his first triumphs . He also meditated a more daring and important enterprise than any struggle with his kinsfolk ; for he came to the conclusion that it was essential to destroy the Chinese power in Leaoutung before he should undertake any further enterprise in Manchuria . His army had now been raised to an effective strength of 40 , 000 men , and the Manchu bowman , with his formidable bow , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the arrow or spear , were as formidable warriors as then existed in the world . Confident in his military power , and thinking , no doubt , that a successful foreign enterprise was the best way to rally and confirm the allegiance of his race , Noorhachu invaded Leaoutung , and published a proclamation against the Chinese , which became known as the Seven Hates . Instead of forwarding this document to the Chinese Court he burned it in the presence of his army , so that Heaven itself might judge the justice of the cause between him and the Chinese. @# It was in the year 1618 that Noorhachu invaded Leaoutung , and so surprised were the Chinese at his audacity that they offered little or no resistance . The town of Fooshun was captured and made the headquarters of the Manchu prince . From this place he sent a list of his requirements to the governor of Leaoutung , and it is said that he offered , on the Chinese complying with his terms , to withdraw and desist from hostilities . But the Chinese did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his grievances with indifference and contempt , and they sent an army to drive him out of Leaoutung . The Chinese troops soon had a taste of the quality of the Manchu army . They were defeated in several encounters , and the best Chinese troops fled before the impetuous charge of the Manchu cavalry . Noorhachu then laid siege to the prefectural town of Tsingho , which he captured after a siege of some weeks , and where he massacred nearly 20 , 000 of the garrison and townspeople . He would have continued the campaign but that his followers demanded to be led back , stating that they feared for the safety of their homes at the hands of Yeho , still hostile and aggressive in their rear . The conquest of Leaoutung was therefore discontinued for the purpose of closing accounts with the last of the Niuche principalities ; but enough had been accomplished to whet the appetite of the Manchu leader for more , and to show him how easy it was to vanquish the Chinese . On his return to his capital , Hingking , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delayed by the necessity of resting his troops and of allowing many of them to return to their homes . This delay , no doubt , induced the Chinese to make a supreme effort to avert the overthrow of Yeho , who had proved so useful an ally , and accordingly the governor of Leaoutung advanced with 100 , 000 men into Manchuria . He sacrificed the advantage of superior numbers by dividing his army into four divisions , with very inadequate means of inter- communication . Noorhachu could only bring 60 , 000 men into the field ; but , apart from their high training , they represented a compact body subject to the direction of Noorhachu alone . The Manchu leader at once perceived the faulty disposition of the Chinese army , and he resolved to attack and overwhelm each corps in detail before it could receive aid from the others . The strongest Chinese corps was that operating most to the west , and marching from Fooshun on Hingking ; and Noorhachu perceived that if he could overthrow it the flank of the rest of the Chinese army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Chinese general in command of this corps was impetuous and anxious to distinguish himself . His courage might on another occasion have helped his country , but under the circumstances his very ardor served the purpose of Noorhachu . Tousong , such was his name , marched more rapidly than any of his comrades , and reached the Hwunho  --  the Tiber of the Manchus  --  behind which Noorhachu had , at a little distance , drawn up his army . Without pausing to reconnoiter , or to discover with what force he had to deal , Tousong threw himself across the river , and intrenched himself on Sarhoo Hill . His overconfidence was so extreme and fatuous that he weakened his army by sending a detachment to lay siege to the town of Jiefan . The Manchus had , however , well provided for the defense of that place , and while the Chinese detachment sent against it was being destroyed , Noorhachu attacked Tousong in his position on Sarhoo Hill with the whole of his army . The Chinese were overwhelmed , Tousong was slain , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the waters of the Hwunho , beneath the arrows and javelins of the pursuing Manchus. @# Then Noorhachu hastened to attack the second of the Chinese divisions under a capable officer named Malin , who selected a strong position with great care , and wished to stand on the defensive . His wings rested on two hills which he fortified , and he strengthened his center in the intervening valley with a triple line of wagons . If he had only remained in this position he might have succeeded in keeping Noorhachu at bay until he could have been joined by the two remaining Chinese corps ; but the impetuosity of his troops , or it may have been the artifice of the Manchu leader , drew him from his intrenchments . At first the Chinese seemed to have the best of the battle , but in a short time victory turned to the side of the Manchus , and Malin fled with the relics of his force back to Chinese territory . After these two successes Noorhachu proceeded to attack the third Chinese corps under Liuyen , who had acquired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had no better fortune than any of his colleagues , and his signal defeat completed the Manchu triumph over the Chinese army of invasion . The defeat of Liuyen was effected by a stratagem as much as by superior force . Noorhachu dressed some of his troops in the Chinese uniforms he had captured , and sent them among the Chinese , who received them as comrades until they discovered their mistake in the crisis of the battle . During this campaign it was computed that the total losses of the Chinese amounted to 310 general officers and 45 , 000 private soldiers . Among other immediate results of this success were the return of 20 , 000 Yeho troops to their homes and the defection of 5 , 000 Coreans , who joined Noorhachu . Like all great commanders , Noorhachu gave his enemies no time to recover from their misfortunes . He pursued Malin to Kaiyuen , which he captured , with so many prisoners that it took three days to count them . He invaded Yeho , which recognized his authority without a blow , and gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Niuche clans thus became united under his banner , and adopted the name of Manchu . He had succeeded in the great object of his life , the union of his race , and he had well avenged the death of his father and grandfather ; but his ambition was not satisfied with this success . It had rather grown with the widening horizon opened by the discomfiture of the Chinese , and with the sense of military superiority. @# Amid these national disasters the long reign of Wanleh closed in the year 1620 . That unhappy monarch lived long enough to see the establishment on his northern borders of the power which was to destroy his dynasty . The very last act of his reign was , whether by accident or good judgment , the most calculated to prevent the Manchus overrunning the State , and that was the selection of a capable general in the person of Hiung Tingbi . With the death of Wanleh the decadence of Ming power became clearly marked , and the only question that remained was whether it could be arrested before it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MANCHU CONQUEST OF CHINA @# Tingbi , with the wrecks of the Chinese armies , succeeded in doing more for the defense of his country than had been accomplished by any of his predecessors with undiminished resources . He built a chain of forts , he raised the garrison of Leaoutung to 180 , 000 men , and he spared no effort to place Leaouyang , the capital of that province , in a position to stand a protracted siege . If his counsels had been followed to the end , he might have succeeded in permanently arresting the flood of Manchu conquest ; but at the very moment when his plans promised to give assured success , he fell into disgrace at the capital , and his career was summarily ended by the executioner . The greatest compliment to his ability was that Noorhachu remained quiescent as long as he was on the frontier , but as soon as he was removed he at once resumed his aggression on Chinese soil. @# Meanwhile , Wanleh had been succeeded on the Chinese throne by his son , Chu Changlo , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and well- meaning prince , whose reign was unquestionably cut short by foul means . There is little doubt that he was poisoned by the mother of his half- brother , from a wish to secure the throne for her son ; but if so she never gained the object that inspired her crime , for the princes of the family met in secret conclave , and selected Kwangtsong ' s son a youth of sixteen , as his successor . The choice did not prove fortunate , as this prince became known as Tienki the Unhappy , whose reign witnessed the culmination of Ming misfortunes . One of his first acts was the removal of Tingbi from his command , and this error of judgment , aggravated by the ingratitude it implied to a faithful servant , fitly marked the commencement of a reign of incompetence and misfortune. @# In 1621 the Manchu war reopened with an attack on Moukden or Fanyang , which Noorhachu had marked out as his next object . The garrison was numerous , and might have made a good defense , for the walls were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of temerity , and , leaving his fortress , marched out to meet the Manchus in the open . The result was a decisive overthrow , and the victors entered Moukden at the heels of the vanquished . The Chinese still resisted , and a terrible slaughter ensued , but the Manchus retained their conquest . At this juncture the Chinese were offered the assistance of the Portuguese at Macao , who sent a small body of 200 men , armed with arquebuses and with several cannon , to Pekin ; but after some hesitation the Chinese , whether from pride or contempt of so small a force , declined to avail themselves of their service , and thus lost an auxiliary that might have turned the fortune of the war in their favor . The Portuguese were sent back to Macao , and , although the Chinese kept the cannon , and employed the Jesuit priests in casting others for them , nothing came of an incident which might have exercised a lasting influence not merely on the fortune of the war , but also on the relations between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recover Moukden ; but , although they took these guns with them , they met with no success , and Noorhachu made it the base of his plan of attack on Leaouyang , the capital of the province . The defense of this important town was intrusted to Yuen Yingtai , the court favorite and incompetent successor of Tingbi . That officer , unwarned by the past , and regardless of the experience of so many of his predecessors , weakened himself and invited defeat by attempting to oppose the Manchus in the open . He was defeated , losing some of his best soldiers , and compelled to shut himself up in the town with a disheartened garrison . The Manchus gained an entrance into the city . Then a terrible encounter took place . The garrison was massacred to a man , Yuen Yingtai , brave , if incapable , committed suicide , and those of the townspeople who wished to save their lives had to shave their heads in token of subjection . This is the first historical reference to a practice that is now universal throughout China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national characteristic . The badge of conquest has changed to a mark of national pride ; but it is strange to find that the Chinese themselves and the most patient inquirers among sinologues are unable to say what was the origin of the pig-tail . They can not tell us whether shaving the head was the national custom of the Manchus , or whether Noorhachu only conceived this happy idea of distinguishing those who surrendered to his power among the countless millions of the long-haired people of China . All that can be said of the origin of the pig-tail is that it was first enforced as a badge of subjugation by the Manchus at the siege of Leaouyang , and that thenceforward , until the whole of China was conquered , it was made the one condition of immunity from massacre. @# The capture of Leaouyang signified the surrender of the remaining places in Leaoutung , which became a Manchu possession , and Noorhachu , to celebrate his triumph , and also to facilitate his plans for the further humiliation of the Chinese , transferred his capital from Moukden to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local chief had raised a force of 30 , 000 men for service on the frontier in the wars with the Manchus , and the viceroy of the province not only declined to utilize their services , but dismissed them without reward or even recognition of their loyalty . These slighted and disbanded braves easily changed themselves into brigands , and as the government would not have them as supporters , they determined to make it feel their enmity , Chetsong Ming , the chief who had raised them , placed himself at their head , and attracted a large number of the inhabitants to his standard . The local garrisons were crushed , the viceroy killed , and general disorder prevailed among the people of what was the most fertile and prosperous province of the empire . Chetsong attempted to set up an administration , but he does not seem to have possessed the capacity or the knowledge to establish a regular government . While he headed the rebellious movement , a woman named Tsinleang , the hereditary chieftainess of a small district , placed herself at the head of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself , succeeded in recovering the principal cities and in driving Chetsong out of the province . She has been not inappropriately called by one of the missionary historians the Chinese Penthesilea . The success she met with in pacifying Szchuen after a two years ' struggle was not attained in other directions without a greater effort and at a still heavier cost . In Kweichow and Yunnan a rebel named Ganpangyen raised an insurrection on a large scale , and if his power had not been broken by the long siege of a strong fortress , obstinately defended by a valiant governor , there is no telling to what success he might not have attained . But his followers were disheartened by the delay in carrying this place , and they abandoned him as soon as they found that he could not command success . In Shantung another rising occurred ; but after two years ' disturbance the rebel leader was captured and executed . These internal disorders , produced by the corruption and inertness of the officials as much as by a prevalent sense of the embarrassment of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manchuria , and weakened its preparations against Noorhachu. @# For a time Noorhachu showed no disposition to cross the River Leaou , and confined his attention to consolidating his position in his new conquest . But it was clear that this lull would not long continue , and the Chinese emperor , Tienki , endeavored to meet the coming storm by once more intrusting the defense of the frontier to Tingbi . That general devised a simple and what might have proved an efficacious line of defense , but his colleague , with more powerful influence at court , would have none of it , and insisted on his own plan being adopted . Noorhachu divined that the councils of the Chinese were divided , and that Tingbi was hampered . He promptly took advantage of the divergence of opinion , and , crossing the frontier , drove the Chinese behind the Great Wall . Even that barrier would not have arrested his progress but for the stubborn resistance offered by the fortress of Ningyuen  --  a town about seventy miles northeast of Shanhaikwan , once of great importance , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When he reached that place he found that Tingbi had fallen into disgrace and been executed , not for devising his own plan of campaign , but for animadverting on that of his colleague in satirical terms . The Chinese had made every preparation for the resolute defense of Ningyuen , and when Noorhachu sat down before it , its resolute defender , Chungwan , defied him to do his worst , although all the Chinese troops had been compelled to retreat , and there was no hope of re-enforcement or rescue . At first Noorhachu did not conduct the siege of Ningyuen in person . It promised to be an affair of no great importance , and he intrusted it to his lieutenants , but he soon perceived that Chungwan was a resolute soldier , and that the possession of Ningyuen was essential to the realization of his future plans . Therefore , he collected all his forces and sat down before Ningyuen with the full determination to capture it at all costs . But the garrison was resolute , its commander capable , and on the walls were arranged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in person , both of which were repulsed , and it is said that this result was mainly due to the volleys of the European artillery . At last , Noorhachu was compelled to withdraw his troops , and although he obtained some successes in other parts of the country , he was so chagrined at this repulse that he fell ill and died some months later at Moukden , in September , 1626. @# Noorhachu was succeeded by his fourth son , the fourth Beira or Prince , known as Taitsong , who continued both his work and policy . Taitsong was as determined to humiliate the Mings as his father had been . He commenced his offensive measures by an attack on Corea , which he speedily reduced to such a pass that it accepted his authority and transferred its allegiance from the Mings to the Manchus . This was an important success , as it secured his eastern flank and deprived the Chinese of a useful ally in the Forbidden Kingdom . It encouraged Taitsong to think that the time was once more ripe for attacking Ningyuen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a large army , including the flower of his troops . Notwithstanding the energy of his attack , Chungwan , the former bold defender of the place , had again the satisfaction of seeing the Manchus repulsed , and compelled to admit that the ramparts of Ningyuen presented a serious if not insuperable obstacle to their progress . Almost at the very moment of this success the Emperor Tienki died , and was succeeded , in 1627 , by his younger brother , Tsongching , who was destined to be the last of the Ming rulers. @# The repulse of Taitsong before Ningyuen might have been fatal if he had not been a man of great ability and resource . The occasion called for some special effort , and Taitsong proved himself equal to it by a stroke of genius that showed he was the worthy inheritor of the mission of Noorhachu . Without taking anybody into his confidence he ordered his army and his allies , the Kortsin Mongols , to assemble in the country west of Ningyuen , and when he had thus collected over a hundred thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marching direct on Pekin . At this juncture Taitsong divided his army into eight banners , which still remain the national divisions of the Manchu race . The Manchus seem to have been a little alarmed by the boldness of Taitsong ' s scheme , and they might have hesitated to follow him if he had given them any time for reflection , but his plans were not fully known until his forces were through the Dangan Pass on the march to the capital . The Chinese , relying altogether on Ningyuen as a defense , had made no preparation to hold their ground on this side , and Taitsong encountered no opposition until he reached Kichow . Then Chungwan , realizing that he had been outmaneuvered , and that the defenses of Ningyuen had been turned , hastened back by forced marches to defend Pekin . Owing to his road being the better of the two he gained the capital in time , and succeeded in throwing himself and his troops into it in order to defend it against the assault of the Manchus . After Taitsong sat down before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chungwan , whose disgrace would be equivalent to a great victory . The method is not to be approved on general grounds , but Taitsong conceived that he was justified in bribing persons in Pekin to discredit Chungwan and compass his ruin . The emperor was persuaded that Chungwan was too powerful a subject to be absolutely loyal , and it was asserted that he was in communication with the enemy . Chungwan , who had been so long the buttress of the kingdom , was secretly arrested and thrown into a prison from which he never issued . The disappearance of Chungwan was as valuable to Taitsong as a great victory , and he made his final preparations for assaulting Pekin ; but either the want of supplies or the occurrence of some disturbance in his rear prevented the execution of his plan . He drew off his forces and retired behind the Great Wall at the very moment when Pekin seemed at his mercy. @# During four years of more or less tranquillity Taitsong confined his attention to political designs , and to training a corps of artillery , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of China . Instead of availing themselves of the lull thus afforded to improve their position , the Chinese ministers seemed to believe that the danger from the Manchus had passed away , and they treated all the communications from Taitsong with imprudent and unnecessary disdain . Their attention was also distracted by many internal troubles , produced by their own folly , as well as by the perils of the time. @# Taitsong , in 1634 , resumed his operations in China , and on this occasion he invaded the province of Shansi , at the head of an army composed largely of Mongols as well as of Manchus . Although the people of Shansi had not had any practical experience of Manchu prowess , and notwithstanding that their frontier was exceedingly strong by nature , Taitsong met with little or no resistance from either the local garrisons or the people themselves . One Chinese governor , it is said , ventured to publish a boastful report of an imaginary victory over the Manchus , and to send a copy of it to Pekin . Taitsong , however , intercepted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenge , matching 1 , 000 of his men against 10 , 000 of the Chinese . That the offer was not accepted is the best proof of the superiority of the Manchu army. @# It was at the close of this successful campaign in Shansi , that Taitsong , in the year 1635 , assumed , for the first time among any of the Manchu rulers , the style of Emperor of China . Events had long been moving in this direction , but an accident is said to have determined Taitsong to take this final measure . The jade seal of the old Mongol rulers was suddenly discovered , and placed in the hands of Taitsong . When the Mongols heard of this , forty-nine of their chiefs hastened to tender their allegiance to Taitsong and the only condition made was that the King of Corea should be compelled to do so likewise . Taitsong , nothing loth , at once sent off letters to the Corean court announcing the adhesion of the Mongols , and calling upon the king of that state to recognize his supremacy . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these letters and declined to open them , thus hoping to get out of his difficulty without offending his old friends the Chinese . But Taitsong was not to be put off in this fashion . He sent an army to inflict chastisement on his neighbor , and its mission was successfully discharged . The king and his family were taken prisoners , although they had fled to the island of Gangwa for safety , and Corea became a Manchu possession . The last years of Taitsong ' s life were spent in conducting repeated expeditions into the provinces of Shansi and Pechihli , but the strength of the fortresses of Ningyuen and Shanhaikwan on the Great Wall effectually prevented his renewing his attempt on Pekin . These two places with the minor forts of Kingchow and Songshan formed a quadrilateral that effectually secured Pekin on its northern side , and being intrusted to the defense of Wou Sankwei , a general of great capacity , of whom much more will be heard , all Taitsong ' s ability and resources were taxed to overcome those obstacles to his progress south @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and at the end of several campaigns , in taking Kingchow and Songshan , but these were his last successes , for in the year 1643 he was seized with a fatal illness at Moukden , which terminated his career at the comparatively early age of fifty-two . Taitsong ' s premature death , due , in all probability , to the incompetence of his physicians , cut short a career that had not reached its prime , and retarded the conquest of China , for the supreme authority among the Manchus then passed from a skillful and experienced ruler into the hands of a child. @# The possession of a well-trained army , the production of two great leaders of admitted superiority , and forty years of almost continuously successful war , had not availed to bring the authority of the Manchus in any permanent form south of the Great Wall . The barrier of Tsin Che Hwangti still kept out the most formidable adversary who had ever borne down upon it , and the independence of China seemed far removed from serious jeopardy . At this juncture events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divisions of the Chinese proved more serious and entailed a more rapid collapse than all the efforts of the Manchus. @# The arch rebel Li Tseching , who proved more formidable to the Ming ruler than his Manchu opponent , was the son of a peasant in the province of Shansi . At an early age he attached himself to the profession of arms , and became well known as a skillful archer and horseman . In 1629 , he first appears on the scene as member of a band of robbers , who were , however , destroyed by a rare display of energy on the part of one of the emperor ' s lieutenants . Li was one of the few who were fortunate enough to escape with their lives and liberty . He soon gathered round him another band , and under his successful and courageous leading it shortly acquired the size of an army . One reason of his success was his forming an alliance with the Mohammedan settlers in Kansuh , who were already known as Tungani or " Colonists . " But the principal cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to terms with the imperial authorities whenever they became too strong for him , and he often purchased a truce when , if the officials had pushed home their advantage , he must have been destroyed . His power thus grew to a high point , while that of other robber chiefs only waxed to wane and disappear ; and about the year 1640 , when it was said that his followers numbered half a million of men , he began to think seriously of displacing the Ming and placing himself on the throne of China . With this object in view he laid siege to the town of Honan , the capital of the province of the same name . At first the resolution of the governor baffled his attempt , but treachery succeeded when force failed . A traitor opened a gate for a sum of money which he was never paid , and Li ' s army burst into the city . The garrison was put to the sword , and horrible outrages were perpetrated on the townspeople . From Honan Li marched on Kaifong , which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the necessary engines to attack a place of any strength , and Kaifong was reputed to be the strongest fortress in China . He was obliged to beat a hasty retreat , pursued by an army that the imperial authorities had hurriedly collected . There is reason to think his retreat was a skillful movement to the rear in order to draw the emperor ' s troops after him . Certain it is that they pursued him in four separate corps , and that he turned upon them and beat them one after the other . When he had vanquished these armies in four separate encounters he again laid siege to Kaifong , and it was thought that he would have taken it , when Li was wounded by an arrow , and called off his troops in consequence . Several times afterward he resumed the attempt , but with no better fortune , until an accident accomplished what all his power had failed to do . The governor had among other precautions flooded the moat from the Hoangho , and this extra barrier of defense had undoubtedly done much toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fatal to the besieged , for the Hoangho , at all times capricious in its movements , and the source of as much trouble as benefit to the provinces it waters , rose suddenly to the dimensions of a flood , and overflowing its banks spread over the country . Many of Li ' s soldiers were drowned , and his camp was flooded , but the most serious loss befell the Imperialists in Kaifong . The waters of the river swept away the walls and flooded the town . Thousands perished at the time , and those who attempted to escape were cut down by the rebels outside . Kaifong itself was destroyed and has never recovered its ancient importance , being now a town of only the third or fourth rank . This great success established the reputation of Li Tseching on a firm basis , and constituted him one of the arbiters of his country ' s destiny . He found himself master of one-third of the state ; proclaimed himself Emperor of China , under the style of Yongchang , and gave his dynasty the name of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ming government , Li invaded Shansi , which he reduced to subjection with little difficulty or bloodshed . An officer , named Likintai , was sent to organize some measures of defense , but , on arrival , he found the province in the hands of the rebel , and he had no choice save to beat a discreet and rapid retreat . The success of Li continued unchecked . Important places like Taiyuen and Taitong surrendered to him after a merely nominal resistance , and when they fell there was no further impediment in the way of his marching on Pekin. @# No preparations had been made to defend Pekin . The defenses were weak , the garrison insufficient , as all the best troops were on the frontier , and the citizens disposed to come to terms with the assailant rather than to die in the breach for their sovereign . When Li pitched his tent outside the western gate of the capital , and sent a haughty demand to the emperor to abdicate his throne , he was master of the situation ; but Tsongching , ignorant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a rebel . His indignation was turned to despair when he learned that the troops had abandoned his cause , that the people were crying out for Li Tseching , and that that leader ' s followers were rapidly approaching his palace . Tsongching strangled himself with his girdle , but only one officer was found devoted enough to share his fate . Although Tsongching had some nominal successors , he was , strictly speaking , the last of the Ming emperors , and with him the great dynasty founded by Hongwou came to an end . The many disasters that preceded its fall rendered the loss of the imperial station less of a blow to the individual , and the last of the Ming rulers seems to have even experienced relief on reaching the term of his anxieties . The episode of the faithful officer , Li Kweiching , concludes the dramatic events accompanying the capture of Pekin and the fall of the dynasty . After the death of his sovereign he attempted to defend the capital ; but overpowered by numbers he surrendered to the victor , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kweiching accepted the offer on the stipulation that he should be allowed to give the Emperor Tsongching honorable burial , and that the surviving members of the Ming family should be spared . These conditions , so creditable to Li Kweiching , were granted ; but , at the funeral of his late sovereign , grief or a spirit of duty so overcame him that he committed suicide on the grave of Tsongching . Li Tseching , who had counted on valuable assistance from this officer , became furious at this occurrence . He plundered and destroyed the ancestral temple of the Mings , and he caused every member of the imperial family on whom he could lay hands to be executed . Thus terminated the events at Pekin in the absolute and complete triumph of the rebel Li Tseching , and the panic produced by his success and severity blinded observers to the hollowness of his power , and to the want of solidity in his administration . Yet it seemed for a time as if he were left the virtual master of China. @# While the Ming power was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remained the large and well-trained Ming army in garrison on the Manchu frontier , under command of the able general , Wou Sankwei . At the eleventh hour the Emperor Tsonching had sent a message to Wou Sankwei , begging him to come in all haste to save the capital ; and that general , evacuating Ningyuen , and leaving a small garrison at Shanhaikwan , had begun his march for Pekin , when he learned that it had fallen and that the Ming dynasty had ceased to be . Placed in this dilemma , between the advancing Manchus , who immediately occupied Ningyuen on his evacuation of it , and the large rebel force in possession of Pekin , Wou Sankwei had no choice between coming to terms with one or other of them . Li Tseching offered him liberal rewards and a high command , but in vain , for Wou Sankwei decided that it would be better to invite the Manchus to enter the country , and to assist them to conquer it . There can be no doubt that this course was both the wiser and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a successful brigand on a large scale ; whereas the Manchu government was a respectable one , was well organized , and aspired to revive the best traditions of the Chinese . Having come to a prompt decision , Wou Sankwei lost no time in promptly carrying it out . He wrote a letter to the Manchus , asking them to send an army to co-operate with his in driving Li Tseching out of Pekin ; and the Manchus , at once realizing that the moment had arrived for conquering China , acquiesced promptly in his plans , sent forward their advanced corps , and ordered a levee en masse of the nation for the conquest of China . Assured of his rear , and also of speedy re-enforcement , Wou Sankwei did not delay a day in marching on Pekin . Li Tseching sent out a portion of his army to oppose the advance of Wou Sankwei ; but the officer ' s instructions were rather to negotiate than to fight , for to the last Li Tseching expected that Wou Sankwei would come over to his side . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his position ; and his fears were increased by his superstition , for when , on entering Pekin , he passed under a gate above which was written the character " joong " ( middle ) , he exclaimed , drawing his bow at the same time , " If I hit this joong in the middle , it is a sign I have gained the whole empire , as the empire is joong , the middle kingdom . " His arrow missed its mark . The apprehensions of Li Tseching were soon confirmed , for Wou Sankwei defeated the first army he had sent out with a loss of 20 , 000 men . Li does not seem to have known of the alliance between that officer and the Manchus , for he marched at the head of 60 , 000 men to encounter him . He took with him the aged father of Wou Sankwei and two Ming princes , who had survived the massacre of their family , with a view to appealing to the affection and loyalty of that commander ; but these devices proved vain. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a strong position near the scene of his recent victory ; his front seems to have been protected by the river Zanho , and he calmly awaited the attack of Li Tseching , whose army far outnumbered his . Up to this point Wou Sankwei had not been joined by any of the Manchus , but a body was known to be approaching , and he was anxious to put off the battle until they arrived . For the same reason Li Tseching was as anxious to begin the attack , and , notwithstanding the strength of Wou Sankwei ' s position , he ordered his troops to engage without delay . Adopting the orthodox Chinese mode of attack of forming his army in a crescent , so that the extreme wings should overlap and gradually encompass those of the enemy , Li trusted to his numerical superiority to give him the victory . At one moment it seemed as if his expectation would be justified ; for , bravely as Wou Sankwei and his army fought , the weight of numbers was telling its inevitable tale when a Manchu corps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , changed the fortune of the day and put the army of Li Tseching to the rout . Thirty thousand men are said to have fallen on the field , and Li himself escaped from the carnage with only a few hundred horsemen. @# After this Li met with disaster after disaster . He was driven out of Shansi into Honan , and from Honan into Shensi . Wou Sankwei took Tunkwan without firing a shot , and when Li attempted to defend Singan he found that his soldiers would not obey his orders , and wished only to come to terms with Wou Sankwei . Expelled from the last of his towns he took refuge in the hills , but the necessity of obtaining provisions compelled him now and then to descend into the plains , and on one of these occasions he was surprised in a village and killed . His head was placed in triumph over the nearest prefecture , and thus ended the most remarkable career of a princely robber chieftain to be found in Chinese annals . At one time it seemed as if Li Tseching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meteor-like career ended not less suddenly than his rise to supreme power was rapid . Extraordinary as was his success , Wou Sankwei had rightly gauged its nature when he declared that it had no solid basis. @# The overthrow of Li Tseching paved the way for a fresh difficulty . It had been achieved to a large extent by the military genius of Wou Sankwei and by the exertions of his Chinese army . That officer had invited the Manchus into the country , but when victory was achieved he showed some anxiety for their departure . This was no part of the compact , nor did it coincide with the ambition of the Manchus . They determined to retain the territory they had conquered , at the same time that they endeavored to propitiate Wou Sankwei and to retain the command of his useful services . He was given the high sounding title of Ping-si Wang , or Prince Pacifier of the West , and many other honors . Gratified by these rewards and unable to discover any person who could govern China , Wou Sankwei gradually reconciled himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most powerful lieutenant of the young Manchu ruler , Chuntche , the son of Taitsong , who , after the fall of Li Tseching , removed his capital to Pekin , and assumed the style and ceremony of a Chinese emperor . The active administration was intrusted to Prince Dorgun , brother of Taitsong , who now became known as Ama Wang , the Father Prince , and who acted as regent during the long minority of his nephew . The new dynasty was inaugurated at Pekin with a grand ceremony and court. @# After this formal and solemn assumption of the governing power in China by the young Manchu prince , the activity of the Manchus increased , and several armies were sent south to subject the provinces , and to bring the whole Chinese race under his authority . For some time no serious opposition was encountered , as the disruption of Li ' s forces entailed the surrender of all the territory north of the Hoangho . But at Nankin , and in the provinces south of the Yangtsekiang , an attempt had been made , and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the members of the prolific Ming family . Fou Wang , a grandson of Wanleh , was placed on the Dragon Throne of Southern China in this hope , but his character did not justify the faith reposed in him . He thought nothing of the serious responsibility he had accepted , but showed that he regarded his high station merely as an opportunity for gratifying his own pleasures . There is little or no doubt that if he had shown himself worthy of his station he might have rallied to his side the mass of the Chinese nation , and Wou Sankwei , who had shown some signs of chafing at Manchu authority , might have been won back by a capable and sympathetic sovereign . But notwithstanding the ability of Fou Wang ' s minister , Shu Kofa , who strove to repair the errors of his master , the new Ming power at Nankin did not prosper . Wou Sankwei , cautious not to commit himself , rejected the patent of a duke and the money gifts sent him by Shu Kofa , while Ama Wang , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by making him the most lavish promises of reward . But that minister proved as true to his sovereign as Wou Sankwei did to the Manchu . The result of the long correspondence between them was nil , but it showed the leaders of the Manchus in very favorable colors , as wishing to avert the horrors of war , and to simplify the surrender of provinces which could not be held against them . When Ama Wang discovered that there was no hope of gaining over Shu Kofa , and thus paving his way to the disintegration of the Nankin power , he decided to prosecute the war against the surviving Ming administration with the greatest activity. @# While these preparations were being made to extend the Manchu conquest over Central China , all was confusion at Nankin . Jealousies between the commanders , none of whom possessed much merit or experience , bickerings among the ministers , apathy on the part of the ruler , and bitter disappointment and disgust in the ranks of the people , all combined to precipitate the overthrow of the ephemeral throne that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patiently to allow these causes of disintegration time to develop their full force , and to contribute to the ruin of the Mings , but in the winter of 1644-45 he decided that the right moment to strike had come . Shu Kofa made some effort to oppose the Manchu armies , and even assumed the command in person , although he was only a civilian , but his troops had no heart to oppose the Manchus , and the devices to which he resorted to make his military power appear more formidable were both puerile and ineffective . Yet one passage may be quoted to his credit if it gave his opponent an advantage . It is affirmed on good authority that he could have obtained a material advantage if he would only have flooded the country , but he " refused to do so , on the ground that more civilians would perish than Manchus , and he said , ' First the people , next the dynasty . ' " The sentiment was a noble one , but it was too severe a crisis to admit of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shu Kofa , soon realizing that he was not qualified to play the part of a great soldier , resolved to end his existence . He took shelter with a small force in the town of Yangchow , and when he heard that the Manchus were entering the gate , he and his officers committed suicide . The Chinese lamented and were crushed by his death . In him they saw the last of their great men , and , no doubt , they credited him with a higher capacity even than he possessed . Only a military genius of the first rank could have saved the Mings , and Shu Kofa was nothing more than a conscientious and capable civil mandarin , ignorant of war . His fortitude could only be measured by his indifference to life , and by his resolve to anticipate the fall of his sovereign as soon as he saw it to be inevitable. @# Fou Wang speedily followed the fate of his faithful minister ; for , when the Manchus marched on Nankin , he abandoned his capital , and sought safety in flight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms for himself with the conqueror , undertook his capture , and coming up with him when on the point of entering a junk to put to sea , Fou Wang had no alternative left between an ignominious surrender and suicide . He chose the latter course , and throwing himself into the river was drowned , thus ending his own career , and the Ming dynasty in its southern capital of Nankin. @# Meantime dissension further weakened the already discouraged Chinese forces . The pirate Ching Chelong , who was the mainstay of the Ming cause , cherished the hope that he might place his own family on the throne , and he endeavored to induce the Ming prince to recognize his son , Koshinga , as his heir . Low as he had fallen , it is to the credit of this prince that he refused to sign away the birth-right of his family . Ching was bitterly chagrined at this refusal , and after detaching his forces from the other Chinese he at last came to the resolution to throw in his lot with the Manchus . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have had no intention of complying with them , so far at least as allowing him to retain his liberty . For they sent him off to Pekin , where he was kept in honorable confinement , notwithstanding his protests and promises , and the defiant threats of his son Koshinga . In preserving his life he was more fortunate than the members of the Ming family , who were hunted down in a remorseless manner and executed with all their relations on capture . The only place that offered any resistance to the Manchus was the town of Kanchow , on the Kan River , in Kiangsi . The garrison defended themselves with desperate valor during two months , and a council of war was held amid much anxiety , to consider whether the siege should be abandoned . Bold counsels prevailed . The Manchus returned to the attack , and had the satisfaction of carrying the town by assault , when the garrison were put to the sword. @# The relics of the Chinese armies gathered for a final stand in the city of Canton , but unfortunately for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One Ming prince proclaimed himself Emperor at Canton , and another in the adjoining province of Kwangsi . Although the Manchus were gathering their forces to overwhelm the Chinese in their last retreat , they could not lay aside their divisions and petty ambitions in order to combine against the national enemy , but must needs assail one another to decide which should have the empty title of Ming emperor . The Manchus had the satisfaction of seeing the two rivals break their strength against each other , and then they advanced to crush the victor at Canton . Strong as the place was said to be , it offered no serious resistance , and the great commercial city of the south passed into the hands of the race who had subdued the whole country from Pekin to the Tonquin frontier . At this moment the fortune of the Manchus underwent a sudden and inexplicable change . Two repulses before a fortress southwest of Canton , and the disaffection of a large part of their Chinese auxiliaries , who clamored for their pay , seem to have broken the strength of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drove the Tartars out of Canton and the southern provinces , but it soon broke its force , and the Manchus , returning with fresh troops , speedily recovered all they had lost , and by placing stronger garrisons in the places they occupied consolidated their hold on Southern China . Although the struggle between the Manchus and their new subjects was far from concluded , the conquest of China as such may be said to have reached its end at this stage . How a small Tartar tribe succeeded after fifty years of war in imposing its yoke on the skeptical , freedom-loving , and intensely national millions of China will always remain one of the enigmas of history. @# @# CHAPTER X @# THE FIRST MANCHU RULER @# While the Manchu generals and armies were establishing their power in Southern China the young Emperor Chuntche , under the direction of his prudent uncle , the regent Ama Wang , was setting up at Pekin the central power of a ruling dynasty . In doing so little or no opposition was experienced at the hands of the Chinese , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and this acquiescence on the part of the Chinese people in their authority no doubt induced the Manchu leaders to adopt a far more conciliatory and lenient policy toward the Chinese than would otherwise have been the case . Ama Wang gave special orders that the lives and property of all who surrendered to his lieutenants should be scrupulously respected . This moderation was only departed from in the case of some rebels in Shensi , who , after accepting , repudiated the Manchu authority , and laid close siege to the chief town of Singan , which held a garrison of only 3 , 000 Manchus . The commandant wished to make his position secure by massacring the Chinese of the town , but he was deterred from taking this extreme step by the representations of a Chinese officer , who , binding himself for the good faith of his countrymen , induced him to enroll them in the ranks of the garrison . They proved faithful and rendered excellent service in the siege ; and when a relieving Manchu army came from Pekin the rebels were quickly scattered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @# In the province of Szchuen a Chinese leader proclaimed himself Si Wang , or King of the West . He was execrated by those who were nominally his subjects . Among the most heinous of his crimes was his invitation to literary men to come to his capital for employment , and when they had assembled to the number of 30 , 000 , to order them to be massacred . He dealt in a similar manner with 3 , 000 of his courtiers , because one of them happened to omit a portion of his full titles . His excesses culminated in the massacre of Chentu , when 600 , 000 innocent persons are said to have perished . Even allowing for the Eastern exaggeration of numbers , the crimes of this inhuman monster have rarely , if ever , been surpassed . His rage or appetite for destruction was not appeased by human sacrifices . He made equal war on the objects of nature and the works of man . He destroyed cities , leveled forests , and overthrew all the public monuments that embellished his province . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Manchu army had crossed the frontier , but he resolved to crown his inhuman career by a deed unparalleled in the records of history , and , what is more extraordinary , he succeeded in inducing his followers to execute his commands . His project was to massacre all the women in attendance on his army. @# When the assembly took place Si Wang slew his wives coram populo , and his followers , seized with an extreme frenzy , followed his example . It is said that as many as 400 , 000 women were slain that day , and Si Wang , intoxicated by his success in inducing his followers to execute his inhuman behests , believed that he had nothing to fear at the hands of the Manchus . But he was soon undeceived , for in one of the earliest affairs at the outposts he was killed by an arrow . His power at once crumbled away , and Szchuen passed under the authority of the Manchus . The conquest of Szchuen paved the way for the recovery of the position that had been lost in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city of Canton . Outside Canton the Manchus carried everything before them , and that city itself at last was captured , after what passed for a stubborn resistance . Canton was given over to pillage. @# At this moment of success Ama Wang , the wise regent , died , and Chuntche assumed the reins of government . He at once devoted his attention to administrative reforms . Corruption had begun to sway the public examinations , and Chuntche issued a special edict , enjoining the examiners to give fair awards and to maintain the purity of the service . But several examiners had to be executed and others banished beyond the Wall before matters were placed on a satisfactory basis . He also adopted the astronomical system in force in Europe , and he appointed the priest Adam Schaal head of the Mathematical Board at Pekin . But his most important work was the institution of the Grand Council , which still exists , and which is the supreme power under the emperor in the country . It is composed of only four members  --  two Manchus and two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the emperor whenever they may demand it . As this act gave the Chinese an equal place with the Manchus in the highest body of the empire it was exceedingly welcome , and explains , among other causes , the popularity and stability of the Manchu dynasty . When allotting Chuntche his place among the founders of Manchu greatness , allowance must be made for this wise and far-reaching measure. @# An interesting event in the reign of Chuntche was the arrival at Pekin of more than one embassy from European States . The Dutch and the Russians can equally claim the honor of having had an envoy resident in the Chinese capital during the year 1656. @# In 1661 the health of Chuntche became so bad that it was evident to his courtiers that his end was drawing near , although he was little more than thirty years of age . On his deathbed he selected as his successor the second of his sons , who afterward became famous as the Emperor Kanghi . Kanghi assumed the personal direction of affairs when only fourteen years of age . Such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of a youth , and its complete success reflected still further credit upon him. @# The interest of the period passes from the scenes at court to the camp of Wou Sankwei , who , twenty years earlier , had introduced the Manchus into China . During the Manchu campaign in Southern China he had kept peace on the western frontier , gradually extending his authority from Shensi into Szchuen and thence over Yunnan . When a Ming prince , Kwei Wang , who had fled into Burmah , returned with the support of the king of that country to make another bid for the throne , he found himself confronted by all the power and resources of Wou Sankwei , who was still as loyal a servant of the Manchu emperor as when he carried his ensigns against Li Tseching . Kwei Wang does not appear to have expected opposition from Wou Sankwei , and in the first encounter he was overthrown and taken prisoner . The conqueror , who was already under suspicion at the Manchu court , and whom every Chinese rebel persisted in regarding as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treat these important prisoners . Kwei Wang and his son  --  the last of the Mings  --  were eventually led forth to execution , although it should be stated that a less authentic report affirms they were allowed to strangle themselves . Having made use of Wou Sankwei , and obtained , as they thought , the full value of his services , the Manchus sought to treat him with indifference and to throw him into the shade . But the splendor of his work was such that they had to confer on him the title of Prince , and to make him viceroy of Yunnan and the adjacent territories . He exerted such an extraordinary influence over the Chinese subjects that they speedily settled down under his authority ; revenue and trade increased , and the Manchu authority was maintained without a Tartar garrison , for Wou Sankwei ' s army was composed exclusively of Chinese , and its nucleus was formed by his old garrison of Ningyuen and Shanhaikwan . There is no certain reason for saying that Wou Sankwei nursed any scheme of personal aggrandizement , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make his authority become gradually independent of Manchu control . For a time the Manchu government suppressed its apprehensions on account of this powerful satrap , by the argument that in a few years his death in the course of nature must relieve it from this peril , but Wou Sankwei lived on and showed no signs of paying the common debt of humanity . Then it seemed to Kanghi that Wou Sankwei was gradually establishing the solid foundation of a formidable and independent power . The Manchu generals and ministers had always been jealous of the greater fame of Wou Sankwei . When they saw that Kanghi wanted an excuse to fall foul of him , they carried every tale of alleged self-assertion on the part of the Chinese viceroy to the imperial ears , and represented that his power dwarfed the dignity of the Manchu throne and threatened its stability. @# At last Kanghi resolved to take some decisive step to bring the question to a climax , and he accordingly sent Wou Sankwei an invitation to visit him at Pekin . Wou Sankwei excused himself from going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that his only wish was to end his days in peace . He also deputed his son to tender his allegiance to the emperor and to perform the Kotao in his name . But Kanghi was not to be put off in this way , and he sent two trusted officials to Wou Sankwei to represent that he must comply with the exact terms of his command , and to point out the grave consequences of his refusing . Wou Sankwei cast off his allegiance to the Manchus , and entered upon a war which aimed at the subversion of their authority . Such was the reputation of this great commander , to whose ability and military prowess the Manchus unquestionably were indebted for their conquest of the empire , that a large part of Southern China at once admitted his authority , and from Szchuen to the warlike province of Hunan his lieutenants were able to collect all the fighting resources of the state , and to array the levies of those provinces in the field for the approaching contest with Kanghi. @# While Wou Sankwei was making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pekin had devised an ingenious and daring plot for the massacre of the Manchus and the destruction of the dynasty . He engaged in his scheme the large body of Chinese slaves who had been placed in servitude under their Tartar conquerors , and these , incited by the hope of liberty , proved very ready tools to his designs . They bound themselves together by a solemn oath to be true to one another , and all the preparations were made to massacre the Manchus on the occasion of the New Year ' s Festival . This is the grand religious and social ceremony of the Chinese . It takes place on the first day of the first moon , which falls in our month of February . All business is stopped , the tribunals are closed for ten days , and a state of high festival resembling the Carnival prevails . The conspirators resolved to take advantage of this public holiday , and of the excitement accompanying it , to carry out their scheme , and the Manchus appear to have been in total ignorance until the eleventh hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conspiracy bears a close resemblance to that of the Gunpowder Plot . A Chinese slave , wishing to save his master , gave him notice of the danger , and this Manchu officer at once informed Kanghi of the conspiracy . The son of Wou Sankwei and the other conspirators were immediately arrested and executed without delay . The Manchus thus escaped by the merest accident from a danger which threatened them with annihilation , and Kanghi , having succeeded in getting rid of the son , concentrated his power and attention on the more difficult task of grappling with the father. @# But the power and reputation of Wou Sankwei were so formidable that Kanghi resolved to proceed with great caution , and the emperor began his measures of offense by issuing an edict ordering the disbandment of all the native armies maintained by the Chinese viceroys , besides Wou Sankwei . The object of this edict was to make all the governors of Chinese race show their hands , and Kanghi learned the full measure of the hostility he had to cope with by every governor from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throwing in their lot with Wou Sankwei . The piratical confederacy of Formosa , where Ching , the son of Koshinga , had succeeded to his authority , also joined in with what may be called the national party , but its alliance proved of little value , as Ching , at an early period , took umbrage at his reception by a Chinese official , and returned to his island home . But the most formidable danger to the young Manchu ruler came from an unexpected quarter . The Mongols , seeing his embarrassment , and believing that the hours of the dynasty were numbered , resolved to take advantage of the occasion to push their claims . Satchar , chief of one of the Banners , issued a proclamation , calling his race to his side , and declaring his intention to invade China at the head of 100 , 000 men . It seemed hardly possible for Kanghi to extricate himself from his many dangers . With great quickness of perception Kanghi saw that the most pressing danger was that from the Mongols , and he sent the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mongol clans could have gathered to his assistance . The Manchu cavalry , by a rapid march , surprised Satchar in his camp and carried him and his family off as prisoners to Pekin . The capture of their chief discouraged the Mongols and interrupted their plans for invading China . Kanghi thus obtained a respite from what seemed his greatest peril . Then he turned his attention to dealing with Wou Sankwei , and the first effort of his armies resulted in the recovery of Fuhkien , where the governor and Ching had reduced themselves to a state of exhaustion by a contest inspired by personal jealousy not patriotism . From Fuhkien his successful lieutenants passed into Kwantung , and the Chinese , seeing that the Manchus were not sunk as low as had been thought , abandoned all resistance , and again recognized the Tartar authority . The Manchus did not dare to punish the rebels except in rare instances , and , therefore , the recovery of Canton was unaccompanied by any scenes of blood . But a garrison of Manchus was placed in each town of importance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a walled town , or " Tartar city , " was built within each city for the accommodation and security of the dominant race. @# But notwithstanding these successes Kanghi made little or no progress against the main force of Wou Sankwei , whose supremacy was undisputed throughout the whole of southwest China . It was not until 1677 that Kanghi ventured to move his armies against Wou Sankwei in person . Although he obtained no signal success in the field , the divisions among the Chinese commanders were such that he had the satisfaction of compelling them to evacuate Hunan , and when Wou Sankwei took his first step backward the sun of his fortunes began to set . Calamity rapidly followed calamity . Wou Sankwei had not known the meaning of defeat in his long career of fifty years , but now , in his old age , he saw his affairs in inextricable confusion . His adherents deserted him , many rebel officers sought to come to terms with the Manchus , and Kanghi ' s armies gradually converged on Wou Sankwei from the east and the north @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a stand in Yunnan . He certainly succeeded in prolonging the struggle down to the year 1679 , when his death put a sudden end to the contest , and relieved Kanghi from much anxiety ; for although the success of the Manchus was no longer uncertain , the military skill of the old Chinese warrior might have indefinitely prolonged the war . Wou Sankwei was one of the most conspicuous and attractive figures to be met with in the long course of Chinese history , and his career covered one of the most critical periods in the modern existence of that empire . From the time of his first distinguishing himself in the defense of Ningyuen until he died , half a century later , as Prince of Yunnan , he occupied the very foremost place in the minds of his fellow-countrymen . The part he had taken , first in keeping out the Manchus , and then in introducing them into the state , reflected equal credit on his ability and his patriotism . In requesting the Manchus to crush the robber Li and to take the throne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was actuated by the purest motives . There was only a choice of evils , and he selected that which seemed the less . He gave the empire to a foreign ruler of intelligence , but he saved it from an unscrupulous robber . He played the part of king-maker to the family of Noorhachu , and the magnitude of their obligations to him could not be denied . They were not as grateful as he may have expected , and they looked askance at his military power and influence over his countrymen . Probably he felt that he had not been well treated , and chagrin undoubtedly induced him to reject Kanghi ' s request to proceed to Pekin . If he had only acceeded to that arrangement he would have left a name for conspicuous loyalty and political consistency in the service of the great race , which he had been mainly instrumental in placing over China . But even as events turned out he was one of the most remarkable personages the Chinese race ever produced , and his military career shows that they are capable of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wou Sankwei signified the overthrow of the Chinese uprising which had threatened to extinguish the still growing power of the Manchu under its youthful Emperor Kanghi . Wou Shufan , the grandson of that prince , endeavored to carry on the task of holding Yunnan as an independent territory , but by the year 1681 his possessions were reduced to the town of Yunnanfoo , where he was closely besieged by the Manchu forces . Although the Chinese fought valiantly , they were soon reduced to extremities , and the Manchus carried the place by storm . The garrison were massacred to the last man , and Wou Shufan only avoided a worse fate by committing suicide . The Manchus , not satisfied with his death , sent his head to Pekin to be placed on its principal gate in triumph , and the body of Wou Sankwei himself was exhumed so that his ashes might be scattered in each of the eighteen provinces of China as a warning to traitors . Having crushed their most redoubtable antagonist , the Manchus resorted to more severe measures against those who had surrendered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had surrendered , and enjoyed a brief respite , ended their lives under the knife of the executioner . The Manchu soldiers are said to have been given spoil to the extent of nearly ten million dollars , and the war which witnessed the final assertion of Manchu power over the Chinese was essentially popular with the soldiers who carried it on to a victorious conclusion . A very short time after the final overthrow of Wou Sankwei and his family , the Chinese regime in Formosa was brought to an end . Kanghi , having collected a fleet , and concluded a convention with the Dutch , determined on the invasion and conquest of Formosa . In the midst of these preparations Ching , the son of Koshinga , died , and no doubt the plans of Kanghi were facilitated by the confusion that followed . The Manchu fleet seized Ponghu , the principal island of the Pescadore group , and thence the Manchus threw a force into Formosa . It is said that they were helped by a high tide , and by the superstition of the islanders , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got possession of Taiwan by a high tide . The fleet now comes in the same manner . It is the will of Heaven . " Formosa accepted the supremacy of the Manchus without further ado . Those of the islanders who had ever recognized the authority of any government , accepted that of the Emperor Kanghi , shaved their heads in token of submission , and became so far as in them lay respectable citizens. @# The overthrow of Wou Sankwei and the conquest of Formosa completed what may be called the pacification of China by the Manchus . From that period to the Taeping Rebellion , or for nearly 200 years , there was no internal insurrection on a large scale . On the whole the Manchus stained their conclusive triumph by few excesses , and Kanghi ' s moderation was scarcely inferior to that of his father , Chuntche . The family of Wou Sankwei seems to have been rooted out more for the personal attempt of the son at Pekin than for the bold ambition of the potentate himself . The family of Koshinga was spared , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thus , by a policy judiciously combined of severity and moderation , did Kanghi make himself supreme , and complete the work of his race . Whatever troubles may have beset the government in the last 220 years , it will be justifiable to speak of the Manchus and the Tatsing dynasty as the legitimate authorities in China , and , instead of foreign adventurers , as the national and recognized rulers of the Middle Kingdom. @# @# CHAPTER XI @# THE EMPEROR KANGHI @# Among the Mongol tribes the noblest at this period were the Khalkas . They prided themselves on being the descendants of the House of Genghis , the representatives of the special clan of the great conqueror , and the occupants of the original home in the valleys of the Onon and Kerulon . Although their military power was slight , the name of the Khalka princes stood high among the Mongol tribes , and they exercised an influence far in excess of their numbers or capacity as a fighting force . Kanghi determined to establish friendly relations with this clan , and by the dispatch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Khalka chiefs to enter into formal alliance with himself , and to conclude a treaty of amity with China , which , be it noted , they faithfully observed . Kanghi ' s efforts in this direction , which may have been dictated by apprehension at the movements of his new neighbors , the Russians , were thus crowned with success , and the adhesion of the Khalkas signified that the great majority of the Mongols would thenceforth abstain from acts of unprovoked aggression on the Chinese frontier . But the advance of China and her influence , even in the form of paying homage to the emperor as the Bogdo Khan , or the Celestial Ruler , so far west as the upper course of the Amour , involved the Pekin Government in fresh complications by bringing it into contact with tribes and peoples of whom it had no cognizance . Beyond the Khalkas were the Eleuths , supreme in Ili and Kashgaria , and divided into four hordes , who obeyed as many chiefs . They had had some relations with the Khalkas , but of China they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the surrender of the Khalka princes became known the Eleuth chiefs held a grand assembly or kuriltai , and at this it was finally , and , indeed , ostentatiously , decided not to yield Kanghi his demands . Important as this decision was , it derived increased weight from the character of the man who was mainly instrumental in inducing the Eleuths to take it. @# Much has been written of the desert chiefs from Yenta to Yakoob Beg , but none of these showed greater ability or attained more conspicuous success than Galdan , who strained the power of China , and fought for many years on equal terms with the Emperor Kanghi . Galdan determined that the easiest and most advantageous beginning for his enterprise would be to attack his neighbors the Khalkas , who , by accepting Kanghi ' s offers , had made themselves the advanced guard of China in Central Asia . He began a systematic encroachment into their lands in the year 1679 , but at the same time he resorted to every device to screen his movements from the Chinese court , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ignorance of the situation beyond the border , that in the very year of his beginning to attack the Khalkas , his envoy at Pekin received a flattering reception at the hands of Kanghi , still hopeful of a peaceful settlement , and returned with the seal and patent of a Khan . Events had not reached a state of open hostility three years later , when Kanghi sent special envoys to the camp of Galdan , as well as to the Khalkas . They were instructed to promise and pay much , but to rest content with nothing short of the formal acceptance by all the chiefs of the supremacy of China . Galdan , bound by the laws of hospitality , nowhere more sacred than in the East , gave them an honorable reception , and lavished upon them the poor resources he commanded . In hyperbolic terms he declared that the arrival of an embassy from the rich and powerful Chinese emperor in his poor State would be handed down as the most glorious event of his reign . But he refused to make any tender of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The dissensions among the Khalka princes assisted the development of Galdan ' s ambition , and added to the anxiety of the Chinese ruler . Kanghi admonished them to heal their differences and to abstain from an internecine strife , which would only facilitate their conquest by Galdan , and he succeeded so far that he induced them to swear a peace among themselves before an image of Buddha. @# At this juncture the Chinese came into collision with the Russians on the Amour . The Russians had built a fort at Albazin , on the upper course of that river , and the Chinese army located in the Khalka country , considering its proximity a menace to their own security , attacked it in overwhelming force . Albazin was taken , and those of the garrison who fell into the hands of the Chinese were carried off to Pekin , where their descendants still reside as a distinct Russian colony . But when the Chinese evacuated Albazin the Russians returned there with characteristic obstinacy , and Kanghi , becoming anxious at the increasing activity of Galdan , accepted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1688 , sent the son of the Governor-general of Eastern Siberia to Pekin to negotiate a peace . After twelve months ' negotiation , protracted by the outbreak of war with Galdan , the Treaty of Nerchinsk , the first concluded between China and any European power , was signed , and the brief and only war between Russia and China was thus brought to a speedy and satisfactory termination . The Russians agreed to the destruction of Fort Albazin , but they were allowed to build another at Nerchinsk. @# There is reason to believe that Galdan thought that he might derive some advantage from the complications with Russia , for his military movements were hastened when he heard that the two powers were embroiled on the Amour , and he proclaimed his intention of invading the Khalka region , because some of their people had murdered his kinsmen . Galdan endeavored to conclude an alliance with the Russians , who sent an officer to his camp ; but they soon came to the determination that it would be more advantageous to keep on friendly terms with the Chinese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an Asiatic horde . The mere rumor of a possible alliance between Galdan and the Russians roused Kanghi to increased activity , and all the picked troops of the Eight Manchu Banners , the Forty-nine Mongol Banners , and the Chinese auxiliaries , were dispatched across the steppe to bring the Napoleon of Central Asia to reason . In face of this formidable danger Galdan showed undiminished courage and energy . Realizing the peril of inaction , he did not hesitate to assume the offensive , and the war began with a victory he gained over a general named Horni , within the limits of Chinese territory . The moral of this success was that it showed that Kanghi had not decided a moment too soon in resorting to extreme measures against the ambitious potentate who found the Gobi Desert and the surrounding region too circumscribed for his ambition. @# Kanghi intrusted the chief command of his armies to his brother , Yu Tsing Wang , who justified his appointment by bringing the Eleuth forces speedily to an engagement , and by gaming a more or less decisive victory over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both sides , among the imperial officers killed being an uncle of the emperor ; but Galdan ' s forces suffered a great deal more during the retreat than they had done in the action . After this disaster Galdan signed a treaty with the Chinese commander , Yu Tsing Wang . At first he attempted to gain an advantage by excluding his personal enemies , the Khalkas , from it , but the Chinese were not to be entrapped into any such arrangement , and , standing up for their dependents , the provisions of the treaty provided equally for their safety and for the acceptance by Galdan of the supremacy of China . This new arrangement or treaty was concluded in 1690 , but Kanghi himself seems to have placed no great faith in the sincerity of Galdan , and to have regarded it merely as a truce . This view was soon found to be correct , for neither side laid aside their arms , and the unusual vigilance of the Chinese gave Galdan additional cause for umbrage . Kanghi showed that he was resolved not to let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dead letter . He summoned a great assemblage of the Khalka tribes on the plain of Dolonor  --  the Seven Springs near Changtu  --  and he attended it in person , bestowing gifts and titles with a lavish hand . Kanghi was thus able to convince himself that , so far as the Mongol tribes were concerned , he might count on their loyalty and support . He then began to establish an understanding with Tse Wang Rabdan , and thus obtain an ally in the rear of Galdan . This latter circumstance was the direct cause of the second war with Galdan , for Kanghi ' s embassador was waylaid and murdered in the neighborhood of Hami . The outrage for which , whether he inspired it or not , Galdan was held blameworthy , aroused the strongest resentment and anger of Kanghi. @# Kanghi made extraordinary preparations for the campaign . He placed four armies in the field numbering about 150 , 000 combatants , and it has been computed that , with non-combatants , the total of men employed did not fall short of a million . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and was intrusted to Feyanku , the Ney of the Manchu army . Kanghi took personal command of the second , and its strength is given at 37 , 700 men ; and the third army , 35 , 400 men , was placed under the orders of Sapsu . The fourth , of unstated but greatest numerical strength , acted as the reserve force for the others , and did not , properly speaking , come into action at all . In order to render the war popular Kanghi offered special pay to the soldiers , and undertook to provide for the widows and orphans of those slain . At the same time Kanghi neglected no precaution to insure the success of his arms . He provided cotton armor which was proof to the bullet for his cavalry and part of his infantry , and he organized a corps of artillerists mounted on camels , which also carried the light pieces , and rendered good service as " flying artillery . " Before setting out for the campaign , the emperor reviewed his army , and he chose for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when all China takes a holiday . After the inspection of the numerous and well equipped army an impressive ceremony took place . Feyanku approached his sovereign , and received at his hands a cup of wine , which the general took while on his knees , and which , on descending from the steps of the throne , he quaffed in full view of the spectators . Each of his assistant generals and the subordinate officers in groups of ten went through the same ceremony , and the ruin of Galdan was anticipated in the libations of his conquerors . While Feyanku marched to encounter Galdan wherever he should find him , the ministers and courtiers at Pekin made a strenuous effort to prevent Kanghi taking the field in person , expatiating on the dangers of a war in the desert , and of the loss to the empire if anything happened to him . But Kanghi , while thanking them for their solicitude , was not to be deterred from his purpose . He led his army by a parallel route to that pursued by Feyanku across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headquarters . The details of the march are fully described by the Roman Catholic priest , Gerbillon , in his interesting narrative . They reveal the difficulties of the enterprise as well as its success . Some detachments of the Chinese army were compelled to beat a retreat , but the main body succeeded in making its way to the valley of the Kerulon , where some supplies could be obtained . Feyanku ' s corps , when it reached the neighborhood of the modern Ourga , was reduced to an effective strength of 10 , 000 men , and of Sapsu ' s army only 2 , 000 ever reached the scene of operations , and they formed a junction with the force under Feyanku . But Galdan did not possess the military strength to take any advantage of the enfeebled state in which the Chinese armies reached his neighborhood . He abandoned camp after camp , and sought to make good his position by establishing an empty alliance with the Russians in Siberia , from whom he asked 60 , 000 troops to consummate the conquest of China . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the active operations of a Chinese army in his own country . In a fit bordering on desperation Galdan suddenly determined to risk an attack on the camp of Feyanku at Chowmodo . That general , less fortunate than his sovereign , had been reduced to the verge of distress by the exhaustion of his supplies , and was even meditating a retreat back to China , when the action of Galdan relieved him from his dilemma . The exact course of the battle at Chowmodo is not described in any authentic document . During three hours Feyanku stood on the defensive , but when he gave the order for attack , the Eleuths broke in confusion before the charge of his cavalry . Two thousand of their best warriors were slain , their organization was shattered , and Galdan became a fugitive in the region where he had posed as undisputed master . This victory undoubtedly relieved the Chinese from serious embarrassment , and Kanghi felt able to return to Pekin , leaving the further conduct of the war and the pursuit of Galdan in the hands of Feyanku . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Chowmodo put an end to his career , and destroyed all his schemes of greatness . The Chinese pursued him with great persistence , and at last he died in 1697 , either of his deprivations or by the act of his own hand . With Galdan disappeared one of the most remarkable of the desert chiefs ; but , although Kanghi flattered himself that such would be the case , peace did not settle down on Central Asia as the consequence of the death of his active and enterprising antagonist . The Chinese armies were recalled for this occasion , and the only force left on the remote frontier was a small one under the command of the gallant Feyanku. @# The overthrow and death of Galdan brought Tse Wang Rabdan into direct contact with the Chinese . He had from his hostile relations with Galdan  --  the murderer of his father Tsenka  --  acted as the ally of Kanghi , but when he became the chief of the Eleuths on the death of his uncle , his ideas underwent a change , and he thought more of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but that the Chinese , in their implacable resolve to exterminate the family of their enemy Galdan , demanded from Tse Wang Rabdan not only the bones of that chieftain , but also the persons of his son and daughter , who had taken refuge with him . Tse Wang Rabdan resented both the demand itself and the language in which it was expressed . He evaded the requests sent by Feyanku , and he addressed a letter of remonstrance to Kanghi , in the course of which he said , " The war being now concluded , past injuries ought to be buried in oblivion . Pity should be shown to the vanquished , and it would be barbarous to think of nothing but of how to overwhelm them . It is the first law inspired by humanity , and one which custom has consecrated from the earliest period among us who are Eleuths . " Kanghi , undeterred by this homily , continued to press his demand , and sent several missions to the Eleuth camp to obtain the surrender of Galdan ' s remains and relations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his old opponent were surrendered to be scattered as those of a traitor throughout China , and his son was sent to Pekin , where , however , he received an honorable appointment in lieu of being handed over to the public executioner . Although Tse Wang Rabdan at last conceded to Kanghi what he demanded , his general action soon marked him out as the antagonist of the Chinese in Central Asia . He first vanquished in battle , and then established an alliance with the Kirghiz , and thus his military forces were recruited from the whole of the vast territory from Hami on the east to Khokand on the west. @# The main object of his policy was to assert his influence and authority in Tibet , and to make the ruling lama at Lhasa accept whatever course he might dictate for him . Galdan had at one time entertained the same idea ; but probably because he had not as good means of access into the country as Tse Wang Rabdan had , on account of his possession of Khoten , it lay dormant until it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Up to this time China had been content with a very shadowy hold on Tibet , and she had no resident representative at Lhasa .
