SCENE I.  --  Ladies ' Waiting Room at Railroad Station . Plain ordinary room with chairs and settees . Costumes modern , but old-fashioned costumes , if possible , for MISS BEAN , MRS . SCRIB and MRS . JONES . FREDDY ALDEN ( sitting reading book  --  dressed for travelling ,  --  bag , umbrella , etc . ) FREDDY ALDEN ( closing book ) That train 's late and I 'm tired to death waiting for it . ( yawns ) I ca n't imagine why mamma insisted upon my taking this trip so suddenly . There 's some mystery about it , that she did n't explain to me  --  and that 's not a bit like mamma . ( gets up and goes to door ) Oh porter , did my trunk come ? Yes ? You 'll check it for me ? Thank you ! ( rumble heard outside ) Ah , there 's the train . ( gathers up bag and goes out but returns immediately ) How provoking ! It 's the down train . I felt just like getting on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much , but the changing cars is so disagreeable . ( goes to glass and arranges hat and hair ) ( Enter MISS HARMON , limping and groaning . ) MISS HARMON That savage  --  ! that ruffian  --  He 's crippled me for life . ( drops bag , bundle , etc. , sits down groaning . Her hat is on awry ) p. 3 FREDDY ALDEN Why what 's the matter . You are hurt ? MISS HARMON Fatally injured  --  I 'm afraid . FREDDY ALDEN ( alarmed ) Has there been an accident ? Let me help you  --  I 'll call some one . ( starts toward door ) MISS HARMON ( sitting bolt upright ) Do n't you do it . I 'm not going to have a crowd around me . I prefer to die peacefully . FREDDY ALDEN But , my dear Madam , ca n't you tell me where you 're suffering ? MISS HARMON My foot . He trampled all over it . Purposely , too . Young brute ! FREDDY ALDEN ( concerned ) Anything broken ? ( she looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her ) MISS HARMON Every single bone , and it 's mashed to a pulp besides . ( groans and wiggles foot ) FREDDY ALDEN This is dreadful . Do n't you think I ought to go for a doctor ? MISS HARMON ( very decidedly ) I never let a doctor come near me . Do n't believe in ' em . But if you could just run out and catch that young villain who has brought me to this pass , I 'd be much obliged to you . He wore a blue coat , or a grey one  --  or some kind . That does n't matter . Seize him , and bring him to me . After I 've cuffed his wicked ears I 'll feel greatly relieved . He ran up the street , or down  --  I do n't remember which  --  Well  --  are you going ? p. 4 FREDDY ALDEN I 'm afraid I would n't find the  --  the man  --  did you say ? MISS HARMON Man I did n't say . Boy ! Oh , if I could only lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys . They should never be allowed to run around loose . They 're a menace to human life . ( swings foot and groans ) FREDDY ALDEN ( aside ) Now , is n't she peculiar ? But I think she 's really suffering and I 'll try and help her . ( to MISS H. ) If I ca n't catch your bad boy , I may be able to make your foot feel better . ( kneels down and unlaces her shoe , MISS H. jerking her foot and uttering little , sharp cries of pain ) There , the shoe 's untied , and I 'm sure it will relieve you . I 'll hold your foot in my hand  --  so  --  and perhaps that will ease it . How small it is ! MISS HARMON ( pleased ) You think so ? Strange how every one notices that . ( aside ) Now that I look at her , she 's a charming young girl . ( to FRED ) There , my dear , that will do . ( rubs hands over face ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day so warm . FREDDY ALDEN Let me bathe your face with some cologne I have in my bag . ( gets bottle out of bag , pours cologne on handkerchief and gently bathes MISS H. 'S face , smoothes her hair and sets her bonnet on straight ) There , now , I 'm sure you 'll feel better . p. 5 MISS HARMON Thank you , my dear , I 'm greatly refreshed . It 's very considerate of you to take so much trouble over a cross old woman . Sit down , and let me talk to you a little . You ca n't imagine how lovely you seem to me after my experience with that horrible boy . And to think , I 've always believed I liked them better than girls . I shall hate the sight of anything in caps and knickerbockers after this . FREDDY ALDEN Now do you know , I 've always wanted a brother . MISS HARMON You have n't any ? FREDDY ALDEN No . In fact , I have n't a sister either . I 'm an only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've been dreadfully spoiled . Still you do n't show it . FREDDY ALDEN ( laughing ) Oh , as to that , I have the dearest , most sensible mother in the world . She loved me too well to spoil me , though , of course , I 'm not perfect . But it 's not my mother 's fault . She 's worked over me hard enough . MISS HARMON She 's succeeded pretty well , I judge . But tell me , where are you going ? Do you take the down train or the up ? FREDDY ALDEN The up . You see , I started quite unexpectedly . For some reason , mamma decided all at once that I must go to her cousin 's for a visit . I 'm to stay until I 'm sent for . I do n't understand it , and I 'm afraid I do n't quite like it . However , mamma seemed so anxious about it , I did n't make any objections  --  except just a little perhaps  --  at first . What puzzles me though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off so suddenly . But she 'll tell me all about it when she thinks best for me to know . And I really like Cousin Sarah . p. 6 MISS HARMON ( aside ) Is n't that a sweet disposition ! What a pity she could n't have been my niece . ( to FRED ) I 'm sorry you 're not going my way . We could have had a pleasant " journey " together . FREDDY ALDEN You are going down ? MISS HARMON ( dismally ) Yes . And I 'm afraid I 'm not going to like the person I 'm on my way to see . He 's sure to be big and rough and everything that 's not nice . How I wish he were a girl . And yet , how proud I 've always been to think he had his father 's name  --  Frederick . FREDDY ALDEN Do you know that 's my name too . Odd  --  is n't it ? MISS HARMON ( horrified ) Odd ! It 's barbarous ! Who gave , you a boy 's name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Violet , or some such sweet gentle name . But Frederick  --   --  FREDDY ALDEN ( laughing ) Oh , it is n't exactly Frederick . It 's Fredericka  --  after my father . You see every one was so sure I was to be a boy that they felt bound to name me after papa even when I was just a girl . Then , after dear papa died , ( sighs ) every one was so glad I had his name . You ca n't think what a comfort it is to mamma . p. 7 MISS HARMON Um  --   --  . Perhaps there 's some little excuse for it then . But I shall call you Fanny , if you do n't mind . It 's near enough , and more civilized . I do wish you might have been my niece . ( takes FRED 'S hand and pats it lovingly ) You do n't know how I dread meeting that boy  --  my nephew , or rather my grandnephew . While I 've always been glad to think of him , as a boy , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as long as possible . But I 'll have to see him some time , and I really ought to pay more attention to him . Hope I 'll live through it . FREDDY ALDEN Perhaps he wo n't be so very bad . I know some nice boys . MISS HARMON ( decidedly ) Now , my dear Fanny , do n't try and raise false hopes . I know he 'll be horrid in every way . But I 'm going to do my duty , even if I do come out totally done up . I only hope he does n't sing coon songs . FREDDY ALDEN Do n't you like music ? MISS HARMON Love it . But a boy bawling coon songs  --   --  ( shudders ) FREDDY ALDEN I 'm glad you care for music . I love it too . MISS HARMON ( eagerly ) You sing ? p. 8 FREDDY ALDEN A little . My voice has never been trained  --  because  --  well , we are n't rich enough to pay for lessons . So I just sing the best I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you would like the lessons ? FREDDY ALDEN Oh , more than anything else in the world . But it 's of no use thinking of it . We never could afford it . Hark ! here 's my train . Good bye  --  and I hope your foot wo n't trouble you . ( shakes hands , snatches bag , etc. , and goes out ) MISS HARMON ( looking after her ) Now , is n't she perfectly angelic ! Sings , too , and wants lessons that she ca n't afford . And here I am with more money than I can possibly spend . Well , she shall have the lessons and everything else that I can give her . I 'll do my whole duty by my nephew  --  coon songs and all  --  and then  --  I 'll hunt up Fanny and  --   --  ( pauses in dismay ) @x SCENE II .  --  MRS . ALDEN 'S sitting room . A comfortably furnished room with chairs R. and L. Table set for afternoon tea . MRS . ALDEN sitting at one end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ALDEN ( sighing ) Will this dreadful week never end ! I 've grown so nervous that I start at every sound , and I have n't slept decently since Aunt Harmon came . MISS CRAGIN I think you were very foolish not to have told her in the first place . She 's sure to find out sooner or later . MRS . ALDEN I wish I had . But it 's too late now . She would n't forgive the deceit . MISS CRAGIN I 'd risk it . Anything would be better than living in such constant dread . Let me tell her . MRS . ALDEN ( hastily ) Oh , no  --  no  --  not for the world . You do n't understand . She 's always supposed Freddy was a boy . At first it was merely a joke and we laughed so much at her writing of her nephew , and all the things she meant to do for him when he was older . Then , after my poor Frederick died , she seemed to lose all interest in us and we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd forgotten all about us until I received her letter last week . In it she wrote that Fred must be a big boy by now  --  and she felt it her duty to fulfill her promise to do something for him . You know how poor we are , since that awful bank failure , last year . And poor Freddy breaking her heart because she ca n't have singing lessons . ( leans head on hand and sighs ) p. 10 MISS CRAGIN I know all that , sister . But I still think you 're doing wrong . Freddy could not understand why she was sent away in such a hurry . I do n't see how you 're ever going to explain it to her . MRS . ALDEN I never can . But that does n't worry me so much as keeping her sex a secret from Aunt Harmon . She says she must go tomorrow , and since I 've got along so far without her discovering it , I hope to be able to carry it through for one day more . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should think you would . I 'm heartily ashamed of it , and in favor of telling the whole thing at once . If she does n't want to do anything for her niece simply because she is n't her nephew  --  why let her keep her money . MRS . ALDEN ( putting handkerchief to eyes ) Oh , sister , I never had your courage and your independent spirit . I can only think what it means to Freddy . MISS CRAGIN Freddy will do very well without her great-aunt 's help . Does she ever complain ? Well , I think not . There never was a happier , more contented girl . And I doubt if she would thank you for getting anything for her under false pretenses . MRS . ALDEN Do n't , sister , do n't . You 're so harsh . You make me feel like a thief . ( sobs ) p. 11 MISS CRAGIN ( aside ) Poor little woman ! How weak she 's always been . ( to MRS . A. ) Well  --  well , I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your eyes  --  and look a little more cheerful before any one comes in. ( pats her gently on shoulder ) Here 's Miss Harmon . ( Enter MISS H. in afternoon dress , lace cap and knitting . MRS . A. and MISS C. both rise . ) MRS . ALDEN ( offering easy chair ) Have this chair , Aunt . You 'll find it very comfortable . MISS HARMON No , thank you , niece . I 've never cultivated indolent habits . I ca n't begin now . ( takes straight-backed chair ; to MRS . A. ) When did you say you expected Fred ? MRS . ALDEN ( hesitating ) I  --  er  --  well , not until next week . MISS HARMON I 'm afraid I wo n't see him then . I leave tomorrow . MRS . ALDEN Must you ? MISS HARMON Yes . I never change my plans and I 've arranged to go tomorrow . MRS . ALDEN I 'm  --  so sorry . p. 12 MISS CRAGIN ( aside ) You hypocrite. ( to MISS H. ) You 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes to table and arranges cups , etc . ) MISS HARMON ( slowly ) No doubt . ( aside ) I know just the kind of a nuisance that boy is . Brought up by a weak little mother , and petted to death by that aunt . Grappling irons would n't hold me here until he gets back . ( to MRS . A. ) You 're sure he wo n't be back until next week ? MRS . ALDEN Quite sure , Aunt , unless you insist upon my sending  --   --  MISS HARMON ( hurriedly ) No  --  oh , no  --  not for the world . Some other time I may see him . ( aside ) . I wo n't risk my life in the house with that young Indian . I 'm sure he 's that . MRS . ALDEN ( relieved ) Very well . Aunt . As you say , some other time when you 're not so hurried . ( Enter MISS BEAN . MRS . A. and MISS C. greet her and present her to MISS H. ) MISS BEAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first one here ? Well , you know I always like to come early  --  it gives one a chance to see everybody else . Nothing like these little afternoon teas for promoting sociability I say . Just the place to hear all that 's going on in the village . You know what a neighborly creature I am  --  what an interest I take in every one ? I 'm what you may call sympathetic . Mrs. Alden , have you heard the dreadful rumor about Jamie Lane ? ( MRS . A. shakes head ) You have n't ? Well , of course , I do n't want to be the first one to spread an evil report about any one . Least of all , a young man that 's always been so well thought of . Though they do say he has n't been as straight as people supposed . His mother always humored him too much , I think . p. 13 MISS CRAGIN I 'm sure Jamie 's always behaved himself , and I should be very sorry to hear anything to the contrary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . MISS BEAN Oh , there is n't any doubt of it 's being true . Miss Hale 's cousin told Jane Seamon , and Jane 's cook overheard her telling Miss Daniels . I got it straight from her . MISS HARMON ( severely ) The cook , Madam ? Do you ever believe servants ' gossip ? I never do  --  on general principles . MISS BEAN Well  --  er  --  you see  --  I could n't doubt this , coming as it did so straight . I know servants gossip  --  it 's one of their worst faults . I never believe in talking about my neighbors ' private affairs . I would n't speak of this if I had n't felt so sorry for Mrs. Lane . I can feel for her  --  even if I do think she 's brought that boy up all wrong . But she never would take my advice , and now she must bear her disgrace as best she can . Of course , you wo n't any of you mention my telling you of this dreadful affair . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intimate with Freddy ? MISS HARMON ( aside ) Freddy has bad companions . it seems . MRS . ALDEN They were always good friends . Indeed  --  we have known Jamie ever since he was a baby . In fact , he and Freddy have grown up together . p. 14 MISS BEAN Um  --   --  . Rather unfortunate for you under the circumstances . A young girl  --  MRS . ALDEN ( alarmed ) My dear Miss Bean , what are we thinking of to let you sit so long without a cup of tea . ( pours tea and hands to MISS B. ) I hope you will excuse my thoughtlessness . Cream and sugar ? ( aside to MISS C. ) Keep her busy eating and drinking the rest of the time she is here . ( MISS C. offers cakes , confections , etc. , to MISS B. and MRS . A. gives tea to MRS . H. and MISS B. ) MISS BEAN ( eating rather greedily ) When did you say you expected Freddy back ? MRS . ALDEN ( nervously ) I  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be this time . MISS BEAN ( looking astonished ) You do n't know ? Well , that 's strange . Who should know if not you ? MISS CRAGIN You see , Miss Bean , Freddy went rather unexpectedly , and did n't say for how long . ( aside to MRS . A. ) Give her some more tea . MISS BEAN ( confidentially to MISS H. ) Now is n't that a very peculiar way for a child to treat a mother ? p. 15 MISS HARMON Is Fred inclined to be headstrong ? MISS BEAN I never thought so before . But this looks like it . MISS CRAGIN Do have some more cake , Miss Bean ( MISS B. helps herself liberally ) MRS . ALDEN And some hot tea . ( offers some ) MISS HARMON ( aside ) That Fred is a spoiled child , if ever there was one . I shall be thankful when I 'm once out of this house . ( Enter MRS . JONES and MRS . SCRIB . MRS . A. and MISS C. greet them and present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too busy eating to rise . They seat themselves , and MRS . A. serves them with tea and MISS C. with cakes , etc. , all talking at once meantime . ) MRS . ALDEN ( seating herself ) It 's so kind of you ladies  --  to come in this afternoon . I wanted you to meet my aunt before she left us . MRS . JONES You are going soon ? MISS HARMON Tomorrow . MISS BEAN Oh , then you wo n't see Freddy . p. 16 MISS HARMON I fear not . ( aside ) I mean I hope not . MRS . SCRIB What a pity . Really , you do n't know what you 're missing . MISS HARMON I daresay . ( aside ) I can guess part of it , though . MRS . SCRIB ( to MRS . A. ) Why do n't you telegraph Fred to come back tonight ? MISS HARMON ( hurriedly ) No  --  no  --  I beg you not to think of it . It 's always very confusing to me to have a person sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm coming again very soon . ( aside ) Between them all they 'll contrive to get that boy here before I 'm out of the house . I 've a mind to start tonight and not run any further risk . MRS . ALDEN ( aside ) I must get them to talk of something else . ( to MISS H. ) What is that pretty bit of work you have there , Aunt ? MISS HARMON Slippers . MRS . SCRIB For Freddy ? MISS HARMON ( scornfully ) For Fred ? Nonsense ! For Fanny . MRS . JONES Another niece , I suppose . p. 17 MISS HARMON No. ( sighing ) I wish she were . A niece is a very nice thing to have if she happens to be the right kind  --  and Fanny is . MRS . JONES But if you were to see Freddy I 'm sure you 'd be quite satisfied . We all think  --   --  MISS CRAGIN ( hastily ) Do have some more cake , Mrs. Jones . ( aside to MRS . A. ) Give her some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yours , may I ask ? MISS HARMON None whatever . I do n't even know her name , or where she lives , but I mean to find out . MRS . SCRIB How odd to be making something for a person you know so little about . You have at least seen the young lady ? MISS HARMON Once . And of all sweet tempered , sensible , sympathetic beings I ever met , she was the most so . Oh , never fear  --  I 'll find her . And then I mean to travel with her , and let her have music lessons  --  and everything else she wants . She told me she could sing . ( during this MRS . A. has listened in dismay  --  exchanging glances with MISS C. ) MISS BEAN Well , Freddy sings too . ( all , " Beautifully , " " lovely voice , " etc. ) p. 18 MISS HARMON Coon songs  --  most likely . ( all , indignantly , " No , indeed " ; " nothing of the kind , " etc . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aside to MISS C. ) There goes my poor Freddy 's last chance and for an utter stranger . MISS CRAGIN ( resolutely ) I mean to tell her . Once she sees Freddy she will love her instantly  --  Miss Harmon  --   --  MRS . ALDEN ( clutching at MISS C. 'S arm ) No  --  no  --  you must not . I could n't bear it before all these people . I 'll tell her after they go , or write her . MISS HARMON ( turning to MRS . A. ) Did you speak , niece ? MRS . ALDEN No  --  yes . Where did you say you met  --  er  --  Fanny ? ( Enter FREDDY , unexpectedly . ) FREDDY ALDEN Good afternoon everybody . ( rushes up to MRS . A. , embraces her and kisses her , and does same to MISS C. All act delighted to see her . ) FREDDY ALDEN ( to MRS . A. ) You did n't expect me , did you , dearie. ( holds mother 's hands ) How could you when I did n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started . You 're not vexed , are you little mommie ? p. 19 MRS . ALDEN ( kissing her ) No , of course not . But how did it happen ? FREDDY ALDEN Well you see Cousin John had to come down this afternoon . I did so hate to take the journey alone that I came with him , instead of waiting until tomorrow , as you wrote me to do . And I 'm so glad to be here . ( kisses her mother ) MISS HARMON ( to MRS . J. ) That 's Fanny . MRS . JONES ( astonished ) Ridiculous ! Why that 's Freddy . MISS HARMON ( with great dignity ) Madam , I think I know Fanny when I see her . I may also add that I know a sweet young girl from a horrible , howling , nerve-racking boy . ( knits very energetically ) MRS . JONES ( to MRS . A. ) Oh , Mrs. Alden , there 's the most ludicrous mistake here . ( FREDDY turns and sees MISS H. ) FREDDY ALDEN ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And how is your poor foot  --  and  --  and  --  however did you happen to be here ? MISS HARMON I came to visit my nephew . p. 20 MRS . ALDEN ( astonished ) You 've met your aunt before ? FREDDY ALDEN Why , yes  --  if this is my aunt . But I do n't understand . ( looks from MRS . A. to MISS H. ) MRS . ALDEN I  --  I  --  will have to explain . Oh  --  oh  --  how can I do it ! ( sobs in hands ) MISS CRAGIN Let me do it for you , sister . You 've had enough to bear . ( to MISS H. ) You see , MISS Harmon , you 've been under a delusion all along . You 've always taken it for granted that Freddy was a boy . Now , no one ever really told you she was . MISS HARMON No one ever told me she was n't . If you or my niece had done so I might have been spared a very miserable week . MRS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my best to make you comfortable . MISS HARMON So you have , my dear , so you have . But you do n't know how I 've suffered expecting Fred in trousers to pounce down upon me . However , I 'm ready to forget it all since this is really my niece . ( embraces FRED ) FREDDY ALDEN Now is n't this exactly like something out of a story-book . Mamma , dear , I never dreamed you did n't want me to meet Aunt Harmon . Why , just think , I saw her before you did . It 's all too delightful for words . I must tell Jamie Lane all about it when he comes in this evening . p. 21 MISS HARMON ( grasping FRED 'S arm ) My dear , do n't you have anything to do with that young man . FREDDY ALDEN ( astonished ) Why not ? MISS HARMON ( solemnly ) He 's disgraced his mother . FREDDY ALDEN What ! MISS HARMON ( still more solemnly ) He 's disgraced his mother . FREDDY ALDEN Jamie ? ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Bean . FREDDY ALDEN But how ? MISS HARMON She did n't say . ( to MISS B. ) Can you bring proof of what you said , Madam ? MISS BEAN ( confused ) Why  --  er  --  well  --  I  --   --  Well , you know I merely referred to that affair in church last Sunday . FREDDY ALDEN Oh , that ! It was the funniest thing . ( laughing ) I 'll tell you about it . It was this way . Jamie , you know , always goes to church with his mother . MISS HARMON ( glaring at MISS B. ) A very proper thing to do . p. 22 FREDDY ALDEN Well , last Sunday old Mrs. Grey fell asleep during the sermon  --   --  MISS HARMON ( severely ) And he made fun of a poor tired old woman  --  whose age caused her to slumber when she should n't . FREDDY ALDEN Oh , not at all . But Miss Grey had some artificial berries on her hat and a swallow had flown in the window and lighted on them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pick those berries off , and Miss Grey wake up once in a while just enough to shake her head a little . Finally the swallow succeeded in loosening the whole bunch , and flew away with it in his bill . Miss Grey woke up then and put her hand up to her hat . When she discovered that part of the trimming was gone she turned around to Jamie ( he sits in the pew back of her ) and called out so that everyone around heard her : " Young man , hand back those berries . " Jamie , of course , forgot for a moment where he was and laughed outright . His poor mother was dreadfully mortified , and Jamie told me she felt quite disgraced . I suppose that was what Miss B. meant . MISS HARMON ( to MISS B. ) Was it ? MISS BEAN ( confused ) Why  --  er  --  yes . Of course you do n't approve of such irreverent conduct ? p. 23 MISS HARMON I should have laughed myself if I had seen it . FREDDY ALDEN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much even to hear of it that I do n't see how Jamie could have helped it . ( laughs in which MISS H. joins ) FREDDY ALDEN ( to MISS H. ) And you 're really and truly glad that I 'm not a boy ? MISS HARMON My dear , I never was so pleased at anything in my life . MRS . ALDEN ( rising and holding out her hand to MISS H. ) And you can forgive me for deceiving you ? MISS HARMON ( taking MRS . A. 's hand ) As Miss Cragin says , I began by deceiving myself . MISS CRAGIN Then you will have to pardon our not undeceiving you . MISS HARMON For the sake of this dearest and sweetest girl I can overlook everything . ( puts arm around FREDDY )
