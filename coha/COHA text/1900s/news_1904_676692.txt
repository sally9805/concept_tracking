txt Hannah Elias , locked in the house at 236 Central Park West , which John R. Platt declares she bought with money wrung from him , yesterday successfully de- I fled the civil order for her arrest issued by Justice Dugro of the Supreme Court . While process servers hovered about her I home , and the sidewalk before it was blocked by a curious crowd , the aged man who lavished his fortune upon her by hundreds of thousands of dollars was lying prostrated in his residence in East Fiftyfourth Street . Buoyed up by excitement until he had seen the proceedings against the Elias woman fairly launched , Platt collapsed when the full realization of his position came upon him , and the members of his family are much alarmed over his condition . Orders were given that he be permitted to see no one , and W. J. Cassard , his sonin-law , last night said that it might be a considerable time before lie recovered his etrength . " Mr. Platt is much worked up , " said Mr. Cassard . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be able to get out . I wish it plainly understood , however , that he is remaining at home because of his condition . Absolutely no restraint is being exercised upon him by the members of the family . " There is no telling how long the Elias woman can balk the efforts of Warren , Warren &; O'Beirne to serve the papers in the suit brought against her by Platt ( and evade the order for her arrest Lyman E. Warren , who has the case in charge , declined yesterday to say what course would be pursued if Mrs. Elias persisted in remaining indoors and refusing access to the process servers . He was asked if he would apply for an attachment or attempt to gain entrance by a writ of replevin , on the ground that there was property belonging to Platt in the house , and said that he would make no prophecies as to the course ' which would be pursued . Deputy Sheriff Walgering , who was intrusted with the execution of the order of arrest , gave up the battle yesterday morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that admission to the Elias home had been denied to him , and that as he was not- empowered to force his ! way in there was nothing to Da gained by remaining on guard . The withdrawal of the deputy from the field left the clerks from the office of Platt 's attorneys in charge of the siege . They stuck to their post , making several unsuccessful attempts in the course of the day to gain admittance to the house . They has no opportunity to grow lonesome , as their vigil was shared from early morning until almost midnight by a large number of persons who waited about the place , hoping that its occupant might show hereelf . POLICE DISPERSE THRONG . Public interest ' has seldom been aroused as it has been in the Platt-Elias suit . This Was testified by the size of the crowd , which included white and black , old and young , men and women . In the afternoon the throng in front of the house was so dense that mounted policemen had to be employed to clear the way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1:30 o'clock , and a man , clean shaven and wearing a serge suit , ran briskly up the steps . Kato , the Japanese butler of the Elias establishment , answered his ring , and , when he recognized the caller , let him in . He remained inside for about an hour . When he came out he declined to give his name . He denied that he was either Dr. J. B. Van Tine , the Elias physician , or a representative of the District Attorney . Washington Brauns , who has been retained as counsel by the woman , although he is not her attorney of record , reached the house soon after the mysterious stranger departed . He was in consultation with his client for several hours . At the end of his visit he said that she was ill and not able to see any one . It was generally believed yesterday morning that Mr. Brauns and the attorm  --  ys for Platt would get together and isach some agreement by which bond would be taken for Mrs. Elias and service accepted . The developments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any such arrangement going through . At his office late yesterday afternoon Ira D. Warren declared vehemently that there had been not even a suggestion of a conference with the Elias attorney . " I have not seen Mr. Brauns , " he said , " and have no desire to see him . We have no compromise proposition to make at this time , and will have none . We are not afraid that the woman will get away . She ca n't We can afford to wait . " Mr. Brauns said last night that he had not made any overtures looking to a conference-with Platt 's attorneys , and that he did not propose to do so . " I had a little conversation with Mr. Warren over the telephone last evening , " he admitted , " but it was at the suggestion of one of his clerks , who was at the home of my client when Deputy Sheriff Walgering attempted to serve her with the warrant for her arrest . " Before going to see his client yester // // day afternon , Mr. Brauns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whether or not that official intended taking a hand in the case . He had a talk with Assistant District Attorney Taylor . " I have come to say to you , " he told Mr. Taylor , " that my client , Mrs. Elias , dyes not intend to run away . I would like to know , too , how soon , if at all , the District Attorney would like to hear her side of this charge of blackmail , made by Mr. Platt and his counsel . The warrant for her arrest in the civil action was issued unnecessarily , I believe . We are ready to meet the civil issue at any time . " Mr. Taylor informed Mr. Brauns that District Attorney Jerome would not be at his office before Monday . He was unable , therefore , to say what attitude the office would assume in the case . He told Mr. Brauns further that the Grand Jury would not be impaneled until Monday , and that it was hardly likely that anything would be done before that time . DENIES ANY CRIMINAL ACT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he was perfectly satisfied With the outlook , so far as the District Attorney'e office was concerned . " I know Mr. Jerome very well , " he asserted , " and I know him to be an honest , conscientious man . There is nothing criminal in anything my client has ever done , and I am sure that the District Attorney will not permit himself to be turned into a collecting agency . Mrs. Elias is ready at any time to give him the fullest details in any matter which he may wish explained . " When reminded that the writ issued for his client in the Platt suit was returnable Monday , and asked if the suit would not be voided if no service could be secured upon her before that day , he said that the question was one which should properly be put to the attorneys for Platt . " I am not giving away any plan of defense which I may have , " he declared . He denied that he had made any efforts to obtain bail , and refused to say whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sum of $20,000 , the amount of the bond fixed by Justice Dugro , should he decide to surrender his client . Kato , the Japanese retainer , was called to the door of the Elias home yesterday afternoon and asked if Mrs. Elias 's child , born in April . was with its mother . He said that the child was not in the house . He did not know where it was . Dr. Van Tine reached the Elias home at 7 o'clock and remained with his patient for three hours . When he left there he said that she was in a state bordering on nervous prostration . " Mrs. Elias was so ill recently , " he asserted , " that the strain because of the suit filed by Mr. Platt and its attendant publicity has proved too much for her . She is not in a dangerous condition by any means , but she requires the most careful attention . She retired shortly before I left the house . I will not call again until tomorrow night . " It was said yesterday that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and who attempted to turn their knowledge into money . This was shown when Platt , at the time of the Andrew H. Green murder , was overwhelmed with letters demanding various sums , on the penalty that he would be exposed as the man for whom Mr. Green was murdered by mistake . BELIEVES WILLIAMS INSANE . District Attorney Jerome , talking with a NEW YORK TIMES reporter last night over the long-distance telephone , said he would hardly return to New York from Lakeville before Monday . When asked if there were other names mentioned than that of Platt at the time of the investigation made by him when Mr. Green was killed by Cornelius Williams , he replip , d , in the . negative . " I Was there anything developed by the investigation , " ' ' he was asked , " which would lead you to believe that there were other men involved , or that Hannah Elias was co-operating with a band of blackmailers ? " " The name of John R. Platt was the only name mentioned , " replied Mr. Jerome . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Elias woman was the instrument of organized blackmail . " " Have you determined to proceed criminally against Hannah Elias ? " he was asked . " I have absolutely nothing to say on the subject . " Did the statement of Cornelius Williams induce you to believe that he has recovered his sanity , and is there any likelihood that he will be placed upon trial for the murder of Mr. Green ? " " I am entirely satisfied that Williams is insane . For a period of more than three months he was regularly examined under my instructions by four of the leading insanity experts , and they informed me that he was insane beyond a question . I have not the slightest intention of reopening any investigation of his sanity . He will remain in Matteawan so far as I am concerned . " The process servers did not relax their efforts to get inside the Elias home last night . Braving the dampness , they made frequent attempts , each time with a different excuse , to obtain entrance . Always they were met by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elias was too ill to be seen . " The evening watch was not devoid of incident . Two men entered the place soon after nightfall , evidently using a signal , for the door was opened wide to them the moment ; hey rang the electric bell . At 10:30 o'clock a woman in black , heavily veiled , entered the house by the same method . Not the slightest clue could be gained as to her identity . Whoever she was , she spent the night in the house , for as soon as she had disappeared within the door the lights were put out . A black automobile came into the case about 11 o'clock last night . It served to /frighten the process servers , who feared that an attempt would be made to get Mrs. Elias from the house by stealth . All the curtains of the closed auto were drawn , and It mpved along silently . The front was of glass , and a curtain concealed the chauffeur . There were two slits in the curtain through which , it is supposed , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside of the coach . It was first seen going north on Central Park West . It went as far as Eighty-sixth Street , and then filmed and went slowly back to Eighty-fourth Street . Then for the next hour it continued making its slow trips back and forth . The process servers said that the people in the house had probably been warned .. aat sensational developments were promised for to-day . One of the servers , who would not allow his name to be used , said : " We will get into the nouse if we have to do the Jerome act . "
