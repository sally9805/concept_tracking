txt Christian Science received a legal setback to-day , when the Supreme Court decided that the " First Church of Christ , Scientist , " is not deserving of a charter . The opinion , written by Justice Potter , upholds the late Judge Arnold and ex-Judge Dimner Beeber , the referee to whom the application for a , charter had been referred . Judge Beeber reported adversely upott the application , mainly on the ground that the Christian Science doctrine that thersi are no maladies or contagious diseases Is a menace to the health of the community . Judge Arnold sustained this view , but went further by saying that , as teachers of the doctrine were required to sell Mrs. Eddy 's book , the Church was an organise . tion for profit . in its application the Church asked to be chartered in order " to establish and maintain a place for the support of public worship and to preach the Gospel according to the doctrine of Jesus Christ as found in the Bible and the Christian Science textbook , ' Science and Health , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eddy . ' " When the . appeal from Judge Arnold 's decision was argued in the Supreme Court , on Jan. 23 last , Mayor Weaver , then District Attorney , appeared as counsel , at the request of the Board of Judges . J. W. Laws , for the Church , argued that all the Christian Scientists asked was to be permitted to do as a chartered organization what they are now doing as an unincorporated body . Justice Potter , in his opinion ' to-day , says : " We are inclined to think that the evidence was not sufficient to support a finding that the corporation itself was to be one for profit . There was proof that the individual healers who are consulted and sent out by the society do receive compensation for their services , but this seems to be a personal recompense , with which the society has nothing to do . " But the court below , in its supplementary opinion , went beyond this question and adopted in substance the conclusion of the Master , that the practice of the art of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Mrs. Eddy 's book is injurious to the community , because it is opposed to the general policy of the laws of Pennsylvania relative to the existence and treatement of disease . " It was the duty of the court below to refuse charter if in the exercise of sound legal-discretion he found its purpose , In whole or in part , included anything injurious to the community . Under the well-defined polity of the law of Pennsylvania as at present existing , we are satisfied that there was no abuse of sound legal discretion in refusing the application for a charter . " At the annual election of the Municipal Art Society , in the rooms of the National Arts Club last evening , the following-named officers were elected : Calvin Tompkins , President ; William T. Evans , First Vice President ; F. Wellington Ruckstuhl , Second Vice President : William S. Crandall , Secretary ; Edward D. Page , Treasurer . The retiring secretary . F. S.

WOULD POOL BANK STOCK . Henry W. Gennerich , President of the United National Bank , says in a letter to stockholders that several months ago a syndicate of parties offered to buy the majority holdings of the stock of the bank , and the Directors refused the offer as being too low . Since then , he says , parties havc succeeded in purchasing some of the stock at different prices . In order that all stockholders who sell be treated alike , President Gennerich suggests that stockholders owning a majority of the stock form a pool for mutual protection , this pcol to be represented by fifteen stockholders who would hold the stock , or agreement for the same , in trust for a period of time , voting on same as directed by the stockholders ; the pool not to sell any of its stock unless all , at no less than 160 , or unless each stockholder is first consulted and gives his consent in writing .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
