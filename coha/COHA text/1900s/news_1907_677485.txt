txt A good deal of new light was thrown yesterday upon the negotiations between President Roosevelt and E. H. Harriman in regard to the overflow of the Colorado River , Into the vast tract of land known as the Salton Sink Region in Southern California by additional telegrams which have come to light and which belong to the series published in part between Dec. 13 and Jan. 3 . The subject of this whole series of communications was to fix the responsibility for the break of the river and consequent threatened destruction of millions of acres of arable property , and secondarily to determine by whom the immediate work of repair must be done . The parties at interest were the Southern Pacific Company , which Mr. Harriman controls , and the Federal Government . The President addressed Mr. Harriman originally , asking that the Southern Pacific stop the break . To this Mr. Harriman replied on Dec. 13 that it did not seem fair that the Southern Pacific , which had already spent nearly $2,000,000 in the natter , should be called upon to do more . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Dec. 20 by declaring that " there is not the slightest excuse for the California Development Company waiting an hour for the action of the Government . " The California Development Company had figured in the earlier dispatches as the corporation developing the irrigation scheme which led to the break in the Colorado River . Telegrams already published conveyed Mr. Harriman 's suggestion that the President seemed to be under an erroneous impression that the California Development Company was a Southern Pacific enterprise , and Mr. Roosevelt 's rejoinder that he understood the Southern Pacific controlled 51 per cent . of the stock of the California . Development Company , and elected the President and other officers . The President wanted to know if this was correct , and Mr. Harriman replied that he would try to find out . Here the published telegrams stopped , but not the entire series . The first of the additional telegrams which came to light yesterday was this from Mr. Harriman to the President : Southern Pacific Willing to Sell . 1 New York , Jan. 2 , 1907 . The President . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have learned that there is in the office here what purports to be copy of a , contract explaining the relations between the Southern Pacific Company and the California Development Company , from which it appears that the Southern Pacific Company agreed In June , 1903 , to lend the California Development Company $200,000 to assist It In dealing with the situation , and to secure the loan stockholders of the California Development Company pledged 3,600 shares of its capital stock , and the agreement provides that until the loan is paid the Southern Pacific Company shall be allowed to select three members of the Board of Directors of the California Development Company , one of whom shall be elected President , provided such President shall be acceptable to at least two members of the board selected by the development company , and it was under such agreement that Randolf was chosen President . I undeistand this provision for representation upon the board and the selection of the President was in order that we might supervise and keep check on the expenditure of the money lent by us . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the West . But I say now that whatever may be the position of the Southern Paciflo Company to the California Development Company , it is ready to transfer that position to the Government immediately under such conditions as you may deem fair , as we have never had any other purpose than the protection of the settlers , and I leave the matter entirely in your hands . Moreover , we will co-operate with the Government in giving the use of our plant and facilities in its efforts to stop the break . The Southern Pacific Company has no stock of the development company except the 0,300 shares held by it purely as collateral , as above stated . I have no stock of said company , nor have any officers nor employes of the Southern Pacific Company stock in said California Development Company , so far as I know . I am informed that C. R. Rockwood , W. T. Heffernan , Mrs. Catherine Rockwood , H. W. Blaisdell , Beatty estate , estate of A. H. Heber , and J. N. Smith . none of whom are connected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control of the California Development Company . I am dictating this in bed , but hope to be out in two or three days . E. H. HARRIMAN . The President replied to this telegram the nert day , and his answer was as follows : " Kind Proposal " Not Accepted . E. H. Harriman , 120 Broadway . l ' : ew York : My information from West is to effect that Southern Pacific has claims against the California Development Company aggregating $1,800 , - 000 . California  --  Development Company has outstanding bonds of $478,000 , and has sold wattr rights for almost 200,000 acres , requiring expenditure of several million dollars to provide permanent water supply for these rights ; also has other debts and reported recent bond issues . Its assets are lands costing $31,000 , canals worth quarter million , notes of settlers $170,000 . Principal officers or stockholders being sued for misappropriation of about $1,000,000 company funds which should have been used for protective works . Are these statements correct ? Of course it may be doubtful whether Government can accept your kind proposal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Southern Pacific Company with reference to the California Development Company if such transfer would as a chief effect mean the assumption by the Government of some minims of obligations . I therefore earnestly desire to know the facts in detail , that I may fully report to Congress thereon . THEODORE ROOSEVELT . Mr. Harriman 's reply to this telegram informed the President that he was using every possible means to get the information and that rhe was absolutely certain teat the Southern Pacific Company was related to the California Development Company in no way but as a creditor . " My telegram of yesterday , " said Mr. // HARRIMAN UNABLE TO UNLOAD ON ROOSEVELT // Harriman , " was not intended to ask the Government to assume any obligation of the Southern Pacific Company , except so far as you may deem it fair for the Government to assume advances made by the Southern Pacific Company in efforts to prevent damage by the river . " Says It 's a Good Thing to Let Alone . It appears , however , that Mr. Roosevelt had been doing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of  --  which he eventually reported to Congress on Jan. 12 that " the complications which have arisen from the transfer of the ( property and the involved relations of the California Development Company , with its numerous subsidiary companies , are such that the United States would not be justified in having any dealings with this company until the complications are removed and the Government has a full understanding of the situation . " To this the President added : " The Southern Pacific Company must continue its work to close the break and restore the river to its proper channel . The United States can then take charge , making protective works permanent and providing for their maintenance . " ' This more complete expression of the President 's refusal of what he termed Mr. Harriman 's " kind offer " to transfer to the Government " whatever may be the : position of the Southern Pacific Compaify with the California Development Cornpany " seems to have been based upon facts which came out in the course of the President 's investigations referred to , and not appearing either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hitherto . I They . add interest to the negotiations which may follow between the- Government and Mr. " Harriman , particularly in view of the instigation of the Southern Pacific , among other Harriman railroads , by the Inter-State Commerce Commission , The President 's more specific information came from Epee Randolph , President , and W. J. Doran , Treasurer , of the California Development Company , through the medium of Director Wolcott of the United States Geological Survey . In a telegram sent to Mr. Wolcott on Jan. 3 Mr. Randolph said that the California Development Company has liabilities of $2,000,000 and assets in excess of that fig , ure provided the Colorado River can be permanently controlled . The development company , said Mr. Randolph , had no money except what might be lent to it by the Southern Pacific Railway , and these loans were availed of even to meet its lcurrent payrolls . Assets Shrink Under Scrutiny . Mr. Doran went even further into particulars . He told Mr. Wolcott that the " tangible assets of the Development Company have considerable value , but when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared , of the stock of a. company organized as the Mexican counterpart of the Development Company itself , carried at a par value of $1,000,000 , and representing an actual investment of some $81,000 ; canals that cost $260,000 to construct , $270,000 of Rs own stock tabled in settling litigation ' and $171,5:13 in notes of settlers . Against these assets stood the $2,000,000 debt to the Southern Pacific , $477,020 of bonds , and the coin- pany 's obligation to maintain water rights that it had sold on 200,000 acres of lane , at that time threatened with destruction by the Colorado River floods . The entry of the Southern Pacific Company into the situation was in the Spring of 1005. after various attempts had been made by the California Development pet , - ' pie to get Government help in meeting the dangers which it had itself created by making the original cut in the banks of the Colorado River for the Salton Sink- irrigation project . Floods had so ripped things up that the tracks of the railroad were threatened and It would ap I pear that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the railroad re-ceiwed willingly on account of the prop-1 erty stake it itself had . At any rate , the result was a contract dated June 20. 1905 , which forms one of the most interesting papers in the case at present in view of Mr. Harriman 's assertion originally that the Southern Pacific was " not interested in the stock and in no way controlled it , " and his sub-1 sequent statement that the 6,300 shares put up as security for the loan was " held purely as collateral . " The contract in question provides that the party of the second part should advance the $200,000. , which was the beginning of loans made by the Southern Pacific , to be paid back in installments - running to 1911 . Thei stock collateral , according to Section 4 of the contract , was all to remain in the hands of the railroad until the payment of the final payment of the loan . And the contract continued : Said stock to be deposited in pledge for such purpose with a Trustee to be selected by the party of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the books of the corporation during the life of the pledge unforeclosed. but to remain in the names of the owners thereof , who shall have a right to sell and transfer their respective interests in the same , subject always to said pledge and the purposes thereof ; at the time of so depositing said stock said owners shall execute to the Trustee or pledge so selected by the second party irrevocable powers of attorney or proxies , giving , to said Trustee the right to vote said stock ' at all meetings held after ninety days ' default In payment of any Installment of said loan , or In performance of any of first party 's agreements herein contained while such default con- I ttnues . The contract further provided for the election of a President and general manager of the development company by , three Directors to be named by the Southern - Pacific and for the appointment of all other officers by the President and - general manager . In this condition the organization of the California Development Company has remained during the subsequent months in which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developed into that of a $2,000,000 creditor of a corporation which is obliged to borrow more money from its benefactor to meet its monthly pay rolls .
