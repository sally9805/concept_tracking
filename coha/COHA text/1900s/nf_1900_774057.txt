txt // constitutional powers . No courts restrain them . France , like England , vests in her parliament a complete sovereignty of discretion as to its own acts . 400 . The principal difference between the two cases is , that the English Parliament may exercise all its powers in the same way , by the ordinary procedure of enactment , whether it changes by the act a mere detail of the common law or a chief arrangement of the constitution of the realm , while the French clambers are put under limitations of procedure in respect of every alteration of the fundamental law . 401 . The constitutional arrangements thus effected have this admirable difference from all other previous constitutions France has had since the Revolution : they do not pretend to constitute the whole body of her fundamental public law . They exclude neither precedent nor growth . In practice even the precedents of previous constitutions have been suffered to have a part in supplementing them . So much of former constitutional usage as is not incompatible with the laws and character of the Republic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no absolute break with the past , but only a new construction on old foundations . 402 . The Chamber of Deputies . ? t was the hope of the constitution-makers of 1ST. ; that the . Senate would have equal weight in affairs with the Chamber u1 ' Deputies ; but that hope has been disappointed . Effective power has fallen from the first to the popular chamber , and the Senate has been thrust into a secondary rule . O1 ' the choice of members of the Chamber of Deputies , the constitutional laws say no more than that they shall be elected by universal suffrage . ' Organic statute law has organized the Chamber on the basis of one deputy to every seventy thousand inhabitants . Deputies must be at least twenty-five years of age , and their term , unless the Chamber be sooner dissolved , is four years . The eighty-six Departments into which the country is divided are the basis of representation in the Chamber , as in the Senate ( see . 406 ) . To each Department is assigned a certain number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , whatever its population , being entitled to at least three representatives . The deputies are elected , not at large ' for the whole Department , that is , on a general ticket , but by districts , as members of our federal House of Representatives // are chosen in the States ( sec. 1286 ) . The Arrondissements serve as congressional districts , ' as we should call them , ? and this method of voting is accordingly known in France as scrutin d'arrondissement ( ballot by arrondissement ) . 403 . This was the original arrangement of 1875 ; but in 1885 the system of voting for deputies in each Department on a general ticket , as we vote for presidential electors in the States , was introduced , being called scrutin de liste ( ballot by list ) . It was adopted at the suggestion of Gambetta , who thought that a system of general tickets would give his party a freer sweep of popular majorities . lh 1889 , however , scrutin d'arrondissement was reestablished , because scrutin de liste had given too free a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The principal colonies , too , are entitled to representation in the Chamber . Algiers sends five deputies ; Cochin-China , Guadaloupe , Guyana , India , Martinique , natation , and Senegal each send one . All counted , there are five hundred and eightyfour deputies . Elections to the Chamber do not take place at regular intervals and on fixed dates named by statute , but must be ordered by decree from the President of the Republic in each case . The law directs , however , that the President must order an election within sixty days , or , in case of a dissolution , within two months after the expiration of a term of the Chamber ; and that the new Chamber must come together within the ten days following the election . At least twenty days must separate decree and day of election . 405 . Election by Majority . ? The law governing the election of Deputies provides against choice by plurality on the first ballot ; and the result is unfortunate . If there are more than two candidates in an electoral district ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is possible only if one of the candidates receives an absolute majority of all the votes cast not only , but also at least one-fourth as many votes as there are registered voters in the district . If no one receives such a majority , another vote must be taken two weeks later , and at this a plurality is sufficient to elect . The result is , that the multiplication of parties , or rather the multiplication of groups and factions within the larger party lines , from which France naturally suffers overmuch , is directly encouraged . Rival groups are tempted to show their strength on the first ballot in an election , for the purpose of winning a place or exchanging favor for favor in the second . They lose nothing by failing in the first ; they // may gain concessions or be more regarded another time by showing a little strength ; and rivalry is encouraged , instead of consolidation . France can not afford to foster factions . 406 . The Senate . ? By an act of the National Assembly passed August 14th , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ February 24th , 1875 , relating to the organization of the Senate and to the qualifications and election of senators was stripped of its constitutional ' character and became an ordinary statute . Four months later it was replaced by the act of December 9th , 1884 . In all that respects its organization and in much that respects its powers the Senate has become a merely statutory body . So far as the constitutional ' laws are concerned , it might be constituted by executive appointment or by lot . By statute it has been made to consist of three hundred members chosen by ' electoral colleges specially constituted for the purpose in the several Departments and colonies , and the term of senatorship has been fixed at nine years . Forty years has been declared the minimum age for senators . The electoral college for the choice of senators is composed in each Department of the deputies from the Department , the members of the General Council ' of the Department ( see . 447 ) , and the numbers of the Councils of its several Arrondissements ( see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commune by the Communal Council from among the qualified voters of the Commune ( sec. 464 ) . One-third of the membership of the Senate is renewed every three years . In legal powers the Senate is in all respects upon a footing of equality with the Chamber of Deputies , except that money bills must originate with the Chamber ; and though it has in practice been conceded that the Senate may amend them , it has been doubted whether it can of strict legal right add to money bills . In political power , of course , the Chamber overshadows and dominates the Senate . 407 . Until 1884 the law provided that seventy-five of the senatorial seats were to be filled by the choice of the Senate itself , and held for life . By virtue of the constitutional change effected in 1884 , all vacancies occurring in these life-memberships are now filled by election in the Departments , as other seats are , and for the usual term of nine years . This process will in time , of course , do away with all life-membership. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senators shall be elected by each Department . According to the present distribution ten are returned by the city of Paris , which itself constitutes the Department of the Seine . Other Departments vary in their representation from two to eight . " The following elect one senator each : the Territory of Belfort , the three Departments of Algeria , the four colonies , Martinique , Guadaloupe , Reunion , French Indies . " ( Law of Dec. 9 , 1884. ) 409 . In Case of Usurpation . ? In ease the Chambers should be illegally dissolved or hindered from assembling , the General Councils of the Departments are to convene without delay in their respective places of meeting and take the necessary steps for preserving order and quiet . Each Council is to choose two delegates to join delegates from the other Councils in assembling at the place whither the members of the legal government and the regular representatives of the people who have escaped the tyranny have betaken themselves . The extraordinary assembly thus brought together is authorized to constitute itself for business when half the Departments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that may be necessary to maintain order , administer affairs , and establish the independence of the regular Chambers . It is dissolved , ipso facto , so soon as the regular Chambers can come together . If that be not possible , it is to order a general election , within one month after its own assembling . 410 . The National Assembly : its Functions . ? The Senate and Chamber of Deputies meet together in joint session as a National Assembly for two purposes : the revision of the Constitution and the election of the President of the Republic . Since November , 1879 , the Houses have met for the performance of their ordinary legislative functions in Paris ; as a National Assembly they meet in Versailles , apart from the exciting influences of the great capital , which has led so many assemblies captive . Whether met for the election of the President or for the revision of the Constitution , the National Assembly must do the single thing which it has convened to do and then at once adjourn . For the election of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the office of President falls vacant , whether by the death or resignation of the President or by the expiration of his term . 911 . Revision of Constitution . ? A revision of the Constitution may take place whenever the two Houses are agreed that revision is necessary . It has , thus far , been customary for the Houses to consider separately beforehand not only the propriety // of a revision , ? that standing constitutional rules-require , ? but also the particular points at which revision is necessary and the lines on which it should proceed ; and to know each other 's minds on these important heads before agreeing to a National Assembly . Alike for the election of a President and for the adoption of constitutional amendments an absolute majority vote of the united Chambers suffices . 412 . It might easily happen that the majority in one of the Houses would be outvoted on joint ballot in National Assembly . If such were likely to be the case , that majority could hardly be expected to consent readily to a joint session . France has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is not always possible to effect the same combination of factions in support of a measure in both the houses . Cases must frequently arise in which a joint vote of the houses upon a particular measure would carry with it defeat to the policy preferred in one of them . And yet there is no legal obstacle to prevent the majority in a joint session taking up and deciding questions not agreed upon beforehand . The only guarantee is good faith . 413 . The National Assembly is the most completely sovereign body known to the Constitution , there being but one thing it can not do under existing law : it can not sit as long as it pleases . Its sessions must not exceed iii length the duration of an ordinary legislative session ( live months ) . It is , indeed , forbidden , besides , to consider the repeal of republican government ; but it could repeal the law which forbids it . 414 . The officers of the Senate act as officers of the National Assembly . They consist of a President , four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for one year . The Chamber of Deputies has the same offices , with the addition of two more secretaryships. 415 . The President of the Republic . ? The president , elected by the joint ballot of the Chambers , is titular head of the Executive of France . His term of office is seven years . He has the power of appointing and removing all officers of the public service . He has no veto on legislation , but he is authorized to demand a reconsideration of any measure by the Houses . lie can adjourn the Chambers at any time ( though not more than twice during the same session ) for any period not exceeding one month ; he can close a regular session of the Houses at his discretion after it has continued live months , and an extra session when he pleases ; and // he can , with the consent of the Senate , dissolve the Chamber of Deputies , even before the expiration of the five months of its regular session . A dissolution of the Chamber of Deputies puts an end also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Senate ; for it can not act , except as a court , without the Chamber . In the event of a dissolution , as has been said , the President must order a new election to be held within two months thereafter , and the Houses must convene within ten days after the election . " The President is responsible in case of high treason only , " says the constitutional law of February 25th , 1875 ; and , in case of high treason the Chamber must impeach , the Senate try , him . As a matter of fact , however , four out of the six Presidents of the Republic have been forced or have chosen to resign . Not one has completed his full term of seven years : for Carnot was assassinated and Faure has been ( 1897 ) but two years in office . 416 . The only limitation put by law upon the choice of the ' National Assembly in electing a President of the Republic is , that no one shall be chosen President who is a member of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these families are also excluded from seats in either the Chamber or the Senate . 417 . The President 's power of dissolving the Chamber might , on occasion , be used to bar even the proceedings of the National Assembly . The consent of the Senate having been obtained , the President could dissolve the Chamber while the National Assembly was in session , and so deprive that body of two-thirds of its members , leaving it without that absolute majority , ' lacking which it can take no authoritative action . Such a course would , however , be clearly revolutionary , ? more revolutionary than any action of the Assembly that it might be used to prevent , ? and would , though perhaps technically defensible , have no real sanction of law . 418 . Influence of President and Senate . ? The President and Senate , it will be seen , are given a really very great power of control over the Chamber of Deputies . It is within the choice of the President to moderate the excesses of the Chamber by returning bills to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period of too great excitement ; and it is within the choice of the President and Senate acting together to appeal from its decisions to the constituencies by a dissolution . The Senate , moreover , has once and again been given so many members of real weight of character and distinction of career that it would seem to have been in a position to act in restraint of the Chamber with firmness and success . But , though the National Assembly which elected Tiers and MacMahon // and put together the framework of the constitution may have intended the new government to be in some real sense a government by the President , it has in fact never shown the President in any degree a master in affairs since the days of MacMahon himself . MacMahon exercised the power of dissolution , with the approval of the Senate ; but the change of Deputies only taught him the real character of the government , as a government subject to the will of Ihe Chamber . Year by year the subordinate position of the Senate and the irregular but always irresistible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The later presidents have been men of so little commanding force and the Senate has played so timid a part in affairs that their position of advantage has been altogether sacrificed ; and the unbridled license of the Chamber constitutes one of the chief menaces to the success and even to the existence of the Republic . 419 . The Cabinet and the Council of Ministers . ? A Cabinet of ministers constitutes a link between the President and the Chambers : and the political functions of this Cabinet are amongst the central features of government in France . It is to be carefully distinguished from the Council of ministers ; both the Cabinet and the Council consist of the same persons ; but the Cabinet is a political body exclusively , while the Council has only administrative functions . The distinction illustrates pointedly the double capacity of the ministers . 420 . The Ministries . ? ' There are now eleven ministers : the Minister of Justice , filling the office filled before the Revolution by the Chancellor ; the Minister of Finance , who has taken the place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the Minister of War , who acts as head of the administrative department created in the time of Mazarin ( 1644 ) ; the Minister of Marine and the Colonies ( 1644 ) ; the Minister of Foreign Affairs ( 1644 ) ; the Minister of the Interior , an office created by the Constituent Assembly in 1791 , by a consolidation of the pre-revolutionary offices of Comptroller-General and Minister of the Royal Household , except so far as the functions of the Comptroller-General were financial and bestowed upon the Minister of Finance ; the Minister of Public Instruction ( 1848 ) , Religion ( 1848 ) , and the Fine Arts ; the Minister of Public Works ; the Minister of Agriculture ( an office created in 1812 , but after wards abolished , to be revived in 1828-30 ) ; the Minister of Trade ana Industry ; and the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs . These last two offices were created in 1848 by subtraction from the department of the Interior . 421 . The Cabinet . ? As a Cabinet , the ministers represent the Chambers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Houses ; but , whether members or not , they have , as ministers , the right to attend all sessions of the Chambers and to take a specially privileged part in debate . The same right extends also to the Under-secretaries of Finance , of the Interior , of the Colonies , and of Fine Arts , who are , consequently , usually members of the Chambers . A minister may speak at any time in the Chambers ; not even the cloture ( previous question ) can exclude him . In 1888 the Minister of War was without a seat in the Chamber . 422 . The Council of Ministers . ? As an administrative Council the ministers are , in official rank at least , subordinate to the President , who is the Chief Executive . The Council sits in his presence , though not under his presidency , but under that of a special President of the Council ' chosen by the ministers from amongst their own number . Its duty is to exercise a general oversight of the administration of the laws , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state . In case of the death , resignation , or incapacitation of the President of the Republic , the Council is to act in his stead until the National Assembly can meet and elect his successor . Its members are ex officio members of the Council of State , the highest judicial tribunal of the Republic for the determination of administrative cases ( sec. 468 ) . 423 . Relation of the Ministers to the President . ? The Council of Ministers is a body recognized by law , the Cabinet is not : it is only the ministers in consultation concerning matters affecting their political responsibility : it is , aside from such meetings for consultation , only a name representing their union in responsibility . But the two names , Council and Cabinet , furnish convenient means for making plain the various relations of the ministers to the President . As a Council they are , in a sense , his creation ; as a Cabinet they are , in a sense , his masters . The Executive Departments or Ministries over which they preside are the creation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the President 's decree . No decree of the President is valid , however , unless countersigned by the minister whose department is affected . Any such decree must , too , almost necessarily affect the budget , and must in that way come within the control of the ministers // and the Chambers . The ministers are the President 's appointees ; but he must appoint ministers who are in agreement with the majority in the Chambers , and they are responsible to the Chambers alone for their conduct in office . The President is the head of the administration ; but his salary is dependent upon the annual budget which the Minister of Finance presents to the Chambers : and the items of the budget are matter of agreement between the ministers and the Chambers . 424 . All these buts ' are so many fingers pointing to the power of the Cabinet over the President . The Ministers are in fact not his representatives , but representatives of the Chambers . In this capacity they control not the policy only , but also the patronage of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they do in every case , the countersignature of a minister , are in general the appointments of the ministers ; and their appointments are too often bestowed according to their interest in the Chambers , ? are too often used , in short , to be cast as bait for votes . 425 . The Patronage of Office , indeed , threatens to become even more of a menace to good govern moot in F ' 111 ce thou it has been to good government in our own coludry under the federal system of appointment . The munber of ounces in the gift of the minister in France is vastly greater than the manlier wil I in the gift of the ' resident of the United States ; and the ministers ' need to please the Chambers by favors of any and all kinds is i its niharably greater than our President 's need to please Congross , since they are dependent upon the good-will of the Chambers for their tenure of office , while he is not dependent on Congress for his . 426 . There have never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removals from office upon the going out of one administration and the coming in of another as we have seen again and again in this country ; because there has really been no radical change of administration in France since the days of MacMahon . In this country , as in England , there are two great national parties , and the government is now in the hands of one and again in the hands of the other . But in France a change of cabinet means nothing more than a change from the leadership of one group of Republicans to the leadership of another , ? or , at most , a change from the leadership of Republicans to the leadership of Radicals , who are simply extreme republicans . In England we hear of " Her Majesty 's Opposition " : the party of the minority for the time being is known to be as patriotic , as much attached to the existing form of government , as safe to entrust power to , should it obtain a majority in the Commons , as the // party in office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very recent years , the only real party opposed to the Republicans was made up of persons known or suspected to be hostile to the very form of government under which the country is living . The people have never given it a majority in the Chamber , and have never been willing to entrust it with office . One group of Republicans , therefore , succeeds another ; one faction goes out of office , another comes in . Generally a new cabinet , just come in , is composed in part of men who held office also in the cabinet just thrust out . It is a change only of chief figures . And so wholesale removals from office do not take place . 427 . Ministerial Responsibility . ? The responsibility of the ministers to the Chambers is of law , and not simply of custom as in England . Their tenure of office is dependent upon the favor of the Houses . It would doubtless be so without law , for no policy of theirs could succeed without legislative approval and support , and it is French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defeated . They resign because they will not carry out measures of which they disapprove . In theory their responsibility is to both Houses ; but , as a matter of fact , it is only to the Chamber of Deputies . The votes of the Senate alone seldom make or unmake Cabinets ; that has come to be recognized as the prerogative of the popular Chamber , which is more directly representative of the nation . 428 . Questions and Interpellations . ? The ministers may be held closely to their responsibility at every turn of their policy by means of various simple and effective forms of inquiry on the part of the Chambers . First of all is the direct question . Any member of either IIouse may , after due notice given to the minister concerned , ask any question as to affairs of state ; and an answer is demanded , by custom at least , to every question which can be answered publicly without detriment to the public interest . Next to the direct question , which is a matter between the individual questioner and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy of the Cabinet , known in France as the Interpellation . ' The simple questioner must first get the consent of the minister to hear his question ; an interpellation , on the contrary , can be brought on without awaiting the acquiescence of the minister . It is a special and formal challenge of the policy or action of the Cabinet on some matter of the day , and is // commonly the occasion of a general debate . It usually results in a vote expressive of confidence or want of confidence in the ministers , as the case may be . It is the question exalted into a subject of formal discussion : it is the weightiest form of interrogating ministers : it makes them and all that they have done the objects of set attack and defence . A third and still more formal method of bringing administrative acts under the scrutiny of the Chambers consists in the appointment of a Committee of Investigation . 429 . The power of interpellation has been so indiscriminately and unwisely used in France as seriously to discredit her system of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intemperate body , and it seems constantly inclined to make of government a game at which it may match its wits with those of the ministers of the day . Interpellation is unhesitatingly used to take the ministers by surprise . Deputies lie in wait to take them at a disadvantage . They are ' interpellated , ' moreover , most often , not upon questions of first-rate importance or in any way representative of their policy , but upon trivial matters of the moment . A sudden impulse upon a minor question of administration often determines the vote , and a cabinet goes out , it , may be , as if by a trick , ? not because its policy has been rejected or discredited , but because a chance and tet suer inajorily has been got together against it . It is said that " out of the twenty-nine ministries that have resigned in consequence of a vote of the ( ; hamper of Deputies since the cabinet has been nnule respensib , ten have fallen on account of orders of the day moved after an interpellation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orders covered , indeed , the general policy of the cabinet , but others had no such broad significance . " ( Lowell , 1. , 122. ) 430 . The ministers are , therefore , hardly more than nominally the leaders of the Chamber , holding their authority for brief periods and upon a very precarious tenure . For a little they represent a combination of Republican groups ; they have almost never since the establishment of the Republic had a thoroughly homogeneous majority behind them . The Chamber treats them as if they were still the agents and appointees of a monarch , instead of its own representatives , and is jealous and suspicinns of them at every turn . The system no doubt awaits for its successful operation the formation of two coherent national parties , capable of organizing for government instead of merely for rivalry . 431 . The Course of Legislation . ? All propositions alike , whether made by ministers or by private members , have to go to a special committee for consideration before reaching a debate and vote by // the whole House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test before they reach even a special committee . They must go first to the Monthly Committee on Parliamentary Initiative , ' and it is only after hearing the report of that Committee upon bills submitted to it that the House determines whether particular measures shall be taken under further consideration and advanced to the special-committee stage . A vote of emergency taken upon the introduction of a measure can , however , rescue a ministerial bill from all committee handling , and a private member 's bill from the delays of the Initiative Committee . 432 . The Committees . ? The committee organization of the House is worthy of special remark . Every month during the session , the members of the Chamber of Deputies are divided by lot into eleven , those of the Senate into nine , Bureaux . These Bureaux select four monthly committees , ' one on Leave , ' one on ' Petitions , ' one on Parliamentary Initiative , ' and one on Local Interests , ' and one annual committee on the Budget , ? each Bureau contributing its member or members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committees to which bills are referred , except when the House prefers itself to elect a committee ; and they themselves consider matters referred to them . 433 . It will be seen that this arrangement , making the composition of the Bureaux dependent upon lot , as it does , and providing for the monthly reconstitution alike of the Bureaux and of the committees which they select , must effectually prevent the recognition or maintenance of party lines in the formation either of the Bureaux or of the committees , and seems in that way very well adapted to check the factional ardors of the Chamber . But the very existence of committees and of the matter-ofcourse reference of all measures to their consideration , means that the Chamber insists upon examining and sifting all proposals for itself , whether they have been introduced by the ministers or not . It means , consequently , that the leadership of the ministers is thus still further broken and embarrassed . The committees will always insist upon putting some touch at least of their own handiwork upon the bills submitted to them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposals pulled about and altered . 434 . The Budget Committee . ? All financial matters are considered by special standing committees chosen for one year ; in // the Chamber of Deputies by a Budget Committee composed of thirty-three members , and in the Senate by a Finance Committee composed of eighteen members ; and these Committees , like other standing committees , arrogate to themselves something like abso lute domination of the financial policy of the government , with the result of robbing financial legislation of order and consistency , and of sadly obscuring the responsibility of the ministers . Other committees simply consider and report ; the Budget Committee undertakes often radically to revise , sometimes altogether to transform , ministerial proposals , originating when it was meant only to control . ' 435 . Government by the Chambers . ? Ministerial responsibility has rapidly degenerated in France , during the past few years , into gov ernment by the Chambers , or , worse still , government by the Chamber of Deputies . Ministerial responsibility is compatible with ministerial leader-ship ; and under a ministry really given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chambers judging and controlling but not directing , that policy might have dignity , consistency , and strength . But in France the ministers have , more and more as the years of the Republic have multi-plied , been made to substitute for originative leadership submissive obedi ence , complete servility to the wishes , and even to the whims , of the Chamber of Deputies . The extraordinary ' unctions which have been arbitrarily assumed by lie Budget Cennuittee simply mirror the whole political situation in France . The Chamber has undertaken to govern , with or without the leadership of ministers . So capricious , so wilful has it been in its rejection of every minister who would not at once willingly serve its moods , so impatient indeed of all real ministerial leadership , that almost every public man of experience and ability in France has now been in one way or another discredited by its action ; and France is staggering under that most burdensome , that most intolerable of all forms of gov-ernment , government by mass meeting , ? by an inorganic popular assem-bly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again called forth so loud a demand for a revision of the Constitution , and which has seemed upon at least one notable occasion to create an opportunity for another return to some sort of dictatorship . 436 . The Administrative and Judicial Powers of the Executive . ? It must not be supposed , because the life of a ministry is short and its leadership in the houses uncertain , that it wholly lacks power while it lasts . It inherits the traditional prerogatives of the // French Executive , and they are very great . The powers of the President are the powers of the ministers . His power to execute and administer the laws means , according to the immemorial practice in France , that he may not only freely interpret the laws but may also supplement them to meet circumstances and cover cases which the legislature did not foresee or provide for . He may not disregard the plain principles of the law , indeed , but he need not be restrained by its detail ; and in shaping administrative arrangements , instructing officials , and developing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authority exercised by the ministers through the President 's decrees is in most cases wholly free from the trammels of statute . The Executive is expected to shape the laws to the cases that arise , and to supplement them where they lack completeness . The laws are , accordingly , for the most part themselves without detailed provisions . They give the officers of state who are to execute them a principle by which to go rather than a body of minute instructions . The legality of administrative action , moreover , is tested , when challenged , not by the ordinary courts of law , in which private rights are determined and guarded , but by special administrative tribunals in which the utmost latitude of discretion on the part of officers of state is the principle chiefly respected and enforced . The Executive inherits a very absolute tradition of power . 437 . The President 's power to ' dispose of the armed force ' of the nation has been employed in such a way as almost to amount to a declaration of war , in some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves to be drawn . There goes with the executive power of appointment , too , an absolute power of removal from office , and all the vast official machinery of a centralized state is under the hands of the ministers to use almost as they will . 438 . Departmental Functions . ? The main duties of most of the Departments are sufficiently indicated by their names . The Ministry of Justice controls the administration of civil , criminal , and commercial law ; in other words , is set over the judicial system of the country . Not over the whole of it , however . The strict differentiation of functions insisted upon in France assigns to the Ministry of War , the Ministry of Marine , and the Minis234 THE GOVERNMENT OF FRANCE . try of the Interior respectively , the administration of military , marine , and administrative law . The Ministry of Foreign Affairs controls the relations of France with foreign countries . The Ministry of the Interior undertakes all duties not assigned to any other executive Department . That of Finance collects , handles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That of War directs all military affairs . That of Marine and the Colonies has , added to the duty of managing the navy , the duty of acting for the colonies as all departments in one . The Ministry of Public Instruction , Religion , and the Fine Arts organizes and oversees education , from the primary schools up to the University , mediates between church and state , buys works of art for the state , directs the public art-schools , museums , and art-exhibitions , subsidizes the theatres , exercises a censorship over the drama , superintends conservatories and schools of music and oratory , and supervises the state manufactories of Sevres ware and tapestry . The Ministry of Public Works is entrusted with the management of the public highways , including the railways , and of the state mines , with the inspection of shipping and the care of seaports and lighthouses , and with the direction of the schools of engineering and architecture . The Ministry of . hr'ricudture is charged with the care of the forests , the proper irrigation of the country , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulations with reference to cattle diseases , and the administration of the various aids given by law to agriculture . The Ministry of Trade and Industry undertakes to provide for the interior commerce of the country the facilities afforded by special courts of law , bourses and chambers of commerce , duly commissioned middle-men and factors , life-insurance companies , savings banks , and accident funds , the official examination and warranty of certain classes of manufactured goods , the policing of markets , and the granting of patents and trade-marks ; for the foreign commerce of the country , it regulates duties and imposts , offers premiums for shipbuilding and seamanship , and collects statistics . A. special Bureau of Industrial Societies ' was added to this Department in 1886 . The Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs sees to the carrying and delivery of the mails , and to the telegraphic service of the country . // 439 . The duties of most of these ministries illustrate the range of function assumed by the government in France ( secs . 1479 , 1480 ) more conspicuously than they illustrate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the political life of France is to be found in the organization of the Ministry of the Interior , which is more largely concerned than any other Department with the multifarious details of local government . LOCAL GOVERNMENT . 440 . France still preserves the administrative divisions created by the Constituent Assembly in December , 1789 . Instead of the old system of ecclesiastical dioceses , military provinces , and administrative generalities ' ( see . 385 ) , with their complexities and varieties of political regulation and local privilege , there is a system , above all things simple and symmetrical , of Departments divided into Arrondissements , Arrondissements divided into Cantons , and Cantons divided into Communes . Much the most significant of these divisions is the Department : whether for military , judicial , educational , or political administration , it is the important , the persistent unit of organization ; arrondissement , canton , and commune are only divisions of the Department , ? not fractions of France , but only fractions of her Departments . The canton , indeed , is little more than an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheel in the administration of the Department . The symmetry of local government is perfect throughout . Everywhere the central government superintends the local elective bodies ; and everywhere those bodies enjoy the same privileges and are hedged in by the same limitations of power . 441 . The several parts of the system of local government in France will thus be seen to rest , not upon any historical groundwork , creating each a vital whole , with traditions of local selfgovernment handed clown from an older time of freedom , but upon a bureaucratic groundwork of system . If , therefore , France is now approaching confirmed democracy and complete self-government , as there is good reason to believe she is , she is building , not upon a basis of old habit , fixed firmly in the stiff soil of wont // and prejudice , but upon a basis of new habit widely separated from old wont , depending upon the shifting soil of new develop ments of character , new aptitudes , new purposes . Her new ways run across , not with , the grain of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resting upon something already made . 442 . The Department ; the Prefect . ? The central figure of French administration is the Prefect , the legal successor of the Intendant ( sec. 384 ) . He is the agent of the central government in the Department . He is the recruiting officer of that district , its treasurer , its superintendent of schools , ' its chief of police , its executive officer in all undertakings of importance , and the ap pointer of most of its subordinate officials . He fills a double capacity : he is the agent and appointee of the central govern ment , and at the same time the agent of the local legislative authorities . IIe is at once member and overseer of the General Council of his Department ; and he is necessarily its agent , inas much as he commands , as representative of the authorities in Paris , all the instrumentalities through which its purposes must be effected . A minister can veto any net of a Prefect , ? for he is the representative of any minister who needs his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can override him and act by his own direct authority . Until he is dismissed the minister must act through him . 413 . When acting as the agent of the central authorities in carrying out the provisions of general statutes or of general ad ministrative regulations the Prefect has , of course , no choice but to obey the orders he receives from the ministers in Paris . But when he acts in local matters , he may use his own discretion and can be brought to book only by judicial process and upon com plaint . It is of great consequence , therefore , that his powers in the field of local government are so many and so important . He prepares the budget of the Department not only but also all the other business upon which the General Council of the Department ( sees . 447-452 ) is expected to act . His initiative determines the greater part of what that Council does ; and it can act only through him in getting its resolutions carried into effect . His police // power extends beyond the organization and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at any rate , indirect control of , the police organization and the police regulations of the Communes , many of which are great cities , with elective officers of their own ( sec. 458 ) . Every mayor 's police appointments must be confirmed by him , and he alone can remove police officials from office in the Communes . Police ' affairs , in France , moreover , cover not merely the preservation of order and the enforcement of the law , but also such important matters as those , for example , which concern the public health . In respect of some matters of local management , too , the Prefect can act by direct orders of his own , addressed to the officials of the Communes , as if to his own immediate subordinates . He can in his discretion suspend the mayor of a Commune from office for a month 's time ; he can suspend also the session of a communal council ( sec. 464 ) for a like period . 444 . The Prefect may take part in the proceedings of the General Council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are being considered . 445 . Such is the legal position of the Prefect . His actual position is somewhat different . The politics of the Republic , one of whose tendencies has been to contribute by degrees to local self-government , is making the Prefect more and more largely the executive agent of the General Council of his Department ; and has , moreover , already made his office a party prize . lie is appointed by the Minister of the Interior and is in law first of all and chiefly the representative of the Interior . P , ut the other ministers also , as has been said , act through him in many things . The result is that his office is often emptied and filled again upon a change of ministers , ? a change , that is , of the ruling group in the Chamber . He frequently owes his appointment to the favorable influence of the deputies and senators from his Department with the Minister of the Interior and he is kept , by his personal relations with them , close to local influences . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under Napoleon . Iie is , rather , the trimmer to local opinion too often found under popular governments . 446 . The Spoils System in France . ? French administration in all its branches , indeed , and in all grades of its service , from the lowest to the highest , has suffered profound corruption through the introduction of the fatal idea that public office may and should be used as a reward for party or personal services . Ministers have adopted , all too readily , the damning practice of distributing offices among their party followers as pay for party activity , and even among the friends and constituents of deputies , // ? in exchange for support in the Chamber . And of course , when short of gifts to bestow , the temptation is to empty as many offices as possible of opponents or luke-warm friends in order to have places to give away . This policy is likely to be doubly fatal to good government in France because of the very frequent changes of ministry at present characteristic of her politics . ( Compare secs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Department . ? The legislative body of the Department is the General Council , which is made up of representatives chosen , one from , each canton , by universal suffrage . Except during a session of the Chambers , the President of the Republic may at any time dissolve the General Council of a Department for cause . The election of representatives to the General Council , like the election of deputies , does not take place upon days set by statute , but on days set by decree of the President . Councillors are elected for a term of six years , one-half of the membership of the Council being renewed every three years . In order that members of the General Council may be in fact representatives of at least a respectable number of the voters of the cantons , the law provides , as the case of the election of Deputies ( see . 406 ) , that no one shall be elected on a first ballot unless voted for on that ballot by ; tn absolute majority in a poll of at least one-fourth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the election by the failure of a first ballot , a plurality will suffice to elect on a second . In ease of a tie , the older candidate is to be declared elected . 448 . The membership of the Council varies in the several Departments , according to the number of cantons , from seventeen to sixty-two. 449 . The General Council is judge of the validity of elections to its own membership ; but it is not the final judge . An appeal lies from its decisions to the Council of State . A seat may be contested on the initiative either of a member of the Council , the Prefect , or a constituent of the member whose rights are in question . 450 . There are two regular sessions of the General Council each year . The duration of both is limited by law : for the first to fifteen days , for the second to one month . Extra sessions of eight days will be called by the President of the Republic at the written request of two-thirds of the members . If the Council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be dissolved by the Prefect ; // if it overstep its jurisdiction in any-matter , its acts may be annulled by a decree of the President . Members are liable to penalties for non-attendance or neglect of duty . They are , however , on the other hand , paid nothing for their services . 451 . At the first regular session of the year the Council considers general business ; at the second and longer session it discusses the budget of the department , presented by the Prefect , and audits the accounts of the year . At either session it may require from the Prefect or any other chief of the departmental service full oral or , if it choose , written replies to all questions it may have to ask with reference to the administration . 452 . The supervisory and regulative powers of the General Council are of considerable importance ; but its originating powers are of the most restricted kind . It has the right to appropriate certain moneys for the expenses of local government , but it has not the right to tax for any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is to use are determined by the Chambers in Paris . Even such narrowed acts of appropriation as it can pass have to be confirmed by presidential decree . Its chief functions are directory , not originative . It sees to the renting and maintenance of the buildings needed for its own use , for the use of the Prefect and his subordinates , for the use of the public schools , and for the use of the local courts ; it votes the pay of the police ( gendarmerie ) of the Department ; provides for the cost of printing the election lists ; supervises the administration of the roads , railroads , and public works of the Department ; oversees the management of lunatic asylums and the relief of the poor . Most important of all , it apportions among the several arrondissements the direct taxes annually voted by the Chambers . 453 . The Departmental Commission . ? During the intervals between its sessions , the General Council is represented in local administration by a committee of its own members called the Depastnnental Commission , which it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this Commission , however , are merely advisory . 454 . Central Control . ? The most noticeable feature of this system is the tutelage in which local bodies and the individual citizen himself are kept . Fines compel the members of the General Council to do their work , and then every step of that work // is liable to be revised by the central administration . Irregularities in the election of a member may be brought to the attention of the General Council by the Prefect , as well as by its own members or by petition from the constituency affected . If the Council overstep the limits of its powers , it is checked by decree , and not by such a challenging of its acts in the courts by the persons affected as , in English or American practice , strengthens liberty by making the individual alert to assert the law on his own behalf , instead of trusting inertly to the government to keep all things in order . Even expression of opinion on the part of the General Council is restricted . It may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interests , if only it never express a wish which has a political character . ' 455 . The Arrondissement is the electoral district for the Chamber of Deputies , the members of the Chamber of Deputies being elected , as we have seen , not at large , ' for the whole Department , but by Arrondissements , ? not by scrutin de liste , that is , but by scrutin d'arrondissement ( see . 404 ) . It also serves as a judicial district and as the province of an arroiidissemental Council . The Council of the Arrondissement ( eoicnit , d'arrondissement ) , elected from the cantons , like the General Council of the Department , has no more important fnnetion than that of subdividing among the communes the quota of taxes charged to the Arrondissement by the General Council . For the rest , it merely gives advice to administrative officers appointed by the ministers in Paris . Its decisions are largely controlled by the Prefect , and may be annulled by the President of the Republic . 45G . The Canton is the electoral district from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Council of the Arrondissement ; it marks the jurisdiction of the Justice of the Peace ; it is a muster district for the army , and serves as a territorial unit of organization for registration and for the departmental care of roads ; but it has no administrative organization of its own . It is a mere region of convenient size for electoral and like purposes . 457 . The Commune , unlike the arrondissement and canton , is as vital an organism as the Department . All towns are communes ; but there is , of course , a much larger number of rural than of town communes. // 458 . There are 36,170 Communes , most of which have less than 1500 inhabitants and many of which have less than 500 . One hundred and seventeen have more than 20,000 . Every city of France , except Paris and Lyons , is organized as a Commune. 459 . The general rule of French administration is centralization , the direct representation of the central authority , through appointed officers , in every grade of local government , and the ultimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paris . In one particular this rule is departed from in the Commune . The chief executive officer of the Commune , the mayor , is elected , not appointed . He is chosen by the Municipal Council from among its own members , and is given one or more assistants elected in the same way . 460 . Down to 1874 the mayors of the more populous Communes were appointed by the authorities in Paris , the mayors of the smaller Communes by the Prefects . Between 1831 and 1852 the choice of the appointing power was confined to the members of the Municipal Councils ; between 1852 and 1874 the choice might be made outside those bodies . From 1874 to 1882 the smaller Communes elected their mayors , indirectly as now . Since 1882 all mayors have been elected . 461 . The Communal Magistracy . ? The mayor and his assistants do not constitute an executive board : the mayor 's assistants are not his colleagues . He is head of the communal government : they have their duties assigned to them by him . The mayor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but to the central administration and its departmental representative , the Prefect . Once elected , he becomes the direct representative of the Minister of the Interior . If he will not do the things which the laws demand of him in this capacity , the Prefect may delegate some one else to do them , or even do them himself instead . For cause , both the mayor and his assistants may be suspended , by the Prefect for one month , by the Minister of the Interior for three months , and all their acts are liable to be set aside either by Prefect or minister . They may even be removed by the Executive . 462 . In case of a removal it is the duty of the Municipal Council to fill the vacancies , and to fill them with other men ; for removal renders the mayor or his assistants ineligible for one year . // 463 . One of the duties of the mayor is to appoint the police force and other subordinate officers of the Commune ; but in Communes of over forty thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be ratified by decree , and in other Communes all his appointments must be confirmed by the Prefect. 464 . The Municipal Council . ? There is in every Commune a Municipal Council ( of from ten to thirty-six members , according to the size of the commune ) which has , besides its privilege of electing the mayor and his assistants , pretty much the same place in the government of the Commune that the General Council has in the government of the Department ; and , in the main , a like dependence upon the approval of the central administration . Unlike the General Council , the Municipal Council is liable to be suspended for one month by the Prefect ; like the General Council , it may be dissolved by decree of the President passed in the Council of Ministers . It holds four regular sessions each year , one of which it devotes to the consideration of the municipal budget , which is presented by the mayor . Its financial session may continue six weeks ; none of its other sessions may last more than fourteen days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own accounts are under consideration . 465 . Neither Ihe . Municipal Council nor the Council of the Arrondissement is judge of he vnlidily of the elections of its members . Contested election erases : cc hear ( i l ) y the Prefectural Council ( sec. 469 ) . 466 . Until 18 ; 11 the Municipal Council was chosen by the Prefect from a list of qualified persons made up in the Commune . Between 1831 and 1848 its members were elected by a restricted suffrage . Since 1848 they have been elected by universal suffrage . 467 . In case of a dissolution of the Municipal Council , its place may be taken , for the oversight of current necessary matters , by a delegation of from three to seven members appointed by the President of the Republic to act till another election can be had . This delegation can not , however , take upon itself more than the merely directory powers of the Council . 468 . Administrative Courts : the Council of State . ? So thorough is the differentiation of functions in France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administration are instituted , not in the regular law courts connected with the Ministry of Justice , but in special administrative courts connected with the Ministry of the Interior . French thought , inherited from days of unTHE // bounded royal prerogative , makes sharp separation between Public Law , which concerns the action of the government , and Private Law , which concerns the relations of individuals to one another . The ordinary courts will determine the rights of an individual when they concern the action of another individual ; but the special courts of the administration must determine the questions involved in any challenge of official action , ? in any challenge of the public power . ( Comp. sec. 437 . ) The highest of these courts is the Council of State , which is composed of the ministers , and of various high administrative officers of the permanent service . It is the court of last resort on administrative questions . It is also charged with the duty of giving advice to the Chambers or to the government on all questions affecting administration that may be referred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Below the Council of State are the Prefectural Council , a Court of Revision , a Superior Council of Public Instruction , and a Court of Audit . These are not subordinate to each other : each is directly subordinate to the Council of State . The Prefectural Council is directly associated with the Prefect and is the most important of them . It has , amongst other weighty functions , that of determining the validity of elections to the Council of the Arrondissement and to the Municipal Council . ? For the rest , it has jurisdiction over all administrative questions , and over all conflicts between administrative authority and private rights . Its processes of trial and adjudication are briefer and less expensive than those of the ordinary law courts . In almost all cases an appeal lies to the Council of State . 470 . , The Prefect is the legal representative of the government in cases brought before the Prefectural Council ; but that court is not at all under his dominance . It is composed of permanent judges , one of whom , at least , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appointed , and , for cause , are removable , by the central administration . 471 . Each minister is himself a judge of first instance in cases whose consideration is not otherwise provided for , an appeal almost always lying , however , to the Council of State . Prefects and mayors are , in like manner , judges of first instance in certain small cases . // THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE . 472 . Ordinary Courts of Justice . ? The supreme court of France is the Cassation Court ( the Court , that is , of reversals or appeals ) which sits at Paris . Next below it in rank are twenty-six Courts of Appeal , the jurisdiction of each of which extends over several Departments . These hear cases brought up from the courts of first instance which sit in the capital towns of the arrondissements . These last consider cases from the Justices of the Peace , who hold court for the adjudication of small cases in the cantons . By decree of the President , passed in the Council of Ministers , the Senate may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeming to involve the safety of the state ; and such questions may be removed by the same authority from the ordinary courts . 473 . The appointment of all judges rests with the President , or , rather , with the Minister of Justice ; and the tenure of the judicial office , except in the case of Justices of the Peace , is during good behavior . In the ease of Justices of the Peace , the President has power to remove . 474 . Jury Courts .  --  In France , the ordinary civil courts are without juries ; the judges decide all questions of fact as well as all questions of law . There are , however , special jury courts ( corers d'ussi.se , $ ) constituted four times a year in each Department for the trial of crimes , and of political and press offences ; and in these the jury is sole judge of the guilt or innocence of the accused ; the judges determine the punishment . 475 . Tribunal of Conflicts . ? Between the two sets of courts , the administrative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whose province it is to determine to which jurisdiction , the administrative or the ordinary , any ease belongs whose proper destination , or forum , is in dispute . This Tribunal consists of the Privy Seal as president , of three State Councillors chosen by their colleagues , and of three members of the Cassation Court selected , in like manner , by their fellow-judges , besides two . members chosen by those already mentioned . ? VII . THE GOVERNMENTS OF GERMANY . 476 . The Feudalization of Germany was in some points strongly contrasted with the feudalization of France . There was in Germany no Romanized subject population such as existed in Gaul , with habits which should enter like a leaven into the polity of their conquerors . Beyond the Rhine all were of one general kin , all bred to the same general customs . What was new there was the great Frankish kingship of Merowingian and Carolingian , ? the new size and potency of the regal power bred amidst the readjustments of conquering migration by the dominant Franks . For the rest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hereditary princes , the old tribal individualities of custom , the old organization into separate , semi-independent , self-governing communities . Feudalism came , not so much through fresh gifts of land and novel growths of privilege based upon such fresh gifts , not so much through benefice ' and commendation ' ( secs . 305-308 , 310 ) , as through the official organization of the Frankish monarchy . 477 . Official System of the Frankish Monarchy : the Grafen . ? In order to exercise their kingly powers the more effectually , the Frankish monarchs adopted the natural plan , for which there was Roman precedent , of delegating their functions to officers commissioned to act as their representatives in various districts of their extensive domains . There does not seem to have been any symmetrical division of the territory into districts to fit the official system . Here and there there were counts ( Grafen ) , the king 's vicegerents in the exercise of the financial , judicial , and military prerogatives of overlordship ; but the limits of their jurisdiction were not always sharply defined . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exemptions from their authority within the general districts allotted them . There were the dignity and pretensions of provincial princes to be respected ; more important still , there were the claims of the great landowners to a special jurisdiction and independent lordship of their own to be regarded . As a matter of policy such claims were generally allowed . The demesnes of the greater landowners were cut out from the administrative territory of the Graf and given separate political functions . Barons , such as we have seen in France , ? local autocrats with law courts and a petty sovereignty of their own , ? were freely created . The king apparently could not deny them the ' immunities they demanded . 478 . The Magistracy of Office and the Magistracy of Proprietorship . ? There thus grew up , side by side , a double magistracy ? a magistracy of office and a magistracy of proprietorship . The Graf ruled by virtue of his office ; the baron by virtue of his landed possessions : there were lords by privilege ( Irnrrnunitdtsherren ) , and lords by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magnates drew nearer and nearer to the possession of a common character through an interchange of qualities . The office of Graf tended more and more to become hereditary and to connect itself with the ownershil , of large estates . Heredity of title and prerogative was the almost irresistible fashion of the age : the men of greatest individual consequence , besides , ? the men who were fit because of their individual weight to be delegated to exercise the royal authority , ? were commonly the men of large properties . Either there went , therefore , along with the grafship , gifts of land , or else men already sufficiently endowed with lands were given the grafship : and as the office connected itself with proprietorship it took from proprietorship its invariable quality of heredity . This was the double process : Grcr fs became hereditary territorial lords ; and hereditary territorial lords acquired either the grafship itself or powers quite as great . 479 . Hereditary Chiefs . ? Add to this hierarchy the more ancient princes of the tribes , and the tale of greater lords @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least , rulers of the once self-governing communities which Frankish ascendency had in the days of conquest united under a common authorTHE // ity . In many cases , no doubt , they retained a vital local sway . They were intermediate , in the new political order , between the king and the barons . 480 . Full Development of Territorial Sovereignty . ? By the thirteenth century German feudalization was complete . Princes ( dukes ) , Grafs , and barons had all alike become lords within their own territories ( Landesherrem ) . Bishops and abbots , too , as in France , had entered the competition for power and become themselves Grafs and barons . That territorial sovereignty , that private ownership of political authority which is the distinguishing mark of feudalism , and which we have seen so fully developed in France , is present in as full development here in Germany also . But the elements of the development are very different in the two countries . In France we have seen the appointment of royal delegates come after the perfecting of feudalism and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authority in the king 's hands , to the undermining and final overthrow of baronial sovereignty ( secs . 380 , 385 ) . In Germany , on the contrary , the royal representatives , appointed while feudalism was taking shape , themselves entered and strengthened the baronage , quitting their dependent functions as officials for the independent privileges of territorial lords . 481 . The Markgraf . ? One office especially fostered feudal independence in Germany . Outside the hierarchy I have described , and standing in special relations with the king , was the Markgraf , ? the Graf of the Mark or border , set to defend the kingdom against inroads by hostile peoples . He was of course chosen chiefly because of his capacity in war , and was of the most imperative , masterful soldier breed of the times . To him , too , were necessarily vouchsafed from the first extraordinary powers . He was made virtual dictator in the " unsettled , ill-ordered border district which he was appointed to hold against foreign attack ; and he was freely given all the territory he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ king . It was thus that the Mark Brandenburg spread itself out to the northeast , to become at last a great kingdom , and that the Ostmark , established by Charles the Great as a barrier against the Hungarians , increased till it became the great state of Austria . The Markgraf was not // long in becoming virtually a ruler in his own right , little disturbed by the nominal suzerainty of a distant monarch , and possessed by fast hereditary right of the titles and powers which would one day make of him a veritable king . 482 . The Empire . ? Charles the Great set for his successors the example of a wide rule and a Roman title . But for many a long age it seemed as if he had left behind him nothing but a tradition and a scheme of power which no man was able to take up . His great empire fell to pieces , never to be put together again , except as it seemed to rise once more for a little space in the days of Charles V. Even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shattered by the disintegrating forces of feudalism . But the name and shadow of the imperial power persisted from age to age with a strange vitality . First a line of Saxon princes , then men of the Franconian house , after them the masterful Hohenstaufan essayed the office Charles had made great , wielding such authority as they could as power cane and went amidst the shifting scene of German politics . Finally the succession fell to the house of 1-Habsburg , who were building a veritable kingdom together upon the southern skirts of Germany , where the Ostmarlc hued grown to be Austria . As their strength increased , their presidency amidst the German states became an unmistakable power of command , and Germany had at last a leader , if not a master . 483 . The Imperial Cities . ? While the imperial power languished a notable thing happened . Germany gave birth to great free cities , set like independent states in the midst of their weak neighbors . The cities of the Empire had , as feudalism developed , fallen into its order in two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emperor himself , were his immediate vassals ; others were subordinated to some feudal lord and were subjects of the Empire only through him . The position of those immediately dependent upon the Emperor was much more advantageous than the position of those who had lesser and nearer masters . The imperial supervision was apt to be much less exacting than the overlordship of princes who , having less wide interests to care for than those which busied the Emperor , could render their power greater by concentration . They were always // near at hand and jealous of any movement of independence on the part of the towns within their domain ; the Emperor , on the other hand , was often far away and never by possibility so watchful . He was represented always by some deputy ; but the presence of this officer did not greatly curtail municipal self-government . In the thirteenth century even this degree of control was got rid of at the suit of some of the cities . They were allowed to become free ' imperial cities , bound to the Emperor only by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The next step in the acknowledgment of their independence and importance was their admission to representation in the Diet of the Empire , ? and such recognition was not long delayed . The role of these great free cities in imperial affairs became one of the most important of the many independent roles played on the confused stage of that troubled time . l , iibeck , Hamburg , and Bremen retain to this day a certain privilege of position as free cities in the German Empire ( secs . 497 , 500 ) . 484 . The Swiss Confederation . ? Almost at the very time that the Habsburgs first won the imperial crown and acquired the duchy of Austria , some of their Swiss dependencies broke away from them , and established an independence never since permanently broken . Schwyz , Uri , and Unterwalden , the sturdy little mountain communities grouped about the southern end of quiet Lucerne , with whose struggle for freedom the glorious story of the Swiss Confederation begins , contained some part of the estates of the Counts of Habsburg , whose hereditary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide to the north about the further shore of Lake Geneva , and southward again on the West . The region of the Alps contained the notable imperial cities of Zurich , Berne , Basle , and Schaffhausen ; and Schwyz , Uri , and Unterwalden claimed to be immediate vassals of the Emperor , as these cities were . The Counts of Habsburg , in despite of this claim , sought to reduce them to submission to themselves . The result was a long struggle in which the three little cantons , at first joined only by their neighbor canton , Lucerne , but afterwards by Zurich , Glarus , Zug , and Berne , were eventually completely victorious . By the formation of this famous league of free cantons and cities , at first known as the " Old League of High Germany , " but ultimately as Switzerland ( the land of Schwyz ) , there emerged from the German Empire one of the most interesting states known to history . It may be said to have been the offspring of the disintegrating forces of the Empire , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next chapter we shall consider its political development with the special attention which it merits . // 485 . Austria 's Rival , Prussia . ? While Austria 's power was on the make a formidable rival had grown up in the north , out of the North Mark established in the tenth century as the Empire 's barrier against the Wends . Men of energy and daring had steadily pushed forward the eastern boundaries of the Mark until it had become a great territory , the Mark Brandenburg . In the fifteenth century the markgrafship fell into the hands of a race more capable than the Habsburgs , the Hohenzollern of Nfirnberg . Under them it waxed greater yet alike in territory and in organized power : took in Prussia , the district from which it was to get its later name , and got ready for the great role it was to play in the seventeenth , eighteenth , and nineteenth centuries . In 1640 Frederic William , the Great Elector ( 1640 ? 1688 ) , came upon the stage , to make his power a determining element @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the first king of Prussia . ' 486 . Frederic the Great . ? Frederic , the first king of Prussia , governed from 1688 to 1713 . His son , Frederic William I. ( 1713 ? 1740 ) , rounded out Brandenburg 's possessions and hoarded the money and prepared the army with which his son , Frederic the Great ( 1740 ? 1786 ) , was to complete the greatness of Prussia . The great Frederic took Silesia from Austria , and then , joining in the heartless and scandalous partition of Poland in 1772 , filled up the gap between Brandenburg and East Prussia with West Prussia and the Netze district , territory already thoroughly German . The second and third partitions of friendless Poland in 1793 and 1795 added to Prussia the districts now known as South and East Prussia . Prussia was at last ready for her final rivalry with Austria for the leadership of Germany . But first there was to be the great storm of the Napoleonic wars , which was to sweep away so much that was old in German political arrangements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 487 . Napoleon : the Confederacy of the Rhine . ? One of the earliest acts of Napoleon in his contest with Austria and Prussia was to isolate these two great German states by thrusting between them a barrier of smaller German states attached to the French interest . So little coherent was Germany , so little had the Empire made of the Germans a single nation , that Napoleon was // able to detach from all alliance with either Austria or Prussia every one of the German states except Brunswick and the electorate of Hesse . Of these the chief were the kingdoms of Bavaria and Wiarttemberg and the grand-duchy of Baden . Napoleon organized out of these allies the so-called Confederacy of the Rhine , ' of which he constituted himself Protector , ' and which lasted from 1806 till 1813. 488 . The year 1806 had marked also the formal end of the ' Holy Roman Empire ' over which the Habsburgs had so long presided . The eighteenth century had witnessed a notable decline in their power ; the sweeping conquests of Napoleon put them at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced to abdicate and forever renounce the imperial office . There was no more to be a German Empire till Prussia should draw one about her , and Austria be once for all ousted from her place of leadership in Germany . 489 . The German Confederation ( 1815-1866 ) . ? Despite the ease with which he at first divided Germany in order to conquer it , Napoleon discovered at last that he had himself aroused there a national feeling which was to east him out and ruin him . In 1813 Germany rose , the Confederacy of the Rhine went to pieces , and all Napoleon 's plans were undone . He had done Germany the inestimable service of making her patriotic . The Congress of Vienna , which met at the close of the Napoleonic wars to recompose Europe , could not revivify the German Empire : that had been dead for some time before Napoleon forced a winding up of its affairs . But Germany was not to remain disintegrate . The year 1815 witnessed the formation of a new union of the German states , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held them more closely together than they had been held for many generations . Austria was the president of the Confederation . The organ of government was a Diet of ambassadors from the thirty-nine component states ( kingdoms , duchies , cities , principalities ) authorized to mediate between the states in all matters of common concern ; and the Confederation maintained an army of thirty thousand men . The arrangement was little enough like national union : the large states had a preponderant representation in the Diet , Austria dominating all ; and each state , whether great // or small , was suffered to go its own way , make its own alliances , and fight its own wars , if only it refrained from injuring any one of the Confederates or the interests of the Confederation . But there was sufficient cohesion to keep the states together while German national feeling grew , and while the political revolutions of the century ( 1830 and 1848 ) liberalized political institutions . 490 . Period of Constitutional Reform . ? In 1848 most of the German states , except Prussia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same year a German National Parliament ' met at Frankfort ( the seat of the Diet of the Confederation ) and attempted to formulate a plan for more perfect union under the leadership of Prussia ; but its leaders proposed much more than was possible , the time was not yet ripe , and the attempt failed . Still earlier , in 1833 , Prussia had led in the formation of a Customs Union ' ( Zollverein ) between herself and all the states of the Confederation except Austria , which laid a freetrade basis for those subsequent political arrangements from which also Austria was to be excluded . In 1850 Prussia received from the hands of her king the forms , at least , of a liberal government , with parliaineut , tly institutions ; and these concessions , though at first largely make-believe , served eventually as the basis for more substantial popular liberties . 491 . The North German Confederation ( 1867-1871 ) . ? Finally , in 1866 , came the open breach between Prussia and Austria . The result was a six weeks ' war in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1815 fell to pieces ; Prussia drew about her the Protestant states of Northern Germany in a North German Confederation ' ; the middle states , Bavaria , Wurttemberg , Baden , etc. , held off for a while to themselves ; and Austria found herself finally excluded from German political arrangements . 492 . Austria out of Germany . ? Since then Austria , originally predominantly German , has devoted herself to the task of amalgamating the various nationalities of Southeast Europe under her hegemony , and so has become in large part a non-German state . Prussia has become the bead and front of Germany , in her stead . 1 The Union did not at first include this ' all , ' but it did eventually . // Meantime Prussia has grown more than one-fifth in territory . The rearrangement at Vienna in 1815 gave her Swedish Porn merania and the northern half of Saxony ; the war of 1866 confirmed her in the possession of Schleswig-Holstein , Hannover , Hesse-Cassel , Hesse-Nassau , and Frankfort. 493 . The German Empire . ? The finishing impulse was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war of 1870-1871 . Prussia 's brilliant successes in that contest , won , as it seemed , in the interest of German patriotism against French insolence , broke the coldness of the middle states towards their great northern neighbor ; they joined the rest of Germany ; and the German Empire was formed ( Palace of Versailles , January 18 , 1871 ) . GOVERNMENT OF THE E11IPLEE. 494 . Austria and Germany : Character of the German Empire . ? When he ceased to be Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire ( 1806 ; sec. 488 ) , Francis I. still remained Emperor of Austria : He had assumed that title in 1804 ; and from that day to this there has been in full form , ? what there had long been in reality , ? an Austrian Empire . In 1871 there arose by its side a new German Empire , but the two empires are thoroughly unlike one another . The Austrian Empire , though wearing the form of a dual monarchy as Austria-Hungary , is composed of the hereditary possessions of the House of Habsburg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a federal state composed of four kingdoms , six grand-duchies , five duchies , seven principalities , three free cities , and the imperial domain of Alsace-Lorraine , these lands being united in a great corporation of public law ' under the hereditary ' presidency of the king of Prussia . Its Emperor is its president , not its monarch . 495 . The four kingdoms are Prussia , Bavaria , Saxony , and Wiirttemberg ; the grand-duchies , Baden , Hesse , Mecklenburg-Schwerin , SaxeWeimar , Oldenburg , and Mecklenburg-Strelitz ; the duchies , Brunswick , Saxe-Meiningen , Anhalt , Saxe-Coburg , and Saxe-Altenburg ; the principalities , Waldeck , Lippe , Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt , **25;138;TOOLONG , Reuss-Schleiz , Schaumburg-Lippe , and Reuss-Greiz ; the free cities , Hamburg , Liibeck , and Bremen . // The Central German States and the Empire . ? The first step towards the present union was taken in 1870 , when Baden , Bavaria , and Wurttemberg , fearing that the object of Napoleon III . was to conquer the central German states or renew the Con-federation of the Rhine , decisively espoused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While the siege of Paris was in progress these three states sent delegates to King William at Versailles and formally united themselves with their northern compatriots : the North German Confederation became the Ger man Confederation , with King William as president . Almost immediately , thereafter , the influences of the time carried the Confederates a step farther : at the suggestion of the king of Bavaria , the president-king was crowned Emperor , and the Ger man Confederation became the German Empire . ' The Character of the Empire . ? These changes of mem bership and of title did not , however , change the character or , at first , the constitution of the union . It remained a federal state , and the king of Prussia was still its president only ; he was not its monarch . Its make-up and powers were not radically altered . Prussia , indeed , was very great : in territory more than three times as large as all the other states of the union put together , her population three-fifths that of all Germany ; and the king of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the law . But as Emperor he occupies not an hereditary throne , but only an hereditary office . Sovereignty does not reside in him , but " in the union of German federal princes and the free cities . " Ile is the chief officer of a great political corporation , whose ob ject it is to " form an eternal union for the protection of the realm and the care of the welfare of the German people . " The Emperor . ? Still his constitutional prerogatives are of the most eminent kind . Unlike other presidents , he is irre sponsible : he can not be removed , his office belonging inalienably to the throne of Prussia , whether its occupant be king or regent only . He summons , opens , adjourns , and closes the two Houses of the federal legislature , the Bundesrath and the Reichstag , the latter of which he can also , with the consent of the Bundesrath , dissolve . He appoints , and may at his ' pleasure remove , the ImTHE // perial Chancellor , who is both the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bundesrath ; and he appoints also , under the countersignature of the Chancellor , all minor officers of the imperial service , whom , with a like cohpera tion of the Chancellor , he may also dismiss . He controls the foreign affairs of the Empire and commands its vast military forces ; and in this latter capacity , of commander-in-chief of the imperial army , it rests with him , acting at the suggestion of the Bundesrath , to coerce into obedience such states of the Empire as may at any time wilfully and . pertinaciously neglect to fulfil their federal duties . He has , in brief , to the fullest extent , both the executive and the representative functions now characteristic of the head of a powerful constitutional state . There are distinct limits to his power as Emperor , limits which mark and emphasize the federal character of the Empire and make of it a state gov erned by law , not by prerogative ; but those limits nevertheless lie abundantly wide apart . Adding , as he does , to his powers as hereditary president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , as king of Prussia , the dominant member of the Union , he possesses no slight claim to be regarded as the most powerful ruler of our time . ( Compare secs . 415 , 418 , 423 , 746 , 761 , 775 , 796 , 813 , 823 , 860 , 889 , 1329 , 1381 , 1382. ) 499 . Sovereignty of the Empire in Legislation . ? So complete , so unlike that of a mere ' confederation , is the present union of the German states that the sovereign , legislative power of the Empire is theoretically unlimited : " it can by means of constitu tional amendment set aside the bounds placed by the constitution between its sphere and that of the individual states , that is , alter them without the consent of the states ; it can also withdraw from the states the powers reserved to them . In a certain sense , there-fore , it may be said that the individual states possess their mag isterial rights only by sufferance of the Empire , only by virtue of its will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either to the people or to the governments of the states : nor are they passed by any special or peculiar procedure , as in France ( sec. 411 ) . They are originated and acted upon as ordinary // laws would be . The only limitations put upon their passage are , first , that fourteen negative votes in the Bundesrath will defeat a proposed amendment , and , second , that no state can be deprived of any right guaranteed to it by the constitution , without its own consent . From the first the legislative power of the Empire has covered the entire field of the law of contracts , of commercial law , and of criminal law ; and by an amendment of December 20 , 1873 , it was extended to the whole field of civil law as well . For some time it did not exercise its power over the whole domain of these great subjects , but it has now enacted , besides full codes of commercial and criminal law , an exhaustive civil code which has brought practically all of private law under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bundesrath : its Composition and Character . ? The central and characteristic organ of the Empire is the Bundesrath , the Federal Council , which is , alike in make-up and function , the lineal successor of the Diet of the older Confederation . In form , in theory , and indeed in fact , the Bundesrath is a body of ambassadors . Its members represent the governments of the states from which they conk , and are accredited to the Emperor as diplomatic agents , plenipotentiary charges d'a ( Jhires , to whom he must extend the same protection that is extended to the like representatives of foreign . states . It is a fundamental conception of the German constitution that " the body of German sovereigns together with the senates of the three free cities , considered as a unit , ? tanquam unum corpus , ? is the repository of imperial sovereignty " ; 1 and the Bundesrath is the organ of this body . It is therefore the organ through which the sovereignty of the Empire is expressed . The Emperor does not exercise sovereignty : he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the Empire is con cerned , and takes part in its exercise only through the Prussian members of the Bundesrath . It follows , of course , from this prin ciple that the members of the Bundesrath are only the agents of their governments , and act under instructions from them , making regular reports of the proceedings of the Bundesrath to their home administrations . The votes of a state are valid , whether cast by her representatives in accordance with their instructions or not ; // but the delegates are responsible for every breach of instructions to their home authorities . In practice they are generally themselves members of the governments they represent , entrusted also with high administrative functions at home , and representing their governments in the local legislative bodies of their own states , as well as in the Bundesrath . The Bundesrath is thus used , as it was intended to be , and as it was used under the somewhat looser forms of the earlier Confederation , as a body of consultation and guidance , a larger sort of imperial cabinet , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to determine all questions of general interest , whether they affect the making or the administration of the laws . 501 . Representation of the States in the Bundesrath . ? The states of the Empire are unequally represented , according to their size . Prussia has seventeen votes ; Bavaria six ; Saxony and Wurttemberg four each ; Baden and Hesse each three ; Mecklenburg-Schwerin and Brunswick each two ; the other seventeen states one apiece . The votes of each state which is entitled to more than one vote must be cast together as a unit , and each such state can cast her full vote whether or not she have her full number of representatives present . 502 . Members are sent and withdrawn at the pleasure of their respective governments , like the responsible agents they are ; and their constant responsibility makes formal instruction as to their votes upon particular measures for the most part unnecessary . The smaller states have found the duty of maintaining representatives at times very onerous ; and , inasmuch as it is not required by law that their delegates should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become a common practice for them to serve economy and their own convenience by combining to maintain joint representatives . Groups of them combine , and each group delegates their powers to a single person , who is authorized to represent them severally . Since 1880 , however , the session of the Bundesrath has been divided into two periods , in one of which the more important matters of the year are considered ; and during this part of the session each state is required to vote , if it votes at all , through its own separate delegate . During the remainder of the session routine matters are disposed of and joint representation is permitted . 503 . The significance of the constitutional provision that amendments to the constitution may not pass if there be fourteen negative votes cast in the Bundesrath is quite evident . A combination of the small states // may defeat any organic change of law proposed by the large states ; and Prussia alone can bar any amendment to which she is opposed . The seventeen votes of Prussia on the one side and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be said , were there any real offset to the power of Prussia , to constitute the central balance of the system . 504 . Functions of the Bundesrath . ? The Bundesrath occupies a position in the German system in some respects not unlike that which the Roman Senate held in the government of Rome ( sees . 171-154 ) . It is , so to say , the residuary legatee of the constitution . All functions not specifically entrusted to any other constitutional authority remain with it , and no power is in principle foreign to its jurisdiction . It has a composite character , and is the presiding organ of the Empire . It is at one and the same time an administrative , a legislative , and a judicial body . 505 . In its legislative capacity , it presides over the whole , course of lawmaking . The Reichstag has the right to originate measures , but , as a matter of practice , originates very few . Most bills first pass the Bundesrath and go with its sanction to the Reichstag . If passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bundesrath and there once more adopted . All the more important legislation , moreover , is framed by the imperial officials and presentisl to the flundcseath by the Chancellor , who is not only president of the federal chamber but also chief of the L'russian delegation . Prussia , therefore , in reality presides over the process of legislation . Hers is the chief initiative ; and the federal chamber , in which she commands seventeen votes , is the usual source of every great measure . The Reichstag has , of course , the right of amendment , a , nd has sometimes exercised it with boldness ; but nothing that it suggests can become law without the assent of the guiding and overseeing Bundesrath . The consent of the Bundesrath , , as well as of the Reichstag , must be had also to every treaty which affects any matter that falls within the legislative powers of the Empire . 500 . The measures sent down from the Bundesrath to the Reichstag are generally advocated there , if not by the chancellor himself , by members of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reichstag is usually kept advised of the amendments which the Bundesrath will accept . All members of the Bundesrath have , however , the right to // be present in the Reichstag , and to express their views upon its floor concerning pending legislation , even when their views are not those which have been accepted by the majority in the Bundesrath. 507 . The administrative function of the federal chamber may be summed up in the word oversight . It considers all defects or needs Which discover themselves in the administrative arrangements of the Empire in the course of the execution of the laws , and may in all cases where that duty has not been otherwise bestowed , formulate the necessary regulation to cure such defects and meet such needs . It has , moreover , a voice in the choice of some of the most important officers of the imperial service . It nominates or elects the members of the Court of Accounts , of the Supreme Court of the Empire ( Reichsgericht ) , and of the ' Chamber of Discipline , ' as well as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who constitute the directory of the Imperial Bank . It confirms the nomination , also , either directly or through one of its committees , of consuls and of the officers who exercise the imperial control over the duties and taxes laid by the states under laws of the Empire . It may also be reckoned among the executive functions of the Bundesrath that its consent is necessary to a declaration of war ( except in case of invasion , when the Emperor may act alone ) , to a dissolution of the Reichstag during a legislative period , and to coercive action against a state of the Empire . 508 . The judicial functions of the Bundesrath spring in part out of its character as the chief administrative council of the Empire . When acting as such a council , many of its conclusions partake of the nature of decisions of a supreme administrative court of appeal . But its jurisdiction as a court is much wider than questions of administration . It can declare a state of the Empire delinquent , and order execution to issue against it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the denial of justice to an individual in a state court arising out of a defect or deficiency in the law of the state ; it being within its competence in such a case to compel the state to cure the deficiency and afford the suitor the proper remedy . It is the court of appeal in all cases of dispute between the imperial government and a state , and in all cases arising between two or more states of the Empire which // involve not mere private law questions ( such cases go to the ordinary civil courts ) , but points of public law . 509 . In case it can not agree upon a conclusion in such disputes , the whole legislative power is brought into play and a law is passed covering the matter in controversy . If in any case it considers itself unfitted by its organization , or for any other reason , to act as a court in controversies brought before it , it , may delegate its judicial powers to a court or to experts . This it did in 12177 with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Berlin-Dresden railway. , 510 . Organization of the Bundesrath . ? The Imperial Chan cellor is chairman of the Bundesrath . He is appointed by the king of Prussia , and he must also be one of Prussia 's seventeen representatives , ? for it is the better opinion among German constitutional lawyers that the Chancellor 's membership in the federal chamber is necessary to his presidency of the body . In case of a tie vote , the Chancellor 's vote is decisive : that is to say , the side on which Prussia 's votes are cast prevails , for her vote must be undivided : ? the Chancellor 's vote is not his own , but is one-seventeenth part of Prussia 's whole vote . The Chancellor may appoint a substitute to e L in his absence as president , this limitation resting upon his choice , that if he does not ap point a Prussian delegate to the office he must appoint a Bavarian . He may also appoint , a , sulistilnte to perform all his functions , and such an appointment would include the presidency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that office were made , ? and unless , also , perhaps , the general substitute were not a member of the Federal Council . Inasmuch as it is not merely the legislative but also the adminis trative organ of the Empire , the Bundesrath may be convened without the Reichstag . It must be called together if one-third of its members demand a session . Its business , moreover , is continuous from session to session , being taken up at each session where it was left off at the last : an arrange ment by which it gains both efficiency and expedition in action . Its sessions are secret : for it preserves the reserve of a guiding cabinet . Its compromises and quarrels do not go abroad . Imperial law makes no provision with regard to a quorum in the Bundesrath . It is believed by German jurists , however , that its business could go forward , after proper notice , if only the Chancellor , its president , were present . No state can cast its vote upon any question in which it is not interested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the practice of other deliberative bodies in referring various matters to special committees of its members . It has , too , like other bodies , cer tain standing committees . These are three : one on Alsace-Lorraine , one on the Constitution , and one on the Order of Business . Much more important than these , however , are eight delega tions of its members which , though called committees , may be more properly described as Commissions , for , like the executive committee of our own Congress under the old Confederation ( see . 1069 ) , they continue to sit during the recesses of the chamber which they in a sense represent . Of these Commissions two are appointed by the Emperor , namely a Commission " for the Land Forces and Fortifications " and a Commission " for Naval Affairs " : five are chosen yearly by the Bundesrath , namely , those " on Tariffs and Taxation , " " for Trade and Commerce , " " for Rail-ways , Posts , and Telegraphs , " " on Justice , " and " on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important , the " Com mission on Foreign Affairs , " consists of the representatives of Bavaria , Saxony , and Wurttemberg , and of two other members chosen by the Bundesrath . At least five states must be repre sented on each of these Commissions , and Prussia must always be one of the five , except in the case of the Commission on Foreign Affairs . On this last Prussia needs no representation ; she has committed to her , through her king who is also Emperor , the whole conduct of the foreign affairs of the Empire ; the Commis sion is appointed simply to watch the course of international relations , and to inform the several states of the posture of foreign affairs from time to time . " It has to prepare no con clusion for the Bundesrath and to make no reports to it : it serves to receive communications concerning the foreign affairs of the Empire and to exchange opinions with the imperial administra tion concerning " those affairs . ' Its action is thus independent of its connection with the Bundesrath ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other Commissions . Their duties are principally to the Bundesrath : they for the most part only make reports to it . // 515 . Besides their right to representation on the Commission on Foreign Affairs , of which Bavaria has the presidency , Wurttemberg , Bavaria , and Saxony have also the right to appointments on the Commissions for Land Forces and Fortifications and for Naval Affairs which it is the privilege of the Emperor to name . Prussia is entitled to the presidency of all the Commissions except that on Foreign Affairs . Each state represented has one vote in the action of a Commission , and a simple majority controls . 516 . The Reichstag : its Character and Competence . ? It would lead to very serious misconceptions to regard the Bundesrath and the Reichstag as simply the two houses of the imperial legislature , unlike each other only in some such way as our Senate and House of Representatives are unlike , only , i.e. , because the upper house is differently constituted and is entrusted with a certain share in functions not legislative . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very different footing with reference to each other . The Bundesrath is the sovereign organ of the Empire , the authoritative representative of the " body of German sovereigns and the senates of the free cities . " Though it originates most of the legislation of the Empire , legislation is no more peculi , irly its busiucss than is the superintendence of administration or the exercise of judicial functions . It , as part of the admini. ; tration , governs ; the Reichstag , as representing the Genital ' people , controls . The control of the Reichstag is exercised , not only through its participation in legislation , but also through the giving or withholding of its sanction to certain ordimtuces to whose validity the constitution makes its concurrence necessary ; through its power of refusing to pass the necessary laws for the execution of treaties of which it does not approve ; through its right to inquire into the conduct of affairs ; and through its right of remonstrance . Its powers are not enumerated ; they are , exercised in one form or another , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competence of the Empire is , since 1873 , legally unlimited as to private law : it covers the whole field of civil and criminal enactment . 517 . Composition of the Reichstag . ? The Reichstag represents , not the states , or the people of the several states regarded separately , but the whole German people . Representation is disTHE // tributed on the basis of about one representative to every one hundred and thirty-one thousand inhabitants . Representatives are , however , elected by districts , one for each district , and no district may cross a state line and include territory lying in more than one state . If , therefore , any state of the Empire have less than one hundred and thirty-one thousand inhabitants , it may , nevertheless , constitute a district and send a representative to the Reichstag . 518 . The Reichstag at present ( 1897 ) consists of three hundred and ninety-seven members ; and of this number Prussia returns two hundred and thirty-five , about three-fifths of the whole number . The electoral districts as they now stand ( 1897 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixed so long ago that Berlin , though it has grown to possess more than a million and a half inhabitants , has only six members in the Reichstag . 519 . The members of the Reichstag are elected for a term of five years by universal suffrage and secret ballot . The voting age in Germany is twenty-five years ; and that is also the earliest age of eligibility to the Reichstag . 520 . The election districts are determined in the northern states according to laws passed under the North German Confederation ; in Bavaria , by the Bavarian legislature ; in the other southern states , by the Bundesrath . The subdivisions of the districts , the voting precincts , are determined by the administrations of the states . 521 . An absolute majority is required for election , as in France ( sec. 405 ) . In case no candidate receives such a majority , the commissioner of election ? an officer appointed by the administration for each district ? is to order a new election to take place within fourteen days after the official publication of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the two candidates who received the highest number of votes . Should this second election result in a tie the lot decides . 522 . Election to the Reichstag takes place , not on days set by statute , but on days appointed by executive decree , as in France 4 ( sec. 405 ) . For the Reichstag may be dissolved by the Emperor , with the consent of the Bundesrath ( by a vote in which Prussia concurs ) before the completion of its regular term of five years . 523 . In case of a dissolution , a new election must be ordered within sixty days , and the Reichstag must reassemble within ninety days . The Emperor may also adjourn the Reichstag without its own consent ( or , in English phrase , prorogue it ) once during any session , for not more than thirty days . // 524 . Sessions of the Reichstag . ? The Reichstag meets at the call of the Emperor , who must call it together at least once each year ; and who may convene it oftener . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sessions of the Reichstag must be public ; it is not within its choice to make them private . A private session is regarded as , legally , only a private conference of the members of the Reichstag , and can have no public authority whatever . 525 . Members of the Reichstag who accept a salaried office under the Empire or one of the states , or an imperial or state office of higher rank or power than any they may have held when elected , must resign and offer themselves for reelection . ( Compare sec. 865. ) 526 . Organization of the Reichstag . ? The Reichstag elects its ' own President , Vice-presidents ( 2 ) , and Secretaries . For the facilitation of its business , it divides itself by lot , for the session , into seven Sections ' ( albtheilungen ) , each Section being made to contain , as nearly as may be , the same number of members as each of the others . These Sections divide among them the work of verifying the election of members and the choice of special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from time to time , as convenience suggests , temporary committees are named , whose duty it is to prepare information for the body , which they present iu reports of a general nature . These committees it is which the Sections select . Each Section contributes its quota of members to each committee . The party leaders , however , always determine beforehand the division of places on the Committees and the Sections merely do their will in the matter . Government bills , moreover , are not referred to the committees . They play no such part in revision as is played by the committees of the French Chamber of Deputies ( secs . 432-434 ) . One-half of the members constitute a quorum ; and an absolute majority is requisite to a valid vote . 527 . Election of Officers . ? The initial constitution of a newly elected Reichstag is interesting . It comes to order under the presidency of the oldest member ; it then elects its president , two vice-presidents , and secretaries ; the president and vice-presidents for a term of only four weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and vice-presidents are elected for the rest of the session . There is no election of officers for // the whole legislative term , as in England and the United States : at the opening of each annual session a new election takes place . It is only at the first , however , that there is a , so to say , experimental election for a trial term of four weeks . 528 . Powers of the Reichstag : the Budget . ? The Bundesrath , as I have said , governs ; the Reichstag in a measure controls . But only in a measure . Its assent is necessary to the validity of all legislation . Though the Bundesrath originates , it can not rule in the field of law without the cooperation of the popular chamber . Like other popular assemblies , too , the Reichstag votes the taxes and subjects the government to sharp criticism when it asks for money . But the annual budget comes to it , like other subjects of legislation , from the Bundesrath , and with the sanction of that great chamber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not annual but permanent ; the army , for whose maintenance the larger votes are asked , is organized for periods of several years together and must be paid ; and there is really very little latitude of choice with regard to any but new or subordinate expenditures . No minister is responsible to the Reichstag for what he does or proposes . The Emperor may dissolve the Reichstag at any time , if the Bundesrath consents , and has frequently exercised the power with the result of obtaining in the new elections the majority he desired . The Reichstag may influence affairs , may win slow victories by persistent and well-directed criticism , may force modifications of policy ; but it is constantly made to realize the fact that it can not govern , and that its chief function is not origination but contral. 529 . Classes and Parties . ? The majority of its members , moreover , are Prussians , and Prussia is above all things else a military state , trained to the compact order and instinctive obedience of a strong monarchy . Classes , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influential landed aristocracy furnishes the army with its best officers , the court with its most devoted servants , the public assemblies with their most conservative leaders . The parties that desire democratic privilege work against ancient prestige , against the habit of the community , against the organization and the prejudices of long-established classes . National parties , moreover , are broken athwart by the divergent feelings // and variant interests of the different states of the unequal Empire . Prussia supports the monarchy whose power galls the lesser states ; her statesmen withstand the process of liberalization which men of the smaller states would fain see pressed forward . Neither responsible party government nor any kind of clear-cut constitutional rule is yet possible . 530 . Imperial Administration . ? While the distinction between the executive and legislative functions of government is sharply enough preserved in Germany , no equally clear discrimination is made in practice between executive and judicial functions . The judiciary is a branch of the administration . The caption ' Imperial Administration ' covers , therefore , all activities of the government of the Empire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fundamental principle of the imperial constitution that the Empire has sovereign legislative power , the states only autonomy , ' the Empire has heretofore occupied only a part of the great field thus opened to it , and has confined itself as a rule to mere oversight , leaving to the states even the execution of imperial laws . 532 . The judges of all but the supreme imperial court , for instance , the tariff oilicials and gaugers , the roast oilieers , and the district military authorities , are state ollicers. 533 . The Imperial Chancellor . ? The Empire has , nevertheless , its own distinct administrative organs , through which it takes , whether through oversight simply or as a direct executive , a most important and quite controlling part in affairs ; and the head and centre of its administration is the Imperial Chancellor , an officer who has no counterpart in any other constitutional government . 534. ( 1 ) Looked at from one point of view , the Chancellor may be said to be the Emperor 's responsible self . If one could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beside an irresponsible constitutional monarch from whom his authority was derived , he would have conceived the real , though not the theoretical , character of the Imperial Chancellor of Germany . He is the Emperor 's responsible proxy . Appointed by the Emperor and removable at his pleasure , he is // still , while he retains his office , virtually supreme head of the state , standing between the Emperor and the Reichstag , as the butt of all criticism and the object of all punishment . ile is not a responsible minister in the English or French sense ( sees . 427 , 868 , 869 ) ; there is , strictly speaking , no parliamentary respon-sibility in Germany . In many respects , it is true , the Chan-cellor does occupy with regard to the Reichstag much the same position that a French or English ministry holds towards the representatives of the people ; he must give an account of the ad-ministration to them , when a debate is forced upon him . But an adverse vote does not unseat him . His responsibility ' does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but consists simply in amenability to the laws . He does not represent the majority in the Reichstag , but he must obey the law . This ' responsibility ' of the Chancellor 's , so far as it goes , shields , not the Emperor only , but also all other ministers . " The constitution of the Empire knows only a single administrative chief , the Imperial Chancellor . " I So all-inclusive is the representative character of the chancellor-ship that all powers not specifically delegated to others rest with the Chan-cellor . Thus , except when a special envoy is appointed for the purpose , he conducts all negotiations with foreign powers . He is also charged with facilitating the necessary intercourse between the Bundesrath and the Reichstag . The Chancellor 's relation to the Reichstag is typified in his duty of submitting to it the annual budget of the Empire . ( 2 ) Still further examined , the chancellorship is found to be the centre , not only , but also the source of all departments of the administration . Theoretically at least the chancellorship is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from it , differentiations within its all-embracing sphere . In the official classification adopted in German commentaries on the public law of the Empire , the Chancellor constitutes a class by himself . ' There are ( 1 ) The Imperial Chancellor , ( 2 ) Admin-istrative officials , ( 3 ) Independent ( i.e. , separate ) financial offi-cials , and ( 4 ) Judicial officials . The Chancellor dominates the entire imperial service . // 538. ( 3 ) A third aspect of the Chancellor 's abounding authority is his superintendency of the administration of the laws of the Empire by the states . With regard to the large number of imperial laws which are given into the hands of the several states to be administered , the Empire may not only command what is to be done , but may also prescribe the way in which it shall be done : and it is the duty of the Chancellor to superintend the states in their performance of such behests . In doing this he does not , however , deal directly with the administrative officials of the states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are responsible . In ease of conflict between the Chancellor and the government of a state , the Bundesrath decides . 539 . The expenses of this administration of federal laws by the states fall upon the treasuries of the states themselves , not upon the treasury of the Empire . Such outlays on the part of the states constitute a part of their contribution to the support of the imperial government . The states are required to make regular reports to the imperial government concerning their conduct of imperial administration . 540. ( 4 ) When acting in the capacity of chairman of the Bundesrath , the Chancellor is simply a Prussian , not an imperial , official . Ile represents there , not the Emperor , for the Emperor as Emperor has no place in the Bundesrath , but the king of Prussia . 541 . During most of the time since the institution of the Empire the Chancellor has been also chief minister of Prussia as president of the Council ; and such a union of offices is both natural and desirable . Theories aside , the Prussian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Vice-chancellorship . ? The laws of the Empire make a double provision for the appointment of substitutes for the Chancellor . As I have already said , in connection with his presidency of the Bundesrath ( sec. 511 ) , he may himself appoint a substitute , for whose acts he is , however , responsible . In addition to this a law of March 17 , 1878 , empowers the Emperor to appoint a responsible Vice-Chancellor . This appointment is made , upon the motion of the Chancellor himself , for the administration of all or any part of his duties , when he is himself hindered , even by an overweight of business , from acting ; the Chancellor himself judging of the necessity for the appointment . The Chancellor may at any ime , too , resume any duties that may have been entrusted to the ViceTHE // Chancellor , and himself act as usual . IIe is thus , in effect , ultimately responsible in every case , ? even for the non-exercise of his office . The vice-chancellorship is only a convenience . 543 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign affairs of the Empire conferred upon the imperial government by the constitution of the Empire does not exclude the several states from having their own independent dealings with foreign courts : it only confines them in such dealings to matters which concern them without immediately affecting imperial interests . The subject of extradition , for instance , of the furtherance of science and art , of the personal relations and private affairs of dynasties , and all matters which affect the interests of private citizens individually , are left to be arranged , if the states will , independently of the imperial Foreign Office . The states , therefore , have as full a right to send ambassadors for their own constitutional purposes as the Empire has to send ambassadors for its greater objects affecting the peace and good government of Europe . It may thus often happen that the Empire and several of the states of the Empire are at the same time separately represented at one and the same court . In the absence of special representatives from the states , their separate interests are usually cared for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the imperial administration which has charge of the international relations of the Empire is known as the Foreign Office simply ( das Auswartige Amt ) . 544 . Internal Affairs . ? The general rule of government in Germany ; as I have said , is that administration is left for the most part to the states , only a general superintendence being exercised by the imperial authorities . But the legislative sphere of the Empire is very much wider than is the legislative sphere of the central government in any other federal state . Imperial statutes prescribe in very great variety the laws which the states administer , and are constantly extending farther and farther their lines of prescription . From the Empire emanate not only laws which it is of the utmost moment to have uniform , ? such as laws of marriage and divorce , ? but also laws of settlement , poor laws , laws with reference to insurance , and even veterinary regulations . Its superintendence of the local state administration of // imperial laws , moreover , is of a very active and systematic sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of supervision are well illustrated ht the matter of weights and measures . The laws with reference to the standard weights and measures to be used in commerce are passed by the imperial legislature and administered by state officials acting under the direction and in the pay of the state authorities ; but thorough control of these state officials is exercised from Berlin . There is at the capital a thoroughly organized Weights and Measures Bureau ( Normal-Eicher ngskonzinission ) , which supplies standard weights and measures , superintends all the technical business connected with the department , and is in constant and direct association with the state officials concerned , to whom it issues from time to time specific instructions . 546 . Money . ? With regard to money the control of the Empire is , as might be expected , more direct . The states are forbidden to issue paper money , and imperial legislation alone determines money-issue and coinage . But even here the states are the agents of the Empire in administration . ( Joining is entrusted to state mints , the metal to be coined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not really state coinage . The state mints are the mere agents of the imperial government : they coin only so much as they are commanded to coin ; they operate ' under the iniiuediate supervision of imperial commissioners ; and the costs of their work are paid out of the imperial treasury . They are state mints only in this , that their officers and employees are upon the rolls , not of the imperial , but of the state civil service . The Empire would doubtless have had mints of its own had these not already existed ready to its hand . 517 . Railways . ? The policy of the Empire with reference to the management of the railways is as yet but partially developed . The Empire has so far made comparatively little use of the extensive powers granted it in this field by its constitution . It could virtually control ; but it in practice only oversees and advises . The Imperial Railway Office ( Reichs-Eisenbahoamt ) has advisory rather than authoritative functions ; its principal supervisory purpose is to keep the various roads safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but most of the lines are owned by the several states ; and the states are bound by the constitution to administer them , not independently or antagonisTHE // tically , but as parts of a general German system . Here again the Empire has refrained from passing any laws compelling obedience to the constitution on this point ; possibly because the states have assiduously complied of their own accord . Using the Bundesrath for informal conference on the matter ( though the Bundesrath has no constitutional authority in railway administration ) they have effected satisfactory cooperative arrangements . 548 . The railways of Bavaria stand upon a special footing : for Bavaria came into the federation on special terms , reserving an independence much greater than the other states retain in the management of her army , her railways , and her posts and telegraphs. 549 . For military purposes , the Empire may command the services of the railways very absolutely . It is as aids to military administration primarily that their proper construction and efficient equipment are insisted on through the Imperial Railway Office . Even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imperial legislative action to be of military importance to the Empire . With reference to any but the Bavarian roads a simple resolution of the Bundesrath alone suffices for this declaration . 550 . The duty of the states to administer their roads as parts of a single system is held to involve the running of a sufficient number of trains to meet all the necessities of passenger and freight traffic , the running of through coaches , the maintenance of proper connections , the affording of full accommodations , etc. 551 . At times of scarcity or crisis , the Emperor may , with the advice of the Bundesrath , prescribe low tariffs , within , certain limits , for the transportation of certain kinds of provisions . 552 . Posts and Telegraphs . ? Here the administrative arrangements of the Empire are somewhat complicated . Bavaria and Wiirttemberg retain their own systems and a semi-independence in their administration , just as Bavaria does with regard to her railways also ; being subject to only so much of imperial regulation as brings their postal and telegraphic services into a necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of the states the imperial authorities directly administer these services ; in a few ? Saxony , Saxe-Altenburg , the two Meclilenburgs , Brunswick , and Baden ? there is a sort of partnership between the states and the Empire . The principle throughout is , however , that the Empire controls . // 553 . Patents , etc . ? Besides the administrative activities with reference to internal affairs which I have mentioned , the Empire issues patents , grants warrants to sea-captains , naval engineers , steersmen , and pilots ; and examines sea-going vessels with a view to testing their seaworthiness. 554 . Military and Naval Affairs . ? The Empire as such has a navy , but no troops . Prussia is the only state of the Empire that ever maintained a naval force , and she has freely resigned to the Empire , which she virtually controls , the exclusive direction of naval affairs . But the case is different , in form at least , with the army . That is composed of contingents raised , equipped , drilled , and , in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This at least is the constitutional arrangement : the actual arrangement is different . Only Bavaria , Saxony , Wurttemberg , and Brunswick really maintain separate military administrations . The other states have handed over their military prerogatives to the king of Prussia ; and Brunswick also has organized her contingent in close imitation of and subordination to the Prussian army . Bavaria 's privileges extend even to the appointment of the commander of her contingent . The Emperor is commander-inchief , however , appointing all the higher field officers ; and the imperial rules as to the recruitment , equipment , discipline , and training of troops and as to the qualifications and relative grading of officers are of the most minute kind and are imperative with regard to all states alike . 555 . Finance . ? The expenses of the Empire are met partly from imperial revenues , and partly from contributions by the states . The Empire levies no direct taxes ; its revenues come principally from customs duties and excises , certain stamp taxes , the profits of the postal and telegraph system , of imperial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So far as these do not suffice , the states assist , being assessed according to population . And here , again , the states undertake much of the actual work of administration : the customs officials , for example , being state officers acting under imperial supervision . The financial bureaux , like all other branches of the imperial government , are immediately subordinated to the Imperial Chancellor . 556 . Justice . ? In the administration of justice , as in so many other undertakings of government , the Empire superintends , // merely , and systematizes . The state courts are also courts of the Empire : imperial law prescribes for them a uniform organization and uniform modes of procedure : and at the head of the system stands the Imperial Court ( Reichsgericht ) at Leipzig , created in 1877 as the supreme court of appeal . The state governments appoint the judges of the state courts and determine the judicial districts ; but imperial laws fix the qualifications to be required of the judges , as well as the organization that the courts shall have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the system of law . 557 . Citizenship . ? Every citizen of a state of the Empire is a citizen of the Empire also and may enjoy the rights and immunities of a citizen in every part of the Empire ; but citizenship , though rooted in the states by way of locus , is conferred only upon terms , fixed by federal law . The Empire determines in nearly all respects this fundamental question of civil status ; and every citizen is thereby made the more directly and immediately a citizen of the Empire . It remains , nevertheless , the theory of the relationship that citizenship is primarily state citizenship and that citizenship of the Empire flows out of citizenship of the state , as with us . ( Compare secs . 1121 , 1124 . ) THE GOVERNMENT OF PRUSSIA . 558 . The organization of government in Prussia has , for the student of German political institutions , a double interest and importance . In the first place , Prussia 's king is Germany 's Emperor ; Prussia is the presiding and controlling state of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used as administrative agencies of the Empire . Her government is in.a very real sense an organ and representative of the imperial government . In the second place , Prussia 's administrative system serves as a type of the highest development of local government in Germany . Prussia has studied to be more perfect than any other European state in her administrative organization . 559 . Stages of Administrative Development. ? Until the time when she emerged from the long period of her development as the Mark Brandenburg and took her place among the great mili ? // tary states of Europe , Prussia 's administrative organization was of a very crude sort , not much advanced beyond the mediaeval pattern . Later , under the Great Elector and his immediate successors , though well out of her early habits , she was still little more than a mere military state , and her administration , though more highly developed , had almost no thought for anything but the army . Only since the close of the Napoleonic wars has her system of government become a model of centralized civil order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elector reduced the feudal Estates of the Mark to complete subjection to his will . He it was , also , who began the policy by which local affairs as well were to be centralized . In the towns the process was simple enough . In them there was little effective obstruction : the channels were already open . There the military authorities , directly representative of the Elector , had all along dictated in police and kindred matters ; direct ordinances of the Elector , moreover , regulated taxation and the finances , and even modified municipal privileges at pleasure . It did not take long , such being the system already established , to make burgomasters creatures of the royal will , or to put effective restrictions upon municipal functions . 561 . In the provinces , however , it was quite another matter to crush out local privilege . The Prussia of the Great Elector and his successors was no longer the Mark Brandenburg , but the extended Prussia of conquest . There were many Estates to deal with in the several principalities of the kingdom ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every step with the central power . They were the channels through which the sovereign 's will had at first to operate upon provincial government , and they were by no means open channels . They insisted , for a long time with considerable success , that the chief officers of the provinces should be nominated by themselves ; and they nominated natives , men of'their own number . Only by slow and insidious processes did the Elector , or his successors the kings of Prussia , make out of these representative provincial officials subservient royal servants . 562 . First Results of Centralization . ? The system pursued in the process of centralization , so far as there was any system , // was a system by which central control was grafted upon the old growths of local government derived from the Middle Ages . The result was of course full of complexities and compromises . In the vast royal domains bailiffs administered justice and police , as ( lid Schulzen in the manorial villages . In the larger rural areas a Landrath , or sheriff , " nominated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number , and appointed by the king , " saw to the preservation of order , to the raising of the levies , to tax collection , and to purveyance . In the towns there was a double administration . Magistrates of the towns ' own choosing retained certain narrow local powers , constantly subject to be interfered with by the central authority ; but royal tax-commis sioners , charged with excise and police , were the real rulers . Above this local organization , as an organ of superintendence , there was in each province a Chamber for War and Domains , ' which supervised alike the Landrath and the city tax-commis sioners. 563 . A War and Domains Chamber consisted of a president , a " director or vice-president , and a number of councillors proportioned to the size , populousness , or wealth of the province . " The president of a chamber was " expected to make periodical tours of inspection throughout the province , as the Landraths did throughout their counties . " In the despatch of business by a Chamber , the councillors were assigned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public improvements for their superintendence or administration , the whole board supervising , auditing , etc.l Justice and Finance . ? Much progress towards centraliza tion was also made by the organization of justice and finance . " The administration of justice was in the hands of boards , the Regierungen , or governments , on the one hand the whole organi zation of administration in Prussia being characteristically col legiate , and the courts on the other . " In finance also there was promise of systematization . During the period preceding the Napoleonic wars , when Prussia figured as a purely military state , the chief concern of the central government was the maintenance and development of the army . The chief source of revenue was the royal domains : the chief // need for revenue arose out of the undertakings of war . ' There were , therefore , at the seat of government two specially promi nent departments of administration , the one known as the ' Gen eral War Commissariat , ' and having charge of the army , the other known as the General Finance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the domains ; and here and there throughout the provinces there were War Commissariats ' and Domains Chambers ' which were the local branches of the two great central departments.2 These two departments and their provincial ramifications were , however , instead of being coordinated , kept quite distinct from each other , clashing and interfering in their activities rather than cooperating . Fusion of Departments of War and Domains . ? Such at least was the system under the Great Elector and his immediate successor , Frederic I. , if system that can be called which was without either unity or coherence . Frederic William I. united War and Domains under a single central board , to be known as the General Supreme Financial Directory for War and Domains , ' and brought the local war and domains boards together in the provinces as Chambers for War and Domains . Under this ar rangement the various war councillors ' who served the provin cial Chambers were charged with a miscellany of functions . Besides the duties which they exercised in immediate connection with military administration , they were excise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the civil functions which had formerly belonged to other direct representatives of the Crown . In the rural districts the Chambers were served in civil matters by the several Landrathe . Differentiation of Central Bureaux . ? This arrangement speedily proved as cumbrous as the name of its central organ , and an internal differentiation set in . The General Directory sepa rated into Committees ; and , as time went on , these committees began to assume the character of distinct Ministries , ? though upon a very haphazard system . Frederic the Great further con-fused the system by creating special departments immediately // dependent upon himself and a special cabinet of advisers having no connection with the General Directory . He was himself the only cohesive element in the administration : it held together because clasped entire within his hand . 568 . Reforms of Stein and Hardenberg . ? Order was at last introduced into the system through the influence of Baron vom Stein and the executive capacity of Count Hardenberg , the two most eminent ministers of Frederic William III. , who together may be said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prussia owes to the genius of Stein , indeed , the main features of both her central and her local organization . Her central organization is largely the direct work of his hands ; and her local organization derives its principles . from his thought not only , but also from the provisions of the great Ordinance by which he reconstructed the administration of the towns . 509 . Prussian administrative arrangements as they now exist may be said to be in large part student-made . As the Roman emperors honored the scientific jurists of the Empire by calling upon them to preside over legal development , so have Prussian kings more and more inclined to rely upon the advice of cultured students of institutions in the organic develop ment of the government . Stein was above all things else a student of governments . In our own clay the influence of Professor Gneist upon administrative evolution has continued the excellent tradition of student power . And because she has thus trusted her students , Prussia has had practical students : students whose advice has been conservative and care-fully observant of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easier to give such influence to students where the government follows for the most part royal or executive initiative than where all initiative rests with a popular chamber . It is easier to get and to keep the ear of one master than the ears of five hundred . 571 . Reform of Local Government before 1872 . ? The county law ( Krei'sordnung ) of the 13 December , 1872 , has been called the Magna Marta of Prussian local government . Upon it all later changes and modifications rest . Between the period of Stein 's reforms and the legislation of 1872 the organization of local government was substantially as follows : ' The provinces were divided into Government Districts , ' as now , the Govern280 TILE GOVERNMENTS OF GERMANS ' . went Districts into Circles ' or Counties . An administrative Board established in the Government District was then , as now , the vital organ of local administration . In the province there was also a board , exercising general supervisory powers , the eye of the central bureaux in the larger affairs of administration , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area of a single Government District ; and , as the chief officer of the province , a Superior President ' of influential position and function . But alongside of this quite modern machinery stood the old provincial Estates ( revived in 1853 ) , representing , not the people , but the social orders of a by-gone age , and possessing certain shadowy powers of giving advice . In the Circle ' or County , there was still the Laud path , as formerly , appointed from a list of local landed proprietors , and associated with the Estates of the Circle , ' a body composed of the county squires and a few elected representatives from the towns and the rural townships , ? a body of antiquated pattern recalled to life , like the Estates of the province , in 1853 . In the towns , which had directly received the imprint of Stein 's reforming energy and sagacity , administration was conducted by boards of magistrates chosen by popular councils and associated with those councils in all executive business by means of a joint-conunittec organization , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Landgemeinde and Manors . ? Besides these areas of administration there were rural communes ( Landgemeinde ) still connected , quite after the feudal fashion , with adjacent or circumjacent manors , their government vested in a Schulze and two or more Schofen ( sheriffs or justices ) , the former being appointed either by the lord of the manor , or , if the village was a free village , as sometimes happened , by the owner of some ancient freehold within the commune with which manorial rights had somehow passed . The commune had , besides , either a primary or an elective assembly . The communes were often allowed , under the supervision of the official board of the Government District , to draw up charters for themselves , embodying their particular local laws and privileges . Within the manors police powers , poor-relief , the maintenance of roads , etc. , rested with the proprietor . Local government was within their borders private govermment. 573 . Reform of 1872 . ? The legislation of 1872 took the final steps towards getting rid of such pieces as remained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hereditary jurisdiction of the manor and the dependent office of Schulze , and established in place of the feudal status an equal citizenship of residence . In place of the Estates of the province and county it put real repre-sentative bodies . It retained the Laiulrath , but somewhat cur-tailed his powers in the smaller areas within the Circle , and associated with him an effective administrative board , of which he became little more than president . It carried out more thoroughly than before in the various areas the principle of board direction , integrating the lesser with the greater boards , and thus giving to the smaller areas organic connection with the larger . It reformed also the system of local taxation . It is upon this legislation , as I have said , that the system of local government now obtaining in Prussia is erected ( secs . 588 , 618 ) . 574 . The Central Executive Departments . ? Stein 's scheme for the development of the central organs of administration brought into existence five distinct ministries , which no longer masquer-aded as committees of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirely upon a basis of logical distinc-tion , not at all upon any additional idea of territorial distribution . These were a Ministry of Foreign Affairs , a Ministry of the Interior , a Ministry of Justice , a Ministry of Finance , and a Ministry of War . This , however , proved to be by no means a final differentiation . The Ministry of the Interior was at first given a too miscellaneous collection of functions , and there split off from it in 1817 a Ministry of Ecclesiastical , Educational , and Sanitary Affairs , and in 1848 a Viinistry of Trade , Commerce , and Public Works and a Ministry of Agriculture . In 1878 a still further differentiation took place . The Ministry of Finance , re-taining distinct reminiscence of its origin in the administration of the royal domains , had hitherto maintained a Department of Domains and Forests . That department was in 1878 transferred to the Ministry of Agriculture . At the same time the Ministry of Trade , Commerce , and Public Works was divided into two , a Ministry of Trade and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are now , therefore , nine ministries : ( 1 ) a Ministry of Foreign Affairs ( Stein , 1808 ) ; ( 2 ) a Ministry of the Interior ( 1808 ) ; ( 3 ) a Ministry of Ecclesiastical , Educational , and Sanitary Affairs ( 1817 ) ; ( 4 ) a Ministry of Trade and Commerce ( 1848 ) ; ( 5 ) a Ministry of Agriculture ( 1848 ) , Domains , and Forests ( 1878 ) ; ( 6 ) a Ministry of Public Works ( 1878 ) ; ( 7 ) a Ministry of Justice ( 1808 ) ; ( 8 ) a Ministry of Finance ( 1808 ) ; and ( 9 ) a Ministry of War ( 1808 ) . 576 . The Council of State . ? Most of these ministries were created before Prussia had any effective parliamentary system , and when , consequently , there was no instrumentality in existence through which there could be exercised any legislative control over the executive . Stein would have revived for the exercise of some such function the ancient Council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1604 , which had at first presided over all administration but whose prerogatives of oversight and control had gradually decayed anal disappeared . This council , which bore a general family resemblance to the English Privy Council ( sec. 854 ) , had a mixed membership made up in part of princes of the blood royal , in part of certain civil , military , and judicial officials serving ex officio , and in part of state officials specially and occasionally summoned . It was Stein 's purpose to rehabilitate this body , which was in a sense representative of the classes standing nearest to government and therefore presumably best qualified to test methods , and to set it to oversee the work of the ministers : to serve as a frame of unity in the administration without withdrawing from the ministers their separate responsibility and freedom of movement . This part of his plan was not , however , carried out , and the Council of State , though still existing , a shadow of its former self , has never regained its one-time prominence in administration . 577 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Count H:trdenberg integrated the several ministries by establishing the Ministry of State , or College of Ministers ( Staatsministerircm ) , which stands in much the same relation to Prussian administration that the French Council of Ministers ( sec. 422 ) occupies towards administration in France , though it in some respects resembles also the French Council of State ( sec. 468 ) . It is composed of the heads of the several ministries and meets , once a week or oftener , for the consideration of all matters which concern all the executive departments alike , to discuss proposed general laws or constitutional amendments , to adjust conflicts between departments , to hear reports from the ministers as to their policy in the prosecution of their separate work , to exercise a certain oversight over local administration , to concert measures // to meet any civil exigency that may arise , etc . It serves to give unity and coherence to administration . 578 . The Supreme Chamber of Accounts . ? The same purpose is served by the Supreme Chamber of Accounts ( Oberrec1i000yskaanmer ) and by the Economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was founded in 1714 by Frederic William I. Its members have the tenure and responsibility of judges . Its president is appointed by the Crown on the nomination of the Ministry of State ; its other members are appointed by the Crown upon the nomination of its president , countersigned by the president of the Ministry of State . It constitutes a distinct branch of the government , being subordinate , not to the Ministry of State , but directly responsible to the Crown . Its duty is the careful oversight and revision of the accounts of income and expenditure from all departments ; and the oversight of the state debt and of the acquisition and disposition of property by the state . It watches , in brief , the detailed adulinistration of the finances , and is the judicial guardian of the laws concerning revenue and disbursement. 579 . The Economic Council . ? The Economic Council considers proposals for laws or ordinances affecting weighty economic interests which fall within the domains of the three ministries of Trade and Commerce , of Public Works , and of Agriculture . Such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of such laws and ordinances may be submitted to its debate before going to the king for his approval . It is also privileged to consider the question how Prussia 's votes shall be cast upon such matters in the Bundesrath . Of course , however , its part in affairs is merely consultative . It is composed of seventy-five members appointed by the king for a term of five years , forty-five of this number being appointed upon the nomination of various chambers of commerce , mercantile corporations , and agricultural unions . 580 . The Ministers in the Legislature . ? The king ? or , more properly , the Administration ? is represented in the legislative houses by the ministers , who need not be members in order to attend and speak on the public business . 581 . The Landtag : the House of Lords . ? The Prussian Landtag , or Legislature , consists of two houses , a House of Lords ( Herrenhaus ) and a House of Representatives ( Abgeordnetenhaus ) . The House of Lords might better be described as a house of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represent rights of blood , but also life members who represent landed properties and great institutions , and officials who represent the civil hierarchy . There sit in it princes of the blood royal nominated to membership by the king ; the heads of families once royal whose domains have been swallowed up by Prussia ; certain greater noblemen appointed by the Crown , together with eight others elected by the resident landowners of the provinces ; the four chief officials of the province of Prussia ( the Supreme Burggraf , the High Marshal , the Grand Master of the Teutonic Order , and the Chancellor ) ; and a great number of life members appointed by the king upon the presentation of various bodies : certain evangelical foundations , namely , certain colleges of counts , and of landholders of great and ancient possession , the nine universities , and forty-three cities which have received the right of nomination . The king may , besides , issue special summons to sit in the House of Lords to such persons as he thinks worthy . There is no limit placed upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age : members must be at least thirty years old . 582 . At present ( 1897 ) the number of members is about three hundred . Of these quite one-third are ei the landed nobility , and almost as many more are the nominees of the landed classes ; so that the House stands for loyalty to the Crown and opposition to liberal change . 583 . The House of Representatives , though in a sense representing every Prussian twenty-five years of age who is not specially disqualified to vote , is not constituted by a direct popular franchise , or even by an equal suffrage . The vote is indirect and is proportioned to taxable property . The country is divided into districts ; the qualified voters of each district are divided into three classes in such a way that each class shall represent one-third of the taxable property of the district ; each of these classes selects by vote a third of the number of electors to which the district is entitled ; and the electors so chosen elect the members or the House of Representatives . 584 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for every two hundred and fifty inhabitants ; the voting is not by the ballot , but is public , and an absolute majority of the electors is required to elect . The total number of members of the House is 433 . The term is five years . Any // Prussian who is thirty years of age and in full possession of civil rights may be chosen . In case a vacancy occur in the House , no choice of electors is necessary . Once chosen , the electors are competent to act throughout the legislative term . 585 . It need hardly to be remarked that the division of the primary voters into classes according to the amount of taxes they pay gives a preponderance to wealth . The three classes are of course very unequal in numbers . It requires a comparatively small number of rich men to represent one-third of the taxable property in a district ; it takes a considerably larger number of the well-to-do to represent another third ; and the last third will be represented by the great majority of the inhabitants of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view to distributing the small taxpayers and equalizing the classes numerically . Those who pay most taxes constitute the first class ; those who pay less , the second ; those who pay least or none , the third ; and it may thus very well happen that a very small number of persons elects a third of the electors . 586 . Equality and Competence of the House . - The consent of both Houses is necessary to the passage of a law , and they stand upon a perfect equality as regards also the right of initiative in legislation , ? except that all financial measures must originate in the lower house , and that the upper house can pass upon the budget , which must be presented first to the House of Representatives , only as a whole . The Lords can not amend the budget in part when it comes up to them : they must accept or reject it entire . 587 . The King 's Power of Adjournment and Dissolution . ? The king may adjourn the House of Representatives for a period not exceeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consent . Iie may also dissolve it . When a dissolution is resorted to he must order a new election within sixty days , and the newly elected House must assemble within ninety days . ( Compare sec. 415. ) 588 . Local Government . ? The organization of local government in Prussia is rendered complex by a mixture of historical and systematic elements : it is compounded of old and new , ? of the creations of history and the creations of Stein and Gneist . Stein 's hand is even more visible in local organization in Prussia than in the organization of the central ministries . More conservative than the Constituent Assembly and Napoleon in France , lie did not sweep away the old provinces of Prussia , whose bounda286 THE GOVERNMENTS OF GERMANY . ries , like those of the French provinces of the old regime , were set deep in historical associations . The twelve provinces were given a place , ? a function of superintendence , ? in the new sys tem established . The country is , indeed , divided into Districts ( Bezirice ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but these Districts are grouped under a superintendent provincial organization . There are , therefore , in Prussian local organization ( 1 ) the Province , ( 2 ) the Government District , ( 3 ) the Circle ( Kreis ) or County , and ( 4 ) the township and the town . The township and the town are , as we shall see , coordinate , standing , not in subordination to each other , but in the same rank of the series . 589 . The usual organs of local government throughout all the series of the Prussian system are " first , a representative body with an exclusive control over the economic portion of the communal business ; secondly , an executive board with an exclusive control over the public portion of the communal business ; thirdly , mixed committees , composed of members of both bodies , for the ordinary management of the affairs of the commu nity ; fourthly , the division of the communal area into administrative dis tricts under overseers responsible to the executive board . " r 590 . The Province @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of governmental organs : one of which represents the state and its oversight , the other the Province and its self-government . ( 1 ) The state is represented by a Superior President and a Pro vinzialrath associated with him . The original purpose in retain ing the provincial organization was to secure broad views of administration through officials charged with the oversight of extended areas and so elevated above the near-sightedness of local routine and detail . Nearer to the particulars of local adminis tration than the minister at Berlin , but not so near as the officials of the Government Districts , the provincial representatives of the state are charged with the care " of all such affairs as concern the entire province or stretch beyond the jurisdiction of a single district administration . " 2 These are such matters as affect // imperial interests or the whole Prussian state ; the concerns of public institutions whose functions extend beyond a District ; insurance companies ; extensive plans of improvement ; road and school management , etc . In exercising most of these functions the provincial authorities act , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the District Administrations . There lies with the Superior President , also , the duty of overseeing district administration , the provincial tax directors , and the general Commission for the regulation of the relations between landlords and tenants . He represents the central government , too , in all special , occasional duties , and under all extraordinary circumstances . He has , besides , initial jurisdiction in cases of conflict between District Administrations , or between such Administrations and specially commissioned officials not subject to their orders . 591 . The extraordinary powers of the ' Superior President ' are illustrated by the fact that , in case of serious civil disturbance , of war or the danger of war , he is authorized to assume the whole authority of administration , local as well as general , within the Province . 592 . In overseeing the District Administration , however , he has no executive , but only advisory , powers . He is merely the eye of the Ministries at Berlin , advising them of all matters needing their action . Like the French Prefect , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most directly and intimately associated , with the Ministry of the Interior . 593 . The defect of the provincial organization in Prussia is said to be lack of vitality . Critics like Professor Gneist thought that it rendered the system of local government cumbrous without adding to its efficacy . It is too much restricted to gratuitous advice , and too little authorized to take authoritative action . and the Landeshauptm , ann or Landesdirektor . In a Prussian law it 594 . The Provinzialrath , the administrative Council associated with the Superior President , consists , besides the President or his representative as presiding officer , of one professional civil official of high rank , appointed by the Minister of the Interior , practically for life , and of five lay members chosen by the Provincial Committee for a term of six years . The assent of the Provinzialrath is necessary to every ordinance issued by the Superior President . 595. ( 2 ) The organs representing the Province and its self-government are the Provincial Landtag , the Provincial Committee , // concerning local government the province is described @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a corporation for self-government of its own affairs . " t The provincial legislative body , the Landtag , is composed of representatives elected from the Circles or Counties by the Diets of the Circles : for , when looked at from the point of view of self-government , the Province is a union of Circles , not of Districts : the Districts , as we shall see , are organs of the central government only . The functions of the Landtag lie within the narrow field . of such matters as the apportionment of taxes among the Circles ( which in their turn apportion them among individuals ) , the examination of the local budget , the care of provincial property , and the election of cer tain officials , ? though it is at liberty to take cognizance of any-thing that is of local concern . 596 . It may also , on occasion , give its opinion on bills concerning the Province and on other matters referred to it , for an expression of opinion , by the authorities at Berlin . The Superior President may he present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it oversteps its jurisdiction . Its by-laws are subject to the Crown 's approval , as are also many of its votes of appropriation ; and the king may dissolve it . 597 . The Landtag elects tin Provincial Committee and the Landesha'uptmana , who are the executive organs of provincial self-government . The handealiaojitmann and the Committee stand related to each other very much as do the Superior President and Provinziatrath , or the French Prefect and the Prefectural Council : the Landeshanptmann is the executive , the Committee the ad visory organ of local self-administration , though it in effect directs the action of the Landeshauhtmann in most matters . 598 . The spheres of the representatives of the state and of the repre sentatives of local self-government are quite sharply distinguished in Prussia . The Provincial Committee and the Landeshaupinaann have nothing to do with the general administration : that is altogether in the hands of the Superior President and the Provin.zialrath , who on their part have nothing to do with local self-government . The sphere of local self-government , though narrow , is somewhat more guarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than in France . ( Compare sec. 454. ) // 599 . Communal Estates . ? In some Provinces there still exist cer tain corporations , representing the old organization by ' estates ' of inde pendent districts , which retain their ' landtag , ' their separate property , and a small part of their privileges . They constitute rural poor-unions , and play a limited part in local administration according to the sharply explicit laws of incorporation under which they now exist . They are , however , being gradually abolished or transformed by special enactments . Their German name is Kornrunal-standische herbdnde , which may be translated , Unions of Communal Estates . The Government District . ( Regierungsbezirk ) . ? Unlike the Province , the Government District has no organs of selfgovernment : it is exclusively a division of state administration . Its functionaries are the principal , ? it may even be said the uni versal , ? agents of the central government in the detailed conduct of administration : they are charged with the local management of all affairs that fall within the sphere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Trade and Commerce , of Public Works , of Agriculture , of Ecclesiastical and Educational Affairs , and of War , exclusive , of course , of such . matters as are exceptionally entrusted to officers specially commissioned for the purpose . In brief , they serve every ministry except the Ministry of Jastice . Collectively the functionaries of the District are called . the Administration ' ( Regierung ) , and their action is for the most part collegiate , i.e. , through Boards . The exception to this rule concerns matters falling within the province of the Ministry of the Interior . That Ministry acts in the District , not through a board of officials , but through a single official , the President of the Administration ( Regiernngsprlisident ) . In dealing with all other matters the action is collegiate ; but the Boards are not independent bodies : they are divisions ( Abtheilungen ) of the ' Administration taken as a whole , and in certain affairs of gen eral superintendence the ' Administration acts as a single coun cil. ( im Plenum ) . Each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Oberregierungsrath ) ; and that on Domains and Forests has associated with it a special functionary known as the Forest-master . The members of the Administra tion ' are all appointed by the central government , which places upon the Boards whose functions require for their proper dis charge a special training certain so-called " technical members " : // for instance , school experts , medical experts , road-engineers , and technically instructed forest commissioners . These ' Administrations ' have taken the place of the old-time War and Domains Chambers of which I have spoken ( sec. 565 ) , and which , like the Administrations , acted through Boards as a sort of universal agency for all departments of government . It is only since 1883 that the affairs of the Interior have been given into the sole charge of the President of the Administration . Before that date they also were in the hands of a Board . " Every head of a department , as well as every Rath and assessor , is bound each year to make a tour through a portion of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sees , to be afterwards preserved amongst the records of the Board , and thus to make himself practically acquainted with the daily life and the daily wants of the governed in the smallest details . " a ( Compare sec. 563 . ) The President of the Administration ( 1 ? egierungsprcisident ) is the most important official in the Prussian local service . Not only does he preside over the Administration , ' the general and most important agency of local government ; he is also equipped for complete dominance . IIe may , upon occasion , annul the decisions of the Administration ' or of any of its I ; oards with which he does not agree , and , iu case delay seems disadvantageous , may himself command necessary measures . Ile may also , if he will , set aside the rule of collegiate action and arrange for the personal responsibility of the members of the Administration , ' whenever he considers any matter too pressing to await the meet ing and conclusions of a Board , or , if when he is himself present where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neces sary . ' I n brief , he is the real governing head of local adminis tration . The jurisdiction of the Administration ' covers such matters as the state taxes , the churches , the schools , and the public domain . The District Committee . ? Although , as I have said , the Government District is not an area of self-government , a certain part in the oversight of governmental action in the District is given to lay representatives chosen by the provincial agents of the people . A District Committee ( Bezirksausschuss ) , composed // of two professional members ( one of whom must be qualified for judicial office , the other for the higher grades of the administrative service ) appointed by the king for life , and of four members chosen by the Provincial Committee ( sec. 597 ) for a term of six years , is allowed an oversight of such matters as it has been thought best to put under lay supervision . The President of the Administration is ex officio a member of the Committee and usually presides over its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make with regard to local police are subject to its confirmation , and all questions regarding the control of subordinate local authorities fall to it . More important than its administrative functions are the judicial functions with which it has been recently invested . Since 1883 the District Committee has been the Administrative Court of the District ( sec. 628 ) . When acting in this capacity the Committee is presided over by its judicial member , and the President of the Administration does not sit with it . 606 . The Government Districts number thirty-five , and are grouped , as . I have said , within the twelve Provinces . 607 . The Circle ( Kreis ) . ? In the Circle , as in the Province , there emerges a double set of functions : there is the state administration and , alongside of it , the narrower function of self-government . This double set of functions is performed , however , by a single set of functionaries : by a professional officer known as the Landrath , associated with a Circle Committee ( Kreisausschuss ) , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kreistag ) , the consultative and supervisory authority . There are not , as in the Province , one council and one executive for the state , another council and another executive for the locality . 608 . The Landrath and the Circle Committee . . The Landrath stands upon a peculiar footing : his office is ancient and retains some of its historical features . Originally the Landrath represented the landed gentry of various districts of Brandenburg ; he was appointed upon their nomination and in a sense represented their interests . In some parts of Prussia traces of this right of presentation to the office by the landowners still remain ; and in almost all parts of the kingdom the privilege of nomination // has been transferred to the Circle Diet , as heir of the control once exercised by the local lords of the soil . The Landrath is , therefore , formally , the representative of the locality in which he officiates . In reality , however , he is predominantly the agent of the state , serving both the District Administration and the departments at Berlin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Province in which the Circle lies , and is always a professional officer who has passed , by examination , into the higher grades of the civil service . He is chief of police within the Circle , and superintendent of all public affairs . The Circle Committee is associated with him in the administration of his office and organized under his presidency . It consists , besides himself , of six members chosen by the Circle Diet . It constitutes the Administrative Court of the Circle ( sec. 628 ) , hearing appeals from the acts of subordinate officials as well as supervising administrative action . 609 . The Diet of the Circle represents , not the people , but groups of interests , ? is based upon the economical and social relations of the people . Each Circle includes all towns lying within it which have less than 25,000 inlutbitants , and representation in the Diet is divided between town and country . The country representation , in its tarn , is divided between the rural Communes and the greater landowners . 610 . The cities elect representatives either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magistrates and councils acting together ; if in groups , through electors who assemble under the Presidency of the Landrath . As ' greater landowners ' are classed all those who pay , in their own right , 75 thalers annual land or building tax ; and these are organized for electoral purposes in Unions ( Verbdmade ) . The rural Communes elect in groups through electors . The term of members of the Circle Diet is six years . Cities having more than 25,000 inhabitants constitute separate Circles , and combine in their town governments both Circle and Commune under the forms of city government . 611 . The Circle the Basis of Local Government . ? A moment 's review of the electoral arrangements which underlie Prussian local government as I have outlined it will show how literally the whole structure , so far as it is a system of self-government , rests upon the electoral organization of the Circle . The Diet of // the Circle is the only representative body I have yet named which is chosen by the qualified voters of the locality : and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quota of members through their councils , while the smaller towns unite and choose through electors . The rural Communes elect in groups , through electors . The greater landowners send their separate quota . And then from the Circle Diet , when once it is chosen , proceed , indirectly , all the other lay bodies of administration in the larger areas . It nominates the Landrath , elects the Circle Committee , and unites with the Diets of the other Circles of the Province in choosing the provincial Landtag . The provincial Landtag , in turn , elects the Landeshanptmann and the Provincial Committee . The Provincial Committee elects five out of the seven members of the Provinzialrath and four out of the six members of the District Committee . Each Provincial Committee chooses , on an average , two District Committees . It is iii only a very restricted sense a system of popular control in local affairs . It is a long way from the people to the District Committee . 612 . The Magisterial District ( A9ntsbezirk ) . - The rural Communes are grouped in Magisterial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ District is presided over by a Reeve or Justice ( Amtsvorsteher or Amtsnuann ) who is appointed by the king upon the nomination of the Circle Diet , usually from among the landowners of the locality . The Reeve 's term is six years . He is given charge of the police of the District , and is entrusted with the administration of the laws for the relief of the poor and the preservation of health . As police commissioner he is put over the mayors of the several Communes within his district . He acts under the supervision of the Committee of the Circle . 613 . The Rural Commune ( Landgemeinde ) . ? The larger rural Communes act through small representative assemblies or equncils , while the less populous regulate their affairs by mass meeting . In some Communes the executive officer is known as mayor , ' in others as village judge , ' in still others as president . ' In most localities he is assisted by one or more aids or assessors . The electoral privilege is based upon the three-class system of voting described @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no taxes at all are usually excluded from the franchise . The powers of the Communes cover all matters of strictly local interest . // 614 . The City Communes ( Stadtgemeinde ) . ? Among the City Communes there is great variety of organization . In some cities there is a single executive , ? a single Burgomaster , ? perhaps assisted by certain Boards ; in others the Burgomaster has colleagues ; in still others the magistracy is collegiate , ? is itself a Board . In all there are councils more or less directly representative of the people . In the cities , as in every other unit of local administration , the subjects of finance , police , and the military are largely controlled from Berlin ; and in these branches of administration the city governments are agencies of the central government . They thus have a double character ; they are at one and the same time representatives of the authorities at the capital and of the citizens at home . When acting as agencies of state administration they are , of course , responsible to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Prussian local organization none of the extreme , the rather forced uniformity so noticeable in France , where no difference is made between rural Communes and City Communes , only the greater cities , like Paris and Lyons , being given a special organization . In Prussia historical and other grounds of variety have been freely observed . 616 . General Principles of Prussian Town Government . ? Although without uniformity of structure , town government in Prussia has certain uniformities of principle at its basis which render it a striking example of active self-government . The mayor of a Prussian city is a trained official , taken from the professional service ; but he is not the Executive ; he is simply president of the executive . There is associated with him a board of Aldermen most of whose members are elected from the general body of citizens , to serve without salary , but an important minority of whose members are salaried officials who , like the mayor , have received a thorough technical training in their various branches of administration , and whose tenure of office is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the centre of energy and rule in city government . But it acts under cheek . A town council represents the citizens in the exercise of a control over the city budget , and citizens not of the Council as well as Councilmen act with the Aldermen in the direction of executive business . The Aldermen do their administrative work in Committees , // and act always in association with certain delegations of town-councilmen and certain select citizens ' named by the council . In the wards of the larger towns the Aldermen command also the assistance of local committees of citizens , by whom the conditions and needs of the various districts of the town are familiarly known . Thus in the work of poor relief , in the guardianship of destitute orphans , in education , and in tax assessment select citizens commonly reinforce the more regular , the official , corps of city officers . This literal self-government , which breaks down the wall of distinction between the official and the . non-official guardian of city interests and presses all into the service of the community , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the system that service as a select citizen ' is to be enforced by penalties , ? by increasing the taxes of those who refuse to serve . Berlin " governs itself through more than ten thousand men belong ing to the wealthier part of the middle classes . " r The citizens chosen for ward work or for consultation with the central committees of Aldermen and town-councillors include merchants , physicians , solicitors , manufact urers , head-masters of public schools , and like representative persons . The three-class system of voting described in secs . 583 , 584 , and 585 obtains also in all municipal elections in Prussia , so that weight in the electoral control of city affairs is proportioned to tax-assessment . One-third of the elected Aldermen and town-councillors represent the wealthy class , one-third the middle class , one-third the ' proletariat . ' It is said that in Berlin the first class contains " less than two per cent of the voters , the second class less than thirteen per cent , and the third eighty-six per cent . " The arrangement breeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refrain from voting . The Administration of Justice . ? The Prussian courts of justice , like those of the other states of the Empire , have the general features of their organization and jurisdiction prescribed by imperial law ( sec. 556 ) . They are Prussia 's courts ; but they also serve as courts of the Empire ; Prussian law commands only their personnel and their territorial competence . At the head of the system sits the supreme court of the Empire ( Reichsgericht ) , to which the courts of all the other states stand subordinated. ' // In each Province there is a Superior District Court ( Oberlandesgericht ) , and , next below it , a District Court ( Landgericht ) . In each magisterial District there is an Amtsgericht. 620 . The Amtsgericht , which is the court of first instance in minor civil cases , consists of one or of several judges , according to the amount of business there is for the court to despatch : for when there is more than one judge the work is not handled by them together , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ territorially. 621 . The higher courts , the District Court , and the Superior District Court consists each of a number of judges . At the beginning of each year , the full bench of judges in each court determine a division of the business of the court among themselves , constituting themselves in separate ' chambers for separate classes of cases . There is always a civil chamber and a criminal chamber , ' and often a chamber for commercial cases ( Kummer fur Kandelssachen ) . Each chamber has its own president and its own independent organization . 622 . Minor criminal cases are tried in sheriffs ' courts ( Schoengerichte ) sitting in the Magisterial I ) istriets ; more serious offences by the criminal chamber of the District Court ; all grave crimes by special jury-courts ( Schwacyeeichlc ) which sit under the presidency of three judges of the District Court . 023 . A n appeal from a sheriff 's court on the merits of the case can go no further than the District Court . Appeals on the merits of the case from the criminal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a case can be taken from that court on the ground of the neglect of a rule of law to the Superior District Court , and on other legal grounds to the Imperial Court , for revision . 624 . The nomination of all judges rests with the king : but the appointment is for life and the judges stand in a position of substantial independence . The Minister of Justice , however , completely controls all criminal prosecutions : for no criminal prosecution can be instituted except by the states-attorneys who represent the government in the several courts , and these hold their offices by no permanent tenure , but only at the pleasure of the Minister . // 625 . Purity in the administration of justice is sought to be secured by public oral proceedings . Until a very recent period all proceedings in the Prussian courts were written : the plea and the answer constituted the suit . Now public oral proceedings are made imperative . 626 . The organization of justice in Prussia provides for the assumption by the state of a certain voluntary ' jurisdiction , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the probate of wills ( which latter is made a function of the Amtsgericht ) are quite familiar to the practice of other countries ; but others of which , such as an oversight over certain feudal interests , are somewhat novel in their character . The system knows also certain officially commissioned Arbitrators ( Schiedsmcinner ) and certain trade judges , which are in some respects peculiar to itself . 627 . Administrative Courts ( Verwaltungsgerichte ) . ? The same distinction between administrative and ordinary courts of justice that we have observed in France obtains also in Prussia ( sec. 468 ) . Here again appears the organizing hand of Stein . He established for Prussia the principle that cases arising out of the exercise of the state 's sovereignty should be separated in adjudication from cases between private individuals and should be allotted to special courts . Such are eases of damage done to an individual through the act of an administrative officer , or cases of alleged illegal action on the part of a public official , ? in brief , all cases of conflict between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all questions between administrative authorities . 628 . The courts charged with this jurisdiction are , ( 1 ) in the Circle , the Circle Committee ( sec. 608 ) , presided over , as in dealing with other matters , by the Landrath , and in the cities which themselves constitute Circles , the City Committee ( Stadtausschuss ) , consisting of the Burgomaster as president and four members , all of whom must be qualified for judicial service or for the higher grades of administrative office , elected by the magistracy of the city , acting collegiately , for a term of six years . ( 2 ) In the Government District , the District Committee ( see . 605 ) , to whose presidency when sitting in this capacity , the king may appoint , as representative of the President of the Administration , one of the members of the ' Administration under the title of Director of the Administrative Court ( **28;165;TOOLONG ) . ( 3 ) The Superior Administrative Court in Berlin ( Oberverwaltungsgericht ) , whose members are appointed by the king , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Ministers , for life . This court stands upon the same footing of rank with the supreme federal tribunal , the Reichsgericht . Its members must be qualified , half of them for high judicial , half for high administrative office . It acts , like the other courts , in divisions or senates , ' each of which has its separate organization ; and these sections come together only for the settlement of certain general questions . ( Compare sec. 468. ) 629 . The Court of Conflicts ( Gerichtshoffib . Kompetenz-kon ; jtikte ) . ? Between the two jurisdictions , the ordinary or private and the administrative , stands , as in France , a Court of Conflicts . It consists of eleven judges appointed for life ( or for the term of their chief office , in case they act ex officio ) ; and of these eleven six must be members of the Superior District Court of Berlin , ? must belong , that is , to a court of the ordinary jurisdiction . The other five must be persons eligible to the higher judicial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 630 . The Prussian Courts and Constitutional Questions . ? The Prussian courts have no such power of passing upon the constitutionality of laws as is possessed by the courts of the United States . They can not go beyond the simple question whether , ilaw has been passed , or , in administrative cases , an official order issued , in due legal form . VIII . THE GOVERNMENTS OF SWITZERLAND . ? 0-ono .. 631 . Feudalism in Switzerland . ? Until the beginning of the fourteenth century the towns and communes of the country now called Switzerland were all held fast in the meshes of the feu-dal system . Real vassalage , indeed , such as the low countries of France and Germany knew , had never penetrated to all the val leys of the Alps ; many a remote commune had never known any-thing but a free peasantry ; and hardly anywhere near the heart of the great mountains had feudal fealty meant what it meant elsewhere . Still great neighbor lords and mmiasteries had swept even these mountain lands at least nominally within their over-lordships , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of old 1'eudel domains . 633 . First Movements towards Cantonal Independence . ? In I309 ) , however , le ga , u the process which was to create the Switzer-land of our time . In that year the Cantons of Schwyz , Uri , and UnterwalIon , lying close about the lake of Lucerne , won from the Emperor Henry VII . the recognition of their freedom from all supremacy save that of the Empire itself . They had already , about the middle of the thirteenth century , drawn together into a league which was to prove the seed of the modern Confederacy . That Confederacy has two distinguishing characteristics . It has brought down to us , through an almost unbroken tradition , the republican institutions of the Middle Ages ; and it has by slow processes of cautious federation drawn together into a real union communities the most diverse alike in point of race , of language , and of institutions without destroying their individuality . 633 . The Processes of Confederate Growth . ? In its briefest terms the story is this . The Cantons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while still in possession of those local liberties which the disintegrateness of that system gave leave to grow wherever courageous men could muster numbers enough to assert their independence ; having a common cause against the feudal powers about them , they slowly drew together to each other 's support ; and , having allied themselves , they went on to show the world how Germans , Frenchmen , and Italians , if only they respect each the other 's liberties as they would have their own respected , may by mutual helpfulness and forbearance build up a union at once stable and free . Several centuries elapsed before the development was complete , for the Confederation , as finally made up , consisted of two very different elements : of strong and * for the most part aristocratic free cities and of quiet rural peasant democracies . It was necessarily a long time before even common dangers and common interests brought proud Cantons like Bern and aristocratic cities like Geneva into cordial relations with Schwyz , Uri , and Unterwalden , the humble originators of the Confederacy . But circumstances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last achieved . 634 . French Interference . ? The year 1513 may be taken as marking the close of the period during which the Confederacy won the place it was always to keep among the powers of Europe . In that year the League was joined by the last of those thirteen German Cantons which were to constitute its central membership down to the French Revolution . It was not till 1848 , however , that its constitution was put upon its present foundations ; and not till 1874 that that constitution received at all points its present shape . In. the meantime events of the greatest magnitude gave direction to Swiss affairs . The great powers had recognized the independence of Switzerland in the Treaty of Westphalia , 1648 . The thirteen original Cantons had received great French cities , like Geneva , to the west , and various Italian lands , to the south , either into close alliance or into fixed subjection . The French Revolution had sent French troops into Switzerland , in support of a fruitless attempt to manufacture out of the always stiffly independent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Ilelvetic Republic , ' after the new model just set up in unhappy France ( 1798-1802 ) . Napoleon had inter302 THE GOVERNMENTS OF SWITZERLAND . vened ( 1803 ? 1814 ) for the purpose of both loosing these artificial bonds and creating a new cement for the League in the shape of a common allegiance to himself . And , in 1815 , the pressure of the French power being removed , reaction had come . The irritated Cantons , exasperated by the forms of a government not of their own choosing , had flung apart , to the practice of principles of cantonal sovereignty broader , extremer even than those upon which they had based their Union before 1798 . And then reaction , in its turn , brought its own penalties . Troubles ensued which read very much like those , so familiar to Americans , which forced a strong federal government upon the United States . 635 . The Sonderbund War . ? It was , however , differences of religious , not of political , opinion which were in Switzerland the occasion of the strife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the power of Napoleon had been broken , the Congress of Vienna had sought to readjust all the arrangements that he had disturbed , and Swiss affairs had not been overlooked . The Cantons were induced to receive Geneva , Valais , Neuchatel , and the territories hitherto held as dependencies , into full confederate membership , aril to agree to a fact ( known as the Pact of 1815 ) which gave to the League , with its increased membership of twenty-two Cantons , a new basis of union . One of the clauses of that Pact contained a solemn guarantee of the rights and privi. leges of the monasteries still maintained in the Roman Catholic Cantons : and upon that guarantee were based the hopes of all parties for peace among the members of the League . But the guarantee was broken down . The wave of democratic reform swept steadily and resistlessly through Switzerland during the revolutionary period of 1830 ? 1848 , and where the Protestant and Roman Catholic parties were nearly equal in popular force threatened not a few of the oldest foundations of the medieval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the excesses of a radical party temporarily in control brought about , in 1839 , a violent reaction . The next year saw the disturbance transferred to Aargau . There the anti-Catholic party , commanding , during a period of constitutional revision , a narrow popular majority , and . exasperated by the violent opposition tactics of the clerical party , // forced a vote in favor of the abolition of the eight monasteries of the Canton . The Diet of the Confederation was thereupon asked by the aggrieved party whether it would permit so flagrant a breach of the Pact of 1815 . It was forced by a conflict of interests to a compromise , agreeing to the abolition of four of Aargau 's eight monasteries . This was in August , 184 3 . The next month saw the formation of a separate League ( Sonderb ? oLd ) by the seven Roman Catholic Cantons , Schwyz , Uri , Unterwalden , Luzern , Freiburg , Valais , and Zug . The deputies of these Cantons were , however , slow in withdrawing from the Diet , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its recalcitrant members . Four years this league within a league was permitted to continue its obstructive agitation . But at last , in November , 1847 , war came , ? a sharp , decisive contest of only eighteen clays ' duration , in which the seceded Cantons were overwhelmed and forced back to their allegiance . 636 . The New Constitution . ? Constitutional revision followed immediately . The Pact of 1815 was worn out : a strong and progressive constitution had become a necessity which not even the party of reaction could resist or gainsay . By the Constitution of 1848 there was created , out of the old discordant Confederation of States ( Staatenbend ) the present federal State ( Bundesstaat ) . That Constitution , as modified and extended by the important revision of 1874 , is the present Constitution of Switzerland . 637 . Character of the Constitution . ? The federal government thus established has many features which are like , as well as many which are very unlike , the familiar features of our own national system . It has had , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many important fields of jurisdiction the highest tribunal of the land ; and it has had since 1848 a Legislature consisting of two branches , or Houses , the one representative of the people , the other representative of the states of the Confederation . The popular chamber is called the National Council ' ( der Natioiaalrath. ) , the federal senate , the Council of States ' ( der Stc ederath ) . The former represents the people as a whole ; the latter , the States as constituent members of the Confederation . // 638 . Much of the resemblance of these arrangements to our own is due to conscious imitation .. The object of the reformers of 1848 and 1874 was not , however , to Americanize their government , and in most respects it remains distinctively Swiss . 639 . Nationality and State Sovereignty . ? Much as such institutions resemble our own federal forms , the Constitution of Switzerland rests upon federal foundations such as our own government had during the first half century of its existence rather than upon national conceptions such as have dominated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Constitution does indeed expressly speak of the Swiss nation , declaring that " the Swiss Confederacy has adopted the following Constitution with a view to establishing the union ( Band ) of the Confederates and to maintaining and furthering the unity , the power , and the honor of the Swiss nation " : and not even the war between the States put the word nation into our Constitution . But the Constitution of Switzerland also contains a distinct and emphatic assertion of that principle of divided sovereignty which is so much less familiar to us now than it was before l 561 . It speaks of the Confederation as formed by " the people of the twenty-two sovereign Cantons , " and it explicitly declares that " the Cantons are sovereign , so Par as their sovereignty is not limited by the federal Constitution , a , ud exercise as such all rights which are not conferred upon the federal power " ; and its most competent interpreters are constrained to say that such a constitution does not erect a single and compacted state of which the Cantons are only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of whose membership are themselves states , possessed , within certain limits , of independent and supreme power . The drift both of Switzerland 's past history and present purpose is unquestionably towards complete nationality ; but her present Constitution was a compromise between the advocates and the opponents of nationalization ; and it does not yet embody a truly national organization or power . 640 . Large Constitutional Grants . ? At the same time , the grants of power under the Swiss Constitution have from the first been both larger and less definite than those contained in the Constitution of the United States . It contains such indefinite // grants as these : that the federal legislature shall have power to pass " laws and resolutions concerning those subjects which the Confederacy is commissioned by the federal Constitution to act upon " ; to control the foreign relations of the Cantons ; to guarantee the constitutions and territories of the Cantons ; to provide for the internal safety , order , and peace of the country ; to adopt any measures " which have the administration of the federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fulfilment of federal duties for their object " ; and to effect revisions of the federal Constitution . 641 . It adds to such federal powers as we are familiar with the authority to regulate religious bodies and monastic orders , to control the manufacture and sale of alcoholic liquors , to establish general sanitary regulations in the case of certain diseases , to control the construction and operation of all railroads , to regulate labor in factories , to provide for the compulsory insurance of workmen , and to legislate throughout the whole field of commercial law . The federal government is given , besides , a large power of superintendence . It has supervision of streams and forests , and of the more important roads and bridges ; it has the right to disapprove of and annul the press laws of the several cantons , and their regulations with regard to the acquisition of residence and the franchise in the communes ; and it exercises in many another matter a general oversight and guardianship . 642 . Guarantee of the Cantonal Constitutions . ? The Swiss federal Constitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than our federal Constitution is in guaranteeing to the States " a republican form of government . " The guarantee is made to include the freedom of the people and their legal and constitutional rights ; the exercise of those rights under representative or democratic forms ; and the revision of any cantonal constitution whenever an absolute majority of the citizens of the Canton desire a revision . This ' guarantee ' is not used or understood in Switzerland as it is in the United States . Here the sanction and support of the federal government is taken for granted , unless the constitutional arrangements of a State are challenged as unrepublican . In Switzerland it is expected that each Canton shall seek the explicit sanction or guarantee of the federal government for its constitution , and even for each amendment as added . // Tun CANTONAL GOVERNMENTS . 643 . The Cantonal Constitutions and the Federal Constitution . ? So deeply is Swiss federal organization rooted in cantonal precedents , that an understanding of the government of the Confederation is best gained by studying first the political institutions of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likeness to the governments of the Cantons , out of whose union it has grown . As our own federal Constitution may be said to generalize and apply colonial habit and experience , so the Swiss Constitution may be said to generalize and apply cantonal habit and experience : though both our own Constitution and that of Switzerland have profited largely by foreign example also . 644 . In some respects the Swiss Constitution is more conservative ? or , if you will , less advanced ? than the Constitution of the United States . Those who have fought for union in Switzerland have had even greater obstacles to overcome than have stood in the way of the advocates of a strong central government in this country . Differences of race , oI ' language , and of religion , as well as stiffly opposing political purposes , have offered a persistent resistance to the strengthening and even the logical development of the prerogatives of the federal power . The Constitution of the Conleratiun , therefore , bears many marks of compromise . It gives evidence at certain points of incomplete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cantonal institutions are , consequently , upon a double ground entitled to be first considered in a study of the governments of Switzerland . Both their self-assertive vitality and their direct influence upon federal organization make them the central subject of Swiss politics . 645 . Position of the Legislative Power . ? The development of political institutions has proceeded in the Swiss Cantons rather according to the logic of practical democracy than according to the logic of the schools . The Swiss have not , for one thing , hesitated to ignore in practice all dogmas concerning the separation of legislative , executive , and judicial functions . I say in practice ' ; for in theory such distinctions are observed . The // constitutions of fully half the Cantons say explicitly that legisla-tive , executive , and judicial functions shall be kept fundamen-tally distinct ; but in the practical arrangements actually made the line of demarcation is by no means sharply drawn . The leading principle according to which they proceed in all political arrangements is , that in every department of affairs the people must , either immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effective control . They do not hesitate , there-fore , to give to their legislative bodies a share both in the admin-istration and in the interpretation of laws ; and these bodies are unquestionably the axes of cantonal politics . 646 . A Single House . ? A very great variety of practice marks the organization of government in the Cantons . Each Canton has had its own separate history and has , to a certain extent , worked out its own individual political methods . Rut there is one point of perfect uniformity , ? the Legislature of each Canton consists of but a single House . The two Houses of the federal legisla-ture have been made after foreign , not after Swiss , models . In Uri , Unterwalden , Glarus , and Appenzell this single lawmaking body is the Landsgemeinde , the free assembly of all the qualified voters , the folic-moot ; but in the other Cantons the legislative assembly is representative . Representatives are elected by direct popular vote in all the Cantons , and in almost all by the secret ballot . Elections are for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the different Cantons , the rule being a term of from three to four years . The number of representatives bears a proportion to the number of inhabitants which also varies as between Canton and Canton , the average being about one to every 994 inhabitants ? In most of the Cantons the legislative body is called the Great Council ( Grosse Rath ) ? the executive body being the Lesser Council . In some it is called the Cantonal Council ( Kantonsrath ) ; in others , the Landrath . Functions of the Cantonal Legislatures . ? The functions of these councils have the inclusiveness characteristic of Swiss political organization . Not only are they entrusted with such // legislative power as the people are willing to grant ; they also , as a rule , select many of the administrative officers of the Canton , and exercise , after such election , a scrutiny of administrative affairs which penetrates to details and keeps executive action largely within their control . It is a recognized principle of can-tonal government , indeed , that the executive body ? executive power , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or commission , not in an individual ? is a committee of the representatives of the people , ? a committee of the legislative Council . ' To that council they are responsible , as the selectmen of a New-England town are responsible to the town-meeting ( secs . 1218 , 1219 ) . 650 . The Executive Power is collegiate in all the Cantons , is exercised , that is , not by a single individual or by several indi viduals acting independently of each other , but by a commission . This commission is variously called in the different Cantons . In some it is known as the " Landammann and Council , " in others as the " Estates-Commission " ( Standeslcommission. ) , in some as the " Smaller Council " ; but in most as the " Administrative Council " ( Regierungsrath ) . Its term of aloe varies in the differ ent Cantons with the term of the legislative body , with which it is always coincident ; but the custom is reelection , so that the brief tenure does not in practice result in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the executive have always in the mountain Cantons been chosen by the people themselves ; in the others they were formerly elected always by the legislative council ? whence the name , " smaller council , " which they bear in some Cantons . Now , however , direct election by the people has been substituted in eleven Cantons , and only eight retain the practice of election by the Great Council . Whether elected by the people or by the Great Council , however , the Administrative Council remains , in function , a committee of the legislative body . Its members freely take part in the business of legislation and in the debates of the Great Council . It in fact originates most of the measures of each session , and is looked to for guidance in every matter of consequence . It does not resign if outvoted upon its proposals . It is , on the contrary , regarded in most of the Cantons rather as a business head than as a body of party leaders , THE GOVERNMENTS OF SWITZERLAND . 30i ) and its membership is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the several political parties of the Canton . 651 . The Administrative Council usually consists of from five to seven members , though in the Canton of Berne it contains nine . It has proved necessary of late years to give over the attempt to act in all matters as a Board , and it has become usual to divide the work of the Council among departments . But these departments are under the general direction of the Council as a whole , and the administration of a canton has usually a very real coherence and an intimate coordination . 652 . The People 's Control over Legislative Action . ? Although the people have delegated their legislative powers to representative chambers in all the Cantons except those which still retain their primitive Landsgemeinden , they have nevertheless kept in their own hands more than the mere right to elect representatives . The largest of the Cantons ( Berne ) has but a little more than half a million inhabitants ; the majority of the Cantons have less than one hundred thousand apiece ; and the average population , taking big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and twenty thousand . Their average area scarcely reaches six hundred and forty square miles . The people of such communities stand , as it were , in the midst of affairs . They are in a sense always at hand to judge of the conduct of the public business . Their feelings and their interests are homogeneous , and there is the less necessity to part with their powers to representatives . In seven of the German Cantons a certain number of citizens ( the number varies from one to twelve thousand ) can demand a popular vote upon the question whether the Great Council shall be dissolved or not ; and if the vote goes in the affirmative the chamber 's terns is ended and a new election takes place at once . If this method of control is no longer used , it is because more effective methods have been substituted . In almost all the Cantons the question . of constitutional revision can be brought to popular vote upon petition , and the revision , if undertaken , may go any length in changing or reversing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? In some of the smaller Cantons , again , the people are given a right of Veto . It is provided that , within a certain length of time after the publication of a measure // passed by the Council ( generally about a month ) , a popular vote upon the measure may be forced by the petition of some fifty citizens ( the number varies of course in different Cantons ) and the measure be made to stand or fall according to the decision of that vote . The law is rejected , however , only when an actual majority of all the registered voters cast their ballots against it . Those who do not vote are reckoned as favorable to the law . 654 . The Initiative : Imperative Petition . ? So far has the apparent logic of democracy been carried in Switzerland that the people exercise in several ways a direct part in lawmaking . The right of petition , which is recognized in every country where popular rights exist at all , has become in Switzerland a right of initiative in legislation . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right to initiate constitutional reforms by petition ; and in all except Luzern , Freiburg , and Valais the same right has been established with regard to the revision or enactment of ordinary laws . In the Confederation petitions signed by fifty thousand voters have , since 1591 , been imperative in respect of the introduction of constitutional amendments . In the case of ordinary legislati m , specific laws may be proposed by petition , iu ; ill the Cantons except the three I have named ; the legislature must , snhuiit the law proposed to the popular vote ; and its adoption at the polls puts it upon the statute book . 1 it the case of constitutional amendments , it is generally provided that either general or specific changes may be proposed : that is , that the changes may be proposed either in general terms or in definitive and final form , ready for adoption . If the proposal is couched only in general terms , the legislature may either formulate the desired amendment at once and submit it to the people , or , if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the general question to the vote of the electors . If , in the latter event , the vote be in the affirmative , the legislature must proceed to formulate the necessary article or articles and these must be submitted in their definitive shape once more to the popular verdict . If the petition itself embody a specific change already drawn and formulated , the amendment must go in that shape to the vote , and its adoption makes it part of the fundamental law . The number of signatures required for these imTHE // perative petitions varies with the size of the Cantons , a very usual number being from five to six thousand . Petitions demanding a change in the fundamental law of the Confederation must be signed , as we have seen , by not less than fifty thousand voters . 655 . The Initiative has been very little used , having given place in practice , for the most part , to the ZRefereadum . Where it has been employed it has not promised either progress or enlightenment , leading rather to doubtful experiments and to reactionary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both of the great Cantons of Zurich and Berne , the most populous and influential in the Confederation , it has been used to abolish compulsory vaccination . It was established for the Confederation only six years ago ( 1891 ) , and has been used in federal legislation only to aim a blow at the Jews , under the disguise of a law forbidding the slaughtering of animals by bleeding . 656 . The Referendum . ? Both Veto and Initiative in practice yield precedence to the Referendums . In every Canton of the Confederation , except Freiburg only , the right of the people to have all important legislation referred to then for confirmation or rejection has now been , in one form or another , established by law . In the smaller Cantons , which have had , time out of mind , the directest forms of democracy , this legislation by the , people is no new thing ; they have always had their Landsgemeinden , their assemblies of the whole people , and the legislative function of their Councils has long been only the duty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Cantons which have representative institutions , on the other hand , the Referendum assumes a different form . In about one-half of them laws must be submitted to the vote of the electors only when their submission is demanded by petition , with the requisite number of signatures . This is called the ' optional or ' facultative Referendum . In the rest of the Cantons ( always excepting Catholic and conservative Freiburg ) substantially all substantive changes in the laws must be submitted to the electors , and the action of their legislatures is periodically voted upon . This is known as the obligatory ' Referendum . The Federation itself has had the optional Referendum since 1874 . The Referendum is , moreover , everywhere obligatory , whether in the Confederation or in the // several Cantons , in the case of every constitutional change . Administration and the ordinary budget are usually excepted from its operation , and it is made to apply , within the field of ordinary legislation , only to laws of a general character ; but in most of the Cantons it is made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above a certain sum ; and in Valais it applies only to certain financial measures . 657 . Origin of the Referendum . ? The term Referendum is as old as the sixteenth century , and contains a reminiscence of the strictly federal beginnings of government in two of the present Cantons of the Confederation , Graubunden , namely , and Valais . These Cantons were not at that time members of the Confederation , but merely districts allied with it ( zugezuandte Orte ) . Within themselves they constituted very loose confederacies of Communes ( in Graubunden three , in Valais twelve ) . The delegates whom the Communes sent to the federal assembly of the district had to report every question of importance to their constituents and crave instruction as to how they should vote upon it . This was the original Referendum . It had a partial counterpart in the Constitution of the Confederation down to the formation of the present forms of government in 1848 . Before that ( late the members of the central council of the Confederation acted always under instructions from their respective Cantons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as upon all nstters of unusual importance , it was their duty to seek special direction front their home governments . They were said to be commissioned ad uuulieurlauvt It referendum . The Referendum as now adopted by almost all the Cantons bears the radically changed character of legislation by the people . Only its name now gives testimony as to its origins G58 . Its Operation . ? In respect of constitutional changes the use of the Referendum is not peculiar to Switzerland . In that field its use in this country is older than its use in Switzerland . And in its application to ordinary laws it is modern even in Switzerland . Its earliest adoption was in 1852 , and it was not until the decade 1864-1874 that it won its way into the constitutional practice of the greater Cantons . Its use , therefore , is everywhere new , and the experience by which we must judge of it is recent and partial . It is still tested only in part . It has led in most cases to the rejection of radical legislation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the ordinary voter might be expected to accept with avidity . The Swiss populations , being both homogeneous and deeply conservative , have resisted , as perhaps no other people have , the infection of modern radical opinion . They have shown themselves // apt to reject , also , complicated measures which they do not fully comprehend , and measures involving expense which seems to them unnecessary . And yet they have shown themselves not a little indifferent , too . The vote upon most measures submitted to the ballot is usually very light ; there is not much popular discussion ; and the Referendum by no means creates that quick interest in affairs which its originators had hoped to see it excite . It has dulled the sense of responsibility among legislators without in fact quickening the people to the exercise of any real control in affairs . 659 . Local Government : the Districts . ? Local government in the Cantons exhibits a twofold division , into Districts and Communes . The District is an area of state administration , the Commune an area of local self-government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of police , namely , and the carrying into effect of the cantonal laws , are entrusted , as a rule , not to a board , but to a single officer , ? a Bezirhsanamanm or Regierungs-.Statthalter , ? who is either elected by popular vote in the District or appointed by one of the central cantonal councils , the legislative or the administrative . Associated with this officer , there is in some Cantons a District or county Council chosen by vote of the people . 660 . The Gemeinde , or Commune , enjoys in Switzerland a degree of freedom in self-direction which is possessed by similar local organs of government hardly anywhere else in Europe . It owns land as a separate corporation , has charge of the police of its area , of the relief of its poor , and of the administration of its schools , and acts in the direction of communal affairs through a primary assembly of all its freemen which strongly reminds one of the New-England town-meeting ( sec. 121.5 ) . Besides its activities as an organ of self-government in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an organ of cantonal administration , as a subdivision of the District . Thus it is an electoral district , and a voting district in the case of a Referendum ; and in so far as it is used as a district of the Canton it is subject to the supervision of the local authorities of the state . 661 . There is by no means a fixed and uniform organization in the local government of the Cantons . In the Communes of // the French Cantons , for example , ' the people do not themselves act directly in affairs , in township meeting , as the people of the German Cantons do , but through an elected council , and the organization of local business suggests the cantonal organization upon a small scale . In all the Communes alike , however , as in the Cantons , the executive power is vested in a board of officials , presided over by a Ilauptntann , a Genneindeamnaan , a Syndic , or a Maize . This communal or municipal council is chosen , in the German Cantons , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the representative body to which supervision in affairs and the enactment of all local regulations is entrusted . The I auptrnann has often separate powers of his own , apart from and independent of his colleagues ; but in most matters he is merely the presiding officer of the administrative council , and executive action is collegiate . 662 . Citizenship in Switzerland is associated very closely with the Commune , ? the immediate home-government of the citizen , ? the primary and most vital organ of his self-direction in public affairs . The Commune is , so to say , the central political family in Switzerland ; it is to it that the primary duties of the citizen an . owed . Naturalization is regulated by federal law ; but the full rights of citizenship can be conferred only by cantonal and communal law . THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT . 663 . The Federal Executive . ? In no feature of the federal organization is the influence of cantonal example more evident than in the collegiate character of the Executive . The executive power of the Confederation , like the executive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single person , as under monarchical or presidential government , but in a board of persons . Nor does Swiss jealousy of a too concentrated executive authority satisfy itself with thus putting that authority ' into commission : it also limits it by giving to the legislative branch of the government , both in the Cantons and in the federal system , an authority of correction as regards executive acts such as no other country has known . The share of the legislative branch in administrative affairs is smaller , indeed , under the Federal Constitution than // under the laws of the Cantons ; but it is large even in the federal system , and it seems inherent in Swiss political thought . 664 . The executive commission of the Confederation is known as the Federal Council ( Bandesrath ) . It consists of seven mem bers elected for a term of three years by the two houses of the federal legislature acting together in joint session as a Federal Assembly ( Bundesversammaliang ) . The Constitution forbids the choice of two of its seven members from one and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cantons . The Council is organized under a President and Vice-President chosen by the Federal A ssembly , from among the seven councillors , to serve for a term of one year , the Constitution insisting upon the extreme democratic doctrine of rotation . Neither President nor Vice-President can fill the same office for two consecutive terms ; nor can the President be immediately nominated to the office of Vice-President again upon the expiration of his term . There is nothing to prevent the Vice-President succeeding the President , however ; and it has hitherto been the uniform practice to follow this natural and proper line of promotion . The Federal Assembly may elect to the Council any Swiss citizen who is eligible to either Chamber of the Legislature . As a matter of fact , however , they almost invariably make their choice from amongst the members of the Chambers , though an election to a place in the executive body necessitates a resignation of the legislative function . Berne and Zurich have always been represented in the Bundesrath , and are consid ered to have acquired a sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always had a member , too ; and Aargau was represented con tinuously till 1891 . The choice of the Federal Assembly in constituting the executive has hitherto been admirably conservative . Some of the more prominent members of the Council have been retained upon it by repeated reelection for fifteen or sixteen years ; one has served for thirty years ; and those who have left its membership have generally done so of their own accord . Only twice , indeed , since 1848 , have members who wished reelection been refused The Federal Assembly fills all vacancies in the membership of the Council , electing , however , only for the unexpired term . The three-years term of the Council is coincident with the three-years term of the National Council , the popular branch of the Legislature . // At the beginning of each triennial term of this lower House , the two Houses come together as a Federal Assembly and elect ( in practice reelect ) the Federal Council . If the National Council be dissolved before the close of its three-years term , the election of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assembling of the new National Council . The Bundesrath is thus not , strictly speaking , elected for three years , but for the term of the National Council , whatever that may turn out to be . 669 . The precedence of the President of the Council is a merely formal precedence : he is in no sense the Chief Executive . He represents the Council in receiving the representatives of foreign powers ; he enjoys a somewhat enhanced dignity , being addressed in diplomatic intercourse as ' His Excellency ' ; and he receives a little larger salary than his colleagues receive ; but he is in all practical matters merely the Council 's chairman . 670 . The Executive and the Legislature . ? The members of the Federal Council , though they may not be at the same time members of either House of the Legislature , may attend the sessions of either House , may freely take part in debate , and may introduce proposals concerning subjects - under consideration : may exercise most of the privileges of membership , except the right to vote . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business of the Mouses , and every bill is submitted to them for an opinion before its passage . They thus to a certain extent occupy a position resembling that which a French or English ministry occupy ; but there is this all-important difference : - the English or French ministers are subject to ' parliamentary responsibility , ' ? must resign , that is , whenever any important measure which they favor is defeated ; whereas the Swiss ministers are subject to no such responsibility . Defeat in the Legislature does not at all affect their tenure . They hold office for a term of years , not for a term of legislative success ; and they are the servants of the Houses , not their leaders . They have habitually been chosen from both the chief parties in the Confederation , and since 1891 a third political group has been represented among them . They are not expected to speak the same opinions even on the floor of the Houses . But they are expected to act in harmony in all business , and to mediate between extreme views in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two cases since the establishment of the Council , in 1848 , ? two cases , that is , in fifty years , ? of resignation from the Council on the ground of disagreement in political opinion , ? but two only . l 672 . The Executive Departments . ? The Council acts as a body of Ministers . It was the purpose of the Constitution that all executive business should be handled by the Council as a whole , but of course such collegiate action has proved practically im possible : it has been necessary to divide the work among seven Departments . Each member of the Council presides over a De partment , conducting it much as an ordinary minister would under a Cabinet system , though there is a somewhat closer union of the several Departments than characterizes other systems , and a greater degree of control by the several ministers over such details of administration as the ' permanent ' subordinates of Cabinet ministers generally manage , by virtue of possession , to keep in their own hands , to the restraint and government of tran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Council as a whole ; and , so far as is practicable , the collegiate action contemplated by the Constitution is adopted . The seven Departments , as organized by a law taking effect Janu ary 1 , 1888 , are ( 1 ) of Foreign Affairs , ( 2 ) of Justice and Police , ( 3 ) of the Interior , ( 4 ) of War , ( 5 ) of Finance and Imposts , ( 6 ) of Industry and Agriculture , and ( 7 ) of Posts and Railways . The department of Foreign Affairs is now separated from the presidency , with which it was formerly always associated , so that greater continuity of policy is now possible in all departments.2 The arrangement of administrative business in Depart ments is effected in Switzerland , as in France and Germany , by executive decree , and not by legislative enactment , as in the United States . It is considered the capital defect of this collegiate organization of the Swiss executive , combined as it is with the somewhat antagonistic arrangement of a division of executive business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Council to exercise at one and the same time two largely inconsistent functions . They are real , not simply nomi nal , heads of Departments , and are obliged as such to give their time and attention to the routine , the detail , and the technical niceties of adminis tration ; and yet as a body they are expected to impart to the administra tion as a whole that uniformity , breadth , and flexibility of policy that can // be imparted only by those who stand aloof from detail and routine and command the wider views of general expediency . They are called to be both technical officials and political guides . It has been suggested by thoughtful Swiss publicists that it would be vastly better to give the De partments permanent heads and leave to a board of ministers such as the present Council only a general oversight , Political and administrative functions require different aptitudes , must be approached from very differ ent points of view , and ought seldom to be united in the same persons.i Mixed Functions of the Executive . ? Swiss law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinction between executive , legis lative , and judicial functions . Popular jealousy of executive power has resulted , alike in the cantonal systems and in the sys tem of the Confederation , in the vesting of many executive func tions either wholly or in part in the lawmaking bodies , and a very singular confusion between executive and judicial functions has resulted in the possession by both the executive and the legis lative bodies of prerogatives which should , on any strict classifi cation , belong only to regularly constituted courts of law . It is , consequently , somewhat difficult to get a clear summary view of the role played in Swiss federal affairs by the central executive Council . Its duties give it a toueli both of legislative and of judicial quality . ( 1 ) It stands closely connected with the Legislature because of its part in shaping legislation . The Council both origi nates proposals in the Houses and gives its opinion upon pro posals referred to it , either by the Houses or by the Cantons . It renders annual reports to the Houses concerning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which give it opportunity to urge upon them necessary measures of reform or amelioration ; and which , being freely debated , give the members of the Houses , also , an opportunity to press their own criticisms and suggestions with reference to the conduct of the administra tion . It presents the budget of the Confederation also to the Houses and leads in its debates of financial legislation . It is , in brief , the intimate servant and in part the authoritative guide of the Legislature , both taking and giving advice . The Houses may // reverse whatever action of the Executive they please , even though it be merely administrative in character ; but they usually suggest , they do not often condemn action already taken . 677. ( 2 ) In the exercise of several of its most important duties the action of the Council is essentially judicial . It is empowered to examine the agreements made by Cantons among themselves or with foreign governments and to judge of their conformity with federal constitutional law , withholding its approval at its discretion . In like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is made dependent upon its approval ; and to a very limited extent , a jurisdiction like that entrusted to the Federal Court in hearing complaints concerning breaches of federal law is given it . It has also authoritative oversight of the administration of federal law by the cantonal officials . There are not many federal officials ; federal law is for the most part executed by local officers , the Federal Council supervising . 678 . Here are some of the topics touching which the authoritative opinion of the Council may be taken : cantonal school affairs ; freedom of trade and commerce , and the interpretation of contracts with foreign states which concern trade and customs-levies , patent rights , rights of set tlement , freedom from military service , free passage , etc. ; rights of settle ment within the Cantons ; freedom of belief ; validity of cantonal elections , Totes , etc. ; gratuitous equipment of the militia . ' 679. ( 3 ) Its strictly executive functions are , however , its most prominent and important functions . It appoints all officers whose selection is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course directs the whole executive action of the government , controlling federal finance , and caring for all federal interests ; equally of course , it manages the foreign affairs of the Confedera tion . Besides these usual executive and administrative functions , it exercisgs , however , others less common . It is the instru ment of the Constitution in making good to the Cantons the federal guarantee of their constitutions . It executes the judg ments of the Federal Court , and also all agreements or decisions of arbitrators concerning matters in dispute between Cantons . ' In cases of necessity it ma , y call out and itself direct the move ments of such cantonal troops as are needed to meet any sudden
