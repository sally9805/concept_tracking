txt The advent of young Mr. CORNELIUS VANDERBILT in politics may or may not prove to be an important event . There is frequent* and well-grounded complaint that young men of education , refinement , and social position avoid participating in practical politics , but content themselves with voting and lamenting that political methods are not more seemly . It has , however , occasionally happened that young men of the kind described have entered the field of political practice and hastily withdrawn therefrom as soon as its true nature was fully revealed to them . It is to be hoped that this will not be the case with CORNELIUS VANDERBILT . Nothing , it may be said , is generally known as to his force of character or his personal principles . If he should reveal that the former was great and the latter high  --  and there is no reason for supposing that he will not do so  --  he might by reason of his wealth and position step at once to a level of power which less fortunate men might spend many years of struggle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time the comment on Mr. VANDERBILT 'S debut as a politician has not given any consideration to his personality . What this man might do as a man , possessed of the undoubted power which wealth confers , has not been discussed either by his political sponsors or by those newspapers which regard any action as worthy of much broad-faced type and many pictures , if only the performer of it possesses large blocks of dividend-paying securities . All that has seemed to appeal to these politicians and these journals is the fact that a young man of wealth has entered into a class of society usually avoided by his kind , and that the millions which he possesses may thus be turned into unwonted channels and help to float his party toward triumph . Unfortunately this reduction of one 's personality to zero is one of the penalties of wealth . It is not only money that talks , but money that makes talk . Nevertheless , it is discouraging to see Mr. VANDERBILT on his entry into politics regarded merely as the spigot of a barrel .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
