Secretary Gage 's report is rather barren of suggestion this year , but it can not be said that any subject of current interest is neglected . He recommends reduction of the revenue by $30,000,000 He suggests additional legislation to enable the Secretary to maintain parity between silver money and gold money , and he hints that the bank-note currency is far from perfect , that it does not adapt itself to the changing requirements of trade ; its volume being governed not by the requirements of business , but by the price of Government bonds . He goes in for ship-subsidies like a good Administration man , and he makes some minor suggestions of more or less value . The tone of the report is that of a man who finds his affairs going well , with a comfortable balance on the right side of the ledger , and who is disposed to take things easy . The principal item in the Secretary 's report is the statement of receipts and expenditures . One year ago he estimated that the fiscal year ending June 30 , 1900 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It turns out to be within a small fraction of $80.000,000 , and it hap pens in this instance that three-fourths of the error was in an underestimate of receipts . The estimate in the last report for the year 1901 was a deficit of $18,000,000 . The present estimate for 1901 is a surplus of $80,000,000 . This large surplus brings up the question whether a reduction of taxes to the amount of only $30,000,000 is sufficient to meet the present exigency . Looking at the temptation to subsidies and jobs which a large surplus presents to the appetite of the cormorants who always hover around Congress , we think that the time is ripe for a tax-reduction of $40,000,000 , if not more . There is a necessarily comic air about the President 's pious hope that Congress will be economical . Coming on the heels of recommendations that call for needless millions , and coupled with the well-known fact that McKinley would no more veto an extravagant appropriation bill than he would try to fly from the White House to the Capitol , it will induce Congressmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislating that surplus out of the Treasury in as neat and speedy and thorough-going a fashion as possible . How intent the eye of Congress is on the main chance , we may see by the indecent haste with which the Shipping-Subsidy Bill has been thrust to the front . The President asks for Philippine legislation by Congress , and the prompt response of the " steering committee " is the displacement of the Spooner Philippine resolutions by the Subsidy Bill , which is to have right of way in the Senate from now on . Mr. G. Weaver Loper of Philadelphia writes a very strong letter to the Times against the Ship-Subsidy scheme . He treats the subject like a man who understands both navigation and shipbuilding . It has been often pointed out that the subsidy-hunters are doing a good business now , and that the demand for additional money from the public treasury is merely to pay them twice over for earning their own living , as though this were such a meritorious act when performed on shipboard that it ought not to go unrecognized and unrewarded . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They request that the United States Government shall expend the sum of $9,000,000 per annum for the purpose of increasing the profits of ships already in existence and now under contract to be constructed , both in this country and in Europe ; and it might be well to bear in mind that all of such contracts must now be carried to completion irrespective of the fate that might befall the Ship Subsidy Bill . The pretence , therefore , that the purpose of the bill is to promote an increase of American merchant shipping is one which hardly rises to the dignity of a fairly disguised bunco-game . The real effect of its passage would be a mere bounty upon property owned or contracted for . " He then applies a deserved lash to the back of Mr. Chamberlain , the Commis-sinner who opposed subsidies during the Cleveland Administration , when the shipping interest was much poorer than it is to-day , but now has the effrontery to tell us that our shipbuilders need help from the Treasury because the principal element of cost in their trade is steel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ producing this raw material of the shipbuilding art , while we are actually sending steel to England from furnaces situated on the other side of the Alleghanies . Mr. Loper points out also that those shipbuilders are even now appropriating to themselves the subsidy as a part of their own profits , by charging for new ships not merely the cost and a fair profit , but the sum on which the buyers will be able to earn interest if the Subsidy Bill passes . Why should they not do so ? They have more orders for ships than they can fill . Why should they not pocket all that the subsidy act will enable them to charge ? Every sign of awakened conscience on the subject of our national disgrace , the lynching habit , is surely to be welcomed ; and the Chicago protest on Thanksgiving Day was of good augury . But the eagerness to get the President to " refer to the matter in his message to Congress " was disconcerting . Did not the movers of the resolutions know that a President 's message is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the lost in being paved with good intentions ? If you want Congressmen utterly to disregard any given aspect of public morality , get the President urgently to call their attention to it . Very likely there was also , in this curious desire to induce the President to take official notice of lynching , a vague feeling that , in this way , we might salve our consciences . A sin officially deprecated can scarcely be charged up against us . We will stay the recording angel 's hand by reminding him that our Chief Magistrate really wishes we would be good . As for the President 's going beyond a gentle aspiration , and actually recommending anti - lynching legislation , that was , of course , out of the question . The only place in which the United States , as a nation , call intervene to protect the lives of black men is in the Philippines . Our soldiers there habitually describe their present occupation as " nigger-killing . " That the President can order stopped ; he can do nothing to punish negro-slayers - in Colorado @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the talk about a treaty with Nicaragua for the construction of a canal , it is clear that all that Secretary Hay can have done is to prepare the way for action after the Hay-Pauncefote treaty shall have been ratified . Till that step is taken , our hands are tied . The Administration is absolutely committed to the binding force of the Clayton-Bulwer treaty , till modified or abrogated . To say , therefore , that Mr. Hay has made a treaty with Nicaragua which the ClaytonBulwer treaty binds him not to make , would be to say that he has been trifling with the national honor . If the HayPauncefote treaty were ratified , we might then honorably and properly enter into an agreement with Nicaragua , or Colombia , for the policing of a canal built through the territory of either . It is , we are convinced , only a tentative arrangement of such a nature , to become operative solely in the future , which the Secretary of State has effected . More we could not ask , more neither Nicaragua nor Colombia could give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treaty from doing what they are loosely said to have done . The condition previous to any rational action about an Isthmian canal of any kind anywhere is approval of the Hay-Pauncefote treaty . All roads lead to that conclusion . Secretary Hay has simply taken precautionary steps so as to be able to say exactly what can be done in the canal business after we get the right to do anything . As it now stands , the Administration 's Army Bill is a perfect type of the hasty and ill-digested legislation which is coming to be more and more characteristic of Congress . Almost the only plain things about it are that the greatest period of expansion in its history is at hand for the army , and that some 70,000 men are needed on the Philippine firing lines . Of the Filipinos themselves , some 12,000 are to be recruited under this bill to help us shoot down their brethren , and the Porto Rico regiment is to be retained , provision being made for native officers up to the rank of major . To make up for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the foulmouthed Commissary-General Eagan , the bill contains a provision which will permit the latter 's retirement on three-quarters pay . So many will be the promotions under this proposed law that the grades of first lieutenant and second lieutenant will be emptied of their present incumbents  --  a fact which will doubtless help to reconcile many legislators to our coming heavy military burdens . To fill the vacancies recourse will first be had to the present volunteer officers , who are , fortunately for the army , to be examined before appointment . After this list is exhausted will come the deluge of sons and cousins of politicians who are fortunate in their pulls . Of true army reform , there is scarce a trace in the bill as it now stands after changes made by the House Military Committee . Secretary Root not only failed to strike a blow at the real evils of the staff organization by recommending the consolidation and reduction of the present topheavy departments , but actually included in his measure additional officers for every one of them , thus turning his back completely on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the adoption of the staff-andline transfer principle , for which he deserves all credit , and in an emasculated and weakened form this still remains . The reinstatement of the permanent tenure system for bureau chiefs by the Committee is inexcusable in view of the Eagan episode and the navy 's happy experience with the opposite plan . Secretary Root had wisely confined the appointment of volunteers to the grade of second lieutenant . The Committee 's decision that the President shall have the right to appoint volunteers to any rank in the army is another triumph for the political soldiers , and will be received with groans wherever trained regular officers are stationed . If the bill passes in its present form the country will pay heavily for it , not only in taxes , but in the possession of a polit ical army , over-officered and in many places badly officered . It means simply the enlargement of an antiquated , inefficient machine , with an intensification of nearly every one of its now well-proved defects . The growing tendency of Congress to shirk responsibility by shifting it on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign of the decay of republican government noted for a long time The Republican Philadelphia Ledger sees in it a real ground for the charge of Imperialism , and finds it " shocking testimony " to the ability of Jingoism to lead us away from the spirit which should actuate men of republican beliefs living in a democracy . It does not believe that Mr. McKinley will abuse the privileges given to him , but it rightly fears the result of setting such an un- merican precedent as to confer on him , respecting the size of our army , greater power than the German Emperor 's , who can not add a single soldier to his army . A proof of this is that the Reichstag has been teeming with protests during the past month against the unauthorized dispatch of a volunteer East Asiatic corps to China , and the defenders of the German Constitution have been outspoken in their attack upon this violation of its sanctity , using the very same arguments which apply to our own case . What a change has come over the spirit of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make common cause with the most liberal subjects of what we have so long considered a " down-trodden " monarchy ! It is already " feared " in Administration circles in Washington that Congress may , after all , limit the President 's power to raise armies to two years . We trust that it will not even give him this power for two days . The War Department 's Division of Insular Affairs has issued the annual report of the army officer in charge of the licensing of saloons in Manila . From this it appears that between February 1 and June 30 , 1900 , the number of licensed saloons was reduced from 224 to 155 , including hotels and restaurants . The cause of this was a large increase in the cost of licenses , and it is certainly gratifying to hear that this same reason and the fear of the loss of their privileges made the barrooms more orderly and saloon-keepers more careful in complying with the law . There are none the less many persons who are of the opinion that 155 saloons are still far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troops as is Manila , if their health and welfare are to be considered , as well as their relations to the natives , to whom drunkenness is an inexcusable vice . Some of the disadvantages of the American saloon in the tropics are set forth in the San Juan ( Porto Rice ) News of November 10 , from which it appears that the casualties in " Sam " Owens 's and W. H. Beers 's places on the previous night were one killed and seven wounded . All the participants were Americans except two policemen who had their heads smashed , and one whose leg was broken by a bullet . Murderer and murdered were Americans , and in Owens 's saloon the fight was between infantrymen and artillerymen . The actual details could not be obtained before going to press , the News reports , as all concerned in the row were " considerably the worse " for liquor . It would be unfair to assume that such occurrences are daily ones in either Manila or San Juan . But in view of the feeling of contempt and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any nationality , such happenings attain a serious character , and our military authorities in Manila will be more than justified if they take steps to prevent similar demonstrations of the benefit of a higher civilization , by largely reducing the existing rumshops . It is , to put the case no more strongly , an ungracious policy for the Government to ' " hold up " a benefaction on its way to an organization of public utility . The Federal inheritance tax , which is bad enough when it reaches only gifts of money , is doubly burdensome when it affects bequests other than in cash or securities . It is here that the museums suffer . The bequest of a collection of pictures becomes an immediate draft upon the general fund , so much so that the very largeness of a gift may prevent its acceptance How , for instance , the Metropolitan Museum is to pay a tax estimated at $37,000 on the pictures bequeathed to it by the late R. G. Dun , does not appear . What is clear is the injustice of a law that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a bargain sale every time that it receives a considerable bequest . A clause exempting such institutions from the inheritance tax is urgently required , and the museums of the country look to Congress for prompt relief . It has long been felt that the Terri-tory of Oklahoma would soon press its claim to Statehood ; it has been generally recognized , too , that the future of the newest Territory is bound up with that of the adjoining Indian Terri-tory . That this identity of interest is fully recognized by the parties chiefly concerned , is shown by the call for a joint convention of the two Territories , at which the question of separate or united appeal for Statehood will be considered . Oklahoma has already a population large enough to constitute a State , but it is obvious that the Indian - Territory ought to constitute a part of the new commonwealth . Opposition to this plan will come not so much from Oklahoma as from the Indian . Territory , where there is natural jealousy of the flourishing settlement that has grown up almost overnight in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a feeling , too , that the more prosperous Territory must profit most by the union . Such considerations , however , should weigh little with the Indian Territory against the anomalous condition in which it now finds itself . Since the Curtiss bill abolished the old tribal governments , the Indian Territory , which had enjoyed an excellent government of its own , has reverted temporarily to the condition of a great reservation ruled by appointive officers . Such a condition of things is not only humiliating , but also practically inconvenient , and there is little doubt that the Indians will welcome Statehood on almost any terms . Mr. Bryan , in his new role as writer for the magazines , informs us in the December North , American , Review that the election was " not necessarily conclusive upon any question " Granting this , if we must , we may yet insist that it was conclusive upon one personality . It demonstrated beyond a peradventure that W. J. Bryan is a very poor vote-getter . East and West he ran behind his own ticket . Democratic candidates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York and Connecticut , in Illinois and Minnesota . Democratic Congressmen left him far in the rear . Now this may be wholly deplorable . Mr. Bryan may be a weak candidate through a cruel misunderstanding of his personality . He may be suffering like Aristides from being too just But the fact is that he did suffer personal repudiation at the polls ; that he was a weak candidate , weaker than his party . And no party can be expected to go into Presidential election after Presidential election simply for the sake of making a flourish . The time will come when party managers will cast about seriously to command party success , and then they will drop Mr. Bryan , for they will perceive that , with him , success can not be had . This was settled in the last election , whether anything else was or not . To a man of Mr. Chamberlain 's pride , it must have been galling to have to confess that he had , despite his denials , been connected ( unwittingly , he says ) with a company interested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that neither directly nor indirectly had he any such interest . It was proved , later , that his family were the controlling stockholders in a great contracting firm , Kynochs &; Co. , having large dealings with the Admiralty . His wife , his son , his brother , and a lotof dummy clerk-stockholders from his office were the majority interest in that corporation ; yet Mr. ChaMberlain , with Roman firmness , disowned his own kith and kin by avowing that he had not even an indirect interest in their investments . But the public saw a kind of rough truth in Mr. Labouchere 's assertion in a public speech , " If Mr. Chamberlain were in the dock , where he probably ought to be , he would be known as Chamberlain , alias Kynochs . " And there are other unpleasant revelations concerning the financial connection of the Colonial Secretary with companies affected by Government action . He was a stockholder in the Niger Company , lately bought out by the Crown . He is interested in a Ceylon land company , and the wicked are noting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent to Ceylon . The Hon. Joseph may be as innocent as a babe in all these matters , but he is singularly unlucky in having so many of them come out . He will be asked ugly questions about them in the Commons , and can not always say that he is attacked only because he is the great pillar of the Empire . The parallel between Blame 's career and that of Chamberlain has often been remarked ; it would be strange if the latter 's loss of public esteem should also result from has having seen too many official " channels in which he might be useful . " When so conservative and influential en organ of opinion as the London Statist lifts up its voice against the policy of extermination in South Africa , and calls for some honorable compromise with the burghers still in arms , we may be sure that it utters the unexpressed thoughts of many Englishmen . The war has already cost $500,000,000 . The force with which the War Office at first proposed to conquer the two republics has been increased eightfold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever , if unconditional surrender is to be insisted upon Where the mistake was made was after Roberts had taken Pretoria and Buller had driven the Boers out of Natal . Botha and De Wet then asked for terms , but the British Generals , under orders from London , replied that no terms but unconditional surrender could be admitted . That was a very un-English blunder . Always before , in the history of modern British colonization , English statesmen have been only too glad , after whipping a force in the field against them , to come to a speedy agreement with the native leaders , utilizing them in the work of administration when possible . But now the Dutch are treated with more unbending truculence than Indian rajahs or Malay chiefs " Letters from the Huns " ( Hunnenbriefe ) was the general title which Herr Richter , with mordant satire , gave to the letters of German soldiers in China which he read out in the Reichstag . Their tale of rapine and slaughter was , indeed , gruesome , but it is probable that the civilized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the latest official looting in Pekin . It appears that the astronomical instruments , some of them with superb mountings of bronze , which have been for more than two centuries , ever since they were erected by the Jesuits , one of the glories of the Pekin Observatory , are already packed for shipment to Berlin and Paris . The other Powers are said to have protested against this act of the German and French commanders , whether because they consider it vandalism , or because they did not get their fair share of the plunder , might seem a little doubtful . But even Dr. Morrison , who has all along advocated severe measures in order to " teach the Chinese a lesson , " protests in his dispatches to the Times that this is nlot the lesson which the Chinese need . We should hope not . A higher civiliiation which begins the work of educating a lower by robbing it of what few instruments and symbols of culture it possesses , might as well be , but for the name , a set of howling savages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in stripping Spain and Greece of art treasures . They indulged in no mummeries about the blessings of civilization , but said simply that they wanted the paintings and the marbles , and took them without more ado . Gen. Waldersee has now given the practical comment on the saying of the German Chancellor , " We desire our share in what is to be won from China . " The most humiliating aspect of this course of stealing and butchery in China is that it has been followed by nations which had scarcely done vowing , in. the Hague Conference , that they would never do anything of the kind . The declarations there made concerning the laws of war asserted that prisoners of war " must be humanely treated . " We know what the Russians have done in Mantchuria ; and German soldiers have written that they nad been ordered to bayonet batch after batch of prisoners " in order to save cartridges . " As for the practice of pillage , the Hague Conference was explicit in condemnation . It specifically reprobated the seizure , destruction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institutions . In the light of this prohibition , the razing of temples and now the looting of the Pekin Observatory must make China thankful that she at least did not sign the final act at The Hague . That hypocrisy she might well be content to leave to the Powers who went out from the Conference to violate straightway their solemn agreements .
