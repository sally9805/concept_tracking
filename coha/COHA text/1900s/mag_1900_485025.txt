There never was a national election the results of which were made so clear within twenty-four hours after the polls closed as that of November 6 The only States in the Union regarding which any doubt was then left were Idaho and Nebraska , and the estimates of majorities everywhere are but slightly changed by fuller returns . These simply emphasize the overwhelming rebuke to Bryanism which was administered by the Middle West and the States beyond the Pacific ; the most extraordinary changes from 1896 being the reduction of Bryan 's majorities in the mining State of Colorado from nearly 135,000 to about 40,000 , and in Idaho from about 17,000 to an almost even division , and in Utah 4,000 for McKinley now , instead of more than 51,000 against him four years ago . The only thing needed to cap the climax was Bryan 's loss of his own State , and this , too , has come to pass . No verdict of the people was ever so emphatic . Scott in 1852 and Greeley in 1872 received a smaller proportion of the electoral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was there anything like such overwhelming popular majorities against the defeated candidate . Bryan takes his defeat as well as could be expected from one who was stunned by the result . He says that the election was a surprise to him , and he does not deny that the widespread increase in the popular vote for McKinley reflects public sentiment , although he could not resist the temptation to intimate that the Republicans profited by the colonization . of voters , by the purchase of votes , and by getting tickets or passes for their voters who were away from home . He thinks that the prosperity argument was probably the most potent one used by the Republicans , and that the appeal to " stand by the President while the war is on " had a great deal of influence . He says that what he calls " the contest between plutocracy and Democracy " will go on , and that he will always take an active interest in politics , but he appears to appreciate the fact that his party is done with a national leader who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he does not want to go to the United States Senate , for the latest returns indicate that the Republicans have secured the Nebraska Legislature . The people like to see a beaten candidate accept the popular verdict uncomplainingly , and Bryan shows good sense in the attitude which he has now assumed . Congressman McCall of Massachusetts received at the polls last week a tremendous vindication of his independence . He was the leader in the Republican revolt against the Porto Rican tariff policy which was favored by the McKinley Administration last winter , and made a powerful argument against its injustice in a minority report from the Ways and Means Committee . He followed this up on the floor of the House by a vigorous speech against the bill favored by the majority of his colleagues , and later in the session he spoke and voted , almost alone on the Republican side , against the absurd Constitutional amendment regarding Trusts , which was pushed through as a pasty measure . He went home to find that his Republican constituents were glad to renominate him , and at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his district . It was to be expected that the Quay machine in Pennsylvania would employ all the usual means of coercion to effect the return of its head to the United States Senate . In resorting to blackmail within the organization , however , it has gone a step too far . It was Representative-elect Samuel M. Ray of Philadelphia who was to be " lined up " for the Senatorial caucus . When he refused to pledge himself in advance , two of his leaders hinted at election frauds in his district , for which he would be made answerable , and intimated that a Prosecution could be avoided only by a signing of the pledge to attend the caucus and abide by its decision . Mr. Ray was new in politics , and inexperienced in blackmail charges . In a moment of natural weakness he paid the price required for " protection " from his own chiefs . On sober second thought , he published a letter to the effect that the pledge extorted from him by threats had been signed only as a matter of temporary convenience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and indifferent to the trumped-up charge of election fraud ; finally , that he would under no circumstances vote for Quay during the present session of the Legislature The Allied Organizations for Good Government will follow up the case , and fine and imprisonment already hang over two Of Quay 's lieutenants . Sixty-four thousand shares of Pacific Mail Steamship Company were bought on the Stock Exchange last week , and the price advanced from 43 to 57 , fourteen points , which is equal to 28 per cent , At first this advance was ascribed to some expected change of management , but later it was attributed to the expectation of the early passage of the Steamship Subsidy Bill . The Republican managers did not dare to press this bill to a vote before the election . There were two reasons for this hesitancy . They were not quite sure that they would have votes enough to pass it , and if they did pass it they were not quite sure that they would have enough votes to reelect Mr. McKinley . So they wisely laid the bill aside till @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , during the coming short session , but it is extremely doubtful if they can pass it in the three months that remain to the present Congress It is doubtful whether they can command a sufficient number of votes in the House . It is possible for - the Democrats in the Senate to " talk it to death " in the intervals between the passage of the appropriation bills . The bill has had no discussion in Congress yet . Its only consideration has been in committees The bill may form the subject of a very attractive gamble , but it will not become a law this winter , or at any other time , without a very stout resistance . The programme of the Merchants ' Association for municipal reform , and the tone in which it is announced , give promise of an effective organization to carry out the wishes of all decent people , and to rescue the city from the dreadful fate that befell it when Tammany Hall regained control over it . Simultaneously with the appearance of this publication , and as though he knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an interview his plan for keeping Tammany Hall in power . So he begins by saying that the nomination of Coler can not be thought of . He must be ruled out anyhow . " What I want , " he continues , " and what I presume every citizen of New York wants , is a. man to be named who can unite all the forces opposed to Tammany Hall and win . But Coles , as I have said , is out of the question . " A queer way to unite all the forces opposed to Tammany Hall , by ruling out at the beginning the man who saved the city from the clutches of the Ramapo Company , and who arraigned the chief of Tammany Hall before the city and the nation as the man who works in politics for his own pocket all the time . No person , no organization has yet been committed to Mr. Coles as an indispensable candidate . No doubt there are others who could be elected , although none who could divide the Democratic party in twain to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the beginning is the way to set all Of big friends against any man selected by Platt , and to bring about the same result that followed when Tracy was nominated to defeat Seth Low , and put Croker and his gang in power once more . The reason why " Coler is out of the questibu , " says Platt , is that " he has sinned away his days of grace by going about the State preaching the doctrines of Bryan and Bryanism , and he has , therefore , lost all chance of Republican support . Had he remained quietly at home , instead of following these strange gods , I suppose by the advice of Gov . Hill , he would have been in favor with Republicans . But now it can not be . I would not vote for him . " " Conspuez Craker " is the onlyliwatchword needed at the present stage of our municipal campaign . In exactly what hand is to be placed the sword which is to pierce the dragon , it is premature to discuss . Our St. George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Republican County Committee , is quite right in saying that a precipitate choice of candidate , or even a hurried decision as to the form of union for crushing Crokerism , would be foolish , and might easily be fatal . First let us give indignation a chance to swell and strengthen Let us foster and direct popular and righteous wrath before we endeavor to say just who shall be the instrument of its expression . A single objective steadily pursued is the surest way to bring about union . When the honest citizens of New York get angry enough , and ashamed enough , and alarmed enough , they will find a way to draw Croker 's teeth . A good beginning would be to invoke the power of public opinion and social ostracism against every man with any pretensions to respectability who has , and does not openly repudiate , friendly relations with the brutal boss , The touch of his band ought to be held to carry contagion ; to be seen with him should be thought ignominy ; to accept favors from him ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A judge , a lawyer , a banker , a contractor , a head of a corporation , who would , openly or secretly , curry favor with Croker far political or business advantages , should be made to know that he is looked upon by his fellows with an abhorrence that could not be greater if he had poisoned the Croton water , or sown germs of the plague broadcast throughout the city . ' Washington dispatches say that Great Britain is to be asked by our Government to suppress the Filipino Junta at Hong Kong  --  in other words , to do in respect of Aguinaldo and his friends what she refused to do in respect of Mazzini , Ledru-Rollin , and other refugees from the Continent . No doubt they were revolutionary committees ; yet when in the early fifties the demand was made for their expulsion , England replied proudly that these men and all others had ' the right of asylum in British territory , and that so long - as they hviolated no British law , they should not be disturbed . To the charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as replied that for any overt act in violation of neutrality they could be indicted and tried , and that British courts were open for this purpose . To assume that a conspiracy existed without an overt act , and to punish it without trial , would be tyranny . Such was in substance the answer sent by the Government of Great Britain , half a century ago , to Louis Napoleon and King Bombs . It can hardly be doubted that the - same answer would be sent to us in response to a similar demand , if we should be contemptible enough to make it . What should we have said if Spain had asked us to suppress or expel the Cuban Junta from the United States in 1897 , when Mr. Estrada Palma was at the head of it , and was carrying on his campaign of education , through the press and otherwise , here in New York ? In the non-fanciful part of Gen. Mac-Arthur 's report , the outstanding features are the tacit acknowledgment that American civil rule in the Philippines is a failure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He officially confirms the assertion , so often made in press dispatches , that the natives who apparently accept American sovereignty and take office under American rule , " act secretly in behalf of the insurgents . " He does not say , what a responsible newspa per correspondent declares under his own name in the Independent , that the government of Manila is offensive to the inhabitants , not only because it is imposed from without , but also because it is reeking with corruption in nearly all its branches . On the strictly military side of the problem , Gen. MacArthur brushes away a vast number of campaign lies by saying tersely , " At present and for many years to come the necessity of a large American military and naval force is too apparent to admit of discussion . " Thus we see that the election has came and gone , yet the Philippine misery and shame are with us just as before . We were told that the reelection of McKinley would instantly result in the Filipinos crawling to his feet with halters round their necks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the paper which was loudest and most abundant in this preelection prophecy , the news of Republican victory has produced in the Philippines " no visible effect " upon the insurgents . We were to have the army reduced and the volunteers called home . Now all the Washington talk is only of just how much it , will be necessary to increase the army and navy in order to reduce the Philippines . A bill of more than $100,000,000 a year is to be presented indefinitely to American taxpayers for these " gems and glories of the tropic seas , ' , as Mr. McKinley called them two years ago . Just now they look , instead , uncommonly like a gold brick . Mr Hanna 's statement that " there are no Trusts " in the country , has provoked a deal of comment , first and last . In its preliminary report on Trusts and Industrial Combinations , the Industrial Commission appointed by Congress to investigate this question has described the various forms of Trust ' organization . The original " Trust " was a combination of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of trustees who " voted it , " the stockholders receiving certificates upon which they drew then ' dividends . The Standard Oil Trust , the Sugar Trust , and the Whiskey Trust were originally of this sort A pseudo-Trust organization is formed where , instead of trusteeing stock or buying independent plants outright , one corporation buys a majority of the ' stock in such companies , and so controls their . management . To-day , however , as the report of the Industrial Commission points out , the common form of organization for combinations known as " Trusts " is that of a simple corporation . The development of the Standard Oil Company is typical . The original Trust , under which certificates of stock were issued , dissolved itself back into the original companies , nominally- independent , but virtually associated and controlled through the highly concentrated holding of stock . The formation later on of the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey reorganized these independent companies into one big corporation . In such cases it is technically true that there is no longer any " Trust . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ re main to be solved under the corporate form of organization as under the old-fashioned " Trust . " Lord Salisbury 's reference in his Guildhall speech to the internal politics of the United States was one which he felt compelled to apologize for in the act . So the indiscretion stands confessed . He thought it excusable on the ground that he was about to retire from the Foreign Office . But he remains Premier , and as such should not make a public utterance in disparagement of a great political party in another country . It is one thing to offer personal congratulations to Mr. McKinley , as President Loubet of France did , but quite another to say hard things of a political organization with the leaders of which it may hereafter be important for the British Government to be on good terms . For the rest , Salisbury 's speech was that of a statesman less jubilant over his new lease of power than depressed by the crushing load of re-. spousibility laid upon his shoulders . He N't as pessimistic abbot China , pessimistic about South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reform , though he admitted that the defences of the country must be carefully looked to , and that domestic legislation must take a very subordinate place ; and , in general , " thought aloud " in his characteristic way , with the effect of producing gloom and despondency in his hearers . If the British Empire is really " a weary Titan , " Lord Salisbury is the very one to be its spokesman . Sir Wilfrid Laurier 's victory , like Lord Salisbury 's and President McKinley 's , was essentially a triumph for Opportunism . Feeling that party principles were made to win elections , not to embarrass parties in power , the Canadian Liberals have generally appropriated the Conservative policy of paternalism , includMg a protective tariff , subsidies to railroads and steamship lines , and the providing of terminal facilities at seaports ; while so far as loyalty to the Empire is concerned , the English papers feel that Sir ' Wilfrid is the peer of Sir Charles Tupper , whose professed stock-in-trade was patriotism . The Conservative opposition to Minister Tarte and the over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ representation in Quebec from 51 to 57 out of 65 seats This was to have been expected , and it is doubtful if the Conservatives gained any votes in English Canada from their exploitation of race feeling . It is more difficult to account for the Conservatives ' ignominious defeat in their old stronghold , the Maritime Provinces . One must suppose that the argument from prosperity worked with especial force in this comparatively poor part of the Dominion . Only the prosperous province of Ontario was deaf to the prosperity argument . There the Conservative campaign had been waged with much energy , not to say bitterness , on the issue of Liberal corruption , and in the election of 53 out of 92 members of Parliament , practically turning the tables on the Liberals , the defeated party should find a crumb of comfort . In the West and Northwest , too , the Conservatives and the Independents gained against the Liberals , though falling far short of the promised clean sweep . What is of especial interest in the election is the redistribution of territory between the parties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Liberal land ; to the west , Conservative . It should be said , finally , that the rout of the Conservatives is even more complete than is indicated by Sir Wilfrid 's majority of something more than 50 out of 21j3 seats ; for the Liberals played havocwiththe Conservative leaders in important constituencies . Sir Charles Tupper himself , and his lieutenant , ex-Minister Foster , fell in the East . Hardest blow of all , ' Hugh John Macdonald , the rising hope of the Canadian Tories , yielded to Minister Sifton in Manitoba . This leaves the Conservatives sorely crippled , and , unless some readjustment of seats be made , virtually leaderless in Parliament . It is a bad year for Opposition parties . " Consider , I pray you , and see how he seeketh a quarrels against me . " The Chinese Emperor might well make these words of the King of Israel his own , as he reads the extraordinary demands which the Powers are now making upon China . It certainly looks as if the policy agreed upon were intended to drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to press them to the pqint of exhaustion and practical destruction of their nationality . This huge indemnity of $600,000,000 ? why , it would tax the resources of a great industrial nation to pay it . For China it would mean simply the starvation of millions . This is no exaggeration . Increase taxation in China by any considerable percentage ( as would , of course , be necessary ) , and so narrow is the margin between food and lack of it , in the case of the masses of the swarming Chinese population , that graves would be filled faster than the Treasury . It is said , to be sure , that the Powers will and the money for China , taking land or customs duties for security ; but this is only a roundabout way of exercising oppression . Very fittingly with this demand goes the prohibition of Chinese armaments , and a veto on the importation of guns and ammunition . First drive a people to desperation ; then deny them the right or means of self-defence . There could not well be a more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the strongest desire to cherish and strengthen it . What is the United States doing in this Chinese galley ? Our Minister is consulting and voting with the other diplomats in Pekin . By so much we are in the concert . But it is evident , if the best Washington dispatches are trustworthy , that Mr. Conger is being outvoted , and the more moderate proposals of this country set aside for the eztreme measures adopted . Secretary Hay is reported to be very much annoyed at the severity of the demands presented at Pekin . He considers them to Smack too much of bloodthirstiness and greed Well , how long are we go ing to identify ourselves with a policy ithich we disapprove ? It seems to us high time for the United States to dissociate itself from the concert of the Powers in this matter , just as it did in the question of retaining an army . in China . Our independent and honorable lead f in the withdrawal of troops undoubtedly had an immense moral effect to the time , and practically forced the hand of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action , military operations on an enormous scale might at this moment be going on in China . Has not the hour struck for the Administration again to blaze a path in this Chinese business , by openly protesting against a policy of cruelty and extortion , and proceeding , if necessary , to settle our differences with China independently ? We think that the State Department has before it a golden opportunity to assert a moral leadership , and to win a victory for peace no less renowned than one of war . Already the European press is in a flutter over the mere rumor that the United States will refuse to have part or lot in the diplomatic spoliation of China . This is an indication of Isthe moral uncertainty which marks the attitude of the Powers . Sir Robert Hart , the British manager of the Chinese customs service , who was in Pekin during the dark days of June and July , has written an article for the Fortnightly Review on the cause of the attack upon the legations . The Boxers , he says , could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allied forces bombarded the Taku forts . This assault was construed by the Chinese Government as an act of war  --  naturally so . In accordance with the usual custom in such cases , the Government which was attacked sent notice to the ambassadors of the attacking forces to quit Pekin within twenty-four hours , but the latter would not do so . They supposed , of course , that the attack on the forts would not be made without an immediate advance to Pekin to relieve the legationi . They waited for it , but it did not come . Weeks passed . The Chinese regulars in Pekin could have demolished the legation buildings and killed the occupants any day they chose , had they not been restrained by some person or persons of influence . It appears , therefore , that the Chinese trouble was mainly , if not wholly , caused by an act of unauthorized and senseless violence , committed by the representatives of the civilized nations  --  an act which put : in peril all the Europeans in Pekin and sacrificed the lives of many throughout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still pending . And the civilized folks , forsooth , are now asking themselves how much indemnity they shall require the heathen Chinese to pay on account of the war they made upon them when they attacked the Taku forts !
