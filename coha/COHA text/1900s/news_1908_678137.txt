txt The Olympic games of this era are international In Greece they were Pan-Hellenic , having a religious significance , as they were given in honor of the gods and Pelops , while the tests of strength and endurance were designed to fit men for war . Physical strength and endurance are still serviceable in war , but they are not everything ; brains count for more . There is no thought of military distinction in the minds of the contestants from many countries In the modern games called Olympic . They are part of the new movement to promote the friendship of nations . This boasted friendship may often be founded merely on prudence , but it serves . The commercial spirit , Me , is not absent from these contests . Men engaged in enterprises which profit by widespread interest in athletics lend their energy and intellect to help make the exhibitions successful . This is a commercial age . The Olympic games which began in the Shepherd 's Bush Stadium , London , Monday , are worth noting apart from their significance to the sporting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of muscular competitions may not care to know that the vaulters may not rest their bamboo poles in a hole or have a soft spot dug up for them in case of falls . Hannows 's and Suss , PARD 'S speedy run of more than I 4,800 feet in a minute fraction over 114 minutes may seem to him just , a good bit of running . But the proportions of the show attract him . Picked athletes from every country to the number of 1,500 , running , lumping , ' wrestling , swimming , diving , throwing heavy weights , in the presence of many thousands of spectators , including I Kings and Queens , make a spectacle I that stirs the imagination . The Olympic games were revived in Athens in 1896 , and the games were repeated there two years ago . Probably the contestants were as skillful as the men of Attica and Sparta and the isles who kept themselves In trim for less peaceful contests by wholesome Living and continual practice . and at these great meetings gave homage to Zeus with their muscles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four years later , the other Olympic games were successfully held , without the Athenian scenic environment and the charm of classical associations . The great meeting in London is the fifth of the series , and the American contestants are , as usual , well in the lead . They won 75 1-6 points in the contests at Athens two years ago , against Great Britain 's 41 . It is a significant fact that this international display of strength , skill , and endurance should be held in London at the very moment when the perennial protest against admitting foreign contestants to the Henley regatta has been brought up with more than usual vigor and earnestness . The general interest and pecuniary gains of the regatta may be somewhat larger when it is international , but the Little Englanders of sport declare that it should be kept as a test of British oarsmanship . Perhaps their reasoning is not illogical , but international contests in all sports seem to catch the fancy of the multitude .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
