 | JOHN ELIOT , William Penn , Helen Hunt Jackson , Henry B Whipple , U. S. Grant . and Henry L. Dawes , ? these are the outstanding figures in American history nobly and permanently identified with increasing the Red Indian 's physical and spiritual well-being . What John Eliot , in the New England of the seventeenth century , was to his time , that Bishop Whipple was to his . What William Penn . in the seventeenth century , was to the Indians of the middle Atlantic States as a treaty maker and keeper and a Christian state-builder , that Henry L. Dawes was to the Indians of his time . Mrs. Jackson , with her book " Ramona , " did for the Indian what Harriet Beecher Stowe did for the negro with " Uncle Tom 's Cabin . " She had no predecessor and has had no successor . President Grant , though a man of war , saw the futility of the immemorial policy of strife with the Indians , and turned a leaf in our national policy toward them which none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The long public career of ex-Senator Dawes . who died at his home in Pittsfield , Mass. , February 5 , began in 1848 with his election to the Legislature of Massachusetts , and it ceased with his last illness , for at the time of death he was still chairman of the Commission to the Five Civilized Tribes in the Indian Territory . His was a career notable for its variety of service. ? journalist , lawyer , legislator , ? and for its indeENS DAWES . 301. pendence of thought and action , within party lines . As a young Whig he bolted Webster in favor of Scott in the national party convention in 1850 , he being the only Massachusetts man to do so . He refused to be swept into the " Knownothing " movement . While in the House of Representatives ( 1856 ? 74 ) he opposed the impeachment of Andrew Johnson , as chairman of the Committee of Appropriations he was the unbribable ' watchdog of the Treasury , " as chairman of the Ways and Means Committee in 1872 he brought about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defeated for the Speakership in 1869 by a questionable deal between Mr. Blaine and Benjamin Butler , the defeat did not embitter him , though doubtless it much altered the course of party and national history . After his election to the Senate , in 1875 , as Charles Sumner 's successor , the same personal traits which had made him influential and much respected in the House soon gained for him a high place in the counsels of the upper body . These personal traits were inherited and disciplined industry . " which gave him capacity for a prodigious amount of toil ; thorough mastery of the principles and details of parliamentary procedure and of such legislation as it became his duty to champion and carry through modesty ; lack of all envy ; inflexible will in matters of conscience , but tact and shrewdness in gaining victory and swiftness to seize an opening  | due to an opponent 's neglect of precaution ; and last ? loyalty to high ideals of personal conduct and national action . Consequently , his name is identified with much of the important fiscal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reconstruction period ; with the establishment of the Fish Commission , the Weather Bereau , and of the College for Deaf Mutes at Washington . Far more than some of his brilliant , eloquent contemporaries in the House and Senate from Massachusetts , he was a constructive statesman .  | He had considerable power as a stump speaker , unusual gifts as a debater in the rough-andtumble of debate , but he was a lawmaker rather than an orator . His discipline at Yale had given him a capacity for " team work " and a disposition to get things done which some of his Harvard associates , with their gifts of eloquence and their riper culture but d splendid isolation . " must have envied . There was a rugged simplicity and genuineness , an old-fashioned courtesy , and indifference to wealth about Mr. Dawes which made him an admirable model whether moving in the full glare of Washington light or in the quieter surroundings of Pittsfield . Massachusetts has a way of breeding lovers of humanity , and it is not at all surprising that just as Charles Sumner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negro , and just as later ( +eorge Frisbie Hoar has arisen to champion the Filipinos cause , so Mr. Dawes should make splendid the last clays of his career by unflagging devotion to the best interests of the Red Indian , whom the Caucasian had ousted from the vast territory over which he once roamed unchallenged . It is not a pleasant record to contemplate , ? the one that intervenes between the days of John Eliot and William Penn and the day in 18-1i when the nation took from its own treasury the first dollar which implied that the Indian was to be educated and civilized . It is mostly a record of robbery and neglect , of crowding the Indians upon reservations in the hope that they would die out , of treaty-breaking , and of costly wars . When once the idea took root that the Indian deserved to be treated like any other human being , that he should be educated , fitted for citizenship . elevated from the station of ward to citizen , that instead of being pauperized by grants of land , rations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his own feet , then a new day dawned for the Indian race , which had refused to die out and to-day is nearly as numerous in this country as it was when the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth and the Cavaliers at Jamestown . With all the legislation which records this altered attitude toward the Indian by national officials -- executive and legislative ? and philanthropists , Mr. Dawes ' name is connected more or less closely ? of late , very closely . From the time that he became chairman of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs down to the time of his death , he has been the most conspicuous figure in national life dealing with Indian affairs . When Mr. Dawes retired from the Senate , in 1893 , President Cleveland appointed him chairman of a commission to the five civilized tribes of Indians in the Indian Territory . With patience , tact , yet steady pressure , the commission has done its work during the intervening decade . Slowly but surely , the Choctaws , Chickasaws , Creeks , Cherokees , and Seminoles , after prolonged and delicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won to the new point of view as one conducive to their welfare as well as to that of the Government . Tribal courts have been given up , the common lands divided in severalty , citizenship in the United States has been sought . and subjection to federal laws such as govern white men has been proffered . In turn , the commission has protected the Indians from their greedy enemies , the white cattle men ; it has been conscientious in dividing the common wealth so as to do no injustice ; in unraveling the conflicts between tribal and federal law ; and in determining and defining the status of the Indian , qualities of the highest legal order have been necessary . The task of the friend of the Indian of today . viewed in the large , as expressed by Mr. Dawes , is this : " To fit the Indian for civilization and to absorb him into it . " Prior to 1877 , the Government 's expenditures for Indians were due to the activity of the army in putting down outbreaks . In 1877 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort was made , and , supplemented by gifts from private citizens . went to support the first of the government schools . Now , in addition to educating the Indian in the schools , he is to be educated through the exercise of all those capacities of his nature which self-support , ownership of land , the use of the ballot , etc. , imply . And the vast appropriation for the Indian service in 1902 , ? $9,747.471 , ? does not imply an increase of expenditure due to war or to pauperization , but the carrying out of those schemes for making the Indian a citizen and not a ward which Mr. Dawes has so much favored both as legislator and as commissioner . Hereafter , the home and not the tribe will be the unit with the Indian . and though protected under the law for a quarter of a century from alienating his freehold right , he sooner or later must stand on his own feet , and , like the negro , struggle side by side with the Caucasian for the right to live . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy has made who entered Yale College with a sound body , an excellent mind , high ideals , ? and only nineteen dollars of money . His place is secure among the constructive statesmen of his time . and among those public men who have used their talents and opportunities to lift to higher levels peoples less fortunate than their own race , and generally despised .
