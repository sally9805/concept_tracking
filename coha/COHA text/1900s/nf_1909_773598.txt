txt // the entire Romantic movement assumed in Wordsworth the character of a religion . Wordsworth could feel like others the common aesthetic pleasure at the beauties of the Cumberland hills , which had for some time before his boyhood become a fashionable resort for travellers " in search of the picturesque . " But this was the least important part of his sentiment for Nature . His descriptions of scenery rarely have those striking touches of minute observation which are the charm of Tennyson 's poetry , nor does he dwell lovingly on the names of familiar spots ? a device which Scott uses with beautiful effect . To Wordsworth Nature is a Divine being : to worship merely her superficial beauties obscures her spiritual aspect , and shows a want of true comprehension . This spiritual view of Nature contains the whole of Wordsworth 's philosophy . Man is a part of that : illembracing , living organism which we call Nature , : old it , should be his object to order his life in accordance with Nature 's working . The first rule of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas of man ( such as Home , Duty , love of Beauty ) are those nearest akin to Nature . Wordsworth 's poems are one long commentary on this moral aspect of Nature ? few poets have so completely subordinated their work to one all-pervading ethical idea . Nor can it be said that this impaired even the aesthetie value of his poetry , for the great charm of his poetry ? its simplicity ? is the direct result of his philosophy . Wordsworth 's first published works ? Evening Waite , Descriptive Sketches ( 1793 ) ? are chiefly interesting only as showing how his poetic taste had been formed on the inferior poets of the school of Erasmus Darwin . In these two poems we have just that stilted style , cumbered with elaborate figures of speech , which Wordsworth was ultimately destined to drive from the field . In one way , however , these poems show a promise of Wordsworth 's future excellence ? the descriptions of Nature are accurate and sympathetic . // Like other " advanced " Englishmen of the period , Wordsworth experienced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the Republic failed to redeem its brilliant promises was acute ; for a time he was sunk in despondence , and while in this condition he wrote Guilt and Sorrow and The Borderers  --  a Tragedy , both works turning on the unsatisfactory character of human justice " A tyranny That lives but in the torpid acquiescence Of our emasculated souls . " But this Byronic state of mind was not enduring . Wordsworth in the Prelude ( which was published after his death ) has himself described his recovery under tranquil domestic influences . In 1798 he produced ( in conjunction with Coleridge ) the first volume of Lyrical Ballads ? here . he appears for the first time at the height of his power . Tintern Abbey , which appeared in this volume , and which contains an epitome of Wordsworth 's philosophy , is also a beautiful example of his blank verse style ? quiet , without monotony . But Wordsworth , who meant his work to be a protest against the artificiality of the time , was apt , at this early period of his life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Such poems as The Idiot Boy , Goody /flare , and many others , seem to possess simplicity and absolutely no other quality besides . These poems are generally admitted to be failures . In 1800 appeared Wordsworth 's famous Preface , which enunciated his theory that the language of everyday speech is a fitting medium for a poet . This was in flat contradiction to the accepted theory set forth by Gray and Johnson , that the diction of English poetry , by avoiding the use of commonplace words on the one hand , and by assimilating , on the other , the beauties of expression and the figures of speech invented by successive poets , had become a special and separate language ? a language nobler than the most exalted // prose . It is to be observed that Wordsworth in attacking this theory was not really attacking the great masters of the golden age ? the poetic diction of Pope and Dryden rarely includes expressions that would be inadmissible in prose , and though it avoids commonplace expressions , the same is true of the more exalted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successors of Pope and Dryden , whose diction was a caricature of the doctrine of Johnson and Gray . As a matter of fact , if Wordsworth 's theory were strictly applied , the worst offenders of all would be such poets as Milton , Spenser , and the Elizabethan dramatists . These poets did undoubtedly create a poetic diction ? and a very noble poetic diction ? which is absolutely different from everyday English ; and Wordsworth failed to appreciate the value of this diction as the best medium of expression for certain types of genius , such as Gray or Swinburne . But , on the other hand , it is Wordsworth 's glory that he did discover the noble capabilities of everyday English when employed by a poet whose genius was for simplicity rather than for the ornate style . Undoubtedly this discovery led Wordsworth too far ? there is justice in Byron 's taunt : " Who both by teaching and example shows That prose is verse ? and verse is merely prose . " But the fact remains that much of the best of subsequent English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Wordsworth 's simplicity . Wordsworth 's short poems on Nature and on homely subjects contain perhaps his most valuable work ; they are lit by frequent gleams of an indefinable and somewhat capricious inspiration which will show itself in isolated lines or stanzas . Such passages as " For old unhappy far-off things And battles long ago . " " And beauty ? born of murmuring sound Shall pass into her face " p // are Wordsworth 's best contributions to poetry . They abound in his work prior to 1808 , but in later years the inspiration seems to have failed him . Wordsworth 's poems dealing with events which were moving the world stand somewhat apart from the rest of his work . In many of his Sounds to Liberty ( 1802 ? 1806 ) there is a majesty ? sometimes even a gorgeousness ? which is a contrast to his usual style , e.g. the sonnets ' /'o Toussaint l'Ouverture , On the Subfugstion of Switzerland , &c..; The Happy Warrior ( 1805 ) belongs to this class : the characters Wordsworth had in his mind in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sailor brother . Wordsworth 's simplicity of diction is here peculiarly effective in portraying the fundamental simplicity of a really great nature . Wordsworth 's patriotism was deep and abiding , but it had none of that fiery quality which appears in the German poets of the Napoleonic wars , such as Arndt and Korner . Possibly this was because Wordsworth , like so many of his contemporaries , had given his first love to liberty at the time of the Revolution . Anyhow , English poetry suffered a great loss from the fact that , at the most stirring period of her history , the ideals of patriotism and liberty did , for a time , appear irreconcilable to her greatest poets . W lien , however , England was threatened with actual invasion , Wordsworth 's patriotism assumed a less philosophical and more primitive form . The sonnet To the d/era of Kent is frankly warlike . Otherwise , Wordsworth 's feeling towards his country was a part of that conservatism which was found , after the first flush of revolutionary ardour had passed away , to be an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common with the other romantics , . had come to recognise that the restraints imposed by society on man were part of the universal order of things , and in his Ogle to Duty ( 1805 ) he accepts the yoke gladly . But that the more picturesque side of patriotism could also appeal to him is shown in his unmatched sonnet // composed near Calais ( " Fair star of evening , splendour of the West " ) . Wordsworth 's poems on Childhood ( among which should be included his Ode on the Intimations of Immortality ) form a considerable part of his work . The idea of childhood played an important part in his philosophy ; he conceived the child as enjoying , like the unsophisticated shepherd of the Cumbrian Hills , only to an even greater degree , a mystical insight into the working of the universe . But , with this serious conception of the dignity of children , he failed , as was to be expected , to catch their peculiar charm . From 1808 onwards there is a noticeable falling off in the quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? especially sonnets ? could be mentioned which were composed at a late date ( e.g. the Evening Ode and Sonnet on King 's College Chapel ) . But it is from 1808 that Wordsworth commenced the publication of most of his longer works . The White Doe of Rylstone ( 1815 ) is a narrative poem on a legendary subject in the manner of Scott , but this form of verse is better suited to Scott 's joyous love of action than to the quiet beauty of Wordsworth 's story . This poem was a peculiar favourite of Wordsworth 's own . The Force of Prager and Brougham Castle are other examples of his attempts at ballad style . In 1814 Wordsworth fell under classical influence , especially that of Virgil , the result of which is seen in Laodamia and Dion . In these poems Wordsworth has successfully caught the noble classical manner , and their chief interest lies in the fact that they are totally different from Wordsworth 's previous style . Lycoris ( 1817 ) also belongs to this division of his work . The Excursion ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work to be called The Recluse , which should comprise Wordsworth 's entire philosophy . The Excursion consists of nine books of blank verse , cast in the form of conversations between " The // Wanderer , " " The Solitary , " and " The Pastor " ? three philosophers of Wordsworth 's own type , in which are developed such themes as Nature 's all-sufficiency to secure the tranquillity of the human soul , the simple life of the Cumberland Hills , and the dangers involved in the industrial revolution . Valuable as an exposition of Wordsworth 's theories on philosophic and social subjects , and containing many beautiful passages , the poem , from a literary point of view , suffers from a fault characteristic of the Romantic poets ? a tendency to neglect the construction of the poem as a whole . As a consequence of this fault , many of the longer poems of this age were cast in an " unreadable " form . The Excursion is prefaced by a filly fragment of what was to have been the first part of Wordsworth 's life-work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moral purpose underlying all Wordsworth 's work . After long musings " on man , on nature , and on human life , " he will speak , as he natively remarks , " in numerous verse , " " Of Truth , of Grandeur , Beauty , Love , and Hope , And melancholy hear subdued by Faith . Of Joy in widest commonality spread ; Of the individual Mind that keeps her own Inviolate retirement , subject there To Conscience only , and the law supreme Of that Intelligence which governs all . " The later works of Wordsworth are of comparatively little interest . His various tours in Scotland and on the Continent were commemorated by numerous short poems , among which the best known is the Sonnet on Milan Cathedral , a worthy pendant to his sonnet On King 's College Chapel . The two sonnet series On the River Duddon ( 1820 ) and Ecclesiastical Sonnets ( 1821-42 ) , contain little of Wordsworth 's best work , save for the " King 's College " sonnet above referred to . // In 1819 the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Peter Bell , a work of earlier times , now chiefly remembered for the lines : " A primrose by a river 's brim A yellow primrose was to him , And it was nothing more . " From this time forth Wordsworth 's reputation began to rise , and a series of honours was bestowed on him , culminating in his appointment to the Laureateship in 1843 , when the period of his inspiration had long ceased . " Oftener the laurel on gray hairs is laid , Or on the combed tresses of the dead . " These lines of a poet of to-day apply with singular force to the great poets of the Romantic movement .

English Minor Poets : Taylor , Rogers , Bowles . Satire : The Rolled , Peter Pindar , The Anti-Jacobin , Injected Addresses . Light Verse : Moore , Praed , Barham , Hood . Samuel Taylor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two great founders of the new school of English poetry . He was also the first exponent in England of the transcendental philosophy which Kant had inaugurated in Germany , and which was really the philosophic aspect of the same movement that , in literature , produced Romanticism . Seldom has there been a combination of lyrical inspiration and sheer intellectual power such as Coleridge possessed . His life was a strong contrast to the well-ordered career of his friend Wordsworth . It is a story of ill-considered journalistic enterprises , of perpetual domestic and financial difficulties , of broken business engagements , and of a general untrustworthiness which tried the patience of his many devoted friends . During what should have been the best years of his life he was a slave to the opium habit . He was , like Burns and Byron , an example of ill-regulated genius , but , in his case , the failings were not those of a passionate nature , but of a dreamer . Nevertheless , his personal influence on the ideas of his associates was immense . His was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hazlitt , and // // other founders of modern literary criticism . The fascination of his Table Talk can not be easily understood nowadays : it is usually associated with Carlyle 's famous description of the old man rolling along the garden walk at his home in Highgate , and snuffling metaphysically of a Summ-ject and Ommject . " But contemporary opinion was unanimous as to the value which Coleridge 's disciples attached to his oracular utterances . Coleridge 's earlier works ( especially Religious Musings , 1797 ) are fair examples of well-written verse , dealing sincerely with rather exalted subjects . Their chief defect ? a certain rhetorical exuberance ? is one which , as Coleridge himself remarked at a later date , is often in the young a sign of future promise . It was not , however , till he published Lyrical Ballads , in conjunction with Wordsworth , that his peculiar poetic excellence appeared . No other English poet of the time ? not even Wordsworth ? has had so great an influence on modern poetry ; almost all the great poets of the later nineteenth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most kindred spirit Keats . And yet it is in virtue of a singularly small fraction of his poetic work that Coleridge takes his rank as a poet . His best poems ? nearly all written in the years 1797 ? 1800 ? not only bear witness to the peculiar inspiration of the author , but are models of flawless construction . His ode To France is a fine example of rhetorical verse at its best , as also is that terrible piece of poetic invective , Fire , Famine , and Slaughter , for Coleridge , although his habit of . mind was too detached for a keen politician , had , like Wordsworth and Southey , the revolutionary fever in his youth , and joined vigorously in the poetic hue-and-cry against Pitt . Still finer ? as being more purely poetry ? is his Ode to Dejection ( 1802 ) , which contains some of the best of Coleridge 's natural descriptions , distinguished by their imaginative richness from the more tranquil nature poetry of Wordsworth . Among his lyrics there are // Lewti , charged with an almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kubla Khan . Those who apply the methods of exact measurement to such poetic altitudes , say that this last marks the highest point to which . the inspiration of an English poet has reached , and certainly there are few lines whose beauty is so inexplicable as the conclusion : " Weave a circle round him thrice , And close your eyes with holy dread , For he on honey-dew hath fed , And drunk the milk of Paradise . " In The Ancient Mariner and Christabel , Coleridge employed his imaginative powers on mystical subjects , and it is for his treatment of these that he is best known . Here he employed an archaic style , such as had been used by the early writers of metrical romance , whose rhythms depended on accent and not on strict syllabic scansion . Previous attempts in archaic style had been mere imitations of Percy 's Reliques , but Coleridge with his consummate technical skill evolved a diction which closely reproduced that of the early poets , but which could he used for living poetry . Scott among his contemporaries , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have made use of the style thus originated by Coleridge . After 1802 Coleridge devoted himself mainly to philosophy and criticism . His work in these departments is fragmentary , much of it being scattered in journalistic articles and lecture-notes . But Coleridge 's work has unity , inasmuch as the principle of transcendental philosophy underlies all his thought . The basis of this philosophy is its conception of the universe as organic , not as mechanic in its construction . This principle comes out clearly when we contrast Coleridge 's theology ( in his Aids to Reflection , 1825 ) with that of which Paley was the typical exponent ; for // while Paley sought material " evidences " for Christianity in the outside world , Coleridge finds the necessity for spiritual religion in the nature of the human spirit , which itself contains an " aspect " of the Deity in its faculty of " reason " as distinguished from mere " understanding . " Coleridge 's influence on nineteenth century theology was great ; the " Oxford Movement " of the ' thirties sprang from germs contained in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ J. H. Stirling and F. D. Maurice , strenuously challenged the ascendency in English thought which had been acquired by the " Associationist " philosophers , Mill and Spencer . Coleridge 's desire to publish a complete system of philosophy was never attained , but he succeeded , as his friend Hazlitt said , in " throwing a great stone into the standing pool of contemporary thought . " As a literary critic , Coleridge brought the same philosophic spirit to bear on the work of many periods , his most important books being his Lectures on Shakespeare ( 1811-12 ) , and his Biographia Literaria ( 1817 ) . As a Shakespearean critic he attempted to treat Shakespeare 's work as an organised whole , and to trace the fundamental laws of its construction . The Biographia Literaria contains a profound analysis of the philosophy of poetry and an exposition of the poetic theories which underlay the Romantic movement . The analysis of the strength and weakness of the Wordsworthian theory of poetry is particularly able . In this book , too , the dominant idea is that of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ product of genius as distinguished from the mechanical product of the writer who falls short of genius . Like Wordsworth , Coleridge produced much work which is now more or less justly neglected . Among such work must be classed his dramas ? both those translated from Schiller and his original efforts ? although his Remorse achieved considerable success at Drury Lane in 1813. // Robert Southey ( 1774 ? 1843 ) is usually associated with Wordsworth and Coleridge as belonging to the " Lake School " ; as a matter of fact , he not only stands as a poet on a far lower plane than these two , but lie lacks the distinctive qualities which made them the founders of a new era ? in fact , he can not be considered a " Romantic " poet at all in the true sense . On the other hand , he is an important figure in the history of I iterative , largely owing to his sterling dualities as a man . A professionaI man of letters , he managed , although never a very popular writer , to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genius , but by cultivating talent of the highest degree , he won a respected and even prominent position among the intellectual giants who were his associates . Although his conversion from extreme Republicanism and " Pantisocracy " to the most conventional form of Toryism , and his acceptance of the Laureateship in 1813 , earned him the unremitting vituperation of Byron and the Radicals ? and certainly few courtly poems have so justly merited castigation as Southey 's Vision of . Judgment ( 1821 )  --  yet Southey 's life and reputation distinctly enhanced the credit of literature as a profession . His chief poems are a series of epics ( some written in blank verse , others in a curious irregular metre ) , whose scenes are laid in strange climes and in bygone periods ( Madoc , Thalaba , The Curse of Kehama , &c.).; They show great historical learning , but none of them catch the spirit of the time as , for instance , Scott had caught it in his Scottish poems and romances . An exception , perhaps , is Roderick ( 1814 ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested in Spain . In Kehama , too , there are scenes which catch the true Oriental atmosphere , but , as a rule , there is a modernity of sentiment which shows that Southey had not learnt the true lesson of the Romanticists . The day was past in which Mohammedan leaders and Hindoo princes could with propriety be represented as uttering // sentiments appertaining to Protestant ethics or to the French Revolution . On the other hand , these epics tell their story well and simply . They achieved no small popularity , partly because epics of adventure were then a new departure in English ? Southey had copied them from Italian models ? and partly , doubtless , owing to the attractiveness of their exotic colouring . Southey 's historical work , like his epics , shows unlimited industry and a scholarly care in sifting evidence . But he lacks that faculty for divining the spirit of an age which raises the true historian above the level of a compiler to that of a creative author . Southey 's histories of Brazil and of the Peninsular War are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfavorably in glow and vigour with Napier 's classic history of The War in the Peninsula awl in the South of France . As a biographer Southey is far more successful , for here his good feeling and sympathetic nature supplied the deficiencies of insight . His style , too , incapable of rising to an exalted pitch , but always clear and natural , is better suited to biography than to history . Of his biographies , those of Nelson and Cowper are the best known , the former having a high title to be regarded as one of the finest biographies in our English . Sir Walter Scott ( 1771-1532 ) . Mention has been made of that growing interest in the life of other ages and countries which led to the production of a number of romances in prose and verse at the end of the eighteenth and the beginning of the nineteenth centuries . Scott , who brought the prose romance to such a high pitch of development , was also the founder of the modern metrical romance . He was succeeded by a number of minor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great English poets also turned their attention to this form ( as , for instance , Wordsworth in the // White Doe of Rylstone , and Byron in his lays ) , but in these poets the narrative faculty was usually overborne by an excess of thought or feeling , and except for Coleridge , whose ballads are in a class by themselves , the romances of the English poets lack the raciness of the Scotch , who were born ballad-poets with no pretensions to the highest poetic gifts . It may be remarked that these same Scotch poets are also the best of our song-writers , whereas the far greater English lyric poets have produced comparatively few poems that really go well to music . Partly , no doubt , this is due to the musical qualities of the Scotch Lowland dialect , but it is also due to the same simplicity which enabled the Scotch poets to write better metrical romances  --  a simplicity that can achieve sentiment without the mawkishness of the average English drawingroom ballad . At the commencement of his literary career Scott was imbued with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few attempts on German themes he began to devote himself to the legendary lore of his own country . The stirring history of the Lowlands in the fifteenth to seventeenth centuries had inspired a body of ballad poetry breathing a simple , Saxon spirit very unlike the sad and mystic legends of the Gaelic Highlands . In the Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border ( 1802-1803 ) , Scott edited such of these ballads as he could collect . In Lockhart 's Life there is an attractive picture of Scott eagerly roaming over the countryside and gathering every fragment of oral tradition that he could elicit from the inhabitants . The book marks an epoch in the study of folk-poetry ; it shows a combination of careful scholarship , sympathy with the spirit of the old times , and unerring poetic instinct . The work should be compared with Percy 's Retires to show the advance which had been made in the power of comprehending a bygone age . // Scott had previously written some small pieces of his own ( Glenfinlas , The Gray Brother , S , c. ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their obvious straining after grisly effect ; but his first long poem ( The Lay of the Last Minstrel ) was published in 1805 . The metre of the old metrical romances which Coleridge had revived in Christabel , and which Scott also used , is far better suited to a long poem than the quatrains of the old ballad metre , and was the ideal form for Scott 's simple , stirring story of a border raid in the sixteenth century . The treatment of the characters ? life-like and quite un-selfconscious ? foreshadows the characterisation of the Waverly novels . Marmion ( 1808 ) and The Lord of the Isles ( 1815 ) deal with the more heroic stories of Flodden and Bannockburn , better suited perhaps to an epic than to a ballad . The episode of Marmion 's death is , however , the best thing in Scott 's poetry , and its dramatic force is worthy of Byron . The Lady of the Lake ( 1810 ) is a charming idyll of a Scottish king 's hunting adventure . This was at the time the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flawless model of " Romance " in the popular sense . Scott 's poems on other than Scotch subjects are less good : Rokeby is a romance of the seventeenth century , and the Bridal of Triermain , a romance of King Arthur 's Court . The Vision of Don Roderick is a rhetorical resume of Spanish history , culminating in the Peninsular War . Harold the Dauntless is a very successful example of Scott 's grisly mood . His songs , Bonny Dundee , Proud Maisie , and others , are among the best in the language . In 1814 Scott published Waverley , and thenceforward lie wrote little poetry . His achievement as a poet was to do for the poetry of action what Wordsworth had done for the poetry of contemplation : he freed it from the conventions of " the Grand Style , " and brought it back to reality . He has , it is true , many of the deficiencies of the popular writer . Thus he employs rather too freely certain easy // devices of cheap rhetoric , and much of his attraction lies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credit must be given for the gulf which separates poems like Tennyson 's Revenge and Kipling 's Ballad of least and West from such productions as Addison 's Campaign . Contemporary with Scott were a number of Scottish writers , chiefly of humble origin , who did intuit useful work in carrying on his task of collecting tiro ballads which survived in oral tradition . Many of these poets wrote original songs and ballads , some of which are still popular . One of this group deserves special mention . James Hogg ( 1770-1835 ) , " the Ettrick Shepherd , " is an interesting figure . He was entirely self-educated , and was steeped in the ballad-lore of the Lowlands . He attracted the attention of Scott , who introduced him to a literary career . He was constantly making small fortunes by literature and journalism , which he invariably lost in sheepfarming undertakings . The famous portrayal of him in Wilson 's Nodes Ambrosiano- is a highly idealised representation of his rugged , genial character . Asa poet he is best known by his Queen 's Wake ( I813 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together on the theme of a gathering of bards at Holyrood . Thomas Campbell ( 1777-1814 ) , also a Scotsman , came of a more educated class , and his models were not the poets of his own country , but the English poets of the eighteenth century . In 1799 he produced The Pleasures of Hope ? a poem in which the usual revolutionary aspirations of that period are set forth in strictly conventional heroic couplets . But he found his true vocation when he was brought into contact // with the armies who were fighting on the Continent during the Napoleonic wars . His battle-songs are among the best in the language ( Ye Mariners of England , Hohenlinden , The Battle of the Baltic , &c.).; Their verse rolls like the reverberation of a vessel 's broadside ; but he describes battles entirely from the spectacular standpoint : there is none of the " joy of battle " such as animates the verse of Scott or Macaulay . Of his other poems , his ballads Lochiel and Lord Ullin 's Daughter have a certain gloomy force , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the form which Scott had rendered popular . The English minor poets of this period are perhaps less interesting than the Scotch . The large provincial towns of Norwich and Bristol were the centres of literary circles of some importance . In Norwich lived William Taylor ( 1765-1836 ) , the teacher of George Borrow , who did much to popularise German literature in England , and thus contributed materially to the Romantic movement ; while in Bristol the poet-publisher Cottle presided over the fortunes of a small group of poets , and won enduring fame by his assistance of Coleridge and Southey . Of more note in his day was the wealthy banker , Samuel Rogers ( 1763-1855 ) , who kept open house in London for men of letters , and who himself published some rather lengthy didactic and descriptive poems which in the public estimation of the time ranked far above the work of Wordsworth and Coleridge . William Lisle Bowles ( 1762 ? 1850 ) is now chiefly remembered because Coleridge has gratefully recorded the influence which Bowles ' work had on his own . This influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to any transcendent merit in Bowles himself , although his Sonnets written in Picturesque Spots ( 1789 ) have the merits , rare enough at that date , of simplicity and of a knowledge of nature at first hand . // A class of poetry which still maintained a certain importance at the close of the eighteenth century was the political and social satire . The Ho/bad ( 1784 ? 1785 ) is a collection of poems mostly directed against Pitt 's Government by literary rowdies of the other party . John Wolcot ? better known as Peter Pindar 0738-1819 ) distinguished himself by a series of coarse but undeniably funny satires on the Royal Family . The Anti-Jacobin was started in 1797 , Gifford being the editor , and George Canning being the principal contributor . It was virulently Tory , and its attacks on the revolutionary writers , from Tom Paine to Southey , show a concentrated political hatred . Nor was it any milder in its literary animosities . Its parodies on the didactic poetry of the period ? the Loves of the Triangles is the most celebrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field . It is true that the Anti-Jacobin shows one great advance on the old satires ? its avoidance of direct personalities ; but for this self-denial it amply indemnified itself by unrestrained bitterness . The good-natured parodies in the equally famous Rejected Addresses are a complete contrast to the style of the AntiJacobin . This skit was issued in 1812 by James and Horace Smith . A competition had been announced for an address to be read on the occasion of the re-opening of Drury Lane Theatre after its destruction by fire , and Rejected Addresses purported to be the efforts sent in by various well-known writers of the time . The modern art of gentle parody may be said to date from this occasion . The first quarter of the century was prolific in writers of light verse . Among these the most prominent was Moore . Thomas Moore ( 1779 ? 1852 ) was in his youth closely identified with the Irish revolt , which inspired much of his Irish Melodies . But his patriotic verse is too sugary to carry // conviction . There is all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh blest are the lovers and friends that shall live The days of thy glory to see , " &c.; But the amatory poems in Irish Melodies are charming , and there is much fascination in his glittering Oriental medley Lalla Rookh ( 1817 ) . Still happier is his satiric work ( The Fudge Family in Paris ; The Twopenny Postbag ) , which gave full scope to his wit . His lives of Byron and Sheridan show both good taste and literary skill . Moore 's popularity proved evanescent ; his sentimental verse is too obvious : it just misses that " far away " note which makes so many similar Scotch ballads immortal , while his light verse lacks the crispness of the best modern work of the same kind ( e.g. Mr. Austin Dobson 's ) ; but his style was particularly suited to setting to music , and much of his verse survives in the form of our most popular songs . Winthrop Mackworth Praed ( 1802 ? 1839 ) is a higher type of light-verse writer than Moore . His poems are not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The rushing , inconsequent verses of Good-night to the Season and Our Ball catch to perfection the spirit of social gaiety . His experiments in humorous diablerie such as The Red Fisherman , are second only to the Ingoldsby Legends . Richard Harris Barham ( 1788 ? 1845 ) was the author of the last-mentioned work . The Legends are mostly old monkish tales , told with infinite humour , and a whole-hearted enjoyment of their picturesque horror . Barham 's fertility in amazing rhymes anticipated Browning . Thomas Hood ( 1799 ? 1845 ) must be classed as a humorous poet , though much pathos lies buried beneath his wit . His two best-known poems ( The Song of the Shirt and The Bridge of Sighs ) are serious , and written with a serious moral purpose . And in some of his longer poems ? as in The Plea of // the Midsummer Fairies , with its graceful forest-scenes ? he has shown a considerable degree of true poetic quality . But the bulk of his verse consists of extravagant fun . He was an exuberant punster , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astounding puns . In his lay of Miss Kilmansegg a vein of really powerful satire underlies the fantastic story . CHAPTER XXI EARLY NINETEENTH CENTURY POETS ( continued ) The Poets of Passion : Byron , Shelley , Keats . Minor Poets : Elliott , Beddoes , Darley , Landor . THE Romantic revival had produced poets of contemplation in Wordsworth and Coleridge : it had produced poets of action in Scott and Campbell . Lastly , in Byron , Shelley , and Keats it produced three poets of passion . With the death of Byron the great blossoming-time came to an end , and there followed a series of lean years till the rise of Tennyson and Browning . While Wordsworth and , to a less extent , Coleridge had written " on Man , on Nature , and on human life , " the poets of passion found their inspiration entirely in their own sensations : their verse is a record of their own personality , and the heroes of their poems are more or less idealised representations of themselves . This egoistic temperament made for intensity of feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but they never attained to the splendid detachment of Wordsworth . They never " saw life steadily and saw it whole " ; their lives were each a short and fiery protest against the stupidity and ugliness which they saw in their surroundings . They had the same ardour for freedom which characterised their predecessors , but they suffered no such disillusionment as had come to the latter through the untoward results of the French Revolution . The dominating features of their time were the monarchical reaction typified in the Holy Alliance 270 // abroad , and the regime of Liverpool and Castlereagh at home : the darker side of the revolutionary spirit could well be forgotten amid the prevalence of universal oppression . George Gordon Byron ( 1788-1824 ) . Lord Byron was above all a man in whom poetry meant the expression of his own personality . His splendid egoism was manifest from the first : at the age of nineteen he published a volume of fluent but wholly undistinguished verse ( hours of Idleness ) to which was prefixed a characteristic preface , dealing with ' his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own exalted rank . This effort drew down on Byron a very natural castigation in the Edinburgh Review , to which the poet replied with English Bards and Scotch Reviewers ( 1809 ) ? a ringing satire of the " Dunciad " type ? which brought him into immediate prominence . This poem is an almost indiscriminate onslaught on all contemporary authors of note , and more especially on Jeffrey , the editor of the Edinburgh . It contains scarcely a line of sound criticism , but it is packed with verbal cleverness , and has the true ring of the Augustan satire . It is an example of Byron 's delight in attacking popular idols , his impatience of anything in the nature of constituted authority in this case the self-constituted authority of the Scotch critics ? and his aristocratic contempt of literature as a profession . The unfortunate Southey , as a typical example of this profession ( to say nothing of the graver offence of his conversion to Toryism ) , is here and elsewhere the particular object of Byron 's invective . In 1812 appeared the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Childe " is of course Byron himself in his favourite pose of a sated voluptuary , and the poem records his reflections during a recent tour on the Continent . The story is told in too facile Spenserian stanzas , often faulty and full of irritating archaisms ; but there are inQ72 EARLY NINETEENTH CENTURY POETS dications of undeveloped genius . His rhetorical outbursts frequently ring false , but where they ring true ? as in the passages on Greece ? their grandeur is undeniable . The success of the poem was immediate . Byron stepped into the place of Scott as the reigning popular poet . For the next few years he was the spoilt favourite of London society , and during this period he led a life which combined all the more vulgar forms of profligacy with a far more dangerous emotional debauchery . The effect of such a life was as might be expected . Although his power of poetic expression was not impaired ? his best work was indeed done towards the close of his life ? the development of his character was completely arrested : he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ established order : he never acquired a touch of that idealism which glorified the revolutionary outbursts of Shelley : as Goethe said of him , " Directly he begins to reflect he is a child . " It was an age when high-strung natures needed an effort to preserve their spiritual balance ? witness Wordsworth 's description of the crisis in his own life and Byron 's character was too enervated to make such an effort . His work from the time of his success is the work of a beaten man . The Walk ( 1813 ) , a clever piece of social satire , was followed by a series of poetic romances in the style of Scott 's lays ( The Giaour , The Bride of Ahydos , The Corsair , Lam ) . The scene of them is laid chiefly in Turkey and the Levant , and there is a sameness about the stories . The hero is always Byron himself , posing as a sinister brigand ? a name " linked with one virtue and a thousand crimes , " and the minor characters are negligible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scott 's lays , but they have a dramatic intensity and an impassioned eloquence to which Scott never pretended . Such passages as the famous apostrophe to Greece in The Giaour " He that hath bent him o'er the dead , " // and his description of the Corsair " His heart was formed for softness ? warped to wrong , Betrayed too early , and beguiled too long , " would justify Byron 's contemporaries in their high estimate of him even if his later work had not been still better . At the same time Byron 's work shows obvious limitations . His poems are all in one strain , anal that not a particularly lofty one ; nor can it be denied that lie often showed his contempt for literature as a profession by writing slovenly English . If this had been due only to the fact that he wrote his poems in bursts of feverish inspiration it would have been pardonable , but it is also due to the fact admiringly chronicled by Scott , that he " managed his pen with the negligent ease of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completely lacked the high sense of craftsmanship which is essential to the production of the highest poetry . Lopsided metaphors and impossible constructions abound in his verse , e.y . " The tempest of his heart in scorn had gazed On that the feebler elements had raised " ( Lunt ) . Even that superb passage from Tin Giaour , mentioned above , is distinctly vague as to what ? from a grammatical point of view ? happened to the individual " who bath bent him o'er the dead . " At the height of his fame Byron became involved in a domestic cataclysm which , chiefly owing to his own lack of reticence , set all England ringing with abuse of him . Life in England became impossible , and he spent the remainder of his days in exile . This affair heightened his contempt , always considerable , for the " Puritanic " public opinion of England , and his work henceforth had a strong anti-patriotic bias , which showed itself chiefly in abuse of George III. , s // Southey , and the Duke of Wellington . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the cause of Greek freedom , in the active support of which he eventually met his death . Byron 's exile marks a great advance in the development of his poetic power . The latter cantos of Chilrle Harold are on a different plane to the earlier part of the poem . They tell the tale of the Childe 's journey across Europe to Rome . The theatrical pose is discarded , and the faults of diction which still occasionally occur do not mar the dignity of his verse . The poem is really a magnificent poetic essay on the story of European civilisation as told by the historic scenes which lay on Byron 's route . Few poems abound so richly in famous passages . The lines on Waterloo , on the homes of Voltaire and Gibbon , the description of Venice and of the Florentine art-treasures , lead up to the grandeur , even more highly sustained , of the Roman scenes , culminating , as the poet returns to the opening theme of his poem , in the matchless address to the sea : " Roll on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " There is no depth of thought , no subtlety of diction in Byron , such as Wordsworth and Shelley possessed , but there is an elemental grandeur and a mastery of large effects , and the Spenserian stanza was the ideal vehicle for his surging verse . Manfred ( 1817 ) ? a drama of the supernatural written under the influence of Goethe 's Faust ? was the first of a series of dramatic works which , with the exception of Cain , add little to Byron 's reputation . These belong to that most dangerous class of composition the essay cast in dramatic form . Their construction is faulty , and the blank verse is seldom far removed from prose . Cain ( 1821 ) is on a higher level . Like Paradise Lost , it is a story of rebellion against the Omnipotent ; but here the story is told by one who had him-v BI RON : " DON JUAN " self the soul of a rebel , and there is no attempt to " justify the ways of God to Man . " The diction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequent use of italics is particularly irritating to modern readers . Even the lines pilloried by Matthew Arnold , in spite of their unfortunate division , are a vigorous piece of rhetoric : " Souls who dare look the omnipotent tyrant in His everlasting face and tell Lim that His evil is not good . " There remains one of Byron 's works which is of supreme importance ? Don Juan , which he wrote during the last years of his life . Don Juan stands alone , save for Hudibras , among really important English poems written in the lighter vein . This ostensible chronicle of a good-looking boy 's successful love-affairs is really the supreme expression of a personality which , in its effect on Europe , ranks with Voltaire 's and Rousseau 's . The prevailing note is revolt against the spirit of English Toryism ? its corrupt government , its militarism , and above all , its social hypocrisy . But the subject-matter is infinitely varied , ranging from the passion of Spanish . Julia and the idyll of Haidee 's Ionian island to the horrors of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with countless digressions into cynical philosophy . The style is an inextricable blending of grave and gay ? Julia 's passionate letter of farewell is read to an accompaniment of sea-sickness ; and The Isles of Greece ? the finest of all Byron 's lyrics ? is put , with jesting depreciation , into the mouth of a hireling Levantine ballad-monger . This method , whether legitimate or not , was undoubtedly taking , and the publication of Don Juan created an uproar surpassing even that raised by the theological audacities of Cain . The metre of Don Juan is also the metre of Beppo , the story of a Venetian frolic , and of The Vision of Judgment  --  a skit on Southey 's unfortunate poem describing the reception // of George IlI , into heaven . This metre ? the ottava rima 1 of the Italian ? lends itself particularly to an anti-climax in the last couplet of the stanza , and is thus well suited to Byron 's mocking verse . Byron 's shorter poems , of which the Hebrew Melodies ( 1815 ) are the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His love-lyrics never approach the beauty of Shelley 's , and are rather akin to those of Moore . Few poets ' reputations have fluctuated so violently as Byron 's . For a time he was held to be incomparably the greatest of English poets , and then came a reaction , during which he was held to be scarcely a poet at all . One reason of his uncertain reputation is that he is only half a Romantic . On the one hand , owing to their similar mental attitude and the fact that they were contemporaries , Byron is almost necessarily ranked with Shelley and Keats . But , on the other hand , he is very far removed from them in point of style : here he approaches far more to the school of Pope . Being thus behind the times , and lacking the peculiar charm of the true Romantic poets , he has not exercised much influence on the language of poetry . But his influence on the spirit of the age , both in England and abroad , was supreme . That Byron and Goethe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accepted belief in Continental Europe . Percy Bysshe Shelley ( 1792-1822 ) . Shelley , like Byron , was a member of the class which both so bitterly detested ? the aristocratic land-owning class which ruled England till 1832 . To the traditions of this class Shelley was opposed , in every fibre of his nature . His expulsion Byron adopted this metre in imitation of a burlesque poem on King Arthur and his Round Table ( 1817 ) by " William and Robert Whistlecraft " ? the duplex pseudonym of John Hookham Frere , a prominent contributor to the Anti-Jacobin and a successful translator of several plays of Aristophanes. // from Oxford for publishing a pamphlet On the Necessity of Atheism , ( 1811 ) ; his impulsive marriage with a girl of lower rank than his own , and his desertion of her when he found a woman more satisfying to his intellectual tastes ; his revolutionary propagandism under the inspiration of that somewhat sordid idealist Godwin ; his roamings on the Continent , and his friendship with Byron ? those are the main events of his tempestuous life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leghorn on the 19th July 1822. lint in his life , as in his poetry , through all the unregulated passion there runs a strain of delicacy and a , sure instinct for the beautiful which made him the most lovable of the groat poets of the time . In many practical forms his enthusiasm for the right showed itself despite the mistakes in his conduct . his first considerable work , Queen Mab ( published in 1813 ) , was a rather crude production : the irregular unrhymed metre shows Southey 's influence . The poem typifies the protest of the spiritual element in life against the material ? a protest which Shelley never ceased to maintain . Of more importance is Alastor ( 1816 ) ? a blank-verse poem whose versification owes much to Wordsworth . I t is the story of a poet who lived a happy life in communion with Nature till he was troubled with the vision of an unattainable ideal which drove him to restless wanderings . The poem is a piece of self-portraiture , and shows how Shelley 's conception of L ? Nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alastor are not ? they , scarcely pretend to be ? true descriptions of Nature . His Asian crags and forests are as symbolical as his visions of eagles and snakes in combat , or of amorous swans intertwining their necks . Alastor , like Wordsworth 's Lucy , is a child of Nature , but contrast his guise thus described : " His scattered hair Sered by the autumn of strange suffering Sung dirges in the wind . His listless hand Hung like dead bone within its withered skin " ? // with the picture that rises at Wordsworth 's lines : " And Beauty born of murmuring sound Shall pass into her face . " The contrast between Shelley and Wordsworth is thus described by Hutton : " Shelley 's poetry is the poetry of desire : he is always thirsty , always yearning ; never pouring forth the strains of thankful satisfaction , but either the cravings of an expectant rapture or the agony of a severed nerve . . . . Wordsworth is always exulting in the fulness of nature ; Shelley always chasing its falling stars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the story of an ideal political revolution in the Ottoman Empire , blended with an allegory of the strife between good and evil , the good being typified by a pair of classical lovers , haon and Cythna . The result is a rather confused tale , and in spite of some splendid passages the poem is a falling off from Alastor . Shelley 's lyrical genius was unfitted for a long narrative poem , and his utter detachment from reality , which is often the secret of the beauty of his lyrics , disabled him from describing effectively the uprising of a people : the humanitarian methods of Shelley 's revolutionaries are too painfully in contrast to the procedure which recent experience had tended to associate with a nation fighting for liberty . It is this detachment from reality to which Matthew Arnold refers in his celebrated description of Shelley as an " Ineffectual angel beating in the void his luminous wings in vain . " But there are indications in Shelley 's later work that , had his life been prolonged , his grip on reality might have become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Helen , the story of the wife and helpmate of a revolutionary hero , contains some beautiful descriptions of Italian scenery . In his natural descriptions Shelley has a characteristic power // of transcending reality . Like an impressionist painter he seems to depict not the tangible objects themselves , but the atmosphere and light in which they are seen . Take his description of a flight of rooks in the Lines written among the Euganean //ills : " Gathering round with wings all hoar , Through the dewy mist they soar Like grey shades , till till eastern heaven Bursts , and then  --  as clouds of even Flecked with lire and azure , he In the unfathomable sky , So their plumes , " &c.; In 1820 appeared Prometheus Unbound ? a mighty drama which , like The Revolt of Islam , represents the triumph of an infinite love of humanity over the tyrant Zeus . The pantheistic creed which is conspicuous in many of Shelley 's poems ? notably in Adonais  --  is here illustrated by the alliance of the forces of Nature in the form of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choruses of those spirits are wonderful in their resemblance to the choric masterpieces of Greek tragedy . Prometheus is rather a dramatic poem than a drama : but Shelley wrote one really great drama in The Cenci ( 1819 ) . It is however in his lyrics that Shelley 's greatness chiefly lies . In these he somewhat resembles Coleridge , but whereas Coleridge 's inspiration is fitful , Shelley 's is constant . Like Coleridge , Shelley is a perfect master of technique ? the mere sound of his verse is always beautiful . He has , too , Coleridge 's transcendent imagination ? " The vision and the . faculty divine " ; but in the strong passion that underlies even his most delicate work he shows a nature more akin to Burns , Byron , and Keats . Shelley has two prevailing moods ? the pensive and the passionate ? and both are melancholy . In his pensive mood he wrote The Skylark , Lines written in Dejection near Naples , and the shorter and even more perfect .280 EARLY NINETEENTH CENTURY POETS poems , One word is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with many others not less beautiful . His wilder mood is summed up in his prayer to the West Wind : " Make me thy lyre , even as the forest is . " To this mood belong The Song of Pan , Arethnsa , and his glowing political verses , Hen of England and the Masque of Anarchy . Sometimes he writes in a more hopeful strain , as when in his noble epilogue to Hellas he gives utterance to a visionary faith in a bright future for the world ? a faith that never quite failed him . His elegy on Keats ( Adonais , 1821 ) is an impassioned expression of that love or beauty which was the bond between the two poets . But in Shelley , unlike Keats , who found an easy enjoyment in all things lovely , the love of beauty assumed the form of a divine discontent with the prevailing ugliness of life . In his Hymn to Intellectual Beauty , The Sensitive Plant , and in the opening lines of the Euganean Hilts , it can be seen bow strongly Shelley felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Darkness . To him beauty was not a source of sensuous or aesthetic pleasure merely : it was an ideal as sacred as his political ideal of liberty . A curious excrescence on Shelley 's work is his satirical poetry . Swellfoot the Tyrant ? a satire on George IV . ' s proceedings against his wife ? is rather cumbrous , but in Peter Bell the Third ? a parody of Wordsworth ? there are many distinctly happy touches . John Keats ( 1795 ? 1821 ) was the youngest of this group . In his boyhood he was exposed to the full force of the Romantic movement at its height : Spenser among the old poets and Leigh Hunt among his contemporaries were his first models . Keats , unlike Byron and Shelley , took little notice of the great political movements of his day . lie // truly said : " I value more the privilege of seeing great things in loneliness than the fame of a prophet . " His poems took their shape in a world of Greek myths and mediaeval legends ? a world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And yet he was not the nerveless creature , drugged with morbid sensualism , and done to death by harsh criticism , that Byron made him out to be . It is true that Keats ' aesthetic temperment frequently expresses itself in frank hedonism , as in the line in the Ode on Melancholy "  --  can burst joy 's grape against his palate line , " and there is something essentially unattractive about his heroes ' perpetual swoonings , especially when they swoon " drunken from Pleasure 's nipple . " But Keats ' life was manly , and his work , taken as a whole , is the work of a manly , vigorous nature . No poet shows a better record of a sustained effort at self-improvement and of an eager quest of beauty in its most sane and natural forms . Alone of the great poets of his time Keats did not have a classical education . This may ; recount both for a certain faultiness and lack of restraint in his earlier work and for his genuine love of Greek literature . He was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it must be confessed that the members of this " school " ? not excepting Lamb himself ? did show their common kinship by occasional touches of something not easy to describe but not wholly admirable , and the same " Cockneyism " which shows itself in Hunt 's lapses from good taste and in Hazlitt 's lack of self-control shows itself also in Keats ' early faults of style . His later work , however , shows to what good purpose he studied such models as Milton and Dryden models that could best correct his original failings . But although he set himself to acquire purity of style he never lost sight of his own peculiar theory of poetry , that it should " surprise // by a fine excess . " It is a sensuous luxuriance that remains the chief characteristic of his writing . Keats is a rare example of a poet who achieved supreme greatness without possessing an ethical ideal . It is useless to attempt by a straining of terms to include his poetry in Arnold 's definition of poetry as a " Criticism of Life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful gives his work the same distinction as that of the philosopher Wordsworth and the prophet Shelley . There is nothing in him of the " Wild poet when he works Without a conscience or an aim . " Keats ' first volume of poems appeared in 1817 . These poems revealed him as a nature-poet of the first rank . His observation is almost as minute as Tennyson 's , and a delicate , almost playful imagination , shows itself in such lines as " Here are sweet peas , on tiptoe for a flight . " Endyntion ( 1818 ) is perhaps his most important , though by no means his most perfect , poem . The metre is the common heroic couplet , but modelled on that of Chaucer , not that of Pope . There is no attempt to balance the lines , nor do the couplets normally end with the completion of a sentence . In this poem the old moon-myth becomes an allegory of the poet 's own nature ; the passion of Endymion and Cynthia , like Keats ' passion for beauty , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shelley 's Alastor is inevitable : it illustrates the difference of the two poets . Not the least significant difference between the poems is that ? in commonplace language ? Endymion ends happily and Alaster does not . The construction of Endymion is far from successful . It was the unfortunate tendency of young poets in those days to attempt very long poems very early in their career . This tendency no doubt showed the exceptional vitality of the creative spirit in that great age ; but it resulted in much // genius being comparatively wasted on the production of works that are not attractive to the reader of later days , and which at the time drew down upon the young authors a natural but discouraging castigation from the critics . Lainia and Hyperion have the same Hellenic setting as Endymion , but their style . shows the strengthening discipline of a course of Milton and Dryden . The story , too , is better told , and there are none of the involved episodes that mar the longer work . In the Eve of St. Agnes , Isabella , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mediaeval , and the tints are somewhat deeper and richer than in the sunny pagan poems . It is in his odes and sonnets that Keats is at his best . The four famous odes ? To a Nightingale , On a Grecian Urn , To Autumn , and On Melancholy ? are perfect examples of the treatment of a stanza with elaborately interlaced rhymes to illustrate a subtle play of ideas . There is no better instance of that " unearthliness " which is the soul of the true Romantic lyric than the stanza in the Nightingale " Thou west not born for death , immortal bird ! In its complete detachment from the world of reality , and the glimpse which it gives of the " Realms of ( gold " which are the poet 's home , it can only be compared with Kubla Khan . As a sonnet-writer Keats stands alone with Wordsworth in that age . But while Wordsworth 's sonnets are , like Milton 's , mostly written on subjects of external interest , Keats , like the youthful Shakespeare , made the sonnet the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine , and perhaps three are perfect ? the sonnet on Chapman 's Homer , When I have fears that I may cease to be , and Bright star / Would I were steadfast as thou art ! It has been suggested that Keats ' work shows a marked affinity to the early work of Shakespeare , and that , had he lived , he might have developed into something like a second Shakespeare . Whether this be a fantastic suggestion or no , it is certain that Keats ' i // early death is the greatest loss that the history of British poetry has to record . Three minor poets may be said to have carried on the tradition of Byron , Keats , and Shelley in the interregnum that preceded the rise of the great Victorian poets . Ebenezer Elliott ( 1781 ? 1849 ) was a native of Sheffield , and he drew his inspiration both from the fierce toil and poverty of his town and from the beauty of the mountains among which the town is set . His Corn Law Rhymes and his splendid battle-song " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spirit of an industrial mob in revolt . His poems on the " five rivers like the fingers of a hand , " which flow from the Yorkshire moors , deal with Nature in something of the same wild spirit . T. L. Beddoes ( 1803  --  1849 ) was an avowed disciple of Shelley , and possessed some gleams of Shelley 's inspiration . His dramatic works are important only for some fine lyrics which they contain . Hest known is his charming little poem , Dream Pedlary . George Darley ( 1795 ? 1846 ) was a humble follower of Keats , as Beddoes of Shelley . His Nepenthe is a gorgeous fantasy , and the glowing imagination is frequently worthy of Keats . But the style is extravagant , and is marred by grotesque verbal inventions ? winds that " puffie " and birds that " whiffle . " Darley was the author of a short poem , " It is not beauty I demand , " which so completely caught the manner of the Stuart amorists as to deceive even the editor of The Golden Treasury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an anonymous poet of that age . Walter Savage Landor ( 1775 ? 1864 ) is perhaps one of those authors who are more talked about than read . His " leonine " personality , his innumerable quarrels , and his fundamental good-heartedness , were a stock subject of conversation for three generations of literary men , but neither in // his own time nor since have his writings been really popular . The bulk of his prose-work is contained in the famous Imaginary Conversations ( 1824 ? 1829 ) ? the highest example of classic thought and style that English prose can show . He had a sure instinct for the sound of language , and his periods are uniformly harmonious and dignified . He had also a scholar 's complete mastery of his vocabulary , and his work is full of pregnant apothegms. lint the conversations seldom succeed in representing the interlocutors as life-like characters ; they are rather essays iu the form of dialogue , in which are set forth the ideas of Lindor and none other . Seldom is he in real sympathy with the historical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peter the Great and Alexis , Peter , as a type of crude tyranny , is made to advance the most ridiculous arguments in order that Alexis may rebut them , and the " conversation " becomes nothing more than a rhetorical denunciation of tyranny . As a poet , Landor suffers by juxtaposition with the great poets of that age . He had not that touch of the prophet which distinguished the latter  --  - Le ( lid not bring a new ideal into the world . On the other hand , lie is far from being a merely literary poet like Southey , for with profound scholarship he united an emotional temperament that could show itself in lyrical inspiration of a high order ? especially in his shorter poems , which recall the serious verse of Catullus or the Greek epigrammatists ? for Landor was steeped in the Classics , and his style is the most classical of all the Romantic writers . His longer poems ( Gebir , 1798 ; Chrysaor , 1802 , and many other poetic tales and idylls ) scarcely rank nowadays as living literature . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sums up his long life will never be forgotten : " I strove with none ? for none was worth my strife , Nature I loved , and after Nature , Art ; I warmed both hands before the fire of Life ?

NINETEENTH CENTURIES The " Tale of Mystery " : Beckford , Mrs. Radcliffe , Matthew Lewis , Maturin , Mary Shelley , Godwin . Didactic Novelists : Maria Edgeworth , Jane Austen . The Historical Novel : Scott . Susan Ferrier , Galt , Peacock , Ainsworth , Disraeli , Lytton , Marryat , Lever , Borrow . No department of literature was more completely transformed by the Romantic movement than that of prose fiction . But the change was slow . The traditions of the eighteenth century clung long to the nineteenth century circulating libraries , and although popular novelists early perceived the picturesque possibilities of the new " Romanticism , " as represented by Teutonic tales of mystery and horror , it was long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the Romantic movement embodied . The generation which witnessed the rise of that movement produced few good novels . Between the death of Smollett ( 1771 ) and the publication of Waverley , only one great novelist ( Jane Austen ) arose . The other novelists of that period fall into two groups ? the Sensational and the Didactic . Mention has been made of Walpole 's Castle of Otranto , which first set the fashion for sensational novels . The best of its immediate successors was Vathzeh ; i ( 1782 ) , by William Beckford ? a man who had read and travelled widely . This 1 // semi-philosophic story , in an Oriental setting , is one of the best of its kind . A far more prolific exponent of the sensational novel was Mrs. Radcliffe ( 1764  --  1823 ) , whose two chief works , A Sicilian Romance ( 1790 ) the celebrated Mysteries of Udolpho ( 1794 ) , were highly successful appeals to the average reader 's love of supernatural terror which had long starved in the rationalistic atmosphere of the eighteenth century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Radcliffe spoiled most of her ghosts by appending to them a rationalistic explanation . Matthew Gregory Lewis ( 1775 ? 1818 ) far outdistanced Mrs. Radcliffe in sensational horror . He was the first to exploit that inexhaustible wealth of diabolic legends which Germany afforded . Regarding the Tales of Wonder ( 1801 ) ? a miscellany which he edited , and to which Scott among others contributed ? he writes frankly : " A ghost or a witch is a sine qua non ingredient in all the dishes of which I mean to compose my hobgoblin repast . " His greatest work , Ambrosio , or the Mont , : , gained for him the nickname of " Monk " Lewis . It is a ghoulish performance . Charles Robert Maturin ( 1782 - 1824 ) . in Maturin the " Romance of terror " is slightly elevated by a touch of mysticism . His horrors are less purely mechanical than those of Lewis , and his best work ( Melmoth the Wanderer , 1820 ) has passages that will compare with the work of the great modern representative of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the above works is Frankenstein ( 1817 ) , by Mary Shelley , the wife of the poet . The story of the philosopher who , to his own undoing , solved the problem of creating life has passed into a proverb . Here we have a transition from the purely sensational novel to the novel with a philosophic purpose . ' William Godwin ( 1756 ? 1836 ) went further in the same direction . His importance as a political philosopher // overshadowed his fame as a novelist . His pamphlet , Inquiry Concerning Political Justice , had a great influence on the " advanced " young men of the period , and his not altogether creditable relations with Shelley are a matter of history . His best-known novel , Caleb Williams ( 1794 ) , is an exposi tion , in the form of lurid narrative , of the principles of " political justice . " In St. Leon ( 1799 ) the disadvantages of unlimited wealth are set forth in a story of the Inquisition and the Rosicrucian Brotherhood ? two never-failing resources of the Romantic novelists . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ novels written about that time which are still read and enjoyed . ( Miss Jane Porter 's Thaddeus of Warsaw , 1803 , and perhaps Robert Bage 's Man as he is , 1792 , might be 1r added . ) Less popular , perhaps , and in strong contrast to the foregoing , were a group of women who wrote novels with a more or less educational purpose . Some of these works have considerable literary interest in addition to ( perhaps in spite of ) their moral aims . Mrs. Inchbald 's Simple Story ( 1791 ) , and Coelebs in Search of a Wife ( 1809 ) ts by the poetess Hannah More , are good novels , if not particularly exciting . Maria Edgeworth ( 1767 ? 1849 ) is on a higher level . Her Irish tales ( Castle Rachrent , The Absentee , Ormond ) are early and excellent examples of the " local " novel , written Iil with abundant humour and an inner knowledge of the Irish peasant nature . Her novels of high life are full of vigorous satire ? indeed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Jane Austen 's far more consummate art was exercised on a social grade distinctly below the " fashionable " world . Miss Edgeworth 's stories for children are excellent , and still hold their own in the estimation of that fastidious section of the public . Jane Austen ( 1775 ? 1817 ) . Miss Austen is a singularly // isolated figure in literature . In form her books resemble those of the women-novelists who preceded her , but in spirit she has little iii common with those purposeful writers . Unlike them she had an unerring artistic sense which would not suffer the intrusion of a too obvious moral , and a faculty almost unique for describing the tiny dramas of everyday life . Although she ignores the elements of adventure and passion , which writers like Mrs. Inchbald had thought necessary to retain the reader 's attention , she easily surpasses these writers in the sustained interest which her work possesses for succeeding generations . Other writers have equalled her insight into character and her delicate workmanship , but none have equalled her power to make a commonplace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keenly interested in the working of a world in which she played little part , and endowed with-formidable powers of observation and a chastened sense of humour . Her six novels all describe the society of well-to-do country families , equally at home in the affairs of the parish and of the " county . " Her earliest-written , and perhaps her best , book is Pride and Prejudice ( published 1813 ) ? the story of a clever , well-conditioned girl with " impossible " relations , who is wooed by a man of good birth and high principles , but quite destitute of tact . Very remorseless are her pictures of Mrs. Bennett , an empty-headed woman , perfectly incompetent to deal with her large family of daughters ; and of Mr. Collins , a young cleric of weak intellect , overpowered with a sense of his own social importance . A more serious figure is Lady Catherine de Bourgh . Jane Austen usually confined her satire to those qualities which lie on the borderland between manners and morals , but in depicting the vulgar tyranny which a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was attacking one of the most serious social evils of her time . Sense and Sensibility ( 1811 ) is largely a satire on T // that morbid cult of the feelings which was one of the worst aspects of the new Romanticism . It is also a protest against the doctrine , too widely held at that time , that a young girl should adopt an attitude of self-abasement towards the male sex . Miss Austen felt keenly the humiliation which her sex suffered through the nerveless love-sickness of a Marian Dashwood , as mach as through the frank appetite of a Miss Steele for " smart beaux . " Her breezy treatment of such characters doubtless worked for " emancipation " at a time when emancipation was much needed . Northanger Abbey ( 1816 ) is a protest against the sensational novel of the period . Emma ( 1816 ) skilfully depicts that mysterious thing , the social stratification of an English country town . The characterisation is even more delicate than in Pride and Prejudice ? Mrs. Eltham is a more finished piece of vulgarity than Mrs. Bennett @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country clergy of the time than Mr. Collins . Similarly , in Mansfield Park ( 1814 ) , Lady Bertram 's selfish indolence is more subtly repellent than the open brutality of Lady Catherine de Bourgh . With Persuasion ( 1816 ) Miss Austen 's work was completed . That the Prince Regent was a great admirer of her works is a tribute to the Prince 's undoubted literary taste , seeing that they present a standard of social refinement of which he can have had little conception . Her satiric portraits stand out against a background of sane and cultured English life . It is the continuance of such quiet life in the villages and country-houses that we must bear in mind , if we are to understand how the English nation preserved its stamina through those reckless times . Sir Walter Scott ( 1771-1832 ) . Of all the great writers who were revolutionising English literature at the beginning of the nineteenth century , only two , Scott and Byron , achieved any considerable reputation on the Continent . // The reason of this is , no doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the British authors of the time , but it has been pointed out that they were also pre-eminently representative of the English aristocratic spirit . The success of the English ruling class in conquering Napoleon abroad , while keeping down a dangerous seditious movement at home , had greatly impressed the European imagination , and Europe recognised in Byron the revolutionary its well as in the Tory Scott the salient characteristics of that classforce of character and innate genius on the one hand , ad , on the other , a lack of intellectuality and an indifference to abstract ideas . Inasmuch as Scott suffered from these last two defects , he was the inferior of the early Romantic leaders Wordsworth and Coleridge . But in his genius for endowing his creations with life , he excelled all his contemporaries , and indeed may be ranked with Shakespeare . Scott found the Romantic novel a mechanical thing , depending for its interest on sensationalism and stage properties ; he transformed it into one of the most effective lornis of creative literatin e , in which the actions of men and women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a drama . When Scott , in 1814 , was at the height of his faille as a poet , lie chanced to discover a fragment of his early work  - -  a relinquished attempt at a prose romance . This he completed and published anonymously , under the title of Waverley . The world at once realised that a new order of fiction had arisen , as widely different from the popular " tales of terror " as from the old novels of Fielding and Smollett . Scott followed up his success with a stream of other " Scotch " novels ( by which generic title they were known ) , dealing with various episodes of Scotch history in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries . The quality of these is surprisingly level ; perhaps the best are Rob Roy ( 1818 ) ? the outlawed chief is the most purely romantic character in the series ? 292 EARLY NINETEENTH CENTURY NOVEL , The Heart of Midlothian ( 1818 ) , and The Antiquary ( 181G ) , which last two are his most realistic works . Jeanie Deans in The Heart of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delineating a girl 's character . In these Scotch novels Scott had the advantage of being on familiar ground as regards subject-matter ; he had an intimate knowledge of Scotch history and antiquities , and a thorough insight into the Scotch character . But he showed his weaker side when , with Ivanhoe in 1820 , he commenced a series of novels dealing with England in the Middle Ages ? a series which he extended with Quentin Durward ( 1823 ) to comprise tales of medhoval Europe . Here the characters are as life-like as ever , but there is not the same grasp of the period dealt with . To take a single instance , it would be possible to read the whole of Scott 's mediaeval novels without gathering the fact that medieval society ? especially on the Continent ? centred round the papacy as completely as society of to-day centres round the various nationalities . To Scott the Catholic Church was only one of the many picturesque institutions which make the Middle Ages useful for the novelist ? he ranks it with the Robin Hood legends and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which made him one of the most important influences in his own and the next generation . His popularity alone lived through the reaction against Romanticism which prevailed from 1830 to 1850 . When Byron was hopelessly discredited and Wordsworth hopelessly misunderstood , when Keats and Shelley were only read by a small band of followers , two men of the band of Romantic writers continued to hold their own ? Coleridge as the English founder of the powerful Transcendental School of Philosophy , and Scott as the most popular of British novelists . When the Romantic revival came , both these men were naturally exalted by the leaders of the new movement , and Ruskin 's praise of Scott is a singular proof of the // latter 's influence on a mind in many ways the opposite of his own . Much of Scott 's charm is duo to the blending in his nature of Romanticism and Realism . Thus , on his Romantic side , he is a Tory , with a Tory 's strong historic sense and consciousness of the continuity between the past and the present , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a love of that inequality between mean and man which makes life picturesque , and with a strong preference for practical , external conflicts and adventures over things of a spiritual , introspective interest . Scott , again , has a , romantic tendency to idealise the period of which he is writing : to him , for instance , the Middle Ages are simply a time of feasts and tourneys , and his portraits of such characters as Richard I. and Mary Queen of Scots are heroic rather than historic . But his Realism , even in his most romantic passages , is never far from the surface . His humorous characters ? and especially his characters drawn from humble life ? are usually realistic in the extreme ; they are as vivid as those of Dickens , but unlike the latter , they are rarely caricatures . And Scott 's characters have this great advantage over Dickens ' , that while the latter often suffer from Dickens ' imperfect skill in story-telling , Scott was even better as a story-teller than as a painter of character . Not that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Romola or Esmond ; but he had that supreme quality of a narrator ? a sense of what has been called " the rhythm of events . " His method of composition when he had all England for his audience was the same as when he was a schoolboy telling stories in the dormitory : he simply " made it up as he went along . " This method gave his work a freshness and vitality which were impaired on the few occasions when he attempted unity of design . The rush of action in his stories , the constantly shifting groups of characters in // their endless variety , give such a vivid impression that even his less successful characters ? his rather conventional heroes and heroines ? seem to live with the rest . The knightly abstractions of Ivanhoe and the indeterminate young ladies in The Antiquary , if they do not " stand out from the canvas " quite as vividly as the Laird of Dumbiedykes and Bailie Jarvie , at any rate do not jar the reader with any sense of impossibility . Scott 's defects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place , he was a pioneer in the realm of historical romances as distinguished from the mere sensational stories , and his genius did not always save him from that diffuseness which he inherited from earlier novelists . His lengthy descriptions and his sentimental scenes ( the latter perhaps a concession to public taste ) are rightly resented by young readers of to-day accustomed to the more fully developed art of Kingsley and Stevenson . From the same predecessors with their love of " the Grand Style " Scott inherited a love of rhetoric , but his rhetoric is usually so effective that this can hardly be called a fault , in spite of the occasional incongruities to which it leads . His other great weakness is his Philistine abhorrence of all matters bordering on the intellectual or spiritual . Of course as a novelist of adventure he was bound to describe life chiefly from the outside , but his indifference to the deeper significance of historic events impairs the effect of his historical narratives even from the most superficial point of view . For instance , had he shown more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary Queen of Scots , or of the ideals of the Covenanters , The Abbot and Old Mortality would have been not merely better history , but better novels . In fact , Scott , like Byron , lacked reflective power . When , however , we say of Scott that his insight into the thoughts of men was not equal to his genius for describing their actions , we are only saying that Scott is not the equal of Shakespeare . // The " Scotch novel , " as might be expected , found other exponents besides the genius who had popularised it . Of these , two are worthy of special mention . They may be classed with Scott as portrayers of Scotch life ; , with his romantic side they have little in common . Susan Ferrier ( 1782 ? 1854 ) , whose novels won the warm approbation of Scott , succeeded in charmingly depicting the gentry , great and small , of her native country ( Marriage , 1818 ; The Inheritance , 1824 ; Destiny , 1831 ) . As a portrayer of national peculiarities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ireland , but her scope was more limited . John Galt ( 1779 ? 1839 ) dealt with a lower stratum of Scotch society than Miss Ferrier . His Annals of the Parish ( 1821 ) , The Provost ( 1822 ) , and many other novels all in the same vein , are an anticipation of the " Kailyard " school of modern days . In England there was no attempt to rival Scott . The most prominent novelist after Jane Austen ( whose later contemporary he was ) was a man of very different genius , whose pleasant cynicism and ciiew ? fu1 indifference to plot and story are as complete a contrast to Scott as is the Liberalism of his outlook . Thomas Love Peacock ( 1785 ? 1866 ) . Peacock is a difficult writer to class . He adopted for his novels a form practically unknown in English literature ? a form based on the philosophic " Contes " of certain eighteenth century French writers . The framework of his stories is usually much the same . A company of " intellectuals " assemble at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These characters are types or " humours " in the Jonsonian sense , whose prevailing characteristics are indicated by names of often far-fetched significance . An Edinburgh Reviewer , a Lake poet , and an advanced social reformer are usually included in the dramatis persona ; . A // perfunctory dash of adventure and love intrigue is introduced , from which the representatives of ideas antipathetic to Peacock usually emerge with broken heads , while the more enlightened philosophers are rewarded with the hands of the heroines . In Headlong Hall ( 1816 ) and Malincourt ( 1817 ) the story is overweighted by the dialogue , which however contains much excellent philosophic fooling . The account of the election at Onevote is a particularly good piece of satirical farce . Nightmare Abbey ( 1818 ) and Crotchet Castle ( 1831 ) are far better written . In the former the mystical Scythrop Glowry ( a friendly caricature of Shelley ) is the hero of some fine comic scenes , and in the latter Dr. Folliott , the genial and scholarly clerical gourmet ( supposed to have suggested 1 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by far the most life-like of Peacock 's characters Maid Marian ( 1822 ) and The Misfortunes of , Elphin ( 1829 ) are historical romances in form , but are written in a spirit of keen satire on modern institutions . The arguments against reform put into the mouth of Seithenyn the drunkard would not have disgraced one of Sydney Smith 's " Noodles . " Gryll Grange , written in his old age , and two long and not very important poems complete his work . Mention should be made of the delightful little snatches of song which are scattered through his work . They have a lightness and lilt that not many English poets have surpassed . Like Landor , Peacock was steeped in classical learning , and endeavoured to hold up an ideal of classical sanity and moderation as opposed to what he considered to be the ill-regulated vapourings of the new Romanticists . His abhorrence of the f ? Lake " poets became mitigated in his later days , but he always ignored the genius of his friend Shelley , and ? though here his judgment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Byron as s merely crapulous . In fact , there are many indications in Peacock of the coming reaction against Romantics // The immediate successors of Scott and Jane Austen showed little of their high quality . The historical romances of the former found abler imitators in France than in his native land ? no British writer except Stevenson has so successfully adopted Scott 's vein as the author of Les Trois Mousquetaires ? and when eventually Lytton , George Eliot , and Kingsley revived the glories of the historical novel in England , they evolved a far more serious , philosophic type than the light-hearted masterpieces of Scott . William Harrison Ainsworth ( 7.805-1882 ) brought considerable historical learning to bear on his stories of English life in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries , but these stories are mere pageantry compared with the living realities of the Waverley Novels . More successful were those authors who followed in the steps of Miss Austen , especially Mary Mitford ( 1787-1855 ) , whose sketches of English village life in their sympathetic fidelity put her on a level with Susan Ferrier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hovel of high life rose into prominence . These novels were something more than the travesties of smart society , which have at all times been produced for the edification of readers less exalted . For their authors were not only men thoroughly at home in the world of which they wrote , but they were among the best novelists of their time , and their works throw valuable light on the social and political life of their day . Benjamin Disraeli ( Lord Beaconsfield ) , 1804-1881 . Benjamin was the son of Isaac Disraeli , whose gossiping miscellanies ( Curiosities of Literature , 1791 , &e.); were popular enough in their day . The son achieved his first and most scandalous success with a political novel , Vivian Grey ( 1826 ) , in which the best-known persons of the clay appeared in quite insufficient disguise . The style of the book is almost as bad // as the taste of the young author , but its cleverness was undeniable . Other novels , fashionable and satiric , followed . Alroy , an impassioned story of a Jewish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favourable light the strong Oriental strain in the Jewish author 's nature ? a strain which amid Western surroundings was often incongruous enough to give the effect of vulgarity . Coningsby ( 1844 ) is perhaps his best work . For sheer brilliance it is unsurpassed . Not the least part of its enduring interest is that here we have the rise of the celebrated " Young Tory " party told by the statesman who was its commanding genius . The sordid side of politics is well described in the characters of Tadpole and Taper , whose names have become proverbial for the most despicable type of party hack . In Sybil ( 1845 ) Disraeli attacks the evils then rampant in the industrial towns with a fervour that accords ill with the charge of cynicism commonly levelled against him . In Tancred ( 1847 ) and Lothair. ( 1.870 ) ? the latter the story of a fight between the English and Roman Churches for a rather amorous young duke ? the interest is more spiritual , though Lothair contains some of his wittiest society scenes . ( 1880 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's declining years , though there is still mEedynzionuch of the old brilliance . Disraeli stands high , if not supreme , among the imaginative writers who have also been great statesmen . His work loses in artistic value owing to the devouring ambition which was the dominant factor of his life , and from a certain materialism . Iie presents his characters merely as they would appear to their superficial acquaintances , and he is more concerned to produce a glittering picture of social groups than a sympathetic study of an individual . Brilliant phrases abound in his books as they abounded in his speeches , but his stile is marred by the frequent use of the tawdriest epithets . " Pellucid brows , " " stately domains , " // " dazzling ( and even " modish " ) scenes , " occur with disastrous frequency . Perhaps his own fine boast to a young fellowIsraelite best shows that desire to excel at all costs , which was at once the strength and weakness of his work : " You and I belong to a race which can do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Like Disraeli , Lord Lytton combined authorship with a political career . Like him , too , he first appeared before the public as a society novelist ( Pelham , 1828 ) . But his work does not reveal the strong personality which makes Disraeli 's novels interesting and valuable . He followed Pe/haw with a series of novels of a kind popular in the ' thirties , in which the hero is a successful criminal . Here we have a sign that Romanticism was in its decadence . It is significant that the two giants of the coming generation of fiction both early in their career raised their voice in protest against the criminal hero ? Dickens in Oliver Twist and Thackeray in Catherine . Better work than his criminal novels are Lytton 's historical romances ( Rienzi , The Last Days of Pompeii , Tice Last of the Barons , &c.).; They contain much good descriptive writing , and show much historical knowledge , but they lack the great qualities both of the previous Romantic and of the coming Realist school ? they have neither the simple vigour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Thackeray . Zanoni and A Strange Story are echoes of the old " tale of terror . " The secret of immortality enters largely into the former of the two , nor is the Rosicrucian Brotherhood forgotten . All these were written in the rather exhausted Romantic vein ; when Lytton turned to modern life for his theme ( as in The Caxtons , My Novel , Kenelm Chillingly ) he was more successful , and these works show real humour . His drama , The Lady of Lyons , still keeps the stage . Lytton 's works , especially his historical novels , are still popular : now as ever he stands better with the public than with the professional critic . // The rollicking spirit which pervades so much of the popular literature of the first thirty years of the century did not ( save for the expiring glory of Pict , wick ) survive the Georgian times . But towards the end of those spacious days there flourished two of the most genial spirits among our minor novelists , Marryat and Lever , who carried on in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frederick Marry-at ( 1792-1848 ) , himself a naval officer , caught to perfection the traditional spirit of the British Navy , and Peter Simple and Mr. Midshipman Easy , with their stream of adventures and their fascinating technicalities of sea-craft , are classical examples of nautical romance . Charles Lever ( 1806 ? 1872 ) may be said to have invented the Irishman of popular fiction . The heroes of Charles O'Malley and Tom Burke of Ours pass their days in feats of breakneck horsemanship , and their nights in endless stories told over the claret or round the camp-fires of the Peninsular Army . Their popularity is enduring , and deserves to be . George Borrow ( 1803-1881 ) , like both the last-mentioned authors , wrote of adventures in the open air , but in a deeper , more poetic spirit . His books are a string of more or less fantastic adventures , coloured by prejudices almost equally fantastic , on which he harps with laughable persistence . The Bible in Spain is an account , somewhat apocryphal , of his adventures as an agent of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and The Romany Rye ( 1857 ) deal chiefly with gipsies . Philology , horse-coping , pugilism , and the joy of the open road , give these inconsequent works a peculiar atmosphere of their own . Less polished , and far less witty , than Peacock , whom in many ways ho resembles , he has more to tell , and he tells it in a strenuous style which never fails to hold the reader 's interest . Although he survived till 1881 , Borrow was essentially a writer of the late Georgian age , and had nothing in common with the new spirit of which Dickens and Thackeray were the first and the greatest interpreters . CHAPTER XXHI CRITICAL , PHILOSOPHICAL , AND HISTORICAL WRITERS OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY The Edinburgh and Quarterly Reviews : Jeffrey , Sydney Smith , Gifford . The London Magazine Group . Lainh , Hazlitt , De Quinecy . Blackwood 's : Lockhart and Wilson . Leigh Hunt , Hartley Coleridge , Magian . Philosophy : The Transcendentalists and Utilitarians . Bentham , James Mill , John Stuart Mill . Increased specialisation in philosophy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Palgrave , Mitford , Grote , Thirlwall , Froude . THE age of the Romantic revival was a creative rather than a critical period , and it is in the creative branches of literature ( especially in poetry and fiction ) that its great triumphs were achieved . As regards criticism , the great minds of the age were too much under the influence of a violent reaction against classicism to give impartial verdicts ; nor , till Carlyle , did they pay sufficient attention to foreign literature . It was left to the generation of Matthew Arnold : end of his successors to examine dispassionately the wealth of literature that had accumulated during the three centuries of England 's greatest literary activity . And yet the Romantic movement witnessed the rise of a peculiarly numerous and strenuous race of critics ; but they were critics who , with all their vigour and ability , were for the most part hopelessly behind their contemporaries in the creative departments of literature . This new race of critics were the product of that highly important literary medium , the modern magazine . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a discount . The Addisonian essay had ( lied out , and the critical review had not risen to importance ; only the Monthly Review enjoyed the occasional services of prominent writers . Twenty years later the best intellect of the country was finding its chief expression in a group of famous periodicals which had sprung up in the interval . The growth of these periodicals had a marked effect on the style of criticism . Able men in all branches of life , whose professional occupations precluded any sustained literary exertions , were well pleased to adopt the intermittent and not unremunerative form of authorship which these reviews encouraged . To readers of to-day , accustomed to magazines which command the services of specialists on all subjects , the reviews of the first quarter of the nineteenth century seem amateurish and unsatisfactory . The writers were indeed the ablest men of their ( lay ; but their articles were hack-work , and not always conscientious hack-work . A regular writer on the staff of the Edinburgh or Quarterly would contribute to each issue an appalling number of articles dealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that Brougham once wrote an entire number of the Edinburgh . Consequently these reviews present a quantity of clever but entirely superficial work , essentially journalistic in character . Writers like Coleridge , Lamb , and Hazlitt , who devoted their whole time to literature , were the exception , at least in the early days of the movement . The typical reviewers were men like Jeffrey and Brougham , who wrote their articles in the intervals of their work at the Bar or the House of Commons . An enemy once said of Brougham when the latter was Lord Chancellor , " If only Brougham knew a little about law , he would know a little about everything . " Nor ( lid the reviewers atone for their lack of special knowledge by showing original genius . Not only did they fail to initiate any intellectual movement , but they were usually the last to realise the importance of such movements when they THE CRI'T'ICAL REVIEWVS 10a arose out of the abundant genius of the age . It is true they could join in the universal chorus which praised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or appreciate Shelley . On the other hand , it may be placed to their credit that , when work was obviously and demonstrably bad , they gave it short shrift . Thus they purged English taste of its worst crudities . In politics the attitude of the reviews was analogous to their attitude in literature . They ( at least such of them as professed Liberal opinions ) were loud and effective in their condemnation of the worst abuses ; but they were impervious to the ideas of the radical and demo cratic reformers with whom , as it proved , the future lay . Francis Jeffrey ( 1773 ? 1850 ) is a typical figure among the group of reviewers . He was one of the band of young men ( among whom Brougham , Sydney Smith , and Horner were the most prominent ) who founded the first great review ? the Edinburgh in 1802 . The Edinburgh was started as a protest against the old-fashioned Toryism which dominated the northern capital ; but its Liberalism was of a very moderate type , the more extreme reformers finding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Weekly Register , a magazine which owed its success to its audacious sentiments and its racy , colloquial style . As a literary critic ? and this was his special department ? Jeffrey was unfortunate . His love of mediocrity guided him with the certainty of an instinct , and in 1819 he summed up the opinions formed by twenty years ' editorship of the Edinburgh in an article which , after considering the names of all the famous poets of that great age , singles out two as destined to immortality ? Rogers and Campbell ! His style , consisting as it does largely in the use of uncompromising superlatives , gives the ineptitude of his judgments an additional piquancy . His sentences passed on the great poets of the " Lake " school have become proverbs . And yet , in his own limited sphere , he had an acute judgment and strong common sense . Above all , he was // honest and independent , and he had a high conception of the duties of a reviewer . To him and his colleagues belongs the credit of having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public estimation . " Prejudiced as he often was , he was not affected by the wild bursts of personal and political passion which frequently blew Hazlitt a thousand miles from the course of true criticism . He keeps his eye on the object , which De Quincey seldom does . He is not affected by that desire to preach on certain pet subjects which affects the admirable critical faculty of Carlyle . . . and he never indulges in the mannered and rather superfluous graces which marred , to some tastes , the work of Matthew Arnold " ( Saiedsbnry ) . Sydney Smith ( 1771 ? 1845 ) , also one of the Edinburgh group , deserves mention not only as one of the wittiest Englishmen of all time , but for the breadth and sanity of his judgment . Although his fame rests chiefly on his personality and conversation , his writings have an assured place in English literature . Peter Plymley 's Letters are a storehouse of exquisitely humorous political parables . His Noodle 's Oration ? a parody of the typical Tory oration of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party . His satire is none the less effective for a genial moderation , which is in strong contrast to that of his great predecessors , Swift and " Junius . " William Gifford ( 1756 ? 1826 ) first made his reputation by satires ( Baviad and Myriad ) written in the style of Pope , and directed against a clique of poetasters known as the " Dellacruscans , " after the pseudonym of Della Crusca assumed by their leader , one Robert Merry . As editor of the Tory review , the Quarterly ? started in 1809 in opposition to the Edinburgh ? he became the accepted type of savagery in criticism . His editorship of the AntiJacobin is important , for in this paper a group of brilliant Tory satirists perfected // the art of parody and burlesque which replaced the older satire of the Dunciad type as the vehicle for literary , political , and social skits . ( See p. 267 . ) The Edinburgh and Quarterly represent the first stage of the development of the new periodic literature . The second stage was inaugurated in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blackwood 's Magazine and The London Magazine . While the contents of the earlier pair had been almost purely critical , tho latter were miscellanies of all kinds of literary work , both critical and original . They attracted contributors of greater ability than their predecessors . The London group of writers comprised Lamb , Hazlitt , T. Hood , H. F. Cary ( the translator of Dante ) , and Hartley Coleridge . Blackwood was run chiefly by John Wilson and Lockhart . De Quincey was a leading contributor to both magazines . Charles Lamb ( 1775 ? 1834 ) is one of the most fascinating personalities in English literature . His story is pathetic ; it is overshadowed by the tragedy of the murder of his mother by his much-loved sister in a fit of insanity . The brother and sister passed their lives together , and the latter 's recurring fits of madness cruised periods of intense depression in Lamb 's existence , which were in marked contrast to the almost over-exuberant joyousness of Lamb 's social life . His home was the centre of the most brilliant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his rather impish humour , was the most conspicuous figure in the social life  --  as Coleridge was in the intellectual life ? of a group which comprised Hazlitt , Godwin , Hood , and others , and which monopolised the society of Wordsworth when he paid a visit to town . It was in this society that criticism reached its highest point during the first quarter of the century , and Lamb himself is the chief exponent of the school of thought which that group represented . After u // some youthful attempts at poetry , drama , and novel-writing ( his novel Rosamund Gray had some success ) , he published , in collaboration with his sister , the earliest of his well-known works ? Tales from Shakespeare ( 1807 ) . Like most of the members of the above-mentioned group he was an enthusiastic student of Elizabethan literature , and the Tales , although intended primarily for children , appeal to a far more universal audience through the skill with which the greatness of the original is preserved . His Specimens of English Dramatic Poets Contemporary with Shakespeare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field . More important are his critical essays , On the Tragedies of Shakespeare , On the Barrenness of the Imaginative Faculty is the Productions of Modern Art , and On the Genius and Character of Hoggarth , which did invaluable service in popularising the ideas which underlay the Romantic movement . Lamb 's fame , however , rests less on his critical works than on his discursive Essays of Ella , which stand alone in their tender and sympathetic humour , their masterly treatment of unexalted themes , and the winning intimacy of their manner . The clerks of an easy-going office , an old lady 's love of whist , and the culinary properties of roast-pig ? these are the themes of three of the best-known essays in the English language . Much of their charm is due to Lamb 's style . Although carefully formed on the models of the great prosewriters both of the Jacobean and the Augustan age , it is singularly unselfconscious ? almost irresponsible . William Hazlitt ( 1778 ? 1830 ) was , like Lamb , among the first to recognise the importance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ballads , and as a critic he did yeoman service in the cause of the new movement . His criticism has not the deep philosophy of Coleridge , or Lamb 's gift of delicate appreciation , but he possessed a forceful common sense combined with an amazing knowledge of English literature in all ages . In his Characters of ShakeHAZLITT ? 1 ) E // speare ( 1817 ) , although he can not be said to " pluck the heart from Hamlet 's mystery , " he at any rate gave sound reasons for reverencing Shakespeare at a time when Shakespeareworship had become an unmeaning superstition . His Lectures on the English Poets ( 1818 ) and On the Dramatic Literature in the Age of Queen Elizabeth are models of criticism , enlivened and not warped by the impulsive admiration which he lavishes on his favourite authors . The Spirit q f /he Age is a series of portraits of the notable men of his time , drawn with a vigour equally impulsive , but with many bitter touches , for Hazlitt throughout his career was given to the luxury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he ranks second only to Lamb among the men of his time . Thomas de Quincey ( 1785 ? 1859 ) . De Qnincey 's great work , Confessions of an English Opium-Eater ( 1821 ) , is perhaps the best introspective biography in the language , with its impassioned descriptions , whose effect is not marred by any intrusion of egoism . The numerous papers which he contributed to the London , Blackwoods , and T'ail 's magazines show a vast stock of curious knowledge and an interest in all that is out of the way and abstruse . Ile was a stylist , and a conscious stylist . His long and involved periods , cumbered with every kind of qualifying clause and adorned with many figures of speech , are a wonderful ? oven fm midable ? example of what can be done with the English language . The ornateness of his prose marks a reaction from eighteenth century severity ? a reaction which influenced Carlyle , and in later days Ruskin and Pater . John Gibson Lockhart ( 1794 ? 1854 ) was the moving spirit of Blackwood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ venture , which distinguished itself chiefly by a practical joke on Edinburgh wiseacres , and by its slashing criticisms on what Lockhart called the " Cockney School , " which conducted the London Magazine . Subsequently , as editor of the Quarterly , Lockhart carried on the traditions of Gifford in // a somewhat humaner spirit . His historical novel , Valerius ( 1821 ) , and some other powerful novels which he wrote , are less remembered than his really great work , the life of his father-in-law , Sir Walter Scott ? the one biography in the language which can be compared with Boswell 's John , on . Like Boswell , he has succeeded in picturing not only the genius of his hero , but the goodness and tenderness of the man . John Wilson ( 1785-1854 ) , Lockhart 's coadjutor in Black wood 's ? known to its readers as " Christopher North " ? is now remembered chiefly for his Noctes Ambrosianeo ; , which record the good cheer and genial talk of a series of convivial meetings in Edinburgh . James Henry Leigh Hunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an Opposition journalist . The Examiner , which he started in 1808 , and which attained to considerable importance in the critical world , was the first of many papers which he edited with varying success . His imprisonment for libelling the Prince Regent in 1813 gained him considerable renown in Liberal circles . His journalistic activity precluded the sustained course of study which is necessary for the formation of a sound critic , but his essays have a certain poetic charm . As a poet he may be said to have opened up a new tract by his Story of Rimini ( 1816 ) , for this poem re-introduced the Chaucerian use of the heroic couplet which was imitated by Keats and Shelley , and which became one of the recognised forms of English narrative verse ( e.g. W. Morris 's Jason ) . His translations from Italian poets , and one or two of his shorter poems ( including the trivial but wholly charming " Jenny kissed me " ) , are the best-known specimens of his verse . Hartley Coleridge ( 1796 ? 1E49 ) was the son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Worthies is a respectable contribution to literary history . He was also a minor poet with a tinge of Elizabethan inspiration . THE UTILITARIANS 30S ) William Maginn ( 1793 ? 1842 ) the " bright , broken Maginn " of Lockhart 's fine epitaph , was for a time a contributor to Blackwood . It is , however , as one of the founders of Eraser 's Magazine in 1830 that he left his mark on the history of journalism . The contributors to Fraser 's formed the most distinguished literary circle in the middle of the century , Thackeray , Mill , and Carlyle being only a few among its most distinguished names . Maginn was unfortunately a Bohemian in the alcoholic sense of the word ? the original of Captain Shandon in Pendennis , and this failing ruined his life , but as a slashing Tory pamphleteer and as a novelist of Lever 's school he did work which it would be difficult to surpass . In the domain of abstract thought it was Germany , as has been said , that initiated the reforming movement . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day when Kant was " wakened from his dogmatic slumbers " by reading the works of flume . But in Great Britain too the reaction against the negative doctrines of Hume and Berkeley gave rise to a school of thought ? the Scotch " common - sense school " of Thomas Reid and William Hamilton . Hamilton , as much as Coleridge , helped to naturalise the Kantian doctrine in Great Britain ; but while Coleridge was attracted by the mystic side of Kant , Hamilton viewed his system from the technical and logical aspect . The influence of Coleridge and his followers , F. 1 ) . Maurice and Sterling , was more apparent in the domain of theology ; that of Hamilton in the domain of pure philosophy . The other great philosophic school of the period ? a school diametrically opposed to the Transcendentalists ? was the Utilitarian . The importance of this school lies not so much in their metaphysics ( a subject which interested them but little ) as in their economic teachings , and especially in the // profound influence which they exercised on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the greatest number " was to be obtained by the abolition of old vested interests , the establishment of international peace , and above all by the right of the manufacturer and trader to carry on their business without let or hindrance from the State . This teaching , coming as it did at the time of England 's greatest industrial development , was eagerly taken up by the middleclass manufacturing population , and bore good fruit in the great series of reforms which freed English trade and English politics from the domination of the landowning aristocracy . But , as literature , the writings of the Utilitarians are unimpressive . Only one of their number ? John Mill  --  approached to literary greatness ; the others were for the most part men of keen practical intelligence , but unimaginative . Their lack of imagination impaired not only the literary value of their work , but its practical effects ; for after the destructive part of their work had been successfully accomplished , it became evident that the Utilitarian idea of unfettered competition was , as a constructive policy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Utilitarianism ? with Carlyle and Buskin ? that the victory has remained . Jeremy Bentham ( 1748-1832 ) . Bentham was a juristic writer , whose Fragment on Government ( 1776 ) , Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Politics ( 1789 ) , and Fallacies ( 1824 ) , supplied the text for the Utilitarian movement . As a thinker he was too purely a theorist , and his system lacked completeness . But he is important as the inspiring genius of many able successors who worked out his ideas in a more practical as well as in a more philosophical spirit . James Mill ( 1773-1836 ) . As an exact thinker Mill ranks above Bentham , and his Analysis of the Human Mind ( 1829 ) and Fragment on Mackintosh ( 1835 ) are complete // expositions of Utilitarian philosophy . His History of British India is a marvellous work of research , although his tendency to apply his own political theories to a country so different from his own made him occasionally unfair to the founders of our Indian Empire . John Stuart Mill ( 1806 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was by far the greatest of the Utilitarian group . Unlike the others , he had the power of modifying his views : he was far less the slave of abstract theories , and though the main tendency of his teaching never varied , his greater flexibility of mind gave him a far greater influence than the others both on the thought and the practical politics of his day . From Mill 's fine Autobiography we learn that he was subjected from his infancy to a drastic course of education , which , as he says , enabled him to start with an advantage of a quarter of a century over his contemporaries . In 1823 his father got him appointed to a Clerkship in the East India House ? a situation which left him leisure for great literary activity . He was a frequent contributor to the London ( later the London and Westminster Rev/env ? the chief monthly organ of the Radicals ? and , for a time , its editor . In 1865 he entered Parliament , where he actively advocated the most advanced views ; but his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honourable alike to him and to themselves , were offended by his support of the " Atheist " Bradlaugh , and refused to elect him a second time . Mill began his literary career , under the eye of his father , in the Westminster Review , which represented the most orthodox Benthamism ; but about 1829 his views were somewhat modified by the awakening of certain emotional and poetic needs in his nature ? needs that his father 's educational system had never contemplated . At this period he was influenced by the work of Carlyle and the Coleridgean philosophers : he became more humanised and less doctrinaire . // Thus in his Representative Government he refuses to accept the Benthamite doctrine that the wish of the majority must necessarily represent what is best for the community , and admits that the principles of democracy can not fitly be applied without regard to the stage of civilisation which a community may have reached ? no small concession for a " Philosophic Radical " in the days when that school was at the height of its dogmatism . His Political Economy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : he recognises that the interference of the State with economic " laws " may sometimes be beneficial , but he never ceased to regard State interference with suspicion . As an economist Mill has been largely superseded by later writers , who have applied more fully to the science those comparative and historical methods which are the basis of modern inquiry on social subjects generally . In his essay On Liberty , the most widely read of his works , Mill is at his greatest . The object of this work was , he tells us in his Autobiography , to emphasise " the importance to man and society of a large variety in types of character , and of giving full freedom to human nature to expand itself in numerous and conflicting directions . " Here we see that the Utilitarian can be an idealist . Here , and not in any shortsighted political dogma , lies the greatest lesson which the Philosophic Radicals had for their generation . Mill 's doctrines in Psychology and Metaphysics are closely bound up with his political creed . He strongly opposed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a belief which seemed to him part of that pernicious philosophy which accepts established doctrines of religion and politics as ultimate truths which must not be investigated . It was this sense of the practical importance of metaphysical theory that led Mill to an ardent attack on the chief intuitionist philosopher of the age ( Examination of Sir W. Hamilton 's Philosophy , 1865 ) . Mill 's philosophic writings are remarkably // lucid , and this renders his positions more easily assailable than that of obscurer , if not profounder , writers . But to pronounce him out of date is at least premature . Despite the primness and precision of his style , Mill 's was an emotional nature , and his great-hearted championship of unpopular views ( shown in his pamphlet The Subjection of Women and in his active endeavours to procure the condemnation of Governor Eyre ) made him in the long run one of the most respected men of his ago . Though the general tendency of later days has been against the extreme individualism which he upheld , there is much in his teaching which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of science and the growing complexity of thought which accompanied it led to increased specialisation in philosophic and semi-philosophic subjects . The work of the technical writers of the nineteenth century has less literary interest than that of the more easy-going philosophers of the eighteenth century , with their broader outlook on the world . The epoch-making Origin ( J. Species ( 1859 ) , and Herbert Spencer 's voluminous exposition of his system of evolutionary philosophy , monde no pretence to literary distinction . Perhaps , I. N. Ml ill is the best instance of a writer who could treat difficult and technical subjects with , if not grace , at least a certain dignity of style . In history the sane specialising movement was at work . The increasing mass of material for historical research provided by the discovery of inscriptions , and the greater accessibility of records , has vastly increased the work of the modern historian : it is no longer possible to write a history , as Hume and Gibbon wrote theirs , within the four walls of a library , and history has become less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divided historians into two classes : those who treat history as a picturesque pageant , and those who approach it in the spirit of a philosopher : to // these a third class might now be added , namely , those who look on the past as a field for scientific research . Among the early successors of Gibbon were few of this last group ; but Sharon Turner ( 1768-1847 ) in his History of the Anglo-Saxons , and Sir Francis Palgrav'e ( 1788-1861 ) in his works on early English history may be called the pioneers of scientific historical research . With these must be reckoned Henry Hallam ( 1777-1859 ) , whose works , however ( Europe during the Middle Ages , Constitutional History of England , Introduction to the Literature of Europe ) , have a greater literary value . Hallam , like his greater follower Macaulay , was a staunch Whig , and his political views colour , but do not bias , his history . William Mitford ( 1744-1827 ) wrote a history of Greece with the undisguised purpose of making the ancient Athenians an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work called forth a reply from Grote ? a far abler man ? and Mitford 's history , though not without merits in point of style , was entirely superseded . George Grote ( 17941871 ) was a friend of James Mill and a prominent member of the " Philosophic Radical " group . His History of Greece ( 1846-1856 ) is as completely an ex parte statement as Mitford 's , and is often noisily controversial . He possessed what Mitford lacked ? the power of philosophic insight . His work is a real interpretation of the life of the time , and his explanations of much that had hitherto been misunderstood have generally stood the test of modern research . C. Thirlwall ( 1797-1875 ) . Thirlwall 's History of Greece ( 1835-1847 ) never rivalled Grote 's in popularity : he lacked the qualities , good and bad , that gave Grote his peculiar interest , and his work is that of a scholar , not of a politician . Dignity and soundness are its great merits . James Anthony Fronde ( 1818-1894 ) is one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a historian , as a political essayist , and , above all , as the // biographer of Carlyle , he wrote under an unflagging storm of protest from his various enemies . But the fascination of his style secured him the ear of the British public , and he troubled himself little about the charges of wrong-headedness and inaccuracy brought against him by writers more scholarly , more philosophic , but without a tithe of his brilliance . Fronde in his undergraduate days fell under the influence of Newman , and , partly under family pressure , he took orders . But he soon discovered that he was not fitted for the clerical profession , having , indeed , agnostic leanings . Ire renounced his orders , published his reasons for so doing in a book called The Nemesis of Faith ( 1818 ) , and consequently abandoned a fellowship which he held at Exeter College . Henceforth the prevailing influence in his life was the teaching of Carlyle . Like the latter he preached the " gospel of action , " and developed a fine facility in hero worship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carlyle himself were all glorified by Froude in this spirit ; but he was hardly as fortunate as his master in the choice of objects for his devotion . Above all Froude became the bitter foe of Catholicism , which he regarded as an emasculating influence , inculcating time doubtful virtues of submission and self-denial as against the enterprising and aggressive Protestantism which he conceived to be the strength of the British character . His greatest work , the history of England from the hall of Wolsey to the Spanish Armada , appeared in 1856-1869 . In point of trustworthiness it falls far below any other history of importance published during the century . Not only was Froude constitutionally incapable of quoting accurately from his authorities ; not only was his memory singularly weak and unreliable ; but his entire theory of history was based on a tacit assumption that events as they actually happened were merely the recalcitrant material which the historian must mould to suit his theories . his // prejudices ? especially where Catholicism was concerned ? were as violent as those of Macaulay or Carlyle , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with which he was dealing nor Carlyle 's philosophic insight into the causes of great movements and the tendencies which have directed the course of history . But Froude had three great qualities which give his history its peculiar value . First , his style is perhaps more agreeable than that of any other nineteenth century writer . Though perfectly clear and free from mannerisms , it has a strength and pungency that never fail . He has none of the irritating peculiarities of his two great predecessors , and his matter is equally far removed from complexity and the commonplace . Secondly , his dramatic instinct is as strong as his scholarly instinct is weak . His famous saying that the most perfect history of England is to be found in the historical plays of Shakespeare illustrates this dramatic view . He tells his story with a view to bringing out the picturesque features in the characters of his heroes , and he concentrates his attention on the dramatic moments in their history . This method involves of course the complete loss of all true historical perspective : but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Froude 's historical works , like Carlyle 's , were undertaken largely for the sake of the bearing they had on his own time . In politics he was Protestant , Unionist , Imperialist , and anti-Democratic . All these views find expression in his History of England , his English in Ireland ( 1871-74 ) , Erasmus ( 1894 ) , and Elizabethan Seamen of this Sixteenth Century ( 1894 ) , and give an additional animation to his work . Far below Carlyle as a teacher and prophet , he yet shared something of these qualities with his master , and his was not the least influence in the great imperialist movement which dominated England through the latter part of the century . CHAPTER XXIV VICTORIAN POETRY Low ebb of poetry between Byron and Tennyson . Tennyson . Browning . The " Spasmodic " group : Bailey , Dohell , Alexander Smith . Light verse : Locker Lampson , Calverley , Aytouu . Clough . During the years which immediately preceded the rise of Tennyson and Browning , English poetry was in a discredited position . For this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sir Walter l reigned before me , ? Moore and Campbell Before and after . " And these four poets , Byron , Scott , Moore , and Campbell  --  - despite the greatness of the first two ? had popularised a bad ideal of poetry : the easy diffuseness of their style and the attractive subject-matter of their Romantic poems had recommended them to largo audiences with whom they took the place of Romantic novelists . 7'he successors and imitators of these poets found themselves hopelessly outdistanced in popular favour by the professed novelists , whose position rose in importance as that of the poets declined . Moreover , the years 1830 to 1850 form a chapter in the national history peculiarly unfavourable to the production of poetry . The fervour of the Romantic epoch had died out , and had left only a pseudo-Romanticism such as appears in Ainsworth and in the early novels of Lytton . The 1 Referring , of course , to the poetry of Scott . As a novelist , Scott most emphatically continued to reign " ? after " Byron . 317 // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wealthy manufacturers who carried the Reform Bill and the repeal of the Corn Laws . To such men the literature of prose realism was more acceptable than the worn-out make-believe of the Medievalist Romancers or the unpractical idealism of Shelley . Dickens and Thackeray were amply sufficient for the needs ? never very extensive ? of their imaginative existence , and the poets were left to cater for the demands of the class which dealt in albums and " Keepsakes " and sang drawing-room ballads . Alfred Tennyson ( 1809-1892 ) . The poet who restored poetry to favour was Tennyson . His popularity , though of slower growth , was equal to that of Byron ; but , unlike Byron , he exercised a refining influence on English taste . Readers with the most rudimentary ideas on poetry could love him for his clearness and picturesqueness , and for the close relation in which his work stood to the thoughts and events of his time ; but , with all his popularity , Tennyson never forgot himself as an artist , and he infused into the life of the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the poetry latent in that iron age , and interpreted it with a master 's skill . As an artist , Tennyson 's early career has many points of resemblance to that of his favourite model Keats , although in character and circumstances there is little in common between the ill-educated consumptive and the sturdy descendant of Lincolnshire yeomen who won the Cambridge prize for English poetry in 1829 . But Tennyson 's first volumes of poems ( 1830 and 1833 ) show much the same type of undeveloped genius as Keats ' early work ; they show a mind crowded with poetic imagery but as yet inexperienced in the art of correct expression . The books were ill-received by the reviewers , who seem to have appre hended a recrudescence of the style of the " Cockney School " // ? and , indeed , the volumes contained many lapses into the commonplace ? nor was there any very obvious promise of the perfect lyrics of Tennyson 's prime in the graceful but trifling series of miniature portraits ( Madeline , Rosalind , and the rest ) which filled a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produce a happier result . For ten years Tennyson worked almost in silence at his chosen trade of poetry , and at the end of that period he came forward again ( in 1842 ) a finished master of his craft . The whole volume of his poems ( for his earlier work was carefully revised and partly rewritten in the light of his later experience ) shows a sustained level of excellence that few English poets have equalled . We can trace in Tennyson 's early work the germ of most of his later characteristics ? his power ( occasionally misused ) of pictorial representation , his dreamy melody ( though the perfect music of his blank verse came later , as may be seen by a comparison between Oenone as originally published and the later revised version ) , and the startling accuracy of his observation of nature : " Your meloncholy sweet and frail As perfume of the cuckoo-flower . " ( Margaret . ) Also there is a conciseness ? . the most constant characteristic of Victorian poetry the absence of which often marred the work even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example the succession of pictures in The Palace of Art : " And one , can English home ? gray twilight poured On dewy pastures , dewy trees , Softer than sleep ? all things in order stored , A haunt of ancient peace . " These early poems , too , show Tennyson 's tricks of style ? in later years often the subject of kindly parody ? the frequent 30 VICTORIAN POETRY occurrence of double epithets ( " sudden-curved , " &c.),; the skilful use of repetitions and a marvellous mastery of vowel-sounds which is the secret of some of his most lovely effects : it is not too much to say that even these poems of Tennyson 's youth revived certain notes of that melody which had been lost to English poetry since the days of the Elizabethan poets . In these poems , also , we see the essential homeliness of Tennyson . Like Virgil ? and the English Laureate had much in common with the Roman ? Tennyson looked on nature with something of a farmer 's eye , and loved to tell of a cultivated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he loved wholesome and human ideals : the over-cultured intellectualism which expended itself in the construction of a Palace of Art was as repulsive to him as the selfish spiritual exaltation of his St. Simeon Stylites . The death of Tennyson 's great friend Arthur Hallam was a turning-point in his career . His verse up to that date was scarcely touched by deep thought or profound spiritual emotion , but his In Memoriam ( 1850 ) is a powerful record of these influences . Tennyson was never a poet of the predominantly intellectual order ? any complexity of thought would have tended to mar the exquisite simplicity of his verse ? but , as Hutton says , " He is most successful when a thought or feeling dominates his otherwise too lavish fancy , " and the brooding years which followed Hallam 's death in 1833 gave his work just that sobering touch which it needed . The philosophy of In Memoriam is the philosophy of the Broad Church theologians of the age . It has been said ? and with perfect justice ? that Tennyson followed rather than created @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1833 to 1850 " The Conflict between Religion and Science " was in its initial stage : the discoveries of the geologists
