It lasted in ' 1 two sessions , from 11 o'clock in the morning until nearly 5 in the evening , and was ' termed by Melville E. Ingalls , a member of the Frick investigating committee , literally a " cat and dog fight . " Personalities of the bitterest variety were indulged in. charges of treachery made , end the I lie freely passed . It was the culmination of months of bitterness and intrigue  --  a period that had I wound up with the attempt of the Frick committee to eliminate James H. Hyde , James W. Alexander , and Gage E. Tarbell from executive contra in the society . This was the basis of charges before and at yesterday 's meeting that a plot had been hatched to divert permanently the power of $400,000,000 Equitable assets into the control of the Harriman-Pennsylvania Railroad interests . Prom this developed the assertion of the night before last that Standard Oil played no small part in the affair . It did not figure in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared before the day was over that George Gould , President of the Missouri Pacific , who has close affiliations with the Rockefellers , had lined up with James H. Hyde in direct opposition to the Harriman programme . Railroad Interests Involved . In quarters in touch with James H. Hyde it was intimated last night that this fact was of far-reaching importance in the railroad world . The attempt by the Harriman interests to gain control of the society was said to be at bottom a move to prevent George Gould from financing in New York his various railroad projects , the Wabash extension to the Atlantic Coast and the new Western Pacific line . This was to have been accomplished , it was declared , by keeping the securities of the Gould lines out of the investment lists of the Equitable and by this virtual stamp of disapproval discouraging other great financial institutions of New York from taking them . In answer to a question whether this meant that the Equitable 's financial support was to be as thoroughly enjoyed by George J. Gould ' as it was said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past the authority for the above assertion replied that Mr. ? Gould wand receive only the treatment that was ttccordecle4very other railroad head having legitimate investments to offer to the society . Mr. Harriman was explicitly excepted from this category . The Frick committee , consisting at the end of Henry C. Frick , Edward H. Harriman , Melville E. Ingalls , Cornelius N. Bliss , and Brayton Ives ; had prepared in the interval between the meeting of the Directors on Wednesday and yesterday morning a supplemental report in which the recommendation of the original report that the business of the society be so modified , o.s ? ? . to exclude the tontine and deterred dividend ; policies was 16 , : ataaasggatii*** , . *44y*t:49 : the board present when the meeting was called to order it 11 o'clock yesterday morning .

C. Haarstick , A. S. Cassatt , ' David H. Moffat . E. H. Harriman , Joseph T. Low . Jacob H. Schiff , President Alexander 's Answer . A. J. Cassatt , President of the Pennsyl-i yenta Railroad , first took the floor to move the adoption of the Frick committee 's report , and the meeting was open for discussion . President Alexander made formal answer to the charges involving his conduct of his office contained in the report , and entered into a general defense of the management of the society , based primarily upon the record of the company . He pointed out that the growth of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty years , ' and that the management of the agency , , department had been notable for its suc-1 cess , The financial solidity of the society , 1 Mr. Anexander declared , was unquestioned , and entitled the Equitable to be 1 called " the strongest in the world . " He said that the business of the society had been not only successful , but had been economically administered and with constant regard to the interests of the policy holders . Vice President Hyde Defends Himself . After Mr. Alexander bad concluded Mr. Hyde opened his defense by saying that he recognized this to be the crisis of his life . From the beginning of this unfortunate controversy he had endeavored to bear his troubles patiently and with the dignity befitting the high office which he held , but even patience had its limits , and the welfare of the society , which was nearer to his heart than any other interest involved in the controversy , required him now to speak out in no uncertain vale for its good name , which had been assailed and dragged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been one of rule , or ruin . Mr ) Hyde referred to the great monument of prosperity that had been erected by Iris father , and said lie would be false , to Iris duty to the memory of his family if he failed to defend his good name against the innuMerable plots **26;380;TOOLONG been concocted . to capture the : great trust funds that . Were being held for the policy holders . He proceeded to take up in detail the charges of the report , and said that if any honest man could find in anything con-1 tamed in the evidence before the commit tee a single word or fact that could be construed into wrongdoing , he would surrender his stock and retire into the obliv- ' ion which lie would justly deserve ; he ' ' would admit that he was young , and had been still younger when he assumed office in the company , but that was a crime which time would cure ; he admitted that ' he had been trustful of those who had ' professed to be his friends , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trust in them ; he admit- I ted , also , that he had , perhaps , at times in the exuberance of youth , been rather arbitrary , and had made enemies that would perhaps have better not been made . Mr. Hyde reviewed the charges and took up the evidence piece by piece . He characterized the charges as frivolous and ridiculous in the extreme , and as havingbeen overwhelmingly disproved . He insisted that there was not a single act of his entire career with the society which , was the subject of so much as just criticism on the part of a fair-minded man ' with the possible exception of the Cambon dinner , and that was a matter of honest difference of opinion as to business methods . In that connection he said that while : he had deposited the amount of this expenditure with the cashier he felt he ought to receive it back . Mr. Alexander , he said , was aware before the giving of the dinner , and that while It was given , in his name , it was a business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been circulated against him was one to the effect that he had given this dinner with the idea of getting the Legion of Honor from tile French Government . The Legion of Honor had in fact been conferred on him two years before the dinner was given . Mr. Hyde said that fully onequarter of the guests at the dinner had been invited by others connected with the society , and were men of prominence in the community with whom he was unacquainted . It had been a purely business project , discussed between the officers of the company . in advance , in which they had actively participated and in which his only motive had been to promote the welfare of the society . He referred to the fact that shortly after the dinner Mr. Alexander had come to him with a form of letter to M. Cambon referring to various matters in France in which the society was interested . As to his participations in syndicates , Mr. Hyde said that he had been in many syndicates , always with Mr. Alexander , in which the Equitable had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had lost money . The Equitable , said Mr. Hyde , at one time or another bought in all about $10 , - 000,000 , the $140,000,000 of the bonds , If the society had never bought one ? of . those =bonds , and the ' bantsers had been ' , unable to sell one of the bonds whiclOthe Equitable had bought ( an impoEte/t/le proposition , ) he would have had to take in those two years and in all those 04 ' ; dicates put together $100,000 of bond.S. , ? - .. And if he had to take them or had been , allowed to take them he would have , made money on them . He referred , to the . fact that the society had made very large profits on the e10,000,000 of bonds ; which they had bought from the bankers as compared with which his , trifling commission on the underwriting amounted to nothing . Mr. Hyde went on to say that he proposed to insist on his right to these coatmissions . The address of Mr. Alexander and Mr. Hyde consumed most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the society had read a statement showing the advantages to the society of the deferred dividend system as compared with the annual dividend plan , there was time before the adjournment only for A. W. Krech and H. C. Deming to make short speeches regarding the connection of the Equitable Life with the Equitable and Mercantile Trust Companies . Tarbeil Replies to Charges . The Erick committee had found against Gage E. Tarbell ' that the office of the Second Vice President had been managed with extravagance and incompetence . In answering these charges at the opening of the afternoon session , Mr. Tarbell took up first the method that had been followed by the Frick committee in preparing Rs report . " Talk of tax methods , " he said ; " allow me to indicate some of the methods that have been followed by this committee in making an ex-parte investigation . I received from the committee a letter requesting a mass of detailed information about the conduct of the society 's agency business . I put men at work collecting the information , which was a task of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could possibly be done the Investigating Committee reports , Not long ago I received a notification that on the following day the committee would call on me for information . Gentlemen . that notice le still on my desk , and I have yet to receive the call of the committee . " " That 's about the experience I had , " Mr. Hyde put in . Mr. Tarbell then took up the criticism of the increase in agents ' balances during the past five years , contained in the Frick report . He said that the saving to the society in first year 's commissions exceeded by more than notl000 the entire increase in agents ' balances , and that upon a statement from the Auditor of the society he would deal : re that for five years past the accounts of the agencies under his control showed but $.10,000 charged off to profit and loss . or a little less titan one-hundredth of 1 per cent of the income of the society . At some length Mr. Tarbell presented a comparison of the Equitable with its two leading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and leading insurance journals , incidentally submitting a letter from the Actuary of the society commending his administration . Ile said that it was rather strange tbat this investigating committee in all lengthy report failed absolutely to make any recommendation bearing upon the important question in the whole controversy  --  namely , that of one-man control in the society . He said that he failed to see if the Frick report were adopted how the one-man control would in the least be eliminated . the only difference being possibly that it would be another man who dominated . Mr. Schiff Proposes Reforms . At the conclusion of the Tarbell statement . Jucob H. Schiff offered a resolution previding that a Chairman of the board be created with plenary power over all depainnents and the work of all the officers of the society . Mr. Schiff named as a committee to nominate such a Chairman D. 0 , Mills . John B. Stewart , A. J. Cassatt , T. Jefferson Coolidge , August Belinout , James B. Forgan. and Robert T. I.Incolu , the proposition being that the committer report at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in the moantime , or pending the choice of a Chairman of the board , that it exercise the powers of such an officer . In presenting this resolution Mr. Schiff declared that the report of the Frick committee had done a great injustice to Mr. Tarbell . He said that it had offered conclusive evidence sustaining the charges against James H. Hyde and James W. Alexander , sufficient to warrant their , removal from office , but that In regard to Tarbell it was woefully deficient . Mr. Schiff said that nothing that he had heard from the report or from the members of the committee impugned the honesty of Mr. Tarbell or his faithfulness to the Equitable . He noted that Tarbell had refrained from entering into any discussions in the public press . After the resolution regarding the Chairmanship of the board Mr. Schiff offered two others providing first , that the Executive Committee be reorganized , and that appropriate amendments to the by-laws be prepared for the purpose of carrying out the resolutions , and , second , that James H. Hyde be requested to divest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . and on such terms and conditions as might be satisfactory to the board . Thereupon Alvin W. Krech moved that the first resolution offered by Mr. Schiff be so amended that the board proceed to elect its own Chairman at this meeting , and the motion was carried by a vote of 23 to 16 . Hyde Denounces Directors . The vote had hardly been announced when James H. Hyde was on his feet again , this time to ask Mr. Ingalls if he had not given a copy of the Frick report to a certain newspaper , and if it were hot true that he had received a $1,000 rebate on his policy in the Equitable . That started the excitement . Mr. Ingalls jumped up and shaking ' his finger at Mr. Hyde , cried : " Young man , whom the gods would destroy they ttrst make mad . " He had hardly had time to deny giving I out report of the investigators when Mr. Hyde was up again , this time assailing I Henry C. Frick , E. H. Harriman , and Jacob H. Schiff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interests . All three , he said , had been with him in syndicate operations in one way or an-. , other , and E. H. Harriman and Jacob H. Schiff had posed from time to time as. - his trusted advisers . When the trouble in the- society began , Mr. Hyde continued , : they had declared they would stand by : him , and now were trying to oust him te : get control of the stock . In connection with this Mr. Hyde . charged that within a comparatiyely= short time E. H. Harriman had , Meolaaa , 1proposition , to . purchase . his stocks ; - 'on ; terms . that indicated plainly : eneugh : , IthisC existence of an ulterior purpose when:if= ? : jiff ! s conal d er ectatitat ** touCk ' , , uPoni'the:question of , ' ' one-man control that bad been at thebottom of the whole controversy in the ; society . ' There was nothing in the report , Mr. Hyde declared , to prevent " syndicate control " if its recommendations were earried out Then he continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon Mr. ' ; ; Frick and Mr. Harriman , ? to which the - litter started to reply by bringing up the United States Shipbuilding case and laying responsibility therefor at Mr. Hyde 's ' door . The latter replied again in kind , and turned his invective again upon Henry CI Frick and M. E. Ingalls , until the former jumped to his feet , shouting : " Fall ' no longer sit in the same board ' with =that young man . " Gage E.'Tarbell acted as a pacifier and - , Persuaded Mr. Frick at least to defer his ' action until it was seen whether some - , : - Solution could not be reached . Bttt other Directors took up the warfare , Marvin Hughitt of Chicago remarking that peo : . : pie in the West had an idea that any - ; Wall Street man was a hopeful candidate for warmer regions and that if the im- , - pression became fixed in their minds that the Equitable was a Wall Street company its business in the West and South would be doomed . Another Director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been most unjustly attacked , held , however , that the proposal to turn the business of - the company upside down was a dangerous one in itself and should not be adopted merely upon the recommendation of a committee no member of which ever had any experience in the insurance business . He also called attention to the fact that ' It did not propose to do away with one-man control and offered no remedy at all for this declared evil in the organization . Harriman and Frick Qult  --  Hyde Pleased . In vain Chauncey M. Depew appealed to the meeting in the interests of harmony . The feeling was too bitter , and as the accusations and counter-accusations were passed back and forth , Mr. Hyde uniformly paying his respects to Messrs . Frick , Harriman , and Schiff , the tension finally became so great that E. H. Harriman announced his resignation and Henry C. Frick said he would n't stay in the board under any circumstances . Then Mr. Hyde said , in effect : " By the resignations of these gentlemen this board stands more truly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now I am willing to offer the control of my stock on such terms as may be deemed wise. , I have said that I never would get out I under compulsion . Now I do so voluntarily . I have quarreled with Mr. Alex-I ander and he with me , and there is still bitter feeling between us , but he never tried to put me out of my property for the benefit of his own pocket , as these gentlemen have done . " Bliss Out , Too . Following this speech , Cornelius N. Bliss announced his resignation , but not until Henry C. Frick and E. H. Harriman , together with D. 0 . Mills , J. A. Stewart , and A. J. Cassatt had left the meeting . It was now 4:45 , and the Directors . worn out by wrangling , finally passed all of Mr. Schiff 's resolutions in their original form , and without the amendment of Mr. Krech that bad precipitated the row . The meeting then adjourned , every one being sworn to silence , and the Frick report still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the board , to say nothing of its adoption . None of the Directors would talk much for quotation after the meeting . When Mr. Frick emerged from the board room he said , as he rushed through a group of reporters : " I 'm done with all that . I  --  m a busy man and have no time to devote to further attention to that matter. - E. IL Harriman would say nothing when he came out nor would Cornelius N. Bliss , further than that he thought the Frick report ought to be published and would he eventually . Brayton Ives of thiz investigating committee was silent . M. E. Ingalls said : " It has been a cat and dog fight all The Board was ' packed , ' and that is an ugly word . with the company 's employes and close friends of the management . It was not to have been expected that they would vote other than they did . One thing is certain , and that is that they ca n't suppress the Frick report . absolutely condemnatory of the management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $100,000 to do that . " Mr. Ii:galls had a copy of the report in his hands , but refused to show its contents . Mr. Ingalls left early last evening for Cincinnati . When Gage E. Tarbeli came out of the board room he was walking with Jacob H. Srhift . Mr. Tarbeil smiled as if supremely happy . Somebody asked him whether he was , and he said : " Well . it 's enough to make a fellow smile to have Mr. Schiff stand by me the way he did this afternoon . He said that there was n't a spot or blemish of any character on my work in the society . " One Director who did not want his name used said : - A wonder ful revulsion of public sentiment has resulted from the discovery that the report of the Frick committee was made so as to force Mr. Hyde to sell his stock . This first move ' was followed up as soon as the report was read , with the second move in this financial drama by Harriman offering to buy Hyde 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hyde could be scared into realizing on his investment by passing the control of the Equitable over to Harriman and his Wall Street associates and the last condition of the Equitable would be wolse than the first . " When the Board of Directors saw the typical negro in the woodpile they pulled down the pile . refused to adopt the Frick report and Harriman . Frick et al . left the meeting defeated , leaving their official adieus behind them . " Senator Chauncey M. Depew , when seen at his home last night and asked about the meeting of the Equitable Directors , refused to be quoted about the proceedings other than to say : " This means peace . I /taming been working for peace for some time , and there will be peace . I never devoted myself to arranging fir peace that I did not suecee ( . " Mr. Frick was found at Sherry 's last night and was asked whether he thought it likely that a railroad fight between E. H. Harriman and George J. Gould was responsible for the rejection of the report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I do n't think it likely . " When asked if he thought that the Standard Oil interests were concerned in the matter he said : " I do n't know or care . " He said that there had been no meeting of the Frick committee during the evening and did not know when one would be held . OFFERS TO RAISE $5,000 .
