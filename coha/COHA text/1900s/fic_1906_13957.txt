TIME :  --  The present 8:30 a winter morning . PLACE :  --  The MACCHESNEY living room in a Nevada mining camp . SCENE :  --  Two-thirds of the wall at back R. is an oblique slant with two windows in it . In the remaining third , at L. back , is an outer door with a girl 's long coat hung L. of it : 2 doors in flat at L. lead into sleeping rooms and a door opposite at R. into the kitchen . The walls are covered with cheap , striped wall paper and a few inexpensive prints of dogs and horses , some of which are unframed , and 2 good paintings . The windows are hung with white curtains which were once good , and tied back with red ribbons . On the window sills are several pots of straggling red geraniums . A bird in a cage hanging in one window sings occasionally . The furniture is all black walnut , old-fashioned , heavy and once handsome , but now badly worn and scratched . The carpet is also a relic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dining table , covered with a cloth which shows a hole and several egg stains . On the table are the remains of a breakfast of coffee , ham and eggs . In the center is a tall glass dish of doughnuts . About the table are four dining chairs . At back between the windows is a book-case with writing desk . The desk is open and holds writing materials and a girl 's felt hat . The shelves are crowded with books and one glass door is badly cracked . Above the door at R. is a china cupboard filled with cheap china and glass and a little which is good . At lower R. corner against the wall , is a small table holding newspapers , old magazines , some dog-eared schoolbooks and a work-basket filled with socks to be darned . Several newspapers and a pair of cuffs are under the table and near it a chair with a boy 's coat on the back . A large arm-chair is R. C. , the seat of which is much sunken . Up L. is a large coal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door down L. is a sewing machine with a red cotton cover thrown over it . The general effect of the room is that of the remains of some old-fashioned elegance which have fallen at last into very poor surroundings . AT CURTAIN SONNIE MACCHESNEY is seated at the left end of the breakfast table finishing a plate of hot cakes in large mouthfuls . SONNIE is a sandy-haired , freckled faced boy of 13  --  a mixture of uncouth boyhood and inborn lovableness  --  slow , good-natured , and only ambitious to be comfortable . CLEM MACCHESNEY , a handsome boy of 19 reckless and clever , is just rising from the chair at R. of table , wiping his mouth with his napkin which he throws into the middle of table and turns away R. whistling , stopping at the open desk before window R. CLEM ( Attracted by a letter on the desk up R. ) Who 'd Rhy get a letter from yesterday ? p. 3 SONNIE ( At table L. his mouth full ) D'know . SONNIE ( At table L. his mouth full ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Never saw that fist before . ( He slips the letter out of the envelope ) SONNIE ( Speaking in his tumbler ) Stop sneakin ' Rhy 's letters . CLEM Dry up . ( He turns the letter to see the signature and goes to the window , standing looking out and whistling as MAGGIE enters from the kitchen R. MAGGIE is a large , raw-boned Irish woman of forty . Her brogue is very thick and her heart very big . She wears a calico dress  --  the skirt and waist of different patterns . One corner of the soiled check apron is tucked into her belt , her red arms are bare to the elbow , the neck of the waist turned in and her hair bristling . She strides in , holding a plate of steaming cakes . ) MAGGIE ( Going R. of table . ) Where 's Rhy ? SONNIE Up in the loft . MAGGIE Shure , what 's she doin ' up in the loft ? She did n't eat enough breakfast . p. 4 SONNIE Yes , she did . ( MAGGIE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Give ' em here . MAGGIE Ah  --  you rat hole  --  you . I could n't fill yees up , if I tried . ( MAGGIE puts the cakes on the table before SONNIE and begins clearing it noisily , while SONNIE , pulling the cakes before him , covers them with butter and syrup and proceeds to devour them ) Yees oughter be clearin ' out fer school ; yees 'll be late again . SONNIE Gi'me my books . MAGGIE I will not . ' Tai n't my business to be kapin ' yees books . Where are they ? Where did yees lave ' em ? ( MAGGIE storms about the room , looking for the books ) Look at this table ! ( Going to table down R. ) An ' me after cleanin ' it up twinty times yesterday . ( She picks the school books out of the work basket ) Look at that . Lord knows yees ates enough widout chewin ' up thim books . What do yees go to school fer ? SONNIE ' Cause Rhy makes me . CLEM He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a push ) Aw ! CLEM ( In chair R. C. ) Give us a paper , Maggie . p. 5 MAGGIE ( Getting a newspaper from table down R. ) Umph ! SONNIE Make a chocolate cake to-day , will you , Maggie ? MAGGIE ( Goes above CLEM , to table C. ) I will not . SONNIE Aw  --  why ? CLEM ( In arm-chair R. ) Aw , please , Maggie . You 're a darlin ' . MAGGIE Shure , Clem , you could charm the birds off the bushes if you wanted to . It 's a pity you do n't turn it to some account . ( She strides to the stove , banging doors and dampers and lifting the top to look in ) Yees kin jist march home after school an ' chop that kin'lin ' , Sonnie  --  and do n't fergit it . I 've been choppin ' it meself fer a week , an ' I wo n't do it wan more time . Do yees hear ? CLEM Oh , yes , you will . ( Making a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , scraping the plates and piling them together ) I will not that . CLEM Oh , yes you will . ( Making a cigarette ) You 'll do anything Rhy wants you to . MAGGIE Un ' I know you 'll do nothin ' she wants you to . You had a right to split all thim logs for the kitchen last week too , and Rhy askin ' yees to ivry minite in the day  --  poor darlin ' . p. 6 CLEM Oh , let her pay somebody to do it . She 's got money . MAGGIE ( Stooping to look at him in amazement , her hands on her hips ) Money ! The saints be praised ! Money ! Where did she get it ? ( Goes below table  --  R. of it ) CLEM Aw  --  come off . You know she 's got some money salted down . She could cough up a little once in a while if she wanted to . MAGGIE Wanted to ? Heaven help us ! Wanted to ? When she 'd give the clothes off her back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yees know as well as yee 's is sittin ' there that it 's all she can do to hold your souls and bodies together , and if she was n't sacrificin ' an ' givin ' up ivry thing in God 's world a girl can give up  --  she could n't do that . Money ! Ump ! If yees wants money why do n't yees make it . If yees was half the man what she is  --  yees  --  ( Goes back above table ) CLEM Dry up , Maggie . I 'm sick of it . I 'm sick of the whole blooming business . I 'd like to clear out . ( Rising from arm-chair , leaning against it ) MAGGIE Oh , you 're your father 's own son . He was a rollin ' stone  --  an ' divil a bit o ' moss he gathered . p. 7 CLEM Well , I wish he 'd rolled on a little further before he stuck in this hole . MAGGIE There 's nothin ' the matter wid the hole . It 's you as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards the kitchen with her hands full of dishes ) RHY ( Without door L. I. E. ) Maggie ! Maggie ! SONNIE ( Still eating ) She is calling you . MAGGIE I ai n't deaf . ( Starts to L. CLEM trips her with his foot ) What are you doing ? ( She puts the dishes back on the table and goes out lower L. ) CLEM ( Lighting a cigarette ) Somebody made a good haul night before last . SONNIE ( Reaching for a doughnut ) Who ? CLEM Hold-up on the L. T. branch . SONNIE ( Rising , takes old watch and string from his pocket ) Wha 'd they do ? CLEM ( Moving restlessly about R. C. ) Slick as a whistle . Only two fellows held up the whole train . p. 8 SONNIE Aw  --  they could n't . CLEM Could n't they ? Well , they did . Takes nerve  --  that 's all . Why I could do it all alone . SONNIE ( Laughing ) You 're big , you are ! CLEM Well , I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if a fellow just pulls his gun where nobody 's expectin ' it , he can have anything he wants . ( He throws the paper on the floor , rises and strides about heroically ) It 's about the quickest way to make money I know of . SONNIE Ho  --  ho ! About the quickest way to get strung up . CLEM Not if you 're smart . I can understand how a fellow 'd like to make just one haul and then clear out . Lord knows I 'd like to get out of this . I 'm so sick of waiting for somebody to buy that damned old gold mine of ours I 'd  --  I 'd give it away if I had my way . SONNIE ( Grinning  --  winding watch ) But you ai n't got your way . CLEM ( Up to window ) No , nobody has when Rhy 's around . RHY ( From off L. in a fresh , compelling young voice ) Do n't hit the door , Maggie . Look out  --  you 'll crack your elbow . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things back in his pocket ) Opens the door , somebody , hurry ! ( CLEM is at back window . He quickly raises it and throws cigarette out . SONNIE , who is C. , goes slowly to the door , stuffing the last bite of his doughnut ) Oh , do n't be all day in there boys ! p. 9 MAGGIE Move ! Ca n't yees ? ( SONNIE opens lower L. door slowly and MAGGIE walks in back- ward holding one end of a small trunk , which is very old and dusty  --  lock must be down stage ) RHY ( Holding other end ) Go on , Maggie . Put it over there . ( R. C. , sniffing the air ) Cigarettes ! I thonght you 'd sworn off , Clem . Go on , Maggie , further over  --  there . ( They put the trunk down R. C. at an angle between chair and table . RHY MACCHESNEY , a girl of twenty-five , is forceful and fearless as a young AMAZON , with the courage of belief in herself  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but freedom  --  the lovableness of a big nature and sunniness of an undying sense of humor . What she wears is very far from the fashion , but has charm and individuality and leaves her as free and unconscious of her strength and beauty as an animal ) Now , give me the keys , Clem . CLEM What keys ? RHY In the little drawer  --  the left one . ( Nodding to the desk R. She drops on her knees before the trunk and MAGGIE taking off her apron dusts the trunk with it , then tucks it under her left arm and takes a load of dishes into the kitchen . RHY puts finger in the lock ) Awfully rusty ! p. 10 CLEM ( From desk R. Holding up a bunch of keys ) These ? RHY Yes , toss ' em over . ( She holds out her hand and catches the keys like a boy as CLEM throws them ) Must be one of these . ( SONNIE is L. , of her ) CLEM ( R. of trunk ) What are you after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's . CLEM What for ? RHY I have n't got a rag to wear to Bixie 's dinner to-night . Maggie washed the old white one once more but the waist split up the back at last . Gee ! I believe we 'll have to knock it open . Nothing seems to do the business . ( She goes on trying the keys . Both boys have drawn near interested , and MAGGIE watches as she goes back and forth with the dishes ) The key must be in this bunch . I 've had it open lots of times . CLEM I do n't want to go . I have n't anything to wear . RHY You know you 'll be handsomer than anybody in your blue suit . Maggie 'll press the trowsers this afternoon . CLEM Who 's she going to have to dinner ? p. 11 RHY Why , just Mr. Trenholm and Louis Berresford , and Steve Townley and you and me . She 's feeding Trenholm because she wants him to buy her claim . CLEM Why do n't you get him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear . CLEM Well , it ought to be . RHY ( As the lock turns ) Here she comes . Gee ! ( She hurts her thumb trying to open the side clamp ) Here , push that down with your foot , Clem . Get over here and do the other one , Sonnie . Hurry , you 're so full of hot cakes you ca n't move . ( SONNIE goes to the L. CLEM R. and each pushes down a clamp with his foot ) That 's it ! ( SONNIE goes L. of her again . She raises the lid ) Sonnie , what time is it ? You 'll be late for school again if you do n't look out . Skip now . SONNIE I want to see the dress . RHY ( Sitting on L. corner of trunk . Undoing a small box which is wrapped in a great deal of yellow tissue paper ) I 'll let you see the pictures and then you 'll have to  --  Here  --  this is Dad . ( Taking out a daguerreotype which is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do n't drop it . And this is mother . ( Taking out a similar one . She lets SONNIE take the first one and holds the other herself , the boys looking over her shoulders and MAGGIE stopping back of them with the coffee pot ) We must n't keep them in the light but a minute  --  they 're daguerreotypes , you know , and the light fades them . When we get rich I 'm going to have them copied into miniatures painted you know . Was n't Dad good looking ! And was n't mother the lady though ! Look at her long white hands . And her dear soft hair  --  it 's like satin , is n't it ! p. 12 SONNIE ( Staring at the picture ) Is that a silk dress ? ( L. of trunk ) RHY Of course . See the dear little breast pin and the lace . Is n't she sweet and gentle and sort of fine , boys ? We do n't look much as if we belonged to her , do we . I wonder what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us now . MAGGIE ( At door R. crossing herself ) God rest her soul ! ( Exit R. ) RHY I wish you could remember her , boys . She was n't a bit  --  oh  --  not the least little bit like anybody you ever saw . Mrs. Bix is all right  --  she 's a brick  --  but she 's not the real thing like dad and mother . ( Taking both pictures ) It does n't hurt any of us to be poor . People can have loads of money , you know , or not a cent . That is n't it . It 's something inside of you that counts . And that 's what they left us  --  That 's what we 've got to remember , we fellows  --  and live up to . Sonnie , did you wash your ears this morning ? ( She reaches out suddenly for SONNIE 'S ear ) SONNIE ( Pulling away ) Ow ! Yes , I did . I got on a clean collar , too . RHY ( Laughing and wrapping the pictures ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? You 'll never be a gentleman of the old school like that , Clem . p. 13 CLEM Could if I had the chance . ( Working around to door L. 3 ) SONNIE What old school ? RHY Any old school . You make tracks for yours , now . You 'll have to run all the way . SONNIE Oh , I could n't get there , now . RHY Yes , you can . Run ! It will be good for you . You 've got egg all over your mouth . SONNIE ( Wiping his mouth on his sleeve . At a warning sign from RHY , uses napkin . Hanging back and holding onto chair L. of table ) They 'd rather you did n't come at all than to be late . RHY ( As she turns back to the trunk ) You need n't try that old game on me . Get your duds and march . ( SONNIE goes to table and puts doughnuts in his pockets ) Here , stop putting doughnuts in those pockets . I worked all day yesterday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  ( MAGGIE answers from off stage R. " Yes " )  --  Let 's have boiled ham for dinner so we can use the rest of that cabbage . Clem , I want you to go to the grocery store right away and get it . Hurry , Sonnie . What time is it , Maggie ? p. 14 SONNIE ( Who has taken his books and his overcoat from chair up R. , and is still looking for something ) Where 's my hat ? RHY It was under the table last night . ( SONNIE crawls under table from above . ) MAGGIE ( Looking through the door from kitchen ) Sure , it 's five minutes of nine now . RHY Now see here , boys , this wo n't do . No more late breakfasts . Maggie , let us have breakfast early to-morrow  --  early . MAGGIE Shure that will just suit me  --  I ca n't get nothin ' done this way . RHY ( She holds up the dress waist ) Jimminy ! That wo n't go far on me . ( SONNIE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sonnie , let me tie your tie . ( R. C. Going to him , she reties his tie , rubs his cheeks , smoothes his hair and puts his cap on , giving the top of his head a vigorous love pat  --  and kisses him ) There . Good-bye , Sonnie . Be a good boy and remember  --  two p 's in apple . Bye . SONNIE Bye . ( SONNIE hits CLEM with school books jokingly ) p. 15 CLEM ( Pushes SONNIE through door L. C. and SONNIE falls in snow ) Serves you right , fresh kid . ( Moving around to R. , standing above trunk and looking into it curiously ) What 's that ? ( Coming down stage and standing back of trunk R. C. ) RHY ( Going back to trunk ) What ? This ? ( Taking out a small box ) The fan . It matches the dress . ( Taking a small fan from a box ) Is n't it a darling ? CLEM That thing could n't give any wind . RHY What do you expect  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of  --  ( She fans mincingly ) And here are the shoes . Are n't they the cutest things you ever saw ? What 's this , I wonder ? ( Taking a small box from trunk  --  watch fob and seal in same ) Oh ! Yes  --  it 's father 's seal and fob . Do you want it , Clem ? CLEM ( Taking it L. of RHY ) I have n't got anything to put it on . RHY Now lift out the tray , so I can get at the skirt . ( CLEM helps her with the tray ) Put it on the table ! ( MAGGIE is just taking up the cloth , as CLEM puts the tray on the table . She carries the cloth to kitchen ) Oh , it 's prettier than I thought . Do n't I thank my lucky stars . Why , I 'd have to go to bed , if I had n't thought of this . ( She holds up the skirt of a quaint gown of shimmering old-fashioned silk ) You know the point is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchen door R. ) I say the point is , it 's the style . Bixie says that is just the kind of thing they are wearing in New York and that there 's a perfect craze about old things . p. 16 MAGGIE Ould is it ? You 're all right for style if that 's the craze ; look out it do n't fall to pieces on your back . RHY You get out , Maggie . I 'm going to be the belle of the ball in this . I 'll let out the band and push the fulness back a little and  --  you wait . I 'm not afraid . MAGGIE No , of man nor baste . ( Exit MAGGIE ) CLEM ( Throwing himself into chair R. , feet on top of trunk ) You make me tired , Rhy . Why do n't you buy yourself a decent dress ? RHY That 's a sensible question . CLEM You bet it 's sensible . I mean it . Why do n't you ? RHY What are you talking about ? You know I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You must take me for a chump . How do we live ? RHY ( Calling ) Maggie , put two irons on , please . ( To CLEM ) How do we live ? It is a mystery . CLEM Aw , now come down to figures . How much have we got ? RHY You know as well as I do . CLEM Maybe I do and maybe I do n't . ( Pushing trunk top down with his feet ) What do you say it is ? p. 17 RHY ( Getting her work basket from table down R. ) We 've got the interest on $4,000 to live on , and we 've got this shell of a house to live in , and we 've got that little mining property to live for  --  and that 's all . ( Returns and sits R. of table ) CLEM Well , it 's a very funny thing to me why something ca n't be done . Other people buy and sell . Why ca n't we ? Look at Berresford . He 's made a pot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bixs . They hustle . Why did n't you get the drop on Trenholm before they spotted him and sell to him ? RHY ( Threading a needle at the dining table ) Bixie 's selling at a great sacrifice because she wo n't stay here any longer and wait . They want to go back to New York and they 've got to have ready cash . CLEM Well , I 'd like to have some ready cash , too . RHY ( Beginning to rip the skirt band ) Yes , I suppose you would , so would I. But now that we 've pulled through so far I 'm not going to sell until we can get a really big price . Steve says the country is beginning to open up rapidly  --  and he 's sure we 'll get a chance pretty soon . CLEM You believe anything Steve Townley tells you . What does he know about it ? p. 18 RHY He knows everything about it . ( MAGGIE re-enters with the table cloth ) Bring the machine out , please , Maggie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of chair at L. end of table , then whisks the cover off machine . ) MAGGIE Where will yees have it ? RHY Get up , Clem , and pull that chair away , please . ( CLEM rises and reluctantly pulls the chair to R. ) Help Maggie , Clem . ( CLEM helps MAGGIE to carry the machine up to R. window . ) MAGGIE Shure , whin am I goin ' to be cleanin ' up this room ? RHY Not to-day , Maggie . Just give it a dash with the carpet sweeper . MAGGIE ( Going into kitchen ) How about the wood splittin ' ? RHY Yes , Clem . When are you going to get at that wood ? Does n't the spirit move you this morning ? CLEM ( Beating a tattoo on the window up R. ) No , it do n't  --  and let me tell you I 'm gettin ' damned tired of splittin ' wood . RHY When did you split any ? p. 19 CLEM Well , I 've split about all I 'm going to . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I 'm going to have it . I 'm going to pull out my share and do something with it . I do n't propose to hang around here till I dry up . I 'm going to get out and do something . RHY Why do n't you do what you might right here ? You 've never stuck at anything long enough . Steve gave you a good chance at that last thing . CLEM That 's not my kind . I 'm going to clear out of this blasted place . There 's not a damned thing here but hope . RHY That 's a good deal . CLEM ( Sitting on L. upper corner of table ) Well , I have n't got any . I 'll leave that to you , and I 'll take some money and find something else  --  some place else . RHY That 's all very well , but where are you going to get the money ? CLEM Now do n't begin that old tune . RHY What 's the matter with you , this morning , Clem ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is n't necessary to punctuate your conversation with quite so many damns . CLEM Well , some of everything is mine , is n't it ? p. 20 RHY Certainly . Everything belongs to the three of us , and we 're all going to hang together till good luck comes . CLEM Aw ! Luck ! I 'm sick of it . It never has come  --  it never will . What 's mine 's mine , and I want it . You can do as you please with yours . That 's straight enough , is n't it ? Give me my share and I 'll take it and make something of it . RHY My dear boy , you do n't know what you 're talking about . CLEM Oh , yes , I do . I 'm goin ' to Salt Lake and do something . I want my money . Do you understand ? RHY I understand that you 're saying very foolish things , and saying them very impertinently . I do n't like it . Now keep still and go and  --  CLEM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ square deal . You give me some money and I 'll leave you my share of the claim . RHY There is n't any money  --  but that little dab of principal that we must n't touch . CLEM Well , give me $1,500 of that  --  and I 'll leave you my share of the mine . That 's fair . RHY You 're crazy . CLEM ( Rising to L. of table threateningly ) Oh , no , I 'm not . I 'm talking business . I mean it , and I 'm not going to be fooled with any longer . ( He bangs his fist on the table ) p. 21 RHY Clem  --  how dare you speak to me like that ? ( She looks at him steadily until his eyes fall ) CLEM Are you going to give me the money ? RHY Do n't be silly . Of course I 'm not . ( Puts down sewing , rises , goes to CLEM L. C. ) Get that nonsense out of your head and be your own dear self . ( Throwing her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) I know how hard it is , old man . Heaven knows I do . But it will all come right . I know it 's hard to grind along in this old rut . But you 're young and it wo n't hurt you and by the time you really need your money you 'll have some . I 'm sure of it . Why , do n't think I do n't know what you 'd like to do . I want you to have your fling too . I want you to be all that I know you can be . But the only way in the world to get there is for the three of us to stick together and hang on to that little claim  --  and some day  --  we 'll strike it . Just trust me , dear , and  --  CLEM ( Swinging away from her and walking restlessly to L. ) You do n't trust me  --  that 's just it . You think I do n't know anything . You 've pulled the wool over my eyes long enough , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand it  --  I want my money  --  ( The old cracked bell on the outer door rings , and MRS . BIX opens the door and puts her head in . MRS . TWEED BIX is a New York woman , clever , practical and ambitious . She wears a long coat , a small becoming hat which is a little shabby and carries a large empty market basket . ) MRS . BIX Anybody at home ? ( Only her head seen ) RHY Hello , Bixie . Come in quick and shut the door . MRS . BIX ( Coming in and knocking her feet together as she bangs the door shut ) Morning  --  morning . Is n't this a nipper ? Hello , Clem ? ( Comes down L. and to RHY R. C. Places her basket on table while passing it ) CLEM ( Not looking at MRS . BIX ) Hello . Remember what I said . I want my money and if you do n't give it to me , I 'll get it some other way . I can sell  --  if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( He goes out R. slamming the kitchen door and RHY and MRS . BIX stare at the door for a moment  --  outside door slam heard ) MRS . BIX ( Looking at RHY in amazement , while taking off her coat ) What 's the matter with the boy ? p. 23 RHY He 's never spoken to me like that before in his life . He 's getting too big for me . That 's what the matter . He needs a man ! ( Places MRS . BIX 'S coat over chair R. of table ) MRS . BIX ( Sits R. C. to remove her arctics ) He needs a spanking , you mean . RHY I suppose I am womanish  --  but I try not to be  --  It must be my fault . MRS . BIX ( Going to dining table ) Nonsense ! You 're too patient with him . ( Seeing the dress on the table ) My stars ! You do n't mean to tell me you 've got a  --  RHY ( Turning quickly to MRS . BIX . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spreading it over the dress quickly ) No , I have n't . Do n't look at it . It 's a surprise for you to-night . MRS . BIX ( Taking off her gloves ) Is n't that great ! I 'm awfully glad , dearie . Would n't I love to see you in a New York gown . What 's the matter , dearie ? RHY Nothing , only  --  Clem  --  MRS . BIX Oh , tut  --  tut . Put it out of your head . ( Sits R. of table ) He 's just reached the smarty age  --  that 's all . p. 24 RHY ( Sits L. of table ) But he seems to want money so terribly . He talks about it all the time . MRS . BIX I do n't see anything at all strange about that . Is there a soul of us out here who would n't sell his eye teeth if he got his price ? RHY ( Laughing ) Oh , it is n't so bad as that . MRS . BIX Oh , yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing to this strain out here . Why , Rhy , when I can get back there and live in one room  --  and know that the rent is paid , I shall fold my hands and stop . I 'm so tired of this hope to-day  --  and despair to-morrow . How I hate , hate , hate this wretched little hole ! RHY I love it . MRS . BIX Yes , I daresay . A woman never hates a place where a man is in love with her  --  let alone two who are ready to cut each other 's throats because of her . Besides , you 're young enough to feel the fascination of the gamble without the sickening  --  oh , what 's the use  --  ( She checks herself quickly with a sigh and goes on brightly ) Well  --  I 've come to borrow everything you 've got . I 'm goin ' to give Lorimer Trenholm such a dinner to-night that he wo n't know his heart from his stomach . p. 25 RHY ( Rising , going R. , opening the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door ) All right , I 'll give you my dozen Dresden plates , seven cups and three and a half saucers , and if that does n't fetch him  --  What happened yesterday ? Do you think he 's going to buy ? MRS . BIX ( Has risen , and is L. of RHY to take plates ) Yesterday was a good day . We all went out to the mine and I took Papa Trenholm under my wing and I flatter myself I gained a point or two . RHY ( Taking down the twelve plates ) I bet you did . Of course , he 'll buy . Louis Berresford says you 're cleverer than most men , and that you stand a very good chance . MRS . BIX ( Examining the plates ) Have you got twelve of these ? RHY Yes , twelve and there 's not a nick in them . I never let the boys touch them . It 's the last I 've got of mother 's china . MRS .

Wraps the china in the paper ) I 'm going across the street and ask Louis Berresford to let me have his case of silver . Does it look as if he were in the house ? ( RHY , meanwhile , busies herself bringing cups and saucers to table , and then gets other newspapers from down R. ) p. 26 RHY ( Going to window up R. ) His horse is n't in front . I do n't believe he 's at home . MRS . BIX Berresford 's been awfully good to me . Helped me a lot with Trenholm . And glasses ? Have you got a decent glass ? I need them more than anything . RHY ( Turning to the shelves , of cupboard R. ) Only one champagne glass . ( Taking down a delicate one and bringing it to table C. ) Is n't it pretty ? MRS . BIX ( Taking the glass ) Oh , is n't that a beauty . Your people must have had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RHY They did have lots of beautiful things but we moved so often and things were sold so much that there was n't much left by the time we got here . MRS . BIX How long have you been here , anyway , Rhy ? RHY ( They are both busily wrapping dishes ) Um  --  eight years . Mother died the year before we came  --  and father the year after . MRS . BIX And you 've pulled along all this time with those boys . By Jove , I think I 'm clever  --  but I could n't have done that . p. 27 RHY And blessed old Maggie ! I could n't have done it without her . MRS . BIX And you 're going to stick it out ? RHY You bet we are ! MRS . BIX Bosh ! Why do n't you marry Louis Berresford and be done with it ? If it 's Steve Townley that makes you wait , you 're making a great mistake  --  a very great mistake ? RHY Do you want that ? ( Pointing to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you mean . Yes , I 'll take it . It looks well and I can put something in it , if it 's only a pickle . Do n't think I 'm interfering or curious . Rhy  --  I 'd like to help you  --  to say the right thing to you  --  you 're so alone . RHY I know  --  I know what you mean . But you do n't understand . MRS . BIX I understand that you 're throwing away the chance of a lifetime , if you let Berresford go . Great goodness , what do you expect ? Good family  --  college man  --  loads of money . He 's the sort that knows how to treat a woman . Everything he does is always in such awfully good taste  --  so fastidious . Look at the stunning room he 's built on to that little old house across the street . How many men would take pains and troubled to have anything artistic out in this God-forsaken hole . p. 28 RHY Oh , it 's easy enough to be fastidious , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so wonderful about that room over there . Anybody could have done it with money . MRS . BIX That 's just what I say  --  money . RHY Steve could have made a room much more artistic . MRS . BIX Oh , Steve  --  Steve  --  Steve ! Why , my dear girl , Berresford 's a man of the world . He has social position in New York . RHY Steve had social position in Kansas City . MRS . BIX Oh , Lord ! Rhy , you 're hopeless when it comes to the things that count . RHY I know  --  I know . I 've got some dandy napkins , if you want them . MRS . BIX Oh ! Dinner size ? RHY Perfect whoppers ! They 're in this trunk I think . We never use them . ( She kneels before the trunk again ) MRS . BIX ( Following to L. of RHY . Moves chair L. of table below corner of it as she passes ) You 're an angel ! RHY Yes , here they are . ( Napkins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dusty . p. 29 MRS . BIX Oh , it 's good to get my hands on some decent linen once more . Of course , if Steve had money too , I can easily understand how you might hesitate . Steve 's a dear . I 'm awfully fond of him , but as it is , what can the poor fellow offer you ? I 'm only afraid that you 'll go on flirting with him until there 's a row and you 'll lose Berresford . Tweed says he does n't see how those men have escaped a fight so far  --  they hate each other so , and there 's absolutely no reason in the world for it but you . ( Goes back to table and puts napkins in basket ) RHY Have I got anything else you could use ? MRS . BIX No , this will set me up . I must skip now . ( Crosses down R. to put on arctics ) RHY ( Holding her coat for MRS . BIX ) Oh , I 'll lend Maggie to you . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has to . MRS . BIX ( Rising to put on coat R. of RHY ) That will be great . I 'll have her serve the coffee in the drawing-room after dinner . Do you s'pose she could do that ? RHY Of course she could , if you tell her how . MRS . BIX It 's more than " mine Frieda " could do . Has Maggie got a black dress ? p. 30 RHY No . MRS . BIX She can wear one of mine . RHY Oh , she could n't get into it . MRS . BIX I 'll spread the apron over the places that do n't meet . RHY ( Laughing ) Oh , Bixie ! MRS . BIX It 's going to be a really civilized dinner , I tell you . ( Goes C. to get gloves on table ) I 've told Steve and Berresford they have to wear their evening clothes . I do n't want Trenholm to think we 're heathen . Of course , Tweed will be in his poor old passee things . You could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a howling wilderness . He says it 's the last thing he has to remind him that he was once an English gentleman . ( Goes around L. of table for basket ) RHY ( Above table her hand on basket ) You ca n't carry the basket . I 'll send Clem over with it . Clem  --  Clem ! Maggie ! MRS . BIX Oh , never mind . Do n't bother . ( Lifting the basket ) This is n't heavy . MAGGIE ( Opening the kitchen door as she wipes a pitcher ) What 'll yees have ? p. 31 MRS . BIX Good-morning , Maggie . MAGGIE Good-morning , Mrs. Bix . How are you ? MRS . BIX Flourishing , thank you . RHY Where 's Clem , Maggie ? MAGGIE Shure , I do n't know . He went out . I ai n't seen ' im . RHY Well , Maggie , you take this basket over for Mrs. Bix . MRS . BIX Oh  --  no ! MAGGIE ( Disappearing into the kitchen ) Shure ! MRS . BIX Why she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd rather you would n't . RHY Oh , I would n't let you for anything . You might meet Mr. Trenholm and lose your dignity . ( They both talk at once . MRS . BIX pulling the basket toward the door and RHY pullling it away from her . ) MAGGIE ( Re-entering with an old red shawl over her head ) Here  --  here , give me that basket . ( Slipping on the ice outside door ) Holy Moses ! It 's as slippery as glass ! Mind yees do n't break your neck . ( The three women talk at once , all laughing ) p. 32 MRS . BIX Heard above the others , R. of door with RHY ) Thank you a thousand times , dear . Come early and look your prettiest , and do n't forget what I told you about Berresford . MAGGIE Oh !

Send over two or three , will you ? RHY All right  --  good-bye . MRS . BIX You 're an old darling . Good-bye . RHY ( Closing the door again . Is chilled ) Booh ! ( Stands thoughtfully by stove ) That 's a joke on Bixie . Louis Berresford never asked me to marry him , but I 'm not going to tell her that . ( She taps the handle of the stove door with her thimble ) I wonder if he ever will . Oh , how I 'd love to refuse him . He cares , he does  --  he does , more than he wants to . ( CLEM , coming from R. , passes window , enters L. , C. from outer door with newspaper. ) p. 33 CLEM ( Leaving the door open , and throwing the paper on the table ) Here 's the paper . RHY ( Reaching for it ) Were n't there any letters ? CLEM No . Steve Townley 's comin ' in ! RHY Oh , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into her room ) Do n't you want to go to the grocery now , Clem . CLEM ( CLEM closes door L. C. ) I will , when I get ready . ( Exits door L. I E. quietly ) ( STEVE TOWNLEY crosses by window . Rings bell . Is heard scraping snow from his boots . RHY re-enters putting a pin in her hair . She shows her excited happiness as she hesitates before opening the door , then opens it wide and stands behind it , at R. STEVE TOWNLEY enters , excited and radiant . He is a tall strong fellow about thirty , clean shaven and well bronzed , with the freedom of fresh air of the west , the unmistable stamp of the gentleman , and a half shy boyishness . His clothes show hard wear and are splashed with mud . A miner 's candle thrust in one bootleg . ) STEVE ( Looking about the room quickly and pulling the door shut ) Rhy ! ( He throws his hat onto the dining table and draws her to him impulsively ) Rhy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tightly and she looks up at him , wistful , unbelieving , dazed . Shaking her a little ) It 's true . It 's true . I 've struck it . p. 34 RHY I do n't believe it . STEVE I do n't either , but it 's true . It 's the real thing . ( He takes from his pocket a small piece of quartz , their hands tremble as they touch it . They move quickly to window R. for light ) Look , see that ? It 's there . That 's it . Oh , God , Rhy , do you know what it means ? ( He catches her in his arms but she frees herself quickly ) You know what it means to me . It is n't the gold  --  it 's  --  RHY Tell me about it . Sit down . Begin at the beginning . I ca n't believe it . STEVE ( Sitting ) Well  --  RHY ( Sits on trunk , facing him ) Go on  --  go on . STEVE ( Sitting again ) Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thing . Always thought I 'd find it . Yesterday I struck an old trail I 'd never seen before and decided to follow it up . I turned a sudden twist and saw an old head frame half way up the hill and I knew that meant an abandoned claim . I got off my horse , climbed up , found the shaft  --  a black , ugly looking hole  --  there was the end of an old rotten ladder there in the shaft . I dropped some stones in  --  the hole did n't seem very deep  --  found my candle would burn , so started down . p. 35 RHY Oh  --  how could you ? That was terribly dangerous . STEVE I had to . The ladder held out pretty well for about thirty feet and then something happened and the next thing I knew I had landed  --  RHY Oh ! You fell ! STEVE Did n't matter . I got there all the quicker . RHY But you were hurt . STEVE Not a scratch . RHY Yes , you were . Your hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened , and there 's a cut there by your hair . Tell me . What was it ? STEVE Nothing . Nothing . I got a knock and s'pose I lay there a while . When I had sense enough to light my candle again I saw that this hole was merely a short shaft with a drift leading away from it straight across the hill . I stumbled along further in and began to see that it was nothing more than an old prospect some poor discouraged devil had given up long ago . Then I knocked off some pieces of quartz , and then  --  well  --  I got out again some way  --  sat on the ground and cracked the stuff I 'd brought up and there it was . I never saw anything in my life so beautiful as the stuff in that quartz , except your eyes , now . Rhy  --  I  --  RHY ( Trying to hide her face ) Let me see it again . Let me see . ( She takes the pieces of quartz and goes to the window . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't it glorious ! Oh , you wonderful , beautiful stuff ! Go on , what did you do then ? p. 36 STEVE Staked my claim  --  right away . This morning rushed into the land office , looked up the whole business , found I could have it , filed my claim , and now I 've got it safe and straight . It 's only low grade  --  nothing like yours , but it 's all right . RHY Of course , it is . If it had been rich the first man would never have given it up , and you would n't have got it . Is n't it great ? Poor fellow , I wonder who he was . ( Sits R. of table ) STEVE Lord knows ! ( Sits L. They both laugh in deep happiness ) RHY And you found it . It 's too good to be true . You ! Dreams do come true sometimes , do n't they ? I should think you 'd be crazy . I could scream and yell . Is n't this a funny old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it ? Somebody else , full of hope , took his chances and did the work , and then gave it up , discouraged , heart sick , maybe it was a tragedy to him . And years afterward you stumble across it and find there is value in it after all , because we know better how to do things nowadays . STEVE Yes , that 's the way it goes . RHY ( R. of table ) There 's something awfully pathetic about it to me . My father believed so absolutely in his claim . That was almost the last thing he said to me . " Just hold on to it , daughter . No matter what comes hold on to it , and some day it will make a fortune for the three of you . He named it  --  you  --  know  --  " The Three of Us . " So I 've just kept going on that hope . Some people have tried to get it away from me . Most people laugh at us  --  and then you came , and believed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . p. 37 STEVE ( L. of table ) He was right . If I know anything he was right , and the day 's not far off when you 'll get your chance . RHY Steve , is n't it funny , that it should be you  --  you  --  you who found this old claim ? Oh , I 'm glad ! I 'm glad ! ( Rises , goes R. , laughing  --  sits R. C. They both are in an ecstacy of happiness ) STEVE So am I. Rhy ! I have n't told you the point to the whole thing . RHY ( Rises quickly , back to chair R. of table ) Oh  --  what ? what else ? STEVE Coming back I ran into Bixie 's claim . Did n't know I was any pleace near it  --  this old trail had twisted me so . And found that my claim lies side by side with it , so that the same vein runs through both . RHY Heavens , how exciting ! Well , well ? STEVE Well , this means that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of , and makes her mine worth three times the money she 's offering it for . RHY Think of it ! STEVE Now , Bixie 's trying to sell to Trenholm , but she has n't got the ghost of a chance . Berresford has thrown Trenholm off the scent . p. 38 RHY What ? Why Louis Berresford  --  tells Bixie she has  --  a good chance . STEVE He 's jollying her . That 's his game . RHY Why , what do you mean ? STEVE He 's always had his eyes on Bixie 's claim himself  --  thinks he 'll get it cheap some day , after she has had a few more disappointments ; but if he knew what I have just found out , he 'd buy her out in two hours , and I want Trenholm to buy Bixie 's mine . RHY Trenholm ? STEVE Yes ,  --  he 's the best man we 've ever had here , represents the biggest kind of a syndicate ; he 's over in Sihene to-day , and if I hike over the hill , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think he 'll buy Bixie 's . Then I 'll give him a share in my claim if he 'll put up the money to work that when he opens Bixie 's . See ? And I 'm pretty sure he 'll listen to my proposition . Trenholm 's the man , but he 's got to be handled . RHY Bixie thinks she can do it . That 's what the dinner 's for to-night . STEVE Bixie 's a trump  --  but it takes more than one of her dinners to get Trenholm . RHY Are you going to tell her about her claim ? p. 39 STEVE Of course , but not till I land Trenholm . I 'll get a bigger price for Bixie than she 's looking for , but she must n't know yet . Not a soul must know . RHY ( Suddenly  --  quietly ) Sh ! Listen ! STEVE What is it ? ( RHY shakes her head at STEVE , and goes quickly and carefully to door L. Listens . STEVE rises , moves C. , watching her wonderingly ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ L. I , looks off and up calling ) Clem ! ( A pause ) I was mistaken . ( Closes door , moves back to STEVE ) Maggie 's gone too . STEVE We ca n't be too careful . I do n't need to caution you . You understand how terribly important the new value of Bixie 's claim is , and the  --  RHY ( Moving R. of STEVE ) Of course , of course , I understand . STEVE ( Catching her R. arm as she passes him ) Oh , Rhy , you know it is n't the money I care about  --  I do n't want it without you . RHY Oh  --  STEVE ( Holding her , taking her in his arms ) Rhy , listen , I love you , you 've always known it , but I could n't say it without a cent . I 've got something to fight with now . ( The door is heard slamming in the kitchen and MAGGIE 'S voice singing cheerfully in a very Irish song ) p. 40 RHY ( Going quickly below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ careful ! STEVE ( Snatching her hand ) Rhy  --  tell me : Have I got any show ? You have n't been fooling me , have you ? ( Catching her in his arms and speaking in desperate whispers ) You 've got to marry me . I wo n't let anybody else have you . RHY ( Trying to get away ) Do n't  --  do n't , there 's Maggie . STEVE I must go  --  I wo n't see you till to-night , Have n't I got a chance ? It is n't Berresford , is it ? ( RHY shakes her head , struggling ) I 'm going to fight for you and I 'm going to have you . Rhy , look at me  --  please , just once  --  let me see your eyes  --  please . RHY Oh , do n't  --  Maggie will come in , I  --  STEVE It is n't Berresford ? RHY No  --  no . STEVE Then by God , I 'm not afraid of anything . RHY Please  --  please . STEVE Kiss me and I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wo n't see you till to-to-night . I 'll be gone all day . Good-bye . ( Goes up to door ) Sweetheart . ( Exits L. C. to R. and passes by window R. ) ( MAGGIE 'S song has gone on lustily . She now comes in from the kitchen with the carpet sweeper and bucket of ashes. ) p. 41 MAGGIE I 'm back . ( Opens door L. C. and scatters ashes on door step ) What 's the matter ? Is your head achin ' ? Shure , I know yees did n't eat enough breakfast . RHY ( Springing up ) I 'm going for a little walk , Maggie . I 'll be all right when I get back . MAGGIE But wo n't yees ate somethin ' ? Just a cup of coffee ? RHY No  --  no . ( She snatches her hat from the hooks L. of door , pinning it on recklessly , thrusts her arms into the coat MAGGIE gets from the door , puts on woolen gloves which she takes from the pockets ) Do n't touch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a jiffy . ( She rushes out door L. C. ) MAGGIE ( Continues to sweep and exits R. , singing all the time . She goes into the kitchen and CLEM enters stealthily from L. lower door . He still wears his cap and goes to the outer door , slamming it as if he had just come in as MAGGIE re-enters from the kitchen with a bucket of coal ) Sure , are you just comin ' in ? Rhy was after wantin ' yees . ( MAGGIE goes on to put the coal in ) CLEM What did she want ? p. 42 MAGGIE To fetch a basket wid Mrs. Bix . CLEM I 've got something else to do . MAGGIE Maybe yees think I ai n't . Shure , it ud be better fer yees than hanging around the streets learnin ' things that ai n't fit fer decent ears . ( Door bell is heard , and CLEM starts guiltily towards the kitchen but stops as MAGGIE opens the door L. C. and LOUIS BERRESFORD is seen . BERRESFORD is a tall , dark , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinction of personality . Extremely well dressed in riding clothes . ) BERRESFORD Good-morning , Maggie . Is Miss McChesney at home ? ( He steps into the room with a careless graciousness ) MAGGIE Not just this minute , sir . But she soon will be . BERRESFORD How are you , Clem ? Do you mind if I wait ? MAGGIE Have a chair , sir . ( MAGGIE pushes the arm-chair R. forward ) This ai n't much on looks , but it 's good settin ' . BERRESFORD ( Smiling slowly ) Thank you very much , I 'm sure . ( MAGGIE goes into the kitchen . BERRESFORD stopping by window and looking up the street ) Did you say , Rhy went out with Townley ? p. 43 CLEM No , I did n't . ( Moving restlessly up and down L. C. ) BERRESFORD Got a grouch  --  what 's the matter ? CLEM Aw  --  I 'm sick of this whole proposition . I want to get out . BERRESFORD ( Coming down and sitting R. C. ) Why do n't you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BERRESFORD Easy enough to do  --  if you 've got the sand . CLEM Sand ? Money you mean . What can you do without money ? BERRESFORD Well  --  make a little . That 's the first move . CLEM ( L. ) How can you make any in this hole ? BERRESFORD What do you want with money ? CLEM I 'm no fool . I could do just what you 've done if I had a chance . BERRESFORD What have I done ? CLEM You do n't have to be so damned smart to buy old claims cheap , and start ' em off  --  if you 've got the money . I know a thing or two . ( Moves to BERRESFORD then R. above him to listen a second at door R. ) I know something you 'd give your ears to know . p. 44 BERRESFORD My ears would bring a good price . CLEM So would this , but I 'm not going to talk till I get my price . BERRESFORD Money would make you talk , then ? CLEM You think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to miss a big thing  --  and pretty quick , too , unless you 're on . BERRESFORD You 're on , are you ? CLEM Oh , you need n't laugh  --  I 'm not talking yet . BERRESFORD Well what could you talk about ? Give me a tip . CLEM You do n't expect me to give up the information for my health , do you ? BERRESFORD Not exactly . CLEM Well , of course , if you 're afraid of your money . BERRESFORD I would n't worry about that ; but a man 's got to know he wants the information before he puts up . And I may not be so interested as you think . CLEM ( Crosses to C. back of trunk , one foot on it ) Oh , you 'd be interested enough . You 're it . BERRESFORD ( Walking away ) I think not . I 'm afraid you 're on the wrong track , boy . p. 45 CLEM Oh , no , I 'm not . I happen to know that Townley and Trenholm have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that gets in first . BERRESFORD ( Quickly arrested , but not letting CLEM see his interest ) Townley and Trenholm ? Oh , no . CLEM Oh , yes ! BERRESFORD That could n't be . Trenholm 's buying and Townley has n't anything to sell . CLEM Has n't he ? That 's what you do n't know , you see . There 's where Bixie comes in . BERRESFORD Bixie ? CLEM Yes , Bixie . BERRESFORD ( Checking his surprise . Unconsciously looks at and handles fob hanging from CLEM 'S coat pocket ) What does that clever sister of yours think of this ? CLEM ( CLEM tucks fob in pocket , not hiding it ; a half unconscious action ) This is my own deal . I 'm wise to this and I know what I 'm doing . BERRESFORD She 's a pretty shrewd girl , Clem . Better get her advice before you go in . CLEM Now , look here , no apron strings for mine . What do you take me for ? This is strictly my own business . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I 'm going to make something out of it on my own hook . p. 46 BERRESFORD I 'd hate to see you do anything you might be sorry for . CLEM Rot ! ( Crosses L. C. ) You 'll be the sorry one , if you do n't look out ! BERRESFORD Rhy does n't seem to be coming . Suppose you come across the street and we 'll talk this thing over . I may be able to advise you . CLEM I do n't want advice , I want money . I can manipulate my own business , thank you . BERRESFORD ( Moves up R. ) Well , come across and we 'll talk about this wonderful business ability of yours . ( He goes to the door and holds it open ) We 'll talk it over , eh ? ( CLEM sullen , but irresistibly tempted , goes to the door and out ) Oh , Maggie ! I say , Maggie ! ( MAGGIE appears at the kitchen door ) Will you just say to Miss Mc-Chesney , if you please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to-day , but they may be late on account of the storm . MAGGIE Thank you , sir . ( BERRESFORD smiles slowly and graciously and goes out closing the door MAGGIE sings as she pours a bucket of coal into the stove ) CURTAIN . ( SECOND CURTAIN . RHY enters from outer door and hangs hat and jacket up hanger L. of door and comes down stage . MAGGIE still putting coal in stove. ) @x SCENE :  --  MRS . BIX 'S living room . There are two windows at back , two at right , and a door in " 2 " at left . A fireplace C. back between the window , is crudely built of logs and stone , both in the rough natural state . There are large logs burning on andirons . Other logs on the floor at L. On the high mantel are a few INDIAN ornaments , baskets , earthen jars , etc. , in bright colors . On the walls are INDIAN blankets , and skins  --  guns  --  bows and arrows and tomahawks , etc . There is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abundance of music upon it  --  a large couch down left covered with INDIAN blankets and heaped with pillows . There is a table in upper left corner , holding writing materials and books , a smaller couch , at an angle below the fireplace at the left , with an INDIAN blanket over it . A table and armchair below fireplace at R. A chair before the window at R. back . An arm-chair L. C. , with blanket thrown over it . In upper R. corner a crude cabinet holding various specimens of ore  --  gold , silver , copper , etc . A few strips of carpet and skins on the floor . The furniture is made of rustic logs . On the piano and the two tables are lamps with simple effective shades . The whole has a " home made , " but most comfortable and inviting air . TIME :  --  The evening of the same day . DISCOVERED :  --  At curtain the door into dining room is open and voices and laughter are heard . MRS . BIX comes through the door quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the shoulders . MRS . BIX ( As she enters with chair from L. placing it R. of table R. ) If Tweed 's going to tell that story , it 's time for us to get out . Come on , Rhy . ( There is laughter from the R. , and after a moment RHY enters . She wears the quaint silk gown which she took from the trunk in ACT I , with broach , fan , etc . Her shoulders and arms are bare , and she looks like an old picture . There is an excited happiness about her . MRS . BIX waits C. , admiring RHY as she enters . Laughter heard again outside door L. RHY also has a chair from ACT I. and places it near couch ) Rhy  --  it 's stunning ! Simply Stunning ! Are n't clothes wonderful ? You certainly are to the manner born to-night . Trenholm stared at you all through dinner . How do I look anyhow ? ( She turns and walks about to R. ) p. 48 RHY Like a lady . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . See that ? I have n't worn a low gown for so long that I 'm catching my death of cold . I cut it down this morning . It was the only thing I could do to dress up . ( Advance C. ) Do the raw edges show ? ( Going to RHY to be inspected ) RHY Not a bit . MRS . BIX The sleeves were long , but I took them out , and took this lace from something else . RHY You 're a genius , Bixie , and your dinner  --  um , but it was good . It could n't have been any better in New York , could it ? MRS . BIX It was n't bad , was it ? RHY It was a miracle . You 're the best promoter in camp . Mr. Treholm ought to buy your gold mine after eating you out of house and home . Oh , Bixie  --  ( Throwing her arms about MRS . BIX ) Are n't you happy ? Do n't you feel that it 's going to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I hope  --  hope  --  hope  --  MRS . BIX Hope what ? RHY Oh , everything . ( She moves about restlessly at L. C. ) Money does mean something , does n't it ? p. 49 MRS . BIX Oh , ho ! you 're beginning to find it out , are you ? ( Crosses and advances ) Rhy  --  ( She goes quickly to RHY , putting her hands on RHY 'S shoulders ) Something has happened to you . I never saw you so happy as you are to-night . Have you accepted Berresford ? That 's a luscious blush . Oh , I 'm so glad . RHY ( Laughing happily and turning away ) You imagine things . It 's only  --  it 's these silk stockings . ( Lifting her skirts and looking down at her feet ) They make me feel  --  Oh  --  I love to wiggle my toes in ' em . ( They both laugh ) MRS . BIX Does n't it make a difference , though ? RHY Difference ? Why , I can walk better  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to R. ) and sit better  --  ( Sitting in chair R. C. , with a very grand air , fanning herself affectedly ) and breathe better . ( She spreads out the voluminous folds of her gown and touches the lace caressingly ) I love it ! I feel as if I had on something that belonged to me at last , and this nice silkie  --  silkie feeling goes right through my skin . ( Hugging her bodice ) p. 50 MRS . BIX Of course it does . You were meant for it .

RHY Oh , what ? What  --  MRS . BIX I ca n't tell you now . RHY Oh , please  --  please . MRS . BIX No , not now . I 'm too excited , but I 'll skip over the first thing in the morning and  --  Sh ! ( MRS . BIX turns sharply to the fire and takes up the poker , as BERRESFORD enters from dining room ) p. 51 BERRESFORD I 'd much rather be in here . MRS . BIX ( Going down to table R. C.  --  placing chair aright ) Come on in . One man is better than nothing . BERRESFORD And two women are better than all the men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her back to RHY ) But one woman is best of all . ( Goes to piano R. ) BERRESFORD ( Strolling up to RHY and looking at her with very open admiration ) When I look at you it 's hard to believe I am where I am . RHY ( Smiling at him audaciously . Sits on couch before fire ) You know where you are , then ? BERRESFORD ( L. of RHY ) Uusually . I 'd like to know just where I am  --  with you . ( RHY laughs happily and turning away , sits on couch before the fire , facing the audience  --  her back half turned to BERRESFORD . MRS . BIX , starts to play . Piano : Under the leaves ) You look like an old picture tonight ( Piano ) I should like to see you in the right frame . p. 52 RHY I do n't care to be in a frame , thank you . BERRESFORD Not even a very beautiful one ? RHY No , Sir . BERRESFORD ( Sits on head of couch ) Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're a funny girl . RHY I do n't see anything funny about that . BERRESFORD I 've never heard you wish for anything . Never heard you rebel . Surely in your heart you want beautiful things . Of course you do . You know you 're prettier to-night than you ever were before , just as well as I do . RHY Nonsense ! You like me better now , because I 've got on some old finery . I hate people who only like people in good clothes . BERRESFORD Dear girl ! You 're great ! You 're great just as you are  --  but wait ! RHY There 's nothing to wait for . BERRESFORD Oh , yes , there is . When once you begin to find out it will take a great deal to satisfy you . ( MRS . BIX 'S music goes softer . He drops R. of RHY ) Thank you for putting my flower in your hair . ( MRS . BIX suddenly plays very loudly ) p. 53 RHY You 're quite welcome . It was the only thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bars  --  then p . BERRESFORD takes chair at C. and sits facing RHY on sofa . ) BERRESFORD You 're never very kind to me , are you ? RHY I 'm kind enough . BERRESFORD No  --  you could n't be that . You do n't know how much you mean to me . You ca n't realize what it meant to find you out here in these bare hills . I remember that first day you passed by on horseback . ( He shows a serious infatuation and RHY shows that she both resents and is fascinated by his assurance ) These two years would have been intolerable without you . You 're not going to throw yourself away by marrying a poor man , are you ? RHY I 'm not going to throw myself away . You may depend on that . BERRESFORD What is it a woman sees in a poor man , anyway ? How can she risk it ? How does she think love is going to hold out against the nagging and biting of poverty ? RHY Because the things that make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what are the things that make a woman love ? p. 54 RHY Um  --  there are so many . BERRESFORD Yes  --  but , for instance . What 's the essential thing ? RHY Well  --  before everything else  --  trust . BERRESFORD ( With a little laugh ) Trust ? RHY Absolute confidence on both sides . BERRESFORD It 's the rarest thing a man gives to a woman . RHY Then when he does , it 's the greatest proof of his love . BERRESFORD But do you mean to say that if a man doubts a woman in  --  any way  --  he does n't love her ? RHY Not with the deepest , truest , love . ( RHY is looking into the fire , as she speaks . BERRESFORD facing the audience , shows that an idea  --  a scheme has just occurred to him ) BERRESFORD Well , you 're right . When it comes to that point  --  do n't you believe that I trust you ? RHY Oh , I do n't care whether you do or not . BERRESFORD But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh ! Pshaw ! p. 55 BERRESFORD Shall I prove it to you . RHY How ? BERRESFORD ( Moves close to RHY ) I will . It 's easy enough to vow eternal devotion and that sort of thing to a pretty woman ; but , as you say , it 's quite another matter to trust her . Is n't it ? RHY Exactly . BERRESFORD ( Rising  --  places chair back  --  looks to see that MRS . BIX is not watching ) Well , listen : I made a deal to-day  --  and it 's a dead secret , you understand , but I 'm going to tell you . RHY Do you want me to cross my heart  --  honest Injun I wo n't tell . BERRESFORD I 'm not joking . Of course you wo n't tell ; I trust you . That 's the same as your word of honor to me . RHY Oh , is it so serious ? BERRESFORD Give me your hand . RHY You have n't told me the secret yet . BERRESFORD But I shall . ( She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realize what it means to me . You are right when you say that when a man doubts he does n't love . Remember that . This is your word of honor , eh ? p. 56 RHY ( Amused ) My word of honor . ( BERRES-ford raises RHY 'S hand to his lips as STEVE opens the door from the dining room . RHY and BERRESFORD look rather conscious . There is an uncomfortable pause ) It 's time you were coming in . No , I did n't mean that . ( Smiling from one to the other ) BERRESFORD I think she did , Townley . I 've been trying to amuse her , but I evidently have n't succeeded . STEVE ( Jealously , going up to them slowly ) You seem to have done pretty well . MRS . BIX Which story is Tweed telling now , Steve ? STEVE I 'd hate to say . MRS . BIX ( Stopping her music with a bang ) There ! I 've played almost everything I know . Come here , Beresford , and give Steve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . BERRESFORD ( Moves L. of table R. C. ) I 'll do nothing of the kind . I do n't propose to give Townley a clear field with music to help him out . RHY He does n't need music . BERRESFORD What does he need ? p. 57 RHY Do you think I 'm going to tell ? BERRESFORD You do n't tell  --  secrets  --  do you ? ( There is a slight pause as each man flashes a questioning cautious glance at the other ) RHY ( Rising and moving down R. of fire ) No. that 's my long suit  --  keeping a secret . ( Music  --  PADEREWISKI Minuette . ) BERRESFORD ( To STEVE C. ) I understand you went over into the Sihene district , to-day . STEVE ( L. C. ) Yes . BERRESFORD See Trenholm ? STEVE Yes  --  I saw him . BERRESFORD Anything doing there ? STEVE You mean you want to know what I was doing there ? RHY Oh , you men amuse me . You 're all afraid to take a long breath , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sell my mine , I 'm going to do it at high noon , in the middle of the street  --  so everybody in camp will know all about it . BERRESFORD When are you going to sell it ? p. 58 RHY When somebody comes along who has enough money to buy it . ( She smiles radiantly at BERRESFORD , and STEVE watches jealously . BERRESFORD doing all he can to make him wretched . ) BERRESFORD Did Maggie tell you I went over to see if you would ride with me this morning ? RHY Yes , she told me . BERRESFORD Daisy misses you . You have n't ridden her for three days . RHY Well , I 'm sorry for Daisy  --  but I 've got a new horse ! BERRESFORD What ? RHY Old Mr. Withers has bought the prettiest little filly you ever saw , to send East to his daughter , but she is n't broken to the saddle and I 'm going to do it for him . STEVE No , you 're not . RHY Why not ? STEVE It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " ) RHY I love it ! I had her out yesterday , and I 'm going early to-morrow morning . You ought to see her stand right up on her hind legs . BERRESFORD I 'd like to see you bring her right down again . p. 59 RHY You may . BERRESFORD Thank you . I 'll ask Bixie to come and have breakfast with us when we get back . Seven o'clock ! RHY Bully ! BERRESFORD What do you say , Bixie ? MRS . BIX Tickled to death , of course . BERRESFORD Will you come Townley ? STEVE No , thank you . ( The two men stare at each other for a moment . BERRESFORD strolls over to MRS . BIX who is is still playing softly . ) BERRESFORD ( Taking chair down R. , and sitting R. of piano talking to MRS . BIX ) Your music is very beautiful , Bixie . MRS . BIX Do n't guy me . STEVE ( Aside to RHY in front of sofa L. ) Rhy , I do n't want you to ride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . RHY No , I do n't . STEVE It 's been ten years since I saw you this morning . RHY Has it ? p. 60 STEVE What are you going to say to me ? STEVE What are you going to say to me ? You have n't been fooling me , all this time , have you , Rhy ? If I thought that  --  You let me kiss you this morning  --  RHY I did n't . I could n't help it . STEVE Why did you let him kiss your hand just now ? RHY I did n't . We were only shaking hands . STEVE What were you shaking hands for ? RHY Oh , do n't be silly . It was just a  --  a  --  a little promise . STEVE A promise ? Are you going to marry him ? RHY Oh , Steve , do n't be silly . STEVE Do n't tease me , Rhy . I ca n't keep up with that sort of thing . I 'm too slow . Tell me how it is  --  Have I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear you . I thought Bixie asked you to wear your evening clothes to-night . ( They move to sofa down L. ) STEVE Oh , they 're motheaten  --  mildewed . ( RHY glances at BERRESFORD ) Besides , I just got off the train . Only had time to change my coat . p. 61 RHY What did you do to-day ? Did you see Trenholm ? STEVE You bet I did . It 's all right . RHY Are you sure ? STEVE Dead sure . RHY When is he going to make Bixie the offer ? STEVE He may speak to her to-night about it . He 's just as keen as anybody to clinch it . RHY Is n't it great ! STEVE He may speak to you too . RHY To me ? STEVE About your claim . RHY No ! STEVE Sure thing . I got him worked up about it this afternoon . He wants me to go down the mine with him to-morrow . It looks mighty good for you , Rhy . He means business . RHY What did you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I 'm talking about and that I 'm square . I hope he does speak to Bixie to-night . I 'm anxious to get it settled . You ca n't trust anybody over night . I 've been sort of sorry all day I told you . RHY Oh ! Why ? STEVE You 'll be so disappointed if it does n't pull through . I ought to have waited . p. 62 RHY No , no , I 'm glad . Oh , so glad you told me  --  even if it fails . Why , Steve , it means your fortune  --  everything you 've dreamed of . STEVE Everything ? Are you going to marry me ? You can say yes  --  or no , now . RHY No , I ca n't . You can take me home tonight , and I 'll tell you then .

( BERRESFORD is just going to speak , as TWEED BIX throws the door open at the L. , and ushers LORIMER TRENHOLM into the room . LORIMER TRENHOLM is a man of fifty . The hair and beard are somewhat gray ; the face very shrewd ; the eyes keen and restlessly observant . TWEED BIX is an Englishman , irresponsible and charming . CLEM follows TWEED .

TRENHOLM I apologize for no dinner clothes , but to be very frank  --  I  --  did n't think I 'd need them on this trip . STEVE ( C. ) I would have to apologize if I 'd worn mine . MRS .

BIX You 'll find them in one of those bloomin ' Indian baskets . ( STEVE turns to find the cigars on fireplace C. ) There  --  there you are . Bixie carries her Indian craze even to the cigars , and turns them out of their own very good boxes into one of these things .

BIX They 're all right , I assure you . My special . Hard to get out here . ( Aside to STEVE ) Hard to get the price . ( STEVE and CLEM hold casual conversation .

MRS . BIX I 'm sorry  --  I ca n't tell you  --  that was part of the agreement for business reasons . I hope this change does n't inconvenience you . TRENHOLM Townley , I do n't understand . ( STEVE drops down C. ) You gave me your word , that no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place knew  --  what you told me to-day . It begins to look very much , as if you knew this would happen and expected me to buy it back at a fancy price . STEVE Hold on , Mr. Trenholm. p. 78 TRENHOLM What else can I think ? Who would buy that low grade claim of Mrs. Bix 's so suddenly to-day , unless he knew what you know  --  and how would anybody know it , unless you told it ? MRS . BIX I do n't know what you 're talking about  --  ( STEVE stands with his arms folded and his face set . BERRESFORD listens indifferently . RHY is motionless , staring at STEVE . ) TRENHOLM I do n't care to be made a fool of Mr. Townley . There 's something wrong here and I want it straight  --  pretty quick . MRS . BIX Well , I have n't done anything wrong . I had a perfect right to sell . TRENHOLM What I want to know is  --  who bought that claim . I have the right to know . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell  --  very quietly but significantly . ) MRS . BIX I ca n't tell you . TRENHOLM ( To STEVE ) So you tried to run it up on me , did you ? RHY ( Off guard ) He did n't . TRENHOLM Oh , you know who bought it , then ? p. 79 MRS . BIX She does n't  --  she does n't . Rhy knows nothing about it . TRENHOLM Now , see here . I intend to know who bought that claim . Berresford , what do you say . I ask you for an honest opinion . BERRESFORD ( Moving in toward C. Is at L. C. ) Well , I know so little about it . If there 's anything wrong I should say it was strictly between you and Townley . I do n't see how anyone else can have anything to do with the case , or why Mrs. Bix should be asked to tell anything about her transaction . ( Retires up L. C. ) TRENHOLM And what do you think , Mr. Bix ? BIX Oh , Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RHY L. C. ) And what do you think , Miss MacChesney ? RHY I  --  I  --  STEVE ( Dropping in R. of TRENHOLM ) This is my affair . TRENHOLM No , it 's mine . If Miss MacChesney has anything to say , I want to hear it . What do you think of the situation , Miss MacChesney ? RHY I think  --  I know Mr. Townley did n't buy the mine . I know he has n't done anything wrong . p. 80 TRENHOLM How do you know it ? Do you know who did buy the mine ? ( BERRESFORD has moved at C. to fire again pantomimes to MRS . BIX to be silent . ) STEVE I tell you this is my affair . What good does it do asking questions all over the place ? I 'll settle this with you , but not here . ( Crosses down R. C. ) TRENHOLM Miss MacChesney has n't answered my question yet . ( To RHY ) Do you know who bought the mine ? STEVE ( Turning ) I know who bought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You acknowledge it then ? STEVE I acknowledge nothing . I know who bought the claim and I 'll settle this with you later . Not here . TRENHOLM You 're protecting Miss McChesney . Perhaps she bought it for you . But let me tell you  --  I would n't buy it back at any price . I would n't have it now , if you gave it to me . I 'd make up my mind , Miss MacChesney , to make you a proposition too  --  to start your claim going on the strength of what Townley vouches for it . I thought I 'd found a pretty good thing out here . I 'd decided to interest my syndicate in it . You 're evidently all together  --  trying to get all you can , but you 've struck the wrong man . I throw up the whole business . Good-night . ( He goes off quickly . TWEED whistles a few notes of " Over the fence is out . "  --  MRS . BIX stops him with a look . STEVE moves up C. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drops in chair below table R. C. , saying , " Well this is a nice mess . " ) p. 81 BERRESFORD I hope you have n't made a bad move , Townley . Sorry , old man , I 'll just walk on with Trenholm , Good-night . Good-night . ( Exit door L. ) MRS . BIX Tweed , go over to the hotel and tell him it is n't true , not a word of it . BIX Tell nothing . ( Moving to C. ) I do n't know what 's true and what is n't . You told me to keep my fingers out . ( Nodding toward the door ) MRS . BIX ( Rises goes to him at C. ) Do n't be horrid . Go on , I tell you . Get his coat for him at least . Just tell him  --  do n't you know what to tell him ? BIX Yes , I 'll tell him he must n't mind being done out of a good thing ; for he ought to have known better than to do business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . BIX Tweed . ( He stops ) I did the best I could . BIX ( Returning to her , shaking her L. hand ) I could n't do half as well , myself , old girl  --  ( Exit ) MRS . BIX I 'm awfully sorry , Steve . I would n't have had this happen for anything . Why did n't you tell him , if you knew who bought the mine ? I could n't . I hope you do n't blame me . Do n't you think he should have told Rhy ? Oh , I 'll have to go myself , Tweed will never say the right thing . Excuse me for a moment . ( She hurries out closing the door ) p. 82 STEVE ( Has stood by table R. C. without turning ) Rhy , tell me you do n't know anything about this . RHY You think  --  STEVE I do n't want to think it . Just tell me you do n't even know who bought that claim . You do n't , do you ? RHY ( She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me that ? Do you think  --  STEVE Swear to me that you do n't know who bought that mine . RHY I wo n't . You have no right . STEVE I have every right . Look at me . Do you know who bought that claim ? RHY I wo n't answer . STEVE ( Loud ) You wo n't answer ? RHY It 's degrading . You think  --  STEVE Do n't let me think it . Say this to me  --  say this , I do n't know that Louis Berresford bought that claim . You do n't answer . He did  --  he bought it . ( Goes quickly toward door L. ) RHY ( With a cry , springing up C. ) Steve !  --  ( He stops at door ) You say you know . How do you know . p. 83 STEVE I give you one more chance . ( Returns to her ) Tell me the truth in plain words . Do you know who bought the claim ? ( She closes her eyes ) RHY Steve  --  do n't  --  do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ STEVE You told him . RHY I did not ! STEVE Do n't lie to me . Do n't make it any worse . RHY Lie ? You did n't mean that . Take it back , Steve . Take it back . ( She advances toward him  --  He retreats to L. ) STEVE You 've done the worst thing a woman can do  --  sold one man for another . RHY Steve , you do n't mean what you 're saying . You do n't know what you 're saying . STEVE I wish I did n't ! What a fool you 've made of me ! Leading me on for him . Why did n't you turn me down straight and square ? You want him  --  not me . That 's all right  --  but , you 're not honest . ( He rushes out  --  slamming door . RHY cries out  --  " Steve " as door slams ) @x SCENE :  --  The room is built in a half circle . The large fireplace and window sills of natural stones , the walls of logs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and made of plain heavy boards used lengthwise ; with high hinges and lock , and is set in an abutment . The four windows , one at either side of the fireplace , which is C. , are at the R. half of the circle , and two at L. , are hung with dark coarse material . Single doors at R. and L. in " I. " All the furniture , severely plain , is heavy quartered oak . At L. is a round dining-table , three chairs about it . Below this table is a large couch , below table at R. a small couch , both of which are covered with the same material as the curtains , and crowded with pillows . The long table at L. C. is covered with writing materials , books papers , New York papers in wrappers , a hat , riding crop , spurs . Above this table a revolving book-case well filled with books . At R. end and below table arm large arm-chairs . At lower R. corner a small table holding several boxes of cigars , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several wall spaces are rough shelves filled with books . On floor up left is a wooden box marked with BERRESFORD 'S name , containing books which are partially unpacked and piled on the top of box and on the floor . On the mantel , over windows , doors and bookshelves are foils , boxing gloves , guns , fishing rods , etc . The floor is bare except for one large rug which extends from the fireplace under the table and chairs at C. The whole is crude , and somewhat austere , but shows money , and the taste of a man of the world . The drop at back shows the MACCHESNEY house  --  a small frame one , painted yellow with a single door and windows both sides . A few bare trees . Bright moonlight . TIME :  --  Later the same night . PLACE :  --  LOUIS BERRESFORD 'S living-room . AT CURTAIN :  --  HOP WING , a sphinx like Chinaman , wearing the regulation working dress of a chinaman , enters L. , stands on chair and turns up hanging lamp , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ papers curiously . Shuffling out at L. he returns after a moment with two brushes and BERRESFORD 'S coat seen in ACT I which he proceeds to brush . Discovering a cigar in a pocket he puts it into his own , and goes on brushing . After a moment the outer door is thrown open , and BERRESFORD enters C. BERRESFORD ( Entering and pausing in surprise ) Confound your impertinence ! What do you mean ? Brush that coat some place else , will you ? Do n't do that again . Do you hear ? Did n't expect me so soon . Did you ? Put those things down and come back . ( HOP WING goes out L. BERRESFORD takes off his hat and gloves and throws them on table up L. C. HOP WING re-enters ) Take this coat and give me something to put on . ( BERRESFORD takes off his top coat impatiently . HOP WING crosses L. ) Did you get those letters off in time ? p. 85 HOP WING Yes . Me catchee train . ( Exit L. ) BERRESFORD You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes to window at L. back . HOP WING enters with house coat for BERRESFORD , and assists him to put it on at C. ) Put that stuff over here . ( HOP WING takes whiskey , seltzer , etc. , from table L. moves R. of table , places them on table R. ) Now listen . I want breakfast at seven o'clock to-morrow morning sharp  --  understand ? Mrs. Bix and Miss MacChesney will be here . Understand ? Now what can you give us to eat ? HOP WING ( Above table R. C. ) Eat ? BERRESFORD Yes eat , eat . Breakfast , I said . They are not coming to look at me . Oh , open that box that came to-day , understand ? HOP WING Box ? BERRESFORD Yes  --  grape fruit , you know  --  the big fellows  --  ( HOP WING grins and nods ) The inevitable eggs  --  poached mind . We wo n't take any chances . Now what else can you scare up ? ( HOP WING shakes head ) Un ? Have n't you got anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lee Hi , chicken ! p. 86 BERRESFORD Chicken ? Broiled with a little bacon , eh ? Get that chicken and we 'll make it worth while for your friend . Now some of those rice cakes of yours and I think that will do . ( Going to fire ) And clear out . Go to bed . Six in the morning . ( HOP WING goes out . BERRESFORD pours some whiskey  --  takes it and stands looking into the fire . There is a knock at the outer door . ) HOP WING Six o'clock ? BERRESFORD Who the devil  --  ( He crosses and opens the outer door ) Hello there , Tweed , come in  --  come in . What 's the matter ? Party all over ? BIX ( Coming in . He wears cap , gloves , and large checked ulster ) It did n't last long  --  did it ? The guests seemed to have left on the run . I just took Rhy home  --  noticed your light , so thought I 'd speak to you . How is this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a mess all ' round ? ( Moves down R. C. and sits on box before table . BERRESFORD mixes him a drink ) BERRESFORD ( Pouring whiskey for TWEED ) Oh , you mean Trenholm and Townley ? BIX Trenholm and Townley , and everybody else , so far as I can see . p. 87 BERRESFORD How 's that ? BIX That 's the point , dear boy . How is it ? BERRESFORD ( Taking the whiskey to TWEED and standing R. ) What you in it , too ? BIX ( Taking the glass ) I 'm the notable exception  --  of course . ( He drinks the whiskey ) Thanks , old man . BERRESFORD It does n't concern Bixie in the least , does it ? BIX I 'm not so sure . She 's awfully cut up about it , to say the least . Does n't like the things Trenholm said to her , and all that  --  you know . That 's why I came over , to see if you think I ought to go to Trenholm about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that sort of thing  --  damned if I know what to do . BERRESFORD ( Still R. ) What good would it do to go to Trenholm ? BIX I might go and tell him he 's rotten anyway , to imply that my wife could be mixed up in anything crooked . BERRESFORD Oh , bosh . He knows she is n't . I walked along with him you know . BIX Yes ? What did he say ? BERRESFORD Not much . He 's done with Townley , that 's all . p. 88 BIX There you are , you see . What 's Townley got to do with it ? BERRESFORD Why everything , has n't he ? BIX ( Turning up towards BERRESFORD ) Hanged if I know . I 'd hate to see him in a hole . He 's a damned good sort . BERRESFORD Well . What are you worrying about ? Why do n't you drop it ? BIX ( Going closer to BERRESFORD ) To be very frank  --  are you sure old man , on the level now  --  it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to-day ? BERRESFORD Great Scott , why not ? I made her an offer . BIX Yes  --  to be sure  --  so you did ; but it was rather sudden , was n't it ? BERRESFORD ( Going to mantel , stands with his back to fire ) Well , Bixie 's not slow , and it does n't take me a life-time to make up my mind when I want to buy . What of it ? BIX ( Advancing slowly to table R. ) But she did think Trenholm was going to buy it . Did n't she ? BERRESFORD And he threw her over , did n't he ? BIX Did he ? p. 89 BERRESFORD What do you call it ? He went into Sihene District to-day to buy but it seems Townley had some Tom-fool scheme and called him off . You ca n't help it if Townley 's balled things up for himself . BIX No ! ( Takes up his cap from box down R. and turns it in his hands ) Trenholm went into Sihene to buy  --  did he ? How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) I told her . BIX Would you think me very impertinent , old man , if I asked how you knew it ? BERRESFORD Not in the least  --  but the answer would bore you . You 'd have to listen to details of mining business and of how a man gets on to things and keeps his eyes open for news , etc.  --  all of which does n't interest you , does it ? BIX ( With a sigh ) Not much  --  no . BERRESFORD To tell the truth I was darned glad to buy Bixie 's claim to-day , and save her from being left up in the air . She 's a mighty brave , clever little woman  --  and I 'm interested in her . BIX That 's very nice of you I 'm sure . To tell the truth , I 'm a little interested in her myself . I may be an ass you know , about business  --  but I think I can see quite as clearly as most men when my wife has been bamboozled . Unfortunately I see things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . p. 90 BERRESFORD ( Laughing ) That is , the realization that you and Bixie have absolutely nothing to do with the case  --  and that taking up other people 's rows is a very dangerous and a very thankless job . BIX That 's about the only job I 've ever had  --  I rather like it . ( Pointedly to BERRESFORD ) BERRESFORD ( Laughing again ) Do n't go . ( Getting the cigars ) Come and try one of mine . I 'm deucedly lonely . This is a long way from New York to-night  --  is n't it ? I wish I were as near to it  --  as you are now . BIX I 'm not there yet . No thank you . ( As BERRESFORD holds up the cigars ) I rather think I will see Trenholm to-night , and I may be back if you will  --  BERRESFORD Oh , I 'll burn out another log . Have another drink before you go . Beastly cold tonight . BIX No , thank you  --  I do n't think I need it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out ) BERRESFORD ( Makes himself comfortable . There is a pause of considerable length as he reads . Then a knock ) Come in . ( Rises in amazement as RHY enters quickly and stands tensely near the door up C. ) Why , Rhy . Come in . I 'm delight  --  ( Moves up R. to R. of her ) p. 91 RHY I came to ask you to release me from that promise . BERRESFORD ( Gaily ) What ? You 're joking ? RHY You surely were when you asked me to keep it . BERRESFORD Not at all . Why should n't I ask you to keep it ? RHY But  --  why  --  why did you tell me you bought Bixie 's claim ? BERRESFORD ( Laughing ) That 's the woman of it . You wanted me to tell you . You gave me your word of honor without hesitating . You said you could keep a secret . RHY I have kept your secret . Do n't worry . BERRESFORD I 'm not worried in the least , on the contrary I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moves R. ) RHY ( Follows him unconsciously ) You must release me . BERRESFORD You 're not serious ? Are you ? RHY Of course I 'm serious . Will you ? BERRESFORD Impossible . Do n't you understand what it involves ? RHY ( By chair L. of fireplace ) I understand what it involves for me. p. 92 BERRESFORD How can I allow you to tell it now after that open refusal to-night ? It would be absurd , besides it would hurt you . Nobody would understand why I wanted to confide my business affairs to a girl . Nobody would understand why I  --  Let me take your shawl  --  RHY No , that 's just it  --  they would n't . Neither do I. Why did you ? BERRESFORD Oh Rhy , surely  --  surely you do understand . Sit down . RHY I do n't . No , I do n't want to sit down . ( BERRESFORD takes her to the chair which is directly before the fire and beside the table . ) BERRESFORD Nonsense ! We ca n't talk if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upper end of table and pours a little whiskey ) You must take this . RHY No , thank you . I do n't want it . BERRESFORD Just a drop . ( Holding the glass out to her ) RHY No . BERRESFORD It will warm you . RHY I do n't want it . BERRESFORD Come take it . RHY I said " no. " p. 93 BERRESFORD ( Putting the glass down ) Oh , but you 're stubborn . RHY We 're wasting time . I did n't come to call , you know . BERRESFORD No , you did n't ! But , by Jove , it 's awfully good to see you sitting there . ( Moves down R. of her ) Are you comfortable ? Let me give you a cushion . ( Taking cushion from chair R. before fireplace ) RHY You do n't seem to realize  --  BERRESFORD Yes , I do . ( Puts cushion in her chair ) I do  --  perfectly , but you might as well be comfortable while you 're here . You 're my guest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I came on business . BERRESFORD Well , then , you 're not . But sit down . Now we can talk . ( He sits R. She is in the chair ) We must have an understanding . RHY Yes , we must ! You have n't answered my question . Why did you insist upon telling me your business secret ? BERRESFORD To show you I trusted you . RHY Oh , then , if that 's all , I know you 'll be glad to release me when I tell you that it would put me in a wrong position to keep the promise . It would make very serious trouble for me. p. 94 BERRESFORD It 's hard to refuse you  --  anything , Rhy . RHY Then you do release me ? BERRESFORD I 'm sorry , I can not . RHY ( Rising ) What ! You 're ungenerous  --  unjust . BERRESFORD ( Rising ) Do n't say that , Rhy . I 've explained why I ca n't do it . RHY You have n't explained anything . ( Crosses L. corner of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everybody knew you 'd told me a business secret  --  that 's no excuse . It does n't weigh that  --  that  --  ( Snapping her fingers ) Against my reason for asking to be released . See here . I do n't want to tell everybody . I only need to tell one person to make it right . Just one person . Will you let me do that ? BERRESFORD I ca n't . RHY You 're not fair . You had no real reason for telling me . BERRESFORD ( To L. corner of table R. ) It was a very real reason to me  --  to prove to you how I trusted you . RHY ( Looking at him closely ) I 'm not sure that I trust you . p. 95 BERRESFORD I know better than that . You do trust me , absolutely . RHY I tell you the whole affair is n't open and natural  --  there 's something queer about it . You 've got some other motive for holding me to this promise A motive with something in it for you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ R. corner of table ) Why it 's business , I tell you . Ca n't you understand ? There 's somebody else in it . RHY Somebody else ? BERRESFORD Yes . Other people . RHY Other people ? BERRESFORD Yes . RHY Then what right had you to tell me ? That was a breach of faith , then . BERRESFORD Not at all . It  --  it  --  I had a perfect right to tell you . That was entirely my affair . RHY Then you have a perfect right to release me . It 's the same thing . BERRESFORD Do n't shake my faith in you , Rhy . Perhaps I was foolish , but do n't make me regret my confidence . I never felt your charm so much as I did to-night . I was carried away  --  I admit . p. 96 RHY Oh , I do n't think you 're quite so foolish and weak as that Mr. Berresford . ( Crosses L. C. She strikes something on the floor with her foot , by R. end of couch L. C. and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stoops to pick it up . BERRESFORD stoops also , gallantly , but she secures it . It is the fob in ACT I ) Has Clem been here to-day ? BERRESFORD ( Recognizing fob and seal  --  answers indifferently ) Um  --  was it yesterday or today ? RHY It must have been to-day . I gave this to him this morning Mr. Berresford , you have n't ever loaned Clem money or anything , have you ? BERRESFORD He 's never asked me to . RHY ( R. end of sofa down L. ) Do n't please , if he ever does ; or encourage him to play poker , will you ? BERRESFORD ( C. ) Certainly not . RHY He 's so easily influenced . BERRESFORD I 'd be awfully glad to do something for Clem  --  for your sake . I want to do something worth while for you , Rhy , something  --  RHY Then let me explain this thing to one person . Wo n't you let me ? Please ? What difference does it make to you ? It 's everything to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my friend  --  if you 're a little fond of me as you say you are , you will do this for me , wo n't you ? p. 97 BERRESFORD My dear girl , nothing would please me better than to make you happy . I 've never known a woman so  --  so  --  You 're bully  --  so plucky . I like you , because you came to-night . It was  --  RHY If you want to do something for me , release me from the promise . There 's nothing  --  nothing else I want . Please  --  please . ( Unconsciously she places her hands on his shoulders ) BERRESFORD Rhy , I love you . RHY ( Drawing away to L. a little ) If you did really care for me you 'd say " Never mind your promise . I release you gladly , if it means so much to you . " My honor , my integrity are at stake . I tell you something serious  --  a vital thing is involved in that promise , because it makes somebody doubt me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . BERRESFORD What was it you said to me to-night , " If a man doubts , he does n't love . " RHY Oh , that 's so easy to say . I 'd doubt too , if I were in his place . He thinks you bought the mine . He knows you did . He asked me and I could n't answer  --  and it looks all wrong to him . BERRESFORD Why does it look all wrong to him ? RHY Because he thinks I told you something . He asked me to marry him only this morning , I was going to tell him to-night that I would . And unless I can explain everything now  --  it 's the  --  it 's the end for us. p. 98 BERRESFORD So that 's the way he loves you . Did n't you say to-night a man must trust  --  must believe just you  --  your word against everything ? That 's how I love you , Rhy . I 'd believe you no matter  --  RHY Oh , no , you would n't . I take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take back the stupid promise . BERRESFORD What about your word of honor ? RHY Honor means common sense , too . Do you think I 'm going to sacrifice the happiness of two people for a silly empty promise ? You ca n't give me one good reason why you want me to keep it ; so I break it . Do you hear ? I break it ? ( She starts to the door ) BERRESFORD ( Going between her and the door ) Rhy , listen to me . That man does n't love you . He  --  RHY Open the door . I want to go . BERRESFORD He doubts you now . What would he do , if he knew you came to me ! RHY What do you mean ? BERRESFORD ( Taking her in his arms ) I love you . You came to me , did n't you ? You shall have everything that love and money can give you . Do n't be afraid . You 're not afraid of me , are you , dear ? Do n't , Rhy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kisses her ) p. 99 RHY Are you asking me to be your wife ? BERRESFORD I 'm asking you for your love . RHY But not to marry you ? BERRESFORD That will come dear . We 'll go away at once . RHY So that 's what you mean ? BERRESFORD I love you . Why should n't I say it ? I want you , Rhy . RHY What has made it possible for you to  --  BERRESFORD Do n't say that , dear . You came to me and I  --  RHY ( Breaking from him to L. and standing L. of couch . He below it R. of her ) Came ? Of course I came . I came because everything in my future is at stake . I came because I 've brought trouble , a catastrophe to Steve . I 've not only made him doubt me  --  my honesty  --  my love for him , but I 've taken away the chance of his life for success . I 've made Mr. Trenholm think Steve 's done a contemptible thing . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . I 'm afraid Mr. Trenholm will leave in the morning . I came to stop it . Is there anything in that to warrant what you 've  --  BERRESFORD ( Moving above couch toward her ) Rhy , you 're not a child . You must realize when a woman comes to a man 's  --  p. 100 RHY I came to ask a perfectly fair thing , and I thought I was asking it of a gentleman . BERRESFORD ( C. ) So you were , and I 'm going to protect you . You 've cut away everything from under your feet . The world decides that . You ca n't change it . Townley does n't love you . He  --  doubts you now . What will he do when he knows you 're here ? I know you wo n't marry him without telling him . Then what ! You 'll have to come to me in the end  --  why not now ? RHY How is it possible for you to say that to me ? BERRESFORD ( Going to her ) Great God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I loved you  --  before you came . RHY It 's true , then  --  all women must be afraid . I have n't believed it . I 've thought we could do anything that was right in itself . I still think it ! I know it ! A good woman has n't anything to be afraid of . Nothing can make a thing wrong that 's really right . I 'm not afraid of the world  --  it 's you  --  you who ca n't understand . That this could have happened to me  --  to me ! ( She turns to go around , table R. sobbing . Gets her shawl from chair R. of table ) BERRESFORD Do n't  --  do n't blame yourself . I 've made a fool of myself , Rhy . ( A long pause . RHY goes on to the door , sobbing ) Rhy , will you marry me ? p. 101 RHY Do n't make it any worse . BERRESFORD Will you marry me ? RHY ( Her hands on door latch C. ) What good do words do now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she moves to R. side of door  --  leaning on it ) If ever a man spoke the truth , I 'm speaking it now .

What difference does that make ? What difference does it make whether I 'm here or some place else ? You think  --  STEVE Are you going to marry him ? RHY Do n't say that again . You think I told a lie . If I were a man you would n't dare treat me like this . You accuse me ; then you must give me a chance to clear myself . You think I told about Bixie 's mine . How do you know I did ? Ask me anything  --  everything you want to . STEVE It 's too late now to ask questions . p. 104 BERRESFORD Why is it ? STEVE ( Turning quickly to BERRESFORD who is at L. corner of table ) You  --  do n't you think I understand the whole thing ? If you 're so keen about questions you answer me . You bought that mine , did n't you ? Do you deny that ? BERRESFORD No , I do n't deny that . STEVE You would n't have bought it to-day , if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this morning . BERRESFORD You assume a great deal , Mr. Townley . STEVE Do you deny that someone told you about the increased value in Bixie 's mine ? ( A pause ) RHY Yes , he does . Why do n't you deny it ? STEVE He ca n't . BERRESFORD ( To STEVE ) I object to your interference . ( RHY is speechless with amazement and anger at BERRESFORD . ) STEVE Answer me . BERRESFORD I refuse to . STEVE Of course you refuse . You were told . RHY Oh ! p. 105 STEVE ( Turning to RHY ) Shall I go on ? RHY Yes . Go on . STEVE ( To BERRESFORD ) Who told you ? ( Pause ) Who told you ? ( To RHY ) He wo n't lie for you . ( To BERRESFORD ) Who told you ? BERRESFORD A dozen people might have told me . STEVE That 's a lie . There 's only one person in the world who could . RHY ( To herself in a gasp . Her hand going to fob , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To RHY ) Shall I go on ? RHY No ! No ! no , no , no  --  STEVE No , we know who that is , do n't we ?

Now tell me what it is and I 'll settle with him . p. 106 RHY ( L. ) No , no , there 's nothing to tell . STEVE You just said you came to be released from a promise . What promise ? RHY It 's nothing . STEVE Why do n't you acknowledge everything so I can get at the truth ? You 're not going to protect this blackguard , are you ? BERRESFORD Quit that !

PLACE :  --  The MACCHESNEY living room , same as ACT I. AT CURTAIN :  --  The stage is almost dark , only the dim light of a lamp turned low and the fire in the stove . The room is in order . A dark cover on the dining table . SCENE :  --  RHY is discovered sitting by the stove , a miserable huddled figure in dressing-gown and an old shawl . A slight sound arouses her and she lifts her head alertly to listen . After a moment , the lower door at L. is cautiously opened and CLEM comes out , wearing hat and coat and carrying a satchel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspence . He starts toward the outer door . RHY suddenly speaks ; " Clem ! " and , he starting violently , stops L. C. They stare at each other in silence for a moment . RHY ( Still seated ) Where are you going ? CLEM To catch the train . RHY Why ? CLEM I told you I was going . RHY Why did n't you tell me you were going yesterday ? CLEM I knew you 'd kick , and I did n't want a row . p. 109 RHY Where did you get the money to go ? CLEM That 's my business . RHY You mean you wo n't tell me ? CLEM I 've got it . That 's enough . There 's no time to talk . I 've got to get that train . RHY ( Rising as he starts toward the door ) You 're not going out that door till you tell me where you got the money . CLEM I got it in a square deal . I 'm no kid  --  I  --  RHY What kind of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're not ashamed of it . CLEM Aw  --  you 're a girl . You do n't understand . RHY Was it business ? CLEM Yes , it was . It was  --  well , it was a game . I got in a game and had good luck . RHY Poker , you mean ? CLEM Yes , that 's what I mean . Good-bye , I  --  RHY Clem , I do n't think you ever told me a lie before . Now see here , old man , you do n't need to . I 'm a girl but I can understand . You could n't be in a hole too big for me to understand . Now do n't try to fool me . Let 's call a spade a spade . It was n't poker . Why wo n't you tell me where you got that money ? p. 110 CLEM I 've got to get the train , I say . RHY If you do n't tell me there 's something wrong about it . That 's plain enough , is n't it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't take my word for it  --  there 's no use chewing the rag about it . ( RHY has come up to him . There is a short silent struggle ; he throws her around to his R. She clings to him ) Rhy do n't be foolish . Do n't you know I can walk out if I want to ? RHY You 're not going . CLEM Now I do n't want to hurt you  --  but I have n't got any time to waste . RHY You are not going I tell you . CLEM Oh , hell ! Do n't talk like a fool , Rhy . RHY Clem , do n't forget yourself  --  if you 've done the right thing , why are you sneaking off in the night , like this ? If you 've done the wrong thing , you leave it for Sonnie and me to face , so tell me what it is , and let 's tackle it together . CLEM Oh , you do n't know what you 're talking about , Rhy . Get away and let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He throws the bag down , puts both hands on her arm to swing her away from the door ) Clem dear , wait ! Listen to me ! Do n't be afraid to tell me . Are you ? What difference does it make what you 've done ? We 'll hang together . p. 111 CLEM ( Trying to loosen her tight hands ) I have n't done anything . This is my affair . You keep out of it . RHY ( Trying to drag him away from the door ) Oh , my brother , you do n't realize what you 're doing . Think of Sonnie and me . Are you running away from us ? Did n't you even mean to say good-bye ? What 's happened to you , Clem ? Do n't you love me any more ? Was I nasty and cross this morning ? I did n't mean to be . I 'm sorry , Clem , I 'm sorry . CLEM ( Getting one hand on the door knob ) I told you I was going sometime  --  I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devil like this , if you knew . RHY Just tell me why you 're going . Talk to me as if I were a man . CLEM I 'm going because I ca n't stand this any longer . I warned you . You 've kept me tied down  --  now I  --  RHY Oh , Clem , do n't say that . Is it my fault ? CLEM I 'll write . I 'll let you know . Good-bye . ( He runs to get the bag . She quickly closes and locks door . He rushes to it ) RHY ( Holding him ) You sha n't go . CLEM Let go my arm . I do n't want to hurt you . p. 112 RHY I know ! I know what you 've done ! You told Berresford  --  CLEM That damned sneak told you . I 'll  --  RHY He did n't . I guessed it . I know it . CLEM I 'll kill him ! RHY He did n't tell . It all came out in a funny unexpected way . There 's no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . Do n't you see how it will look ? It will look queer . People will suspect something . They 'll say  --  why did he go away in the night like that ? Where did he get the money ? CLEM I do n't give a hang what they say . I 'm going . RHY Then you leave it to Sonnie and me  --  the disgrace . It 's ours , too . CLEM Oh  --  what are you givin ' us ? RHY Clem , you stay and we 'll find a way out of it together  --  you and I  --  nobody else will know . You did n't mean it , Clem , I know . I understand . You were tempted . ( He is affected ) You were angry at me and you listened . You thought I did n't trust you and you listened to see what was going on , was n't that it ? And then you saw Berresford  --  and it  --  you told him before you realized it , before you meant to . ( Taking bag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know . I understand , old fellow . You need n't be afraid of me . I might have done the same thing in your place . You 're a boy  --  a man , and men have so many more temptations than we have of course . I understand , dear . I understand . Do n't be afraid to tell me . ( She has gradually drawn him into the chair at L. of dining table , setting bag on table ; takes his hat off , puts it on the table , brushing his hair back ) There , sit there . My dear old boy ! " I understand , it 's so easy to fall down . Oh , I 'm so glad  --  so glad I found it out  --  so you 're not alone . It 's so much harder to face a snag all alone . It seems so much bigger .

RHY No  --  do n't say that . CLEM He did tell you ! How 'd you know it if he did n't ? RHY He did n't : He did n't tell me . Never hinted at such a thing . It just came out in a flash . It would have come out in the end . Things always do . CLEM ( He rises and walks up and down at R. his hands thrust into his pockets . RHY still sits on the floor ) What 's the use ! I 'll never stay here . I tell you Rhy , you 've got to let me alone . I do n't interfere with you . Why do n't you let me do as I please ? Do n't you see , everytime you put your finger in , you ball things up ? If you 'd let me have some money yesterday  --  this would n't have happened . Now , what are you going to do about it ? What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and keep me here a few hours longer ? What 's the good ? RHY ( Rising and sitting in the chair ) This good . I 'm going to ask you to give the money back to Berresford this morning . CLEM What ! RHY Tell him you  --  can  --  not  --  keep it . CLEM Well  --  you  --  make  --  me  --  p. 114 RHY That 's all the reparation we can make , so far as I can see . Now the thing for us to think of is you  --  your future . If you go to Berresford and say " I ca n't keep this money . I 've made a mistake . I 'm sorry . " That wipes out a lot . Do n't you know it does ? CLEM What do you take me for  --  anyway ? RHY I take you for a MacChesney , and I know you 've got the grit to do it . CLEM Grit ? Great Scott ! That 's not the point . The thing 's done now , and I 've got the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's nothing to him . He got what he wanted . Nobody 's lost anything and I 've gained something . You say you only happened to catch on to this . Well then you keep still and let me alone , and I wo n't hurt you . You may not look at it just as I do . You may not see it , as a square deal  --  but I do . I was up against it , and I stumbled onto a good thing . Now you just keep out of this , and I 'll take care of the rest of it . RHY How much money was it ? CLEM That 's all right . RHY How much was it ? CLEM It was enough . RHY Did you name the sum , or did he ? Did he bribe you , or did you offer the information ? p. 115 CLEM Oh , it was no bribe . I named the sum . I knew what I was doing all right . It was a square deal , I tell you . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cent less . RHY Five hundred dollars . Five hundred dollars . Oh ! You sold your self respect for that ! Oh , that was cheap . CLEM Do n't preach . I wo n't stand for it . RHY Will you take the money back this morning ? CLEM Not on your life . RHY Then I will . CLEM If you go on like this I 'll clear out , and you never will hear from me or know where I 've gone , or anything about it . RHY Then you start your life as a coward , and a sneak . You run away from something you 're ashamed of . You start all wrong wherever you go . You try to begin on a rotten foundation that wo n't bear inspection . CLEM Keep still , I say , I warn you . RHY I know you . If you ca n't hold up your head higher than anybody else , you 'll hang it so low you never can hold it up again . Clem  --  I 'll make a bargain with you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Berresford this morning , I 'll give you a thousand . p. 116 CLEM Un-hun ! Now you 're talking ! You said yesterday you did n't have a cent . RHY I 'll take it out of the principal , if you 'll just do this . CLEM How do I know you will ? RHY Clem ! CLEM He 'll think I 'm a fool . He wo n't take it back . RHY Throw it into the fire then before his eyes . Ca n't you see it 's the only thing in the world to do ? It will make him see his own dishonor . CLEM Never you mind that , Berresford 's all right . I offered to tell him  --  for money . RHY I 'm glad you said that . It 's great not to blame Berresford . I do n't care how it happened . All I want to know is that you care , Clem . CLEM Well , it did n't hurt you . RHY Hurt me ? Oh , more than if I 'd done it myself . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? CLEM Oh  --  RHY No , listen . It might be I instead of you . Then would n't you move heaven and earth to help me ? Of course you would , you 're the only person in the world I 've got to stand by me . You 're my big brother . You 'd have to protect me . You may have to , sooner than you think . ( He looks at her sharply ) Clem , to-night it came out about this thing  --  you know , the mine business at Bixie 's , and left things in a muddle , all horribly mixed ; and when I got home I saw Berresford 's light and just went across the street to  --  p. 117 CLEM Went over to Berresford 's ? RHY Yes . CLEM What did you do that for ? RHY Because I did n't see any reason why I should n't . CLEM Why , you  --  RHY While I was there , Steve came in , and he did n't understand . It seemed funny to him , I suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rhy , what did you  --  RHY I do n't want them to think they must keep still about it . I do n't want them to think there 's anything they 've got to cover up for me . I want people to know that I was there . I 've got you to take care of me . ( She lets her head fall on the table and sobs unrestrainedly . CLEM 'S hand slowly steals to her hair , with awkward boyish love and sympathy . He lifts her , putting his arms about her . They stand together in silence , save for her sobs ) CLEM Never mind , do n't cry about it . Buck up , Rhy , it will be all right . Townley 's a damned chump , if he did n't understand  --  I 'll punch his head . RHY Oh , it 's so nice to have you know it , Clem . CLEM Just let me hear anybody  --  p. 118 RHY You take the money back the first thing this morning and we 'll take the thousand out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  just as soon as this blows over , you go to Salt Lake and  --  CLEM I do n't want the old thousand . What do you take me for ? I 'll give it back to Berresford , and call it off , but I do n't  --  RHY Oh , Clem , I love you so and you seemed so far away from me to-night . Now , you 're back again and you belong to us . There 's only the three of us  --  nobody else really cares what happens . Oh , I 'm so tired , Clem . CLEM Do n't cry , Rhy . Come on  --  go to bed . I 'll fix it and we 'll forget it . ( CLEM , putting an arm about her , leads her to her door at L. ) Go to sleep and forget it . I 'll fix it . RHY It seems all right , already , just to hear you say it . God bless you , dear . ( She kisses him and goes out L. 3 .

SONNIE ( Standing on one foot at L. C. ) I 'm eatin ' . MAGGIE ( Going out ) Yees kin bet on that . ( SONNIE yawning and stretching , goes slowly to table and contemplates the doughnuts , then lazily takes a sling shot from his pocket and disentangles it from string , a jack-knife , a few nails , etc. , as MAGGIE re-enters with a cup of coffee ) MAGGIE ( Putting the coffee on the dining table near L. end ) Will yees have a fried egg or a boiled egg ?

( MAGGIE goes into kitchen , pushing SONNIE before her . ) ( RHY takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to put it on , takes the crop from the table , and opens the other door . STEVE appears at door . There is a long pause . ) STEVE May I come in ? RHY Yes . ( RHY goes back to R. C. STEVE enters and closes the door ) STEVE It 's one of two things  --  either you 're going to marry Louis Berresford and you 're keeping still about this business for his sake , or he has n't asked you to marry him . RHY Why do you say that ? STEVE If he has n't , I 'll kill him  --  just as sure as I stand here . If he 's  --  Has n't he asked you to marry him ? p. 130 RHY He has . STEVE Then what do you mean ?

You believe me , do n't you ? STEVE Believe you when you say there 's something between that man and you that  --  RHY Yes  --  yes  --  with all that . Just because I love you . Just because my love is so great that it must move everything else . It must make you know that I 've never cared for anyone but you ; that I would have married you long ago , if you 'd asked me ; that I want you to ask me now ; that I 've never been anything but true to you with my whole soul  --  my whole self ; that I love you  --  love you  --  love you , and I know that you love me , Steve .

SONNIE turns it open and enters with CLEM . CLEM is without his hat and very much excited . His hair is disheveled , his face pale and a gash across his left cheek . ) CLEM ( As he enters , coming down L. C. ) The only thing I 'm sorry for is that I did n't have a gun . SONNIE ( Coming down R. C. ) He knocked him down as slick as a whistle . RHY ( C. ) Who ? Who knocked who ? ( She takes CLEM 'S left arm . SONNIE takes his right , and they walk with him to the chair R. C. ) CLEM Young Withers . I knocked him down . You bet your sweet life I did . I 'm only sorry I did n't kill him .

He does n't know what he 's saying . He does n't understand . CLEM I tell you I  --  STEVE ( Speaking with CLEM ) Keep quiet old man . Let 's fix up that slash in your face . CLEM I 've got something else to fix up first . She went there on business  --  my business . I listened and told about that  --  RHY ( Putting her hand over his mouth ) Clem , Steve knows I love him now . It 's all right  --  there 's nothing to explain . I love him .

I thought it was the other man . CLEM ( Putting out his hand to STEVE ) By golly , I 'm glad it was n't . I 'm glad it 's you . ( Goes to window ) SONNIE ( Going around at back to L. and punching STEVE in the back ) I knew it . Steve 's all right . MAGGIE ( Opening the kitchen door ) Come out here till I wash your face , Clem . You look like a dago . ( CLEM kisses RHY and goes into kitchen . ) SONNIE Oh , ho . I know . Ah , Rhy .
