PILGRIM AND AMERICAN *** Produced by David Widger THE PILGRIM , AND THE AMERICAN OF TODAY  --  1892 By Charles Dudley Warner This December evening , the imagination , by a law of contrast , recalls another December night two hundred and seventy years ago . The circle of darkness is drawn about a little group of Pilgrims who have come ashore on a sandy and inhospitable coast . On one side is a vexed and wintry sea , three thousand miles of tossing waves and tempest , beyond which lie the home , the hedgerows and cottages , the church towers , the libraries and universities , the habits and associations of an old civilization , the strongest and dearest ties that can entwine around a human heart , abandoned now definitely and forever by these wanderers ; on the other side a wintry forest of unknown extent , without highways , the lair of wild beasts , impenetrable except by trails known only to the savages , whose sudden appearance and disappearance adds mystery and terror to the impression the imagination has conjured up of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vaster obscurity . This is an encampment on the edge of a continent , the proportions of which are unknown , the form of which is only conjectured . Behind this screen of forest are there hills , great streams , with broad valleys , ranges of mountains perhaps , vast plains , lakes , other wildernesses of illimitable extent ? The adventurers on the James hoped they could follow the stream to highlands that looked off upon the South Sea , a new route to India and the Spice Islands . This unknown continent is attacked , it is true , in more than one place . The Dutch are at the mouth of the Hudson ; there is a London company on the James ; the Spaniards have been long in Florida , and have carried religion and civilization into the deserts of New Mexico . Nevertheless , the continent , vaster and more varied than was guessed , is practically undiscovered , untrodden . How inadequate to the subjection of any considerable portion of it seems this little band of ill-equipped adventurers , who can not without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " Mayflower " lies . It is not to be supposed that the Pilgrims had an adequate conception of the continent , or of the magnitude of their mission on it , or of the nation to come of which they were laying the foundations . They did the duty that lay nearest to them ; and the duty done today , perhaps without prescience of its consequences , becomes a permanent stone in the edifice of the future . They sought a home in a fresh wilderness , where they might be undisturbed by superior human authority ; they had no doctrinarian notions of equality , nor of the inequality which is the only possible condition of liberty ; the idea of toleration was not born in their age ; they did not project a republic ; they established a theocracy , a church which assumed all the functions of a state , recognizing one Supreme Power , whose will in human conduct they were to interpret . Already , however , in the first moment , with a true instinct of self-government , they drew together in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to carry out the divine will in society . But , behold how speedily their ideas expanded beyond the Jewish conception , necessarily expanded with opportunity and the practical self-dependence of colonies cut off from the aid of tradition , and brought face to face with the problems of communities left to themselves . Only a few years later , on the banks of the Connecticut , Thomas Hooker , the first American Democrat , proclaimed that " the foundation of authority is laid in the free consent of the people , " that " the choice of public magistrates belongs unto the people , by God 's own allowance , " that it is the right of the people not only to choose but to limit the power of their rulers , and he exhorted , " as God has given us liberty to take it . " There , at that moment , in Hartford , American democracy was born ; and in the republican union of the three towns of the Connecticut colony , Hartford , Windsor , and Wethersfield , was the germ of the American federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known at the time as the " Connecticut Compromise . " It were not worth while for me to come a thousand miles to say this , or to draw over again for the hundredth time the character of the New England Pilgrim , nor to sketch his achievement on this continent . But it is pertinent to recall his spirit , his attitude toward life , and to inquire what he would probably do in the circumstances in which we find ourselves . It is another December night , before the dawn of a new year . And this night still symbolizes the future . You have subdued a continent , and it stands in the daylight radiant with a material splendor of which the Pilgrims never dreamed . Yet a continent as dark , as unknown , exists . It is yourselves , your future , your national life . The other continent was made , you had only to discover it , to uncover it . This you must make yourselves . We have finished the outline sketch of a magnificent nation . The territory is ample ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seasons , every variety of physical conformation , every kind of production suited to the wants , almost everything desired in the imagination , of man . It comes nearer than any empire in history to being self-sufficient , physically independent of the rest of the globe . That is to say , if it were shut off from the rest of the world , it has in itself the material for great comfort and civilization . And it has the elements of motion , of agitation , of life , because the vast territory is filling up with a rapidity unexampled in history . I am not saying that isolated it could attain the highest civilization , or that if it did touch a high one it could long hold it in a living growth , cut off from the rest of the world . I do not believe it . For no state , however large , is sufficient unto itself . No state is really alive in the highest sense whose receptivity is not equal to its power to contribute to the world with which its destiny is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is a part of the vital current of movement , of sympathy , of hope , of enthusiasm of the world at large . There is no doctrine so belittling , so withering to our national life , as that which conceives our destiny to be a life of exclusion of the affairs and interests of the whole globe , hemmed in to the selfish development of our material wealth and strength , surrounded by a Chinese wall built of strata of prejudice on the outside and of ignorance on the inside . Fortunately it is a conception impossible to be realized . There is something captivating to the imagination in being a citizen of a great nation , one powerful enough to command respect everywhere , and so just as not to excite fear anywhere . This proud feeling of citizenship is a substantial part of a man 's enjoyment of life ; and there is a certain compensation for hardships , for privations , for self-sacrifice , in the glory of one 's own country . It is not a delusion that one can afford to die for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ object of a government ? What is the essential thing , without which even the glory of a nation passes into shame , and the vastness of empire becomes a mockery ? I will not say that it is the well-being of every individual , because the term well-being  --  the ' bien etre ' of the philosophers of the eighteenth century  --  has mainly a materialistic interpretation , and may be attained by a compromise of the higher life to comfort , and even of patriotism to selfish enjoyment . That is the best government in which the people , and all the people , get the most out of life ; for the object of being in this world is not primarily to build up a government , a monarchy , an aristocracy , a democracy , or a republic , or to make a nation , but to live the best sort of life that can be lived . We think that our form of government is the one best calculated to attain this end . It is of all others yet tried in this world the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interference in the affairs of private life , in opinion , in conscience , in our freedom to attain position , to make money , to move from place to place , and to follow any career that is open to our ability . In order to maintain this freedom of action , this non-interference , we are bound to resist centralization of power ; for a central power in a republic , grasped and administered by bosses , is no more tolerable than central power in a despotism , grasped and administered by a hereditary aristocrat . Let us not be deceived by names . Government by the consent of the people is the best government , but it is not government by the people when it is in the hands of political bosses , who juggle with the theory of majority rule . What republics have most to fear is the rule of the boss , who is a tyrant without responsibility . He makes the nominations , he dickers and trades for the elections , and at the end he divides the spoils . The operation is more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the speed of the horses , but by the state of the wagers and the manipulation of the jockeys . We strike directly at his power for mischief when we organize the entire civil service of the nation and of the States on capacity , integrity , experience , and not on political power . And if we look further , considering the danger of concentration of power in irresponsible hands , we see a new cause for alarm in undue federal mastery and interference . This we can only resist by the constant assertion of the rights , the power , the dignity of the individual State , all that it has not surrendered in the fundamental constitution of the Republic . This means the full weight of the State , as a State , as a political unit , in the election of President ; and the full weight of the State , as a State , as a political unit , without regard to its population , in the senate of the United States . The senate , as it stands , as it was meant to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fundamental law established against centralization , against the tyranny of mere majorities , against the destruction of liberty , in such a diversity of climates and conditions as we have in our vast continent . It is not a mere check upon hasty legislation ; like some second chambers in Europe , it is the representative of powers whose preservation in their dignity is essential to the preservation of the form of our government itself . We pursue the same distribution of power and responsibility when we pass to the States . The federal government is not to interfere in what the State can do and ought to do for itself ; the State is not to meddle with what the county can best do for itself ; nor the county in the affairs best administered by the town and the municipality . And so we come to the individual citizen . He can not delegate his responsibility . The government even of the smallest community must be , at least is , run by parties and by party machinery . But if he wants good government , he must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it caucus , primary , convention , town-meeting ,  --  as he does to the machinery of his own business . If he hands it over to bosses , who make politics a trade for their own livelihood , he will find himself in the condition of stockholders of a bank whose directors are mere dummies , when some day the cashier packs the assets and goes on a foreign journey for his health . When the citizen simply does his duty in the place where he stands , the boss will be eliminated , in the nation , in the State , in the town , and we shall have , what by courtesy we say we have now , a government by the people . Then all the way down from the capital to the city ward , we shall have vital popular government , free action , discussion , agitation , life . What an anomaly it is , that a free people , reputed shrewd and intelligent , should intrust their most vital interests , the making of their laws , the laying of their taxes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the management of their public institutions , into the keeping of political bosses , whom they would not trust to manage the least of their business affairs , nor to arbitrate on what is called a trial of speed at an agricultural fair . But a good government , the best government , is only an opportunity . However vast the country may become in wealth and population , it can not rise in quality above the average of the majority of its citizens ; and its goodness will be tested in history by its value to the average man , not by its bigness , not by its power , but by its adaptability to the people governed , so as to develop the best that is in them . It is incidental and imperative that the country should be an agreeable one to live in ; but it must be more than that , it must be favorable to the growth of the higher life . The Puritan community of Massachusetts Bay , whose spirit we may happily contrast with that of the Pilgrims whose anniversary we celebrate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that history records ; not only were the physical conditions of life hard , but its inquisitorial intolerance overmatched that which it escaped in England . It was a theocratic despotism , untempered by recreation or amusement , and repressive not only of freedom of expression but of freedom of thought . But it had an unconquerable will , a mighty sense of duty , a faith in God , which not only established its grip upon the continent but carried its influence from one ocean to the other . It did not conquer by its bigotry , by its intolerance , its cruel persecuting spirit , but by its higher mental and spiritual stamina . These lower and baser qualities of the age of the Puritans leave a stain upon a great achievement ; it took Massachusetts almost two centuries to cast them off and come into a wholesome freedom , but the vital energy and the recognition of the essential verities inhuman life carried all the institutions of the Puritans that were life-giving over the continent . Here in the West you are near the centre of a vast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and heartbeat of its immense and growing strength . Some of you have seen this great civilization actually grow on the vacant prairies , in the unoccupied wilderness , on the sandy shores of the inland seas . You have seen the trails of the Indian and the deer replaced by highways of steel , and upon the spots where the first immigrants corralled their wagons , and the voyagers dragged their canoes upon the reedy shore , you have seen arise great cities , centres of industry , of commerce , of art , attaining in a generation the proportions and the world-wide fame of cities that were already famous before the discovery of America . Naturally the country is proud of this achievement . Naturally we magnify our material prosperity . But in this age of science and invention this development may be said to be inevitable , and besides it is the necessary outlet of the energy of a free people . There must be growth of cities , extension of railways , improvement of agriculture , development of manufactures , amassing of wealth , concentration of capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ palaces , luxury , display . Without reservoirs of wealth there would be no great universities , schools of science , museums , galleries of art , libraries , solid institutions of charity , and perhaps not the wide diffusion of culture which is the avowed aim of modern civilization . But this in its kind is an old story . It is an experiment that has been repeated over and over . History is the record of the rise of splendid civilizations , many of which have flowered into the most glorious products of learning and of art , and have left monuments of the proudest material achievements . Except in the rapidity with which steam and electricity have enabled us to move to our object , and in the discoveries of science which enable us to relieve suffering and prolong human life , there is nothing new in our experiment . We are pursuing substantially the old ends of material success and display . And the ends are not different because we have more people in a nation , or bigger cities with taller buildings , or more miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or make more plows and threshing-machines , or have a greater variety of products than any nation ever had before . I fancy that a pleased visitor from another planet the other day at Chicago , who was shown an assembly much larger than ever before met under one roof , might have been interested to know that it was also the wisest , the most cultivated , the most weighty in character of any assembly ever gathered under one roof . Our experiment on this continent was intended to be something more than the creation of a nation on the old pattern , that should become big and strong , and rich and luxurious , divided into classes of the very wealthy and the very poor , of the enlightened and the illiterate . It was intended to be a nation in which the welfare of the people is the supreme object , and whatever its show among nations it fails if it does not become this . This welfare is an individual matter , and it means many things . It includes in the first place physical comfort for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decent lodging , good food , sufficient clothing . It means , in the second place , that this shall be an agreeable country to live in , by reason of its impartial laws , social amenities , and a fair chance to enjoy the gifts of nature and Providence . And it means , again , the opportunity to develop talents , aptitudes for cultivation and enjoyment , in short , freedom to make the most possible out of our lives . This is what Jefferson meant by the " pursuit of happiness " ; it was what the Constitution meant by the " general welfare , " and what it tried to secure in States , safe-guarded enough to secure independence in the play of local ambition and home rule , and in a federal republic strong enough to protect the whole from foreign interference . We are in no vain chase of an equality which would eliminate all individual initiative , and check all progress , by ignoring differences of capacity and strength , and rating muscles equal to brains . But we are in pursuit of equal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than humanity in general ever had yet . And this fairer chance would not , for instance , permit any man to become a millionaire by so manipulating railways that the subscribing towns and private stockholders should lose their investments ; nor would it assume that any Gentile or Jew has the right to grow rich by the chance of compelling poor women to make shirts for six cents apiece . The public opinion which sustains these deeds is as un-American , and as guilty as their doers . While abuses like these exist , tolerated by the majority that not only make public opinion , but make the laws , this is not a government for the people , any more than a government of bosses is a government by the people . The Pilgrims of Plymouth could see no way of shaping their lives in accordance with the higher law except by separating themselves from the world . We have their problem , how to make the most of our lives , but the conditions have changed . Ours is an age of scientific aggression , fierce competition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enlarged . To live the life now is to be no more isolated or separate , but to throw ourselves into the great movement of thought , and feeling , and achievement . Therefore we are altruists in charity , missionaries of humanity , patriots at home . Therefore we have a justifiable pride in the growth , the wealth , the power of the nation , the state , the city . But the stream can not rise above its source . The nation is what the majority of its citizens are . It is to be judged by the condition of its humblest members . We shall gain nothing over other experiments in government , although we have money enough to buy peace from the rest of the world , or arms enough to conquer it , although we rear upon our material prosperity a structure of scientific achievement , of art , of literature unparalleled , if the common people are not sharers in this great prosperity , and are not fuller of hope and of the enjoyment of life than common people ever were before . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Whatever the greatness of the nation , whatever the accumulation of wealth , the worth of the world to us is exactly the worth of our individual lives . The magnificent opportunity in this Republic is that we may make the most possible out of our lives , and it will continue only as we adhere to the original conception of the Republic . Politics without virtue , money-making without conscience , may result in great splendor , but as such an experiment is not new , its end can be predicted . An agreeable home for a vast , and a free , and a happy people is quite another thing . It expects thrift , it expects prosperity , but its foundations are in the moral and spiritual life . Therefore I say that we are still to make the continent we have discovered and occupied , and that the scope and quality of our national life are still to be determined . If they are determined not by the narrow tenets of the Pilgrims , but by their high sense of duty , and of the value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will call the world up to a higher plane of action than it ever attained before , and it will bring in a new era of humanity . If they are determined by the vulgar successes of a mere material civilization , it is an experiment not worth making . It would have been better to have left the Indians in possession , to see if they could not have evolved out of their barbarism some new line of action . The Pilgrims were poor , and they built their huts on a shore which gave such niggardly returns for labor that the utmost thrift was required to secure the necessaries of life . Out of this struggle with nature and savage life was no doubt evolved the hardihood , the endurance , that builds states and wins the favors of fortune . But poverty is not commonly a nurse of virtue , long continued , it is a degeneration . It is almost as difficult for the very poor man to be virtuous as for the very rich man ; and very good and very rich at the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is a great people that can withstand great prosperity . The condition of comfort without extremes is that which makes a happy life . I know a village of old-fashioned houses and broad elm-shaded streets in New England , indeed more than one , where no one is inordinately rich , and no one is very poor , where paupers are so scarce that it is difficult to find beneficiaries for the small traditionary contribution for the church poor ; where the homes are centres of intelligence , of interest in books , in the news of the world , in the church , in the school , in politics ; whence go young men and women to the colleges , teachers to the illiterate parts of the land , missionaries to the city slums . Multiply such villages all over the country , and we have one of the chief requisites for an ideal republic . This has been the longing of humanity . Poets have sung of it ; prophets have had visions of it ; statesmen have striven for it ; patriots have died for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fruitage of so much suffering , so much sacrifice , a land of equal laws and equal opportunities , a government of all the people for the benefit of all the people ; where the conditions of living will be so adjusted that every one can make the most out of his life , neither waste it in hopeless slavery nor in selfish tyranny , where poverty and crime will not be hereditary generation after generation , where great fortunes will not be for vulgar ostentation , but for the service of humanity and the glory of the State , where the privileges of freemen will be so valued that no one will be mean enough to sell his vote nor corrupt enough to attempt to buy a vote , where the truth will at last be recognized , that the society is not prosperous when half its members are lucky , and half are miserable , and that that nation can only be truly great that takes its orders from the Great Teacher of Humanity . And , lo ! at last here is a great continent , virgin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , discovered , organized into a great nation , with a government flexible in a distributed home rule , stiff as steel in a central power , already rich , already powerful . It is a land of promise . The materials are all here . Will you repeat the old experiment of a material success and a moral and spiritual failure ? Or will you make it what humanity has passionately longed for ? Only good individual lives can do that .
