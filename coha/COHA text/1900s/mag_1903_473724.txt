SOME OME tenement books come from obscure little publishing-houses in the foreign quarters -- serene , de-literate places where , in the gloom of the back room , slow journeymen set type , and an old man turns the crank of a creaking hand-press : a shop , it may be , in a swarming tenement street , elbowed by a butcherstall and given an arm by a dusty dealer in old clothes ; the grimy sign-board. in Hebrew or Arabic characters , is lost in a bewilderment of less modest signs . and fire-escapes , and airing garments . Highminded writers ? pinched and long - haired for the most part , and abstracted to the last rnan ? seek out these printingshops with manuscript and subscription list in pocket ; they hope no more for their message ( God give them honor ! ) than that it may issue from the tenement press and touch some heart in the tenement throng : nor is it granted a larger fortune . But whether or not the hooks are tenement born ? whether from the hand of the Ghetto poet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ typewriter of the fallen Park Row hack by way of a down-town establishment ? they are no more like the books upon which the light of your lamp falls in quiet hours than the Alley is like the Avenue . They may better be likened , it seems to me , to the people who drift past in mean streets ? to the shabby , shuffling characters of the submerged , passed by , but remembered for an oddity of gait or feature : for a twinkle or a droop or an incongruous pomposity . Such folk , be as queer as they may , find congenial company and a welcome where they go ; and so do the tenement books . The Langdon Book of Poetry is papercovered and pink . It has a black , disjointed ornamentation , in which the shamrock , the thistle , and the rose struggle desperately to cling together , as , according to Bowery sentiment , they should , The Popular Poetical Orator of the Curio Halls ? bald , blear-eyed , and qnaveringspeaks of it , with a little lifting of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the off hours !

She boasts such handsome whiskers . A full mustache and beard ! Thus the poet sings of the Bearded Lady ? " a poetical effusion introduced in his series of popular descriptive lectures . " The cover-page calls the " Living Skeleton " an effusion too ; but the Professor , in his hours of relaxation after midnight , confesses that it is " just another little fit .

Jimmie Dugan 's " bundle o ' ribbons " from Catharine Street whispers that she thinks it 's lovely . When , at last , the Professor divulges the interesting fact that it is all contained in a little book which may be had for the small sum of twenty-five cents . Jimmie does his duty like a man . So the Langdon Book of Poefry finds its way to a box in Lizzie Cassidy 's room on the fourth floor of a tenement near the Bridge , where it keeps company with the Book of Etiquette and Polley Players ' Guide and the Old Witch 's Dream Book . Pretty Lizzie may then add a new recitation , " The Elastic Man , " to her accomplishments " for an evening party .

There are many like it ? the fact is frankly advertised on the last page . They go from pocket to pocket in the tenements , with a thought always for the place where " they 'll do most good . " " Read it , " said my friend of the malformed jaw , pushing his empty beer-glass aside and leaning over the table to get close to my ear . " It ' 11 do you good . " The watery gray eyes did not waver then . " Down with the State ! " T rend , while the man with the bristling hair watched me narrowly . " Down with the Church !

" In some of the hook-shops of the Ghetto ? in Ludlow Street , perhaps , the heart of the Quarter , where the tenement life is shrillest , thickest , dirtiest ? the transplanted thriller may be found . It is a curious product : the hack writer of the Quarter translates the lady novelist 's high-strung story into Yiddish , cleverly adapting as he goes along ? turning the ancestral hall , for instance , into a giltedged piece of real estate with a few strokes of the pen , and with no greatereffort transporting it from the loveliest county in all England to that district of New York where the rich but still orthodox Jews reside .

' " Thus Her Grace of Duffievain in Wooed for Love . It is a matter of no difficulty whatever to suit the words to the needs of a Yiddish romance of the Ghetto : " ' Go , girl ! ' cried Mrs. Gabowitzsky , shaking her jewelled hand until the diamonds dazzled the shrinking maid . No son of mine shall degrade the fortune of the richest merchant on East Broadway by a union with a Ludlow Street cigarette-maker ! " " ' But I love her ! ' " It is immaterial , observe , whether this sentiment escapes the drawn lips of Lord Osinond , fair as a Greek god , or of the lustrous-eyed David Gabowitzsky , with a high standing in the University of New York . Her Grace of Duftlevain or the glittering Mrs. Gabowitzsky , as it may chance , faints on the spot . The tenement loves a love-book . It is evident that the downright youth of the East Side needs aid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Woo and How to Win and The Happy Lover and How to Pop fall alike into the hands of the little milliner of Division Street and of Big Tom Slattery , who drives his truck that way of a fine afternoon when he can steal the time . But Big Tom must take care ? he is expressly warned in The Lovers ' Casket ? that the " lady of his choice " is not prompted in her coquetry by the very book to which he turns for his own comfort and direction . " Proposals have been made under the most singular circumstances , " is written in How to Make Love . " We know an instance of a gentleman proposing to a lady who sat opposite him in an omnibus , and whom he had not seen before ; as it happened , they were married , and the match proved a tolerably happy one . But if the girl of your choice be of serious disposition , you will approach the awful subject with due solemnity ; if gay and lively , you will make it an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her in a strain of highwrought romance . " Big Tom will scratch his head over that ! " If in the country , " the book continues . " the lover is taking a romantic walk with the lady of his love , he talks of the beauty of the scenery , and exclaims , Ah , Julia , how happy would existence prove if I always had such a companion ! ' " Too many frills here for Big Tom ; his lips will twitch with disgust ? his stomach fairly turn . " She leans more fondly on the arm that tremblingly supports her , " again the book . " My dearest Julia , ' he says , ' be mine forever ! ' That is usually a settler . Or , Take pity on a forlorn bachelor , ' says another , in a Manner which may be either jest or earnest ; ' marry me at once and pot me out of my- misery . ' With all my heart , ' replies the laughing fair . A joke carried this far is easily made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ varied in a hundred ways . " If Big Tom Slattery is wise , he will go about the business in his own frank way . That war is good enough , at any rate , to persuade the drivers of delivery wagons which get tangled with the truck that he is the only aggrieved party . How , then , could the little milliner of Division Street resist it ? Albertus Magnus , the " Ape of Aristotle " and distinguished Dominican of the thirteenth century , is popular in the tenements . The East Side believes in dreams and witches and evil eyes and incantations . In superstition it is not far removed from the age of Albertus ; hence the popularity of the learned Doctor , who here sneaks with the tongue of a magician . The book is , no doubt , a free translation ( not unmixed with presentday slang ) of one of the apocryphal works . The publishers have sold one hundred thousand copies , spite of a " fake edition at half the price , " which is one dollar . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gravely .

It is in Ludlow Street ? top floor back : a gasping ascent indeed , through the gloom and stale air of the hails , with babies to stumble over and stout women to block the way . It is a florid little room , in greasy , musty plush , but all tidied of the day 's litter ? a place remote from the cry and clatter of the street , but not shut off ; you must know , from the companionable hum of the swarm within . The red sky seeks it out through a confusion of chimneys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ear-locks and forked gray beard ? a lover of wisdom and old ways ? sits by the window , where the evening light may fall upon the page of the book . He singsongs the words of the Rabbis to his household , that they may daily be instructed ; and they listen , dutifully , if sleepily , from the melancholy shadows where they sit ; for the words are wise , and concern the things that abide forever . " Samuel the younger said : When thine enemy falleth , rejoice thou not , and when he stumbleth , let not thine heart be glad , lest the Eternal see it , and it he displeasing in his sight , " Jacob reads . " Elisha Ben Abuyah said : To what may he be likened who learneth when a boy ? To writing in ink upon a virgin sheet . And whereto may he be likened who learns when an old man ? To writing in ink upon a blotted paper .

To one who eats ripe grapes and drinks old wine . " But now the attention of Morris , a lad of the public schools and a new way , wanders . There is that in his hip pocket to lure him to more enlivening thought : " Why not burn the lot ? ' whispered Rawson in the ear of Bold Portia . Why should any of these fools live to tell the tale ? Do n't start like that , man ! If you dye your soul in blood , why be particular as to the shade ? ' " It is too horrible I ' escaped from Bertie 's white lips . " ' Where is the jewel-box ? ' said Rawson , with a malignant glance at our hero . " You left it in the plate-room . ' " They went back , and just as they reached the plate-room , Rawson said , care-lessly " ' Fetch the box , Bertie , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bertie went in . Ile groped about for the box , but could not find it . It is not here , ' he said . " Bill you are ! ' cried Rawson , with a mocking laugh , and the heavy door closed with a bang . " With a shriek , Bertie dashed toward the door , just in time Le hear the heavy bolt shot into place . Ha , ha ! ' laughed Rawson . " And then he brought over some of the lighter furniture and piled it against the door . Over this he poured oil . He struck a match .... " Morris wonders what came after that . There had been no time to find out , when the call for devotions came . His mind has wandered very far indeed from the wise words of the Rabbis . He yawns ? it is too late to conceal it ! " Morris ! " Jacob Levy looks up from the page ? indignant and reproachful ; the evening light is on his gray hair , his face is solemn , his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For a moment the old man 's eyes linger upon him in reproach . Then the reading continues to the end ; whereupon Morris scampers off to the street with a whoop . In the seclusion that two garbage-barrels provide , and by the light of the street lamp overhead , he opens the creased and thumb-soiled book . " Holy Smoke ! " he ejaculates , looking up , breathless , at the end of the chapter . " Bold Bertie wuz a poach ! " He reads on . Cherry Hill way , the street clatter had struck a joyous note : the twitter of sparrows , the laughter of children , a cheery gossip from window to window . It was the first warm day of spring , near noon , with the air all washed clean , and the sunlight thick and yellow . The Commission went up the Alley ? once a dark , slimy passage : now naked to the light o ' day . The Secretary pointed to the place where the rear tenement had been ? then to the Row ; an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunshine was striking unafraid . " Nobody living there now , " said he , gleefully . " It has been ordered vacated . Down it comes , tool " The Row was desolate ? all forsaken of clamor and vice ; the roof was broken , the eaves sagged , the walls gaped , the sashes were torn from the windows . It was a wreck ? a place for the ghosts of murdered men . " Go through ? " was tho brisk invitation . " All cleaned out , you see . Not a soul in the place . " But there was ? one soul , a skinny , flat-breasted slattern , in patched clothes which hung in rags to the tops of her broken shoes . She was all alone . Young ? I think she was young . When the commissioners came upon her , she started back , frightened timidly retreated then to a corner , where she stood by a heap of fallen plaster , blinking vacantly . A three-legged chair , a table , and a rusty stove made the place a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table , beside a pan into which a crust of bread had been cast , was spread a copy of the Heart and COM panion . " She has been reading ! " It was a dirty copy ? ragged at the earners , crumpled , spotted with grease . Loyd Earlscouri 's Sweetheart , was the title I read . The Commission trooped out . As we passed on the return I observed that the girl was again seated at the table , full in the broad , nacre beam of sunshine -- bending over the greasy story , with her eyes close to the page , and one finger laboriously following the lines , word by word . It is evening ? the evening of a soft June night , when the magic of such hours , subtle and beneficent , attunes the heart to all the life of a tenement street . The Man of Learning has written another book ? the people know it ; for there he sits with his hack to the open door of a coffee-room near the Battery , himself disposing of his work at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word thrown in . Beshara Saba , the merchant , being a subscriber ? he is , indeed , the patron ofthe Man of Learning , ? takes his copy . without payment , and seeks the seclusion of the back room , where , stretched out on a divan , he may read in peace . The tales are oid , but now newty translated from the classic Arabic into the dialect of the Quarter ; and Beshara reads : " Now , the Governor of Al Brock was a man accounted most wise and humble , though to his power there was no end . It came about that a Bedouin , to whom the report of his condescension had spread , sought to try him ; and seven days thereafter he thrust himself into the presence of the wise prince . Do you remember the day when your bed-cover was the skin of a sheep , ' said he , and your shoes the skin of a camel ? " I shall be wise , ' said the Governor of Al Frock , if I remember that day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God because lie has given you a kingdom and ' sat you upon a throne ? ' Glory lie to Him , at any rate , ' answered the Governor of Al Frock . The Bedouin , sneering , said , Shall I salute the son of your father as I salute a prince ? ' Salutation is the custom of the people , ' answered the Governor of Al Brock ; therefore , if you salute me . I will greet you . ' Behold the prince , ' said the Bedouin , who eats of delicious meats in secret and gives barley bread to his guests ! ' Answered the Governor of Al Eroek , The food is ours to eat and to give away . ' Said the Bedouin , I should like to leave the country where the poor are robbed by their princes . ' If you stay , you are welcome , ' answered the Governor of Al Frock , and if you go , still we say , Gad be with you ! " Oh , thou Stingy One , ' cried the Bedouin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And the prince said , ' Give him one thousand pieces of money . ' What you have given me is too little , ' said the Bedouin , ' for I am greedier even than thou . ' Give him two thousand , ' said the Governor of Al Brock . that he may have enough . ' Then the Bedouin east himself at the feet of this wise prince , saying , I pray God that he may preserve you as a treasure for the sons of men , for there is no man like unto . you . ' The prince said , I gave him two thousand pieces of money when he treated me with disrespect . Give him four thousand , now that he has praised me . ' " Beshara Saba thinks that the Man of Learning has done well . It is late . Miriam is home from the factory . The day 's work is over ; the monotonous hours listlessly lived , the heat , the fetid air , the whir of the machine , the dull-eyed effort , the rasping voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until to-morrow . Under the window ? far below ? the night murmur of the street is charged with complaint : the cries of the children at play have ceased ; only the wailing of sick babies breaks from the low mutter . It is hot : so Miriam shakes loose her hair and bares her bosom ; it is very hot . She turns the page of Her Only Sin ? a flash of animation in her eyes at last . " I have been watching you , Veronica , ' says Sir Marc Caryl , in his low , thrilling voice , until I have grown jealous of the sky and the foliage , and everything else that your beautiful eyes have rested on . What have you been thinking of ? ' " The whine and sigh of the street recede , as into far distance . The scent of Veronica 's garden creeps into the tenement-room . " ' Of nothing in the world but you , ' replies Veronica , blushing like one of her own roses . " Of me , sweetheart ? ' exclaims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face ? the face of the heir of all the Caryls ? lights up with a great joy . " Miriam 's heart beats faster . The " red glow of the western sunset " now fills her sky , as it filled Veronica 's . She has been transported to " the shade of the lime - trees " at Queen 's Chace , and Sir Marc is by her side . The sultry night , the exhaustion of toil , the whip of to-morrow ? these things have fallen into forgetfulness . " Of you , ' says Veronica . " A happiness comes to Miriam , too ? so " great , so sudden , so entrancing , that she is dazed , bewildered . " even as Veronica was . " ' You are too kind ever to be cruel , darling , ' says Sir Mare , looking at the beautiful , flushed face . Veronica , will you not come to me ? ' " Taster yet beats the heart of Miriam of the tenements . Sir Mare. love her ? Inher face too flames @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgotten . " I have no fortune , Sir Marc , ' says Veronica , timidly . " What care I about fortune , darling ! ' cries Sir Marc . I am a rich man ? so rich that I am troubled at times to know how to spend my money . I lay it all at your feet . Veronica , will you be mine ? ' " The dark eyes of Miriam have in them , at last , the " radiance of full and perfect content . " Her " passionate loveliness deepens into something more lovely still , " as Veronica 's did . " ' Mare , my king , I have loved you always ! ' " So Miriam is taken to her lover 's heart ? clasped to the breast of the proudest gentleman of England . The " beautiful , solemn summer night " now " brooding over tho fair , sleeping earth . " Anon , a " flood of silvery moonlight is poured over the vast estate . " Miriam is far away from the tenement . In her evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in hand with Sir Marc in the cool gardens . In her ears are his love whispers . On her fair bosom flames a new cross of rubies and diamonds . On her finger gleams Hush ! Let her read on ! She has escaped ! It is true that the inspired word is written in the tenement ? by the hands of the poor for the hearts of the humble , by whom it is received as into a treasure-. hnuse . It is true that a flicker of aspiration . in the breast of the boy ? or the open-eyed love of the parent , who lifts her son out of the pit ? takes the wise book to the tilted . taggy tenement shelf . It is true , too , that the books which are familiar to your hand find a way to unexpected places east of the Bowery ? that rare hearts brooding there possess and treasure them . Benevolent folk ? kindly , tactful people ? take care of that . But , as saith the Arabian proverb , " Though men build an habitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Let the outer love for the tenement be as strong and tactful as it may , the mass is not changed ; the sullen swarm goes its own way , seeking that which it knows and loves beat .
