 |p1103  THERE is a protracted crisis in Hungary which is not likely to end for some time . It may even lead to serious complications in this part of Europe . The origin of the crisis was that the Government of Count Tisza violated a fundamental law of the country ( laws of 1899 , No. 30 ) and broke through the standing orders and rules of the House ; and when the opposition put a deadlock in consequence of this to all parliamentary proceedings Tisza induced the King to order a new election , by which another law ( 1867 , No. lo ) was broken . The elections gave a large majority to the opposition and increased especially the Party of Independence , with 17o members , of which the writer of these pages is the leader . There was nothing abnormal in this , and the natural course would have been for the new majority to come to power . At first the King ( who is also Emperor of Austria ) appeared to have no objection against this ; but later it turned out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not agree with the platform upon which it had been elected . The main difference consisted in this , that the new majority resolved upon interpreting an existing law ( 1867 , No. 12 , Art . II ) in a way which , out of fear of meeting with the opposition of the King , had not been attempted since the present constitution exists . This apprehension was felt by the party which has held power uninterruptedly since 1867 under different denominations and has been called for nearly thirty years ( very improperly , too ) the Liberal party . But a change took place ; the Liberal party became a minority ( 156 members ) , and the party which has for its aim to establish with constitutional means the independence of Hungary outnumbered the late majority , and other smaller parties also united with the Party of Independence so as to form a strong majority determined to conduct the affairs of the state in a national direction . The law , the interpretation of which had been anti-national ever since 1867 , gives to the King the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ army and to command , organize and administrate this army according to his will . No allusion is made in this law to the fact that the army is to be commanded and administrated in Hungarian . The fact is that the privilege was given to the King of Hungary , and as according to law the legal language of the Kingdom of Hungary is the Hungarian , the present majority affirms that such a prescription would have been not only superfluous but unnatural and uncon/ stitutional , as it would have admitted , as it were , the possibility that it would be otherwise . The King , on the contrary , interpreted this law in another way , and in this he was never contradicted by the former majority ; but the minority ( the Party of Independence ) always protested against this interpretation . The King pretends to have the right to command and administrate the army in such a language as he pleases ; and as the army of Austria ( i.e. , the Austrian contingent of the common army ) is commanded and administrated in German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administration , German was thus used also in the Hungarian contingent , tho the troops never understood a word of what was thus spoken to them . As a consequence of this in the 43 per cent . of the whole army of Austria-Hungary such an idiotic state of affairs exists that men are persistently commanded and spoken to in a language they do not understand . With ordinary commonsense one would think that it is better to speak to a man a language he can understand , but the Austrian war office is of a different opinions ; it thinks that the unity of the army does not consist in the unity of the control , the unity of the weapons , of the drill , regulations , etc. , but it consists in the language , whether this language be understood or not by the rank and file . The consequence of this absurd notion is that since it was enforced the troops of Austria have been beaten in every battle they fought , and this naturally arises from the fact that there never is any community of feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and file can have no confidence in their officers , who can never speak to their men . The Austrian war office discovered some time ago this drawback , and an innovation was introduced in the instruction imparted by the non-commissioned officers . They have to use now the language spoken by the rank and file , but the principle that orders should be imparted by the officers in a language the men do not understand is still kept up . The present majority of the House affirms that now law prescribes in England that the English troops should be commanded in English or in France that they should be commanded in French , and yet the idea in itself would appear preposterous to an Englishman or to a Frenchman that the respective armies of the two states should be commanded in German or in Russian . No one can see why a thing that would be absurd in England and France should be right and natural in Hungary . However , the King is inflexible on this subject . He will have it that the Hungarian troops should be spoken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in a language they do not understand . Such countries as have never been subjected to the danger of their nationality being assailed can hardly appreciate the importance attached to the principle of " Noli me tangere " applied to the national language . Some philosophers have said that " nations live in their language , " an assertion which would be absolutely true if England and the United States of America did not make an exception to the rule ; there is , however , a great truth in the fact that such nations as have to be on the ( pi vine to defend their liberty and their national existence are extremely sensitive on the point of the rights of their national language . The present majority has always upheld the right of Hungary to claim the use of the Hungarian language in the army , which is kept tip with Hungarian recruits and Hungarian money . It would now be a political immorality to give up this principle simply for the sake of coming to power . We as a majority are determined not to commit the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fought while a minority . And as the King has been accustomed to have his own way in everything he is not likely to yield to the will of the Hungarian nation . A conflict between the Parliament and the Crown may be the consequence of this , a fact which it would be in the interest both of the nation and of the King to avoid .
