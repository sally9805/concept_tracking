 |p1151  WIRELESS telegraphy is one of the most recent wonders of our wonder - revealing age . The public has not vet had time to grasp the principles of this latest achievement . it is commonly supposed that the subject of wireless telegraphy is too intricate for any one except a specially trained scientist to grasp . Nevertheless , the fundamental principles of wireless telegraphy are simple , and may be readily apprehended by all who are interested in this fascinating inquiry , however abstruse and difficult the details may be . Wireless telegraphy employs electric waves which are invisible to the eve , but which run over the surface of the sea and land at an immense speed . A fair analogy to wireless telegraph waves is presented , on a small scale , in the waves artificially created on the surface of a pond by throwing in a stone . We are all familiar with the series of events following the fall of a stone into the middle of a previously smooth sheet of water . First we have a big disturbance or splash where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waves spreading out in all directions from the splash over the surface of the pond . These waves continue to advance radiallv in every direction ? north , south , east and west ? at a steady rate , and if attentively watched they may be seen to go on , getting fainter and weaker as they run , until finally they strike the banks of the pond , or any prominent obstacle , such as a stake stuck in the mud and projecting above the water . Where the wave strikes either one of the banks , or the stake , it raises a little splash or dis turbance of the water . This little splash , on the arrival of the wave , is much feebler than the original splash due to the impact of the stone in falling on the water , because the wave spreads out into such a long contour that only a small portion of the original disturbance can be imparted to an obstacle in its path . In fact , if the pond is sufficiently large , the wave may be so feeble by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on arrival can be discerned . In other words , if the wave on reaching the bank is to be capable of producing a discernible disturbance , it must have an appreciable strength and not be reduced by expansion to microscopic dimensions . From the standpoint of wireless telegraphy , the impact splash of the falling stone corresponds to an electric signal sent out from the mast of a sending station , and the faint little splash on the arrival of the wave at a bank , or an obstacle , corresponds to the faint electric disturbance or signal detected at a distart receiving station as soon as the electric wave arrives there . If we suppose that two boats are quietly anchored in the pond at a suitable distance apart it might be feasible for a man in one boat to send signals to a friend in the other by striking a succession of short and long blows on the water , in conformity with the telegraph Morse alphabet . The letter a would be formed by a short blow followed by a long one , the letter b by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so on .  |p1152  Each blow on the water at the sending boat would send out a new wave in all directions over the pond , and the letters of the message would lie in successive expanding rings on the surface of the water . The man in the receiving boat would intercept these expanding ringwaves at some point of their circle . He might be able to watch the little splashes they formed on his anchor chain , or other obstacle , and so might be able to read the message , each letter being received a few seconds later than it was hammered out by the sender . Practically , of course . this plan would have little chance of success , if only because the least ruffle of breeze would prevent the wave signals from being- discerned . Moreover , the range of water wave sig. naling would be very small , even in calm weather . In the case of pond wave telegraphy , as above suggested , the waves would be emitted from a sending station by producing there a relatively powerful disturbance of the pond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waves in all directions , with a definite speed . At any point , within the working range , a receiving station could intercept and perceive the disturbances caused by the waves on their arrival , and could thus spell out messages . The receiving boat might be north , south , east or west of the sending boat , but if its distance away was the same it should be able to decipher the water waves equally well . Electric wave telegraphy , or wireless telegraphy , operates in a somewhat similar way . Instead of using water waves it uses electric waves traveling thru the ether over the earth 's surface . The electric splash or disturbance is created at the sending station by the sudden electric charge or discharge of a wire or wires on a tall mast , while the expanding waves , being invisible , have to be detected by a delicate electric responsive device connected to a tall receiving mast placed at any point within the working range . The advancing electric waves strike the receiving mast and produce feeble electric splashes . or disturbances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is necessary to regard the wireless telegraph waves as running thru the ether , rather than thru the air , even tho they appear to be carried by the air . If the waves were carried 1w the air , they would he sound waves , which have quite different properties . and which , moreover , are only capable of being detected ordinarily at relatively short distances . There is every reason to believe that if the air which surrounds the globe could somehow he completely removed , so as to leave only so-called empty space on its surface , the electric waves would still be able to run over it , substantially as they do now with the air present . It is universally admitted that so-called empty space , or interstellar space , must be occupied 1w something invisible , which is called the ether , and which transmits light , heat and electric disturbances generally . This ether permeates all matter , and the atmosphere is permeated by it . Consequently , the wireless telegraph waves run thru the atmosphere , but are borne by the underlying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a total eclipse of the sun , from a favorably placed viewpoint , say the top of a mountain , will remember that as the sun 's disk becomes obscured gradually by the moon , the sunlight on the landscape steadily dwindled , but without any sudden changes , until the first instant of totality , when the sun was completely hidden ' behind the moon . The observer watching for this moment discerns a black shadow , on the horizon , like a dark veil or curtain , spreading from earth to sky and running toward him at great speed . The wall of shadow sweeps over the landscape in a stealthy ,  |p1153  majestic rush and passes by the observer , leaving him in the semi-obscurity of the total eclipse . This is perhaps the nearest approach that nature gives to our senses of the phenomenon of electric wave movement . It conveys only a weak image of that phenomenon , because the speed of the moon 's shadow , which the eye sees running over the landscape , is only a few thousand miles per hour , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practical certainty to be almost the same as that of light in free space , i. e. , 186,000 miles per second , or sufficient to run seven and one-half times round the world in one second by the clock . If , however , we assume that our eyes could see an electric wave of wireless telegraphy running over the earth , just as we actually see the waves running over a pond , or the shadow of a cloud running over a landscape , we should expect to see a hemispherical wave thrown out from the sending mast every time an electric spark discharge was produced there . The hemisphere would cover the land like an inverted bowl , and would expand in all directions like the upper half of a gigantic , swelling soap-bubble , at the speed of iSG , 000 miles a second . At the upper portions of the hemisphere , and particularly at the top , the waves would be very thin and weak . It would he denser and stronger in the lower portions , and especially in the lowest portion that spreads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marienfeld-Zossen railroad experiments , made in Germany a few years ago , the highest attainable train speeds were striven for , and speeds of 120 miles per hour were reached over portions of the road . An observer stationed near the straight track and on the lookout for the car with his unaided eyes would see it coming on the horizon , would watch it approach , pass , and vanish on the opposite horizon all within thirty seconds , or half a minute of time . This assumes that he would lose sight of the car half a mile away from him . But if the speed of a passing wave , instead of being 120 miles an hour , were 67o millions of miles per hour . how small would he our chance of getting a look at the passing wave , even tho it reached from the earth to the sky ? A twinkling of an eye would be a relatively long and dreary delay in comparison with the time of passage . By way of example , suppose the sending mast were located in the Brooklyn Navy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spark discharge , or electric splash , were made at this mast , corresponding to a " dot " signal in wireless telegraphy . Immediately we should see , if we possessed the imagined powers of vision , a hemispherical wave rush off from the mast in all directions over the earth . Strictly speaking , there would not be just one wave . A stone thrown into a pond generally produces one principal wave followed immediately by a train of successively smaller waves . So an electric splash , or spark discharge from the sending-mast wire , usually produces a train of waves , of which the first is strongest and the rest are successively weaker . But ignoring this detail , if we confined attention to the first or leading wave , we should expect to see a nearly vertical wall running over the sea and land , north , south , east and west with the speed of light . The wave would , indeed , be made up of two successive walls , say first a " positive " wall and then a " negative " wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water-wave is made up of a positive wall , or crest , and then a negative wall , or trough , immediately behind , with a mean-level space between them . The length of the wave would depend upon the bight of the sendingmast wire , and with a plain vertical wire . the wave , including both positive and  |p1154  negative walls , would stretch over , or cover , a distance on the ground about four times the hight of the wire . Consequently a mast 15o feet high would throw off a wave about 600 feet long , the positive wall being 300 feet wide , and the negative wall also 300 feet wide . In practice , however , coils of wire are included in the discharge path of sendingmast wires , and these artificially increase the virtual hight of those wires , so that a 150-foot mast may act as tho it were much higher , say even a mile high . In the latter case , the outgoing wave would cover four miles of ground , or its wavelength would be four miles . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth 's surface at the speed of light , Jules Verne 's celebrated flying projectile being hopelessly too slow for our imagination in this respect , we could keep up with the outgoing wave and watch what happened to it as it ran . What happens far up above the earth would lie beyond our ken , and we need not attempt to follow the wave upward . But along and near the earth 's surface we should expect to see the wave bend over the globe , so as to keep advancing over it like a nearly vertical wall . The wave in its westward progress would he expected , after starting , to reach the Great Lakes in I-moth of a second , and the Pacific Coast in the 1-90th of a second . If we followed it in our airship eastward we should expect to reach Europe in about 1-50th of a second , and the distant shores of the Levant in about 1-35th of a second . If we took our imaginary aerial automobile northward with the wave , we should expect to see the wave pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If , on the other hand , we selected the southerly direction of flight , we should expect to see the wave pass the south pole in about 120th of a second . One naturally inquires how long could the imaginary aerial chase be kept up . If it could be kept going for a single second of time , the wave would have past New York on the seventh time around the world . The answer is that possibly in theory the chase of an ultramicroscopic ripple might be kept up as long as one pleased , but that , in practice , the waves have not yet been detected at distances exceeding a few thousand miles from their source . The reason is that they weaken so much as they expand . Just as the wave expanding over a pond spreads and weakens until it is rapidly lost to sight , so the wireless telegraph waves , being spread over such immense distances , become diluted to inappreciable residuals . Not only do they suffer in intensity by spreading over a continually widening area . but they are also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the ground were a perfect electric conductor , the electric waves , or the vertical walls that our imagination depicts them , would skim over the ground or ocean without being absorbed therein . But the earth 's superficial lavers are far from being a perfect conductor , and so the earth is always swallowing up or absorbing the wave , to some extent , at the ground surface , and the upper portions of the wave feed down energy into the lower portions to try to make good the defect as the wave runs along ; but the result is to make the wave disappear so much the sooner . The salt water ocean conducts electrically much better than the dry land and also presents a smoother general contour . On this account wireless telegraph signals can ordinarily be detected much further over the sea than over the land . For a given electric splashing power , or discharging disturbance power , at the sending mast there is a certain range over the sea and over the land at which high receiving masts can pick up the disturbance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the aid of a very delicate electric apparatus . The bigger the sending splashing , the higher the masts at both sending and receiving stations , and the more delicate the electric receiving apparatus , the greater is  |p1155  this range . At present the range extends right across the Atlantic Ocean . Wherever a vertical wire is placed in the path of an electric wave an electric disturbance will be created up and down this wire during the passage of the wave , and this disturbance , if strong enough , can act on suitable electric apparatus so as to register a signal . A single wave may pass by a mast in , say , one-millionth of a second , according to the length of the wave . But this brief disturbance suffices . In sending a wireless message every dot and dash involves a succession of waves , or an individual wave train . This train is short for a clot and long for a dash . Dots and dashes , in proper sequence , spell out the message . What is the nature of the wave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fly across the landscape at such an enormous speed ? If we carried our imaginary aerial automobile into one , so as to travel in the wall and examine it leisurely before it dwindled away to insignificant remains , we should expect to find that in the advancing wave there was a feeble vertical electric force , so that an electrically charged pithball suspended from the aerial automobile would be attracted either vertically upward or downward , according as we examined the positive or negative wall . Moreover , there would be an accompanying feeble horizontal magnetic force , so that a delicately poised compass needle on board our flying car would be deflected either to the right or to the left , according to whether we traveled in the positive or negative wall . Such are the warp and the woof of the electromagnetic fabric which constitutes these waves . They are not tissued of matter , but of electricity and of magnetism . And how are we to distinguish at any receiving station between waves coming simultaneously from New York , Boston . Philadelphia , Chicago , San @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pekin without invidious disregard of other places and ships at sea ? The more remote places take care of themselves at present , because their waves are too feeble and exhausted to reach us. he nearer places might well conflict , but by tuning the apparatus at our receiving mast to respond only to waves say 500 yards long , all waves save those of the particular station or stations which emit that length of wave will not he audible . Ilesides , there are other modes of securing artificial selection of signals , otherwise a modern tower of liahel would be erected in the circumambient air . Manifestly , wireless telegraphy is destined to become a great civilizing and socializing agency , because the firmament of the world is the common property of all nations , and those who use it for signaling inhabit it , in a certain sense . When all nations come to inhabit the firmament collectively they will be brought into closer communion for their mutual advantage . A new upper geographv dawns upon us , in which there is no more sea , neither are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telegraphy has entered the commercial field of transoceanic telegraphy , it becomes of interest to inquire whether it is likely to supplant the submarine telegraph cables , some 200,000 miles of which engirdle the oceans of the world . Wireless telegraphy has an undisputed territory on the ocean in maintaining telegraph communication with moving vessels , where submarine cables can not reach them . Now wireless telegraphy proposes to compete with cables for messages from continent to continent . It may he safely said that , up to the present time , wireless telegraphy has helped the ocean cables by bringing messages  |p1156  to them from ships at sea much more than it has hurt them by robbing them of messages . If wireless telegraphy were to remain stationary , and make no further technical progress , it is very doubtful whether , with its present capabilities , it could reduce materially the traffic over submarine cables . On the other hand , however , wireless telegraphy is still very young , and its limitations have by no means been determined . It is. therefore , conceivable that at some distant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to render ocean cables no longer necessary .
