Tariff reform is thundering all around the Republican horizon . Even the Tri tune  --  which it is a pleasure to find again clothed and in its right mind  --  is in favor of " readjustment " of the Dingley tariff ; " and the quicker it comes with the least political debate the better . " It declares that the latest tariff act was " faulty from the beginning " ; that " the iron and steel schedules have certainly been outgrown and need revision " ; that there was a strange " miscalculation " about the leather duties . which were " intended to protect cattle-raisers , " but have simply hampered our export trade and made leather goods " unnecessarily dear at home " We must be excused for rubbing our eyes as we read . Yet all this is only a strict fulfilment of the prophecy made by John Sharp Williams last winter , that if the Democrats did not take up and push the tariff-reform issue , the Republicans world . Ex-Gov : Washburn of Minnesota asserts that " nine-tenths of the thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it , demand a business-like and just revision of the present tariff schedules . . . . The party can not stand sponsor for the cre ation of gigantic Trusts or the building up of great home monopolies . " This is the kind of sentiment which President Roosevelt 's " feelers " are encountering or evoking almost everywhere . Republican Senators and Representatives who visit the White House in these halcyon post-election days , congratulate the President on his smashing defeat of the Democratic party , only to find him bent on carrying out one of the leading Democratic principles  --  reduction of the tariff . When even Senator Aldrich admits that tariff revision is not impossible , we may infer with all certainty that Mr. Roosevelt regards it as not only possible , but highly desirable . - We are told , however , with fine scorn , that the thing is wildly chimerical . Indignant letters reach us : " Do n't you know that the Republican party is as incapable of revising the tariff as a manacled prisoner is of escaping from a platoon of police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It all turns on the question of wise handling  --  more narrowly , on the question of wise naming . In politics , everything is in a name We have a fine illustration from a contemporary political movement in England . The Conservative party , after having shuddered at Irish Home Rule and fought it as next , door to treason , is preparing to accede to it in principle , and to grant a large measure of it in practice . But the gross mistake is not made of calling it Home Rule . No ; the Conservative augurs look gravely at each other , and say , without a wink , that what they are aiming at in Ireland is a " devolution of imperial pow ers . " Convey the wise it call . And , ' similarly , it is quite possible that the Republican party may knock out the keystone of the protective arch and call it " strengthening the principle of protection . " Senator Cullom does not appear to be quite awake to what as going on . Some recent remarks of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over . His words read like a warmed-up hash of one of his campaign speeches . He starts and shies like a skittish old horse at the thought of a Republican Congress revising the tariff . It might " endanger the es't'abhshed prosperity of the country . " It might cause " widespread nervousness . " In short , the Illinois Senator recoils in theatric horror at the thought of any " sweeping cut in the tariff , " just as if he were still witching audiences from the stump . But the process will not be at all what he imagines it . , Properly presented , the matter would be only one proof more of the high governmental capacity of the Republican party . The Democrats had fumbled and . blundered at the tariff knot , and now the Republicans would show them how to unloose it familiar as their garter . Party pride would thus be enlisted , and thereafter a careful selection of names to make tariff reduction smell sweet would help all to go smoothly . Slicing off the steel duties could be called . making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coal and iron ore and hides could be declared " intensified protection , " or " enlarging the sphere of the giant manufactures which are the sole creation of the tariff . " Lowering the rates on textiles could be described as " the great compensating law of protection , " while making hooks and works of art free might be pictured as a sagacious " broadening " of the definitely established principle of the high tariff . And as for the people being made nervous , or business thrown into qualms , by any project of Republican tariff revision , that could all be met by quietly assuming that nothing Republicans may do can possibly disturb anybody  --  unless it be Democrats who see their issue coolly appropriated . A conservative party is , historically , the one to do radical things . The radical party talks about them , frightens the country by its violence of language , entrenches its opponents in power ; and then the latter proceed to dish the Whigs by stealing their clothes . This is one way in which political progress is made . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its ideas upon those who can . The GoVerament is in office , very often , while it is the Opposition that is truly in power . Tins may be thought hard , politically , upon the radical party . It would doubtless prefer " the fruitful task of administration to the spent candor of criticism . " But it may find consolation in the reflection that , after all , it is ideas alone which count and live in politics ; and that to have got a political idea made militant and put in practice is the great thing , no matter what the party or the personal instrument in the work may happen to be . It will be awkward for Mr. Chamber-. lain if the Repulblican party , under the President 's lead , actually puts through a measure of tariff reform in this country . In England , " tariff reform " means just the opposite of what it does with us . There the reform contemplated is a higher tariff ; and in urging the establishment of protective duties , Mr. Chamberlain has continually harped an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Merely that he accepts all the tales about protection having made our soil rich and our laborers skilful ; he has continually pointed to our high tariff as a menace to England . To strike back at 1.18 has been one of his professed aims . So , too , Premier Balfour has defended his own policy of retaliation as one that the protective system an America has forced . upon him  --  so far has he wandered from the maxim of Sir Robert Peel , that the way to meet our protective tariffs is by making your own trade still more free . But if English statesmen now perceive that the business sense of the United States is insisting upon reforming our tariff down ( since we can not take Hamlet 's advice and reform it altogether ) , they will be less disposed to set about reforming their tariff up . That would ' be a good thing for them and for us . THE VOICE OF DISCONTENT . The Socialist vote in the national election was large enough to excite general comment The exact figures can not yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 600,000 in round numbers . This is about six times the vote of four years ago . The rapid growth of the party is shown by a table prepared by Jack London , himself a Socialist , who speaks , so far as any one can , with au-thority - lass 2,068 1892 21,512 1894 . . 30,120 1895 34,809 1696 36,275 1897 55,550 1898. 82,204 1900 98,424 1902 225,903 1904 ( estimated ) .... 600,000 This last figure , impressive in itself , is doubly significant when it is compared with what precedes Where did these votes come from ? For a detailed analysis this is neither the time nor place . The results in a few States , however , are worth considering more fully . California gave the Socialists 7,572 in 1900 , and 35,000 in 1904 ; Iowa , 2,778 in 1900 , 6,421 in 1903 , and 11,236 in 1904 ; Illinois , 10,350 in 1900 , and 150,000 in 1904 ; New York , 25,491 and-48,000 ; Rhode Island , 1,423 and 1,909 ; Massachusetts , 10,510 in 1900 , 29,812 in 1903 , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be said that the totals for 1900 and 1903 generally lump the vote divided between the two small socialistic parties , and those for this year are estimates . The statements are accurate enough to afford a basis for some general observations . The first is that in Massachusetts and Rhode Island , where the Socialist vote has been jealously watched for several years by the other parties , and where the Socialists have been openly spoken of as the gravest menace to the old alignment , the movement shows singular weakness : only a slight gain in Rhode Island and a heavy loss in Massachusetts . Many people had expected that these large manufacturing communities would remain the strongholds of Socialism ; but , through their candidates for Governor , the Democrats made a successful assault upon the so-called labor vote , from which the New England Socialists draw their main support . Gov . Garvin has always had the labor vote of Rhode Island , and he had it this year , for , though he was defeated by a plurality of a few hundred , he ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attracted the labor vote Ever since the election the Massachusetts papers have been trying to explain why ; and , moreover , why these same wage-earners also voted for Roosevelt . The mixed motives that sway large masses can never be satisfactorily analyzed . Yet this much is true : Mr. Douglas is a large employer , popular with his men ; Gov . Bates had offended the wage-earners by one or two vetoes , and President Roosevelt exercises the same potent influence in New England as in the rest of the country . When Douglas and Garvin broke up the straight Socialistic ticket , the remaining fragments were swept into the Republican whirlpool . Notwithstanding losses in New England , the Socialists are justified in venting their exultation ; for the first time they have succeeded in making a perceptible impression upon the American electorate . Their spokesmen now recall a remark attributed to the late Senator Hanna , " The next great issue this country will have to meet will be Socialism " ; and they assert that this issue is now confronting us . They recite the history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soil party , and prophesy like successes for their cause . Prediction is a hazardous business . The Socialists May be right ; but , again , they may be snuffed out like the Populists , who a decade ago seemed even more formidable , but who succeeded only in teaching the country that it is easier to be weary of the Government we have than to mend ourselves by a change We venture to doubt whether the Socialists ever secure a majority for their present rather nebulous programme . Nebulous , we say , for though many Socialists are out for definite things , such as Government ownership of all public utilities  --  say , railways , lighting plants , and waterworks  --  the party is as yet a confuSed babel of voices , in which the most strident note is the cry of the discontented . There is the mild Socialist , who would begin with the railways and telegraphs , and thus slowly and peacefully pass from victory to victory , till he ushers in a millennium in which the capitalistic lion and the oppressed lamb lie down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and temporizing ; with thewatchword , " Death to capital ! " he would offer no quarter , but would go to the limit , and go at once His banner , he shouts to us , " is blood red symbolizing the blood of man , and it preaches the passionate gospel of the brotherhood of man . " The plan " is to confiscate , with or without remuneration , all the possessions of the capitalist class which are used in the production and distribution of the necessaries and luxuries of life " ? that is , practically everything . As to ways and means he is somewhat hazy . He does not grapple with the question much more definitely than that valiant Republican , William Allen White of Kansas . Mr. White , on the morning after election , assured us that " the problems facing Theodore Roosevelt are the problems concerning the distribution of wealth . " Mr. White is convinced that the poor man does not get his share of the good things , while " the promoter , the capitalist , and the captain of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Theodore Roosevelt , the man for the hour , " the following brief sketch of a reform movement : " Laws to regulate and control Trusts ; laws to regulate and control railroad rates and service , laws to regulate and control public utilities  --  street railroads , telephones , public heating plants , telegraph companies , water companies , lighting companies , and all corporations which serve the people with necessaries and comforts of life . " Mr. White also assures us that " laws to regulate and control the man who unbridles his greed behind corporate organization to oppress the people or to swindle them , must be made in the next generation if the country is to maintain its integrity as a liberty-cherishing people . " With all this accomplished , many moderate Socialists would rest fairly satisfied If the Western Republicans can carry with them in such a crusade the capitalists of the Eastern wing of the party , they will cut the ground from under the feet of the Socialists Furthermore , a Democratic alliance which may also modify the demands of the extremists is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ futile ; for these things lie in the lap of the gods . BURDENS OF A BOSS . As the ? young American passes through the several stages of boyhood his ambitions expand . The lad of five thinks that to be a policeman is the height of earthly glory ; at eight he prefers the career of a bareback circus-rider , at ten , that of a soldier ; and at fifteen , that of the President of the Unit-id States . But when he becomes a voter and begins to comprehend the richness and fulness of the perfect life , he aspires to be a political boss . Far be it from us to discourage these lofty aims : our purpose is merely to point out that , in present conditions , the boss does not find it all beer and skittles Hercules had many things to keep him busy . Atlas is the commonly accepted type of a man with his hands full . St. Paul , after referring to his journeyings and perils , his weariness , pain , and watching , complained to the Corinthians that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But , as those who read the remarks of Gov . Odell reported in Thursday 's morning papers must admit , your modern political boss may without boasting assert that he has laid upon him at once the labors of Hercules , the burden of Atlas , and the cares of St. Paul . To enumerate the duties of a boss in the brief space of a single issue of this journal would be impossible ; we mention merely a few of the more conspicuous . First , he must teach all his subordinates , from the President of the United States down to the humblest ward-worker , to know their places . The workers are comparatively easy to handle . Like the dog , they lick the hand that feeds them , whether it strikes or not . A few crumbs at reasonable intervals , accompanied by appropriate kicks and cuffs , will keep the rank and file of minor henchmen quiet as kittens and bursting with gratitude . Ordinary legislators and Congressmen are also fairly manageable . Like the horse , they demand more kindness than the dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they are kept well fed and held with a firm hand , they make little or no trouble . For years Senator Platt drove the New York Congressmen , the State Senators , and the Assemblymen exactly as he pleased ; single or double harness , tandem , hitched to racing sulkies , broughams , drays , ploughs , or garbage carts  --  they never balked . The secret of his success was plenty of oats . Gov . Odell , we regret to note , though firmer than Platt , frequently mixes sawdust with the bran . Governors and Presidents offer a difficult problem . They often get puffed up with notions of their own importance ; are , in short , swayed by delusions of greatness . They talk so much about their duties to the people that they begin actually to imagine they are no longer responsible to the boss : They like to pose as independent executives ; they develop a canine appetite for popularity that . makes them hesitate to perform the simple and obvious duty of licking a boss 's boots in public . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to render him harmless forced him into the Vice-Presidency . Odell was worse yet , for he choked the old boss black in the face and seized the place and perquisites for himself . He is now experiencing the vicissitudes of fortune , for he has had to listen with a forced smile while Higgins declares himself " no man 's man , " and he is making little or no headway with the Presi , dent . A few days ago he tried to take down the President 's pride by telling reporters that the result in this State was not wholly due to Roosevelt 's popularity , but the effort was such a ghastly failure that Odell is now visibly perturbed . Besides treading his subordinates under foot , the boss must fill a thousand offices , and win the undying hatred of the ten thousand hungry seekers who are crowded out . Throwing such chicken-feed as clerkships to the small fry becoffies a daily pastime , but the election of a United States Senator demands time and skill . Generally , you can not settle the matter between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magnitude of the task , and he approaches it with proper humility . He does not commit himself to Black , and he will not speak harshly of poor old Depew , for whom he evidently feels sincere pity . He has , however , said frankly to Senator Platt , " The matter must be left in my hands to be worked out " " Work " is the very word . Some men have time for meals ; a few multi-millionaires and manual laborers can afford an eight-hour day ; but the toils of a boss are never ended . When Sunday comes round , and J. P. Morgan and Edward W. Bolt can rest with a light hedrt and an easy conscience , the jaded boss must turn out of bed bright and early for Sunday-school at the Fifth Avenue Hotel . Well may he envy the galley-slave his ease and freedom . Worse than all , the boss must rule single-handed ; he can " bear , like the Turk , no brother near the throne . " Brother Odell near the throne was the undoing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgotten , for even the blessed " Tapewormers , " Littauer and Ward , are not allowed within ten feet of the . dais . The Kaiser knows that all his steps are divinely guided . The President has Cabinet advisers , and he is checked by the legislative and the judicial departments . A Governor 's power is also bounded by law and precedent . But the boss is an absolute sovereign . He is responsible to no one but himself in the heavens above or the earth beneath or the waters under the earth His rights rtra4Seend , those of legiSlar ture , court , and executive , which are the mere instruments of his pleasure . This is a hard ordeal for a man of delicate conscience . He is bound by an unwritten but inflexible code to secure all the plunder he can for the machine and for himself . And yet if he takes everything in sight , the voters , who are singularly stupid about mastering the rules of the game , are likely to turn his heelers out of office . The dilemma is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boss honor and lives up to his rights , he suffers at the polls ; if he makes a show of , dividing even with the people , he might as well not be boss Pleasant enough it is to be able to say with Governor-Chairman Odell : " In my opinion a majority of the Legislature of New York will do what I may advise in party matters " ; but what shall the advice be ? Is it safe to carry away everything that is not nailed down ? How soon will an affront to public sentiment be forgotten ? How bad a man is it possible to nominate and still win ? How far must one go in pandering to the decent element ? These are the perplexing questions that a boss must answer , and answer alone , conscious that , if he guesses wrong , the jackals are waiting to glut themselves on his wretched Carcass . 117UNICIPAL EXTRAVAGANCE IN ENGLAND . While Englishmen are pondering the formidable increase of national expenditure , they receive , from time to time , uncomfortable reminders that the cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The latest shock is administered by Mr. R. J. Thompson , who has made for the Royal Statistical Society a very comprehensive study of local finance in England and Wales . The iesults of his investigation may well give food for serious reflection ; they demonstrate , indeed , that there are certain " parochial " questions which demand the attention even of men who are " imperially minded " and scorn the affairs of little England . They also suggest to the American reader the unpleasant query whether a similar study of conditions in this country would not disclose a state of affairs too much akin to that in Great Britain . The chaotic condition of English local government a generation ago made it impossible to collect complete data concerning financial affairs , and to-day comprehensive returns are available cub , for the seventeen years extending from 1885 to 1902 During this period the aggregate local expenditures defraycd out of other revenues than loans increased from ? 44,054,000 to ? 87,377 , - 000 , or about 98 per cent. ; while the outstanding debt of the local governments advanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again standing at 98 . Meanwhile the population of England and Wales has advanced not more than 20 per cent. , so that both the ordinary expenditures of the local governments and their outstanding debts have increased about five times as fast as population . If Commissioner Wright and some other American statisticians could only have been set to work upon the problem , they would , have proved , doubtless , that , although expenditures had outrun population , the wealth of England and Wales had advanced even more rapidly ; and would have shown that the figures indicated nothing more than that John Bull had been living up to his larger income . Unfortunately , however , " prosperity statistics " are an undeveloped art in England , so that our unsophisticated cousins know perfectly well that their wealth has not kept pace with the growth of local outlay . Therefore , deprived of that consolation , they are unable to contemplate the situation with unmixed satisfaction . At this point-our friends , the champions of municipal ownership , will ask , Is it not true that the increased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and is it not counterbalanced , therefore , by the revenue derived from waterworks , gas plants , and tramways ? Undoubtedly , some allowance must be made for this factor ; but when this is done the result is not materially affected . Exclusive of " reproductive undertakings , " so dear to the heart of the Fabians , local expenditures have risen from ? 38,924,000 in 1885 to ? 74 , - 045,000 in 1902 , er something more than 90 per cent. ; so that , with municipal trading left out of the account , the outlay has increased four and one-half times as fast as population . And in the case of local indebtedness the situation is the same ; debts contracted for other purposes have increased quite as rapidly as those incurred for municipal trading . Therefore , examine the figures as you will , a startling growth of expenditures is too clear to be mistaken . When we inquire how the bills have been paid , the results are of equal interest . Of the total outlay for the seventeen years , no less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has been left for future generations to settle ; and of this , less than one-half is represented by investments in municipal industries . Then , of the ? 43,323,000 of additional annual outlay , not defrayed by loans , only ? 13,648,000 is covered by increased receipts from " reproductive enterprises " and miscellaneous incomes ; leaving ? 29 , - 675,000 to be met by heavier taxation . In 1902 the imperial exchequer was charged with ? 8,900,000 of this additional weight of taxes , and local rates had to bear the remaining ? 20,680,000 . From 1885 to 1902 , grants from the Imperial treasury increased 240 per cent. , while local rates advanced 80 per cent. ; so that neither the national nor the local taxpayer has escaped the growing pressure caused by heavier expenditures . The situation is made worse by the further fact that the increase of local debt and expenditure was more rapid in the later years under examination than in the earlier . From 1885 to 1890 ordinary expenditures advanced 9 per cent. , and local indebtedness by 15 per cent. ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and indebtedness 18 per cent. ; while from 1895 to 1900 the figures were , respectively , 27 and 25 per cent . And from 1900 to 1902 , the returns indicate no tendency toward a slackening of the pace , so that the increase is not only continuous , but progressive . It is , moreover , confined to no one or two classes of local outlay , but is common to all . Some satisfaction may be found in the facts that expenditures for poor relief showed the smallest rate of increase between 1885 and 1902 , and that the greatest advance was in the outlay for education ; yet the first item can beast of an increase of 50 per cent. , so that there is no reason for excessive enthusiasm even here . The rise of local expenditures has been rapid , progressive , all-pervasive , and it is time for the subject to receive careful attention both within and without Parliament . It may be highly important to tax the laborer 's bread , or to place a protective duty upon screws and other products of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may depend upon the introduction of coolie labor . But it is desirable also to pay some heed to those little-Englanders who have to bear the pressure of local rates ; and some consideration should be given to coming generations that are to inherit the consequences of present-day extravagance . Some increase of local expenditures was , doubtless , inevitable , and for much of the money that has been spent both the present and the coming generation will have something to show . But the outlay can not continue to grow five times as fast as population without producing the most serious results ; and , through action of Parliament or in some other way , the local authorities must be taught to aim at the golden mean between parsimony and extravagance . THE ITALIAN DIALECTS . ALASSIO , October 15 , 1904 The Italian language , for all its accredited position as the language of the nation , has never been able to supersede the dialects . The traveller in Italy must be a long time in the country before he appreciates how firmly established these dialects are in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do speaks to him the best Italian at his command ; he does not at once perceive that when his interlocutor  --  be he coachman , waiter , innkeeper , shopinan , lawyer , or even professor or than of the world  --  turns to those of his own kith and kin , he talks in quite a different language , probably incomprehensible to the foreigner . There are indeed cities , like Bologna , where the language of the street is not admitted into the salotto ; but , outside of these and that favored region in the centre of Italy where the common speech excites the admiration and the envy of men born in less fortunate regions , those who among their intimates speak Italian are exceptions ? I can not say to what extent they are rare . What is more , many cities have one or two newspapers  --  generally satirical and often very clever  --  wherein the local sentiments find expression in the popular tongue . The dialect theatres are sometimes of a high order ; who that ever saw him can forget the inimitable Ferravilla @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Disgrassie de Monsii Travett " will deny that some of the best comedies of the modern rdpertoire are written in Piedmontese ? And the Venetian plays of Goldoni , if not those of mote recent writers , are famous throughout the world . But there is also noble dialect poetry , though I doubt if its fame outside of Italy is equal to its deserts How many Americans know even by name the Milanese Carlo Porta , or the Roman sonneteer G. G. Belli , notwithstanding that be has been celebrated in these very columns , or the Tuscan sonnets of the author of the " Veglie di Neri " ? It is only the student of the Risorgmento who has heard of the patriotic songs of the Turinese Brofferio , and of the part they played in the awakening of the modern Italy ; and even among those who love the by-ways of XVIIIth-century letters there can be but few who have felt the charm of the anacreontie and pastoral poetry of the Palermitan Giovanni Meli , " so ingenuous and suave that there is perhaps nothing to equal it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mostly belong to times when they were Venetian , Roman , Lombard , or Sicilian first , and Italian only in a lesser degree . To-day , when the national feeling overtops that of the region , dialect literature is but a wider expression of the family feeling , and as such it is as flourishing as ever , or rather seems everywhere on the increase , and reveals that enduring attachment to the scenes , the habits , the tongue in which he was brought up , which is so beautiful a trait in the character of the Italian It was but this morning that I was reading a comedy of Fogazzaro , written in the variety of the Venetian dialect that is spoken at Vicenza . And along with the play of Fogazzaro , there lies before me an example of a kindred variety in the ' Canxoniere Veronese ' of Berto Barbarani , whose gentle muse charms by simplicity , tenderness , and melody . Both poems and comedy are samples of the dialects of the Venetian country Veneto ) without being Venetian ( Veneziano ) . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is itself , in the matter of fixity of form , at the opposite pole from the French . The dialect has been leas dominated by its literature , has been beneath the attention of academies , and so , left to the processes of nature , has remained as fluid as the air that enters into every cranny and envelops and adapts itself to the myriad accidents of the earth 's surface .. Thus it is that , in the little community where I live , an Alassian can , blindfolded , tell from the speech alone whether persons brought to him belong to the east or the west end , or to the centre , of the town  --  to La Coseia , that is , to Berg() Barusso , or to the Piazza . It needs , however , one who is native and to the manner born to recognize the variations obtaining between places even more widely separated . No stranger , not even an Italian , I believe , could distinguish by the speech a Mantuan from a Veronese , though the difference would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The same thing may be true of the towns of the Emilia , though the variations are so considerable that a play written in the Modenese dialect has to be translated in order to adapt it to the stage of Bologna . The popular speech undergoes modifications from town to town , until at Piacenza it is a mere cadence ' that , to the ordinary ear , links it with that of Bologna , though the dialects of the two cities are still of the same group . Thus , step by step , all over Italy , each city , each village , each hamlet possesses , with its peculiar physiognomy , certain ways , observances , traditions that are all its own , and , moreover , its own language . And how deeply rooted the local characteristics are , we understand when we see how much more difficult it is to perma-nentlytransplant the Italian than the native of other countries . Hard necessity may drive him from his home , but the moment he feels that he has collected enough to live , however simply , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
