txt p 300 elements of European ethnogeny , and that in spite of the great number of historical and linguistic works published on the subject . We may , however , thanks to the progress in prehistoric , anthropological , and ethnographical studies , obtain a glimpse of the main outlines of this ethnogeny , in which history and linguistics give us often but vague , and in any case very slight information . The better to understand the distribution of races at the present day , we must cast a glance at those which are extinct , going back to geological times removed from us by several hundreds or even thousands of centuries . I. ? ANCIENT INHABITANTS OF EUROPE . Geological Times. ? The portions of Europe emerging towards the end of the tertiary period of the geological history of our globe have been inhabited by man , probably from this very time , and assuredly from the quaternary period which succeeded it ? the predecessor of the present geological period .

' It is only in quaternary beds that the presence of human bones has been ascertained beyond question . The quaternary age in Europe is characterised , as we know , by the succession of " glacial periods , " each of which comprises a greater or less extension of glaciers , followed by their withdrawal ( " interglacial periods " ) , with accompanying changes of climate . The well-known geologist Geikie 2 claims , from the end of the pliocene age to proto-historic times , the existence in Europe of six glacial periods ; but most other geologists ( Penck , Boule ) reduce this number to two or three , considering the movements of the glaciers of some of Geikie 's periods as purely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a whole . At the beginning of quaternary times the climate of Europe was not the same as that of the present day ; hot and moist , it was favourable to the growth of a sub-tropical flora . Dense forests gave shelter to animals which no longer exist in our latitudes ? the Elephas meridionalis , a survival of the pliocene age , the Rhinoceros Etruscus , etc . But soon , from causes still imperfectly known , ice began to accumulate around certain elevated points of Northern Europe ; a veritable " mer de glace " covered all Scandinavia , almost the whole of Great Britain , the emerged lands which were between these two countries , as well as the north of Germany and half of Russia.3 This is the first glacial period , or the period of the footnote 1 The so-called tertiary skeleton of Castenedolo , near Brescia , discovered by Ragazonni , is an " odd fact , " an " incomplete observation , " to use the happy phrase of Marcellin Boule , and can not be taken into account . 2 J. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marcellin Boule , " Paleontol. stratigr. de l'llomme , " Rev. d'Anthr. , Paris , 1888. a The extreme limit of the spread of glaciers to the south at that period may be indicated by a line which would pass near to Bristol , London , Rotterdam , Cologne , Hanover , Dresden , Cracow , Lemberg ; then would go round Kief on the south , Orel on the north , and rise again ( on the south of Saratov ) up to Nijni-Novgorod , Viatka , the upper valley of the Kama , to blend with the line of the watershed of this river and the Pechora ( see Map I. ) .  | great spread of glaciers ( Map I ) . Such an accumulation of ice , combined with a change of climate , which had become cold and moist , was not very favourable to the peopling of the country . Besides , if we consider that all the great mountain chains , the Alps , the Pyrenees , the Caucasian range , with their advanced peaks , were covered entirely with ice , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vicinity of Kazan on the north ( Map I ) , we shall easily understand that the habitable space thus available for man at this period in Europe was very restricted . figure France with Belgium , the south of England , the three southern peninsulas ( Iberian , Appenine , and Balkan ) , the south of Germany , Austria-Hungary , the plains of Southern Russia as far as the Volga , and the basin of the Kama , communicating on the south of the Ural by a narrow isthmus with the Siberian steppes ? these were the only countries which quaternary man could occupy . These conditions only changed at the time that the glaciers began to withdraw ( first interglacial period ) . The climate became milder again , and the Arctic flora gave place to the flora of the forests of the Temperate Zone . It is to this period that the most undoubtedly ancient vestiges of mankind in Europe are to be attributed . The men of that period have handed down to us imple-  | ments of a very rude type : fragments of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are scarcely trimmed by the removal of some flakes.l These implements are called " knuckledusters " ( G. de Mortillet ) , or " Chellean axes " ( Fig. 84 ) , from the Chelles bed in the valley of the Seine ; but such implements are found in side in numerous places ? in France ( especially in the valley of the Somme ) , in England ( valleys of the Ouse and the Thames ) , in Spain , Portugal , Austria , Belgium , etc . ' The first interglacial period , characterised , as we have just seen , by a mild and moist climate , was followed by a new glacier invasion ( second glacial period ) . This time the sea of ice did not extend as far as in the first period : it covered Ireland , Scotland , the north of England ( as far as Yorkshire ) , Scandinavia , Finland , and stopped in Germany and Russia at a line passing nearly through the present site of Hamburg , Berlin , Warsaw , Vilna , Novgorod , Lake Onega , Archangel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the glaciers , a period called " post-glacial " ( or second interglacial period ) , characterised at first by a continental climate , dry , with a very cold winter , and a short but hot summer , and by flora of the Tundras and steppes . At the end of this epoch , the climate becoming milder , there appeared the flora of the meadows and forests , which has remained to the present day.3 The harsh footnote i See G. and A. de Mortillet , Musie prlleistorique , Paris , pl. vi . to ix. ; J. Evans , Ancient Stone Implements , 2nd ed. , chap . xxiii. , London , 1897. a Frequently these implements have been found , in sufficiently deep beds , beside bones of the straight-tusked elephant ( Elephas antiquus ) , the smoothskinned , two-horned rhinoceros ( Rhinoceros Alerckii ) , the great hippopotamus ? that is to say , of animals characteristic of the first interglacial period .

Gesell. , vol. xi. , p. 187 , Vienna .  | climate of the beginning of this period could only be favourable to the preservation and growth of thick-furred animals : the mammoth or elephant with curved tusks ( Elephas1 , rirnigenius ) , the rhinoceros with divided nostrils ( R. tichorinus ) , the reindeer ( Cervus farandus ) , the saiga , the lemming , etc . The man who inhabited Europe during the two overflows of the glaciers and the two interglacial periods is known to us chiefly by the stone implements which are found in the strata of these periods , along with the bones of animals which are now extinct or which have migrated into other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ palaeolithic man used no other but stone tools or weapons . The finds of objects made out of bone , horn , stag 's horn , shell , and wood belonging to these periods are there to bear witness to the contrary . Only these finds are much more rare , on account of the ease with which bone , horn , and especially wood , decompose after a more or less prolonged stay in the ground . Basing their conclusions on the variety of the forms of the stone implements and partly on the frequent occurrence of bone objects , palmethnologists have divided the two interglacial periods which form their stone age or palceolithic ! eriod into two or three periods , according to country . It would have been better , in my opinion , to have replaced in the present instance the word " period " by the term " state of civilisation , " for these periods are far from being synchronous throughout the whole of Europe ; the Vogules and the Samoyeds were in the " stone age " hardly a century ago . Nevertheless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the first so-called Chellean " period , " characterised by the " knuckle-duster , " belongs , as we have seen ( p. 302 ) , to the first interglacial period , and that the others coincide with the second ( Boule ) . In a general way , we may distinguish in the latter a more ancient period , characterised by the abundance of mammoth bones and by smaller and more varied implements than the Chellean tool ; and a more recent period characterised by the presence of the reindeer in Central and Western Europe , by the frequent occurrence of bone tools , and 20  | by the appearance of the graphic arts , at least in certain regions . The first of these " periods " is known as the Mousterian ; it is well represented in France , Belgium , southern Germany , Bohemia , and England.l Instead of a single flint implement , the " knuckle-duster , " which was used variously in the Chellean period , with or without a handle , as an axe , hammer , and dagger , a variety of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , among others , tools needed in the manufacture of garments , blades to open and skin animals , scrapers to make their hides supple , sharp-edged awls for cutting the skin and when necessary making cords or straps from it , for piercing it and making button-holes.2 On the other hand , the use of the bow does not seem to have been known , for in the Mousterian deposits there have not been found any arrow-heads either in flint or bone . These arrowheads appear only in the next period , generally called the reindeer age ; in France styled , according to the classification of G. de Mortillet , the Magdalenian period ' 3 The man of this period was still in the hunting stage , footnote In England it is sometimes designated the " cave period " to distinguish it from the Chellean , called " River-drift " period , but this term is open to objection ; thus , for example , in the celebrated Kent cavern there have been found at the bottom implements of the Chellean type identical with certain objects of the River-drift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Windle , Life in Early Britain , p. 26 , London , 1897. ) 2 According to G. de Mortillet , Mousterian industry also differs from the Chellean in regard to technique . In the Chellean period what is utilised is the core or nucleus of the stone cut right round on both sides ; while in the Mousterian period what are fashioned are the splinters struck off from this core , which are trimmed especially on one face , the inner face remaining smooth and showing the trace of its origin under the form of a " cone " or " bulb of percussion , " which corresponds to a hollow in the block from which the splinter has been dislodged . However , implements recalling at first sight the " knuckle-duster , " but which differ from it by their amygdaloidal form and their straight edges ( Saint-Acheul type ) , are still to be found at this period . a In G. de Mortillet 's classification a yet additional period is inserted between the Mousterian and the Magdalenian . This is the So9ttrian , characterised by finely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shape of a  | but had more perfect hunting weapons than in the Mousterian period ; he was also occasionally a fisher , and probably reared the reindeer . But his especial characteristic in certain regions , as in the south-west of France , is that he was a consummate artist . He has left us admirable carvings ( Fig. 85 , B ) , and engravings on bone most expressive in design ( Fig. 85 , A ) . i After the second glacial period , the era of great overflows and withdrawals of the glaciers came to a definite close for Central Europe ; but it continued in the north , in Scotland , and especially around the Baltic , even as it is still prolonged to our own day in Greenland and Iceland . According to Geikie and De Geer , the glaciers advanced and withdrew thrice again in Scandinavia and Scotland after continental Europe was almost entirely rid of them ( Geikie 's fourth to sixth glacial periods ) . ' footnote laurel leaf . But the zone in which these implements are met with is limited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only . For many pakeethnographers this is a " facies local " of the Magdalenian period . There may be added to the masterpieces here reproduced the famous representation of the mammoth carved on the tusk of this animal itself by a man of La Madeleine ( Dordogne ) , discovered and described by Lartet ; and by Boyd Dawkins , Early Man in Brit. , p. 105 , London , 1880 . See Cartailhac , loc. cit. , p. 7z. 2 After the second interglacial period the " Great Baltic Glacier " still covered the Scandinavian peninsula , with the exception of its southern part ( Gothland ) , extended over the emerged bottom of the Baltic , over nearly the whole of Finland , and spreading round Gothland invaded the east coast of Denmark and the littoral of Germany to the east of Jutland , After the retreat of this glacier and a series of changes in the surface of the ground ( a sinking which brought the Baltic into communication with the North Sea by means of the Strait of Svealand , followed by the upheaval which cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lake of the geologists ) , the climate became milder in these parts , and the trees of Central Europe , first the pines , then the oaks and birches , penetrated into Denmark and Gothland , while in the north of Sweden there were two other new glacier movements .

Schci'ed. , Leipzig , 1896. )  | A slow sinking of the land , which submerged beneath the ocean all the countries to the north and north-east of Europe , marks the end of the quaternary period , and the beginning of the present era in the geological sense of the word . This era is characterised , from the archmological point of view , by the substitution for the " earlier stone age " ( palceolithicperiod ) of another " age , " or , better , of another stage of civilisation , that of the later stone age ( neolithic ) . However , this " age " did not come in abruptly , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , during which man retired , it was supposed , from Central Europe and emigrated towards the north after the reindeer .

Thus the Scan-dinavian peninsula , from figure footnote  | which the glaciers have not yet altogether withdrawn , was in course of formation during this periods The " neolithic folk , " settling at first in Denmark , then in Gothland , have left us in the kitchen-middens ( kitchen refuse , accumulations of shells ) certain chipped stone implements , a sort of hatchet of a special form , contemporaneous with the neolithic tools of the rest of Europe . These tools are associated in the geological beds and prehistoric stations with other objects which denote among the Europeans of this period a fairly advanced civilisation : knowledge of agriculture , pottery , the weaving of stuffs , the rearing of cattle .

As may have been seen from this brief account , it is almost perfectly well known what were the stages of civilisation of the Europeans in the quaternary and neolithic periods . It is different with regard to the physical type of these Europeans . In fact , of interglacial man , contemporary of the Eleplzas antiquits , the maker of those flint implements exhumed from the lowest beds of the oldest quaternary alluvia , we have no remains , except perhaps two molar teeth , found by Nehring in the Taubach station ( near Weimar ) , and some other disputed fragments ( Neanderthal , Brux , and Tilbury skulls ) . This statement , made for the first time by Boule in 1888 , is now admitted by many paltethnologists.2 As far as man contemporary footnote I There was yet to take place another sinking of the ground which established a communication , by means of the Sound , between the " Ancylus Lake " of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a very salt and warm sea called , from the principal fossil which reveals to us its existence , the Littorina Sea . 2 Nehring , Zeitschr .

As to the skulls of the " reindeer " age ( Magdalenian period ) , three only are known which are not called in question : these are the skulls of Laugerie-Basse , Chancelade ( Dordogne ) , and Sordes ( Landes ) . Perhaps we should include among them the skulls of uncertain date , like those of Bruniquel , Engis , Sargels ( near Larzac ) , and perhaps others which certain authorities classify as belonging to mesolithic and even neolithic times : the three skulls of Cro-Magnon ( Dordogne ) ; the six so-called Mentone skulls ( Baousse-Rousso , Maritime Alps ) ; the skulls of the 7you de Frontal at Furfooz ( Belgium ) , of Solutrd ( Valley of the Saone ) , Bohuslan ( near Stangenas , Sweden ) , Clichy and Grenelle ( Paris ) .

These then , even admitting the authenticity of their date , would only be isolated precursors of the neolithic brachycephals with whom we shall deal further on . Let us return to our paheolithic dolichocephals . These appear to belong to two distinct types , the so-called Neanderthal or Spy type , referred to the Mousterian period , very well footnote represented by the skulls and bones found at Spy , near Namur in Belgium ; then the type of the Magdalenian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chancelade ( Dordogne ) . The first of these types is characterised by marked dolichocephaly ( ceph. ind . from 70 to 75.3 ) , by the exceedingly low and retreating forehead , by the prominent brow ridges ( Fig. 86 ) , and probably by a low stature ( about r m. 59 ) . Several pithecoid characters are observable on the skull and bones of this type , the presence of which has been noted , from England ( skull from Bury St. Edmunds , in Suffolk ) , Belgium ( Spy skull , La Naulette jaw ) , and perhaps the  | Rhenish province ( Neanderthal skull ) , to the Pyrenees ( jaw found at Malarnau , Ariege ) , Bohemia , Moravia ( Predmost and Podbaba skulls ) , and Italy ( Olmo skull ) . like all the other prehistoric races , that of Neanderthal or Spy has not entirely disappeared ; Neanderthaloid skulls are found , few in number it is true , in several prehistoric or historic burial-places ( at Furfooz in Belgium , in the dolmens of France , England , Ireland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some rare individuals may still be observed in the populations of the present day showing the characters of this race , according to the statements of Roujoux , Quatrefages , Virchow , Isollmann , and other anthropologists . ) The second so-called l.augerie-Chancelade race ( Herve ) is represented at the present day by only three or four skulls and some other bones found at LaugerieBasse , Chancelade ( Dordogne ) , and Sordes ( Landes ) . It is characterised by a dolichocephaly almost equal to that of the preceding race , but it differs from it in the high and broad forehead , the capacious skull , the absence of the brow ridges , the high orbits , and especially the face with projecting cheekbones , high and broad at the same time ( Fig. 87 ) . Its stature footnote 1 The instances of the skull of Saint Mensuy , an Lrish bishop , and others , are universally known . See on this subject , Godron , lllem . Acad . Slanis'as , p. 50 , Nancy , 1884 ; Worthington Smith , Ulan , the Primeval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ W. Borlase , ' Tae Dolmens of Ireland , vol. iii. , p. 922 , London , 1897. figure  | is rather low . This i.3 the type to which approximates the race of the Baumes-Claaudes of Herve or the true race of Cro-Magnon , which appeared quite at the end of the Magdalenian , if not at the transitional or mesolithic period . The latter race differs from the former in its very pronounced dolichocephaly ( ceph. ind . from 63 to 74.8 ) , its lower face and orbits , its very lofty stature ( from rm. 71 to rm. 8o ) , and many other characters . ' We see then , at the beginning of the neolithic period , the second quaternary dolichocephalic race still existing slightly modified , but we also see the earliest brachycephals appearing along with it . Several hundred skulls , found in neolithic burial-places in France , Switzerland , Austria , and Germany , exhibit an intermixture of brachycephals and dolichocephals .

But if the " neolithic " people of France and Central Europe belonged to at least two distinct races , the same has not been the case with the other countries of our continent . In the British Isles we find ourselves , on the contrary , as regards this period , in presence of a remarkable homogeneity of type ; it is without exception dolichocephalic ( cephal. ind . from 65 to 75 for the men ) , with elongated faces , such as are found in the longbarrows . Did they come from the Continent in neolithic times , or are they the descendants of the pala olithic men of Great Britain , the physical type of which is unknown to us ?

In fact , the copper weapons are hammered or cast after the pattern of the stone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been found ornaments in bronze ( precious metal rarely ) by the side of tools and arms in copper ( ordinary metal ) . The existence of a " copper age " is , however , admitted to-day by almost all authorities , who regard it as an experimental period ; it supplies one of the arguments in favour of the theory that the bronze industry did not come from the East ( from the shores of the Euxine , Egypt , Mesopotamia , India , or IndoChina , according to different authors ) , as was thought until recent times , but sprang up locally in Europe itself . The complete absence of oriental objects , for instance Assyrian cylinders or Egyptian sculptured scarabmi in the finds of the bronze age in Europe , is an argument in favour of the new theory , maintained chiefly by Salomon Reinach in France and Much in Austria .

In Scandinavian countries the first iron age lasted till the sixth century , and the second iron age till the tenth century A.D. The physical type of the inhabitants of Europe during the bronze age varies according to country . In England they were sub-brachycephals ( ceph. ind . 81 ) , of whom the remains found in the " round barrows " have been described by Thurnam and Beddoe . In Sweden and Denmark they were dolichocephals or mesocephals , tall and fair-haired , as far as one can gather from the remains of hair found in the burialplaces ( Montelius and S. Hansen ) . In the valley of the Rhine and Southern Germany they were typical dolichocephals , above the medium stature ( type of the " Reihengraber " or row-graves , established by Holder and studied by Ranke , LehmannNietsche , and others ) .

The ages of bronze and iron , as we have seen , overlapped , in certain regions , the historic period , the period of the Phoenician voyages , the development of Egypt , the origin of Greek civilisation ; and yet it is very difficult to say to what peoples known to history must be attributed the characteristic civilisations of each of the periods of the age of metals , and footnote This term , used first in Germany , is accepted by almost all men of science .

Most historians believed until quite recently that the Euscarians , and perhaps the Ligurians or Lygians of Western Europe , as well as the Iberians , the Pelasgian Tursans or Tursesl of the three southern peninsulas of our continent , were the " autochthones , " or rather the oldest European peoples known to history . These would then be the probable descendants of the palaeolithic Europeans , the races of Neanderthal , Spy , and Chancelade . Further , according to the philologists and historians , these peoples spoke non-Aryan languages , and at a certain period , which D'Arbois de Jubainville 2 places vaguely at twenty or twenty-five centuries B.C. , Europe was invaded by the Aryans , coming from Asia , who imposed their languages on the autochthones . The Basque language of the present day , derived from the Euscarian , is the only dialect surviving this transformation . The central point for the ethnographic history of Europe is , according to the philologists , the arrival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nobody quite knows . It is no part of my plan to write the history of the Aryan controversy.3 It is enough to say that men of acknowledged authority in science ( Pott , Grimm , Max Muller ) have maintained for a long time , without any solid proof , the existence not only of a primitive Aryan language , which gave birth to the dialects of nearly every people of Europe , but also of an " Aryan race , " supposed to have sprung up " somewhere " in Asia , one part migrating towards India and Persia , while the remainder made its way by slow stages to Europe . Generations of scientific men have accepted this . hypothesis , which , after all , had no other foundation than such aphorisms as " ex oriente lux " put forward by Pott , or " the irresistible impulse towards the west " invented by footnote 1 Together with the Sards , the Turses are the only European peoples of which the Egyptian inscriptions anterior to the thirteenth century B.C. make mention , under the name of Shordana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1894 ) . 2 D'Arbois de Jubainville , Les Am-lens Habitants de 1'Europe , new ed. , vol. i. , p. 201 , Paris . 3 See for this history , Isaac Taylor , The Origin of the Aryans , chap . i. , London , 189o , and S. Reinach , L'origine des Aryens , Paris , 1892.  | Grimm . It must , however , be mentioned that objections against this hypothesis by recognised authorities were raised as soon as it was promulgated ; they came from philologists like Latham ( 1855 ) , ethnographers like d'Omalius d'Halloy , anthropologists like Broca ( 1864 ) ; but it was only about 188o that a somewhat lively reaction took place against the current ideas , and it originated in the camp of the philologists themselves . De Saussure , Sayce , and others , returning to the ideas expressed long before by Benfey , rightly observed that the assumed close relationship between Sanscrit and Zend and the primitive Aryan language rests solely on the fact of the archaic forms of these two dialects being preserved to the present time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not possess documents so ancient . They said further , that the European languages of the present day , such as Lithuanian , for example , are much nearer the primitive Aryan forms than the Asiatic dialects , Hindu for example . As to the Asiatic origin of the Aryans , a somewhat rude blow was struck at this second hypothesis by Poesche and Penka , who , taking up the ideas of Linne and d'Omalius d'Halloy on the exclusive existence in Europe of fair-haired populations , identified these populations , without any proof , it is true , with the Aryans . ' In reality , the hypothesis of the fair-haired " Aryan race , " tall and dolichocephalic ( Fig. 88 ) , indigenous to Europe , does not rest on a firmer foundation than that of the " Aryan race " coming from Asia . Anthropology is powerless to say if the ancient owners of the dolichocephalic skulls in Southern Europe spoke an Aryan language or not .

This civilisation , as reconstituted by O. Schrader , differs much from that which Pictet had sketched out in his essay on " Linguistic Palaeontology . " This was something analogous to the neolithic civilisation ; metals were unknown in it ( with the exception , perhaps , of copper ) , but agriculture and the breeding figure Northern Race . of cattle had already reached a fair stage of development . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ non-Aryan languages had not been in possession of the same civilisation , which with them would be developed in an independent manner . Hence we see the uselessness of looking for a centre from which this Aryan culture might have proceeded . The only question which we may still ask ourselves is , what was the point from which diffusion of the Aryan languages in  | Europe began . This point no one at the present time seeks any longer in Asia . It is in Europe , and what we have to do is to define it ( S. Reinach ) . Latham and d'Omalius d'Halloy located the habitat of the primitive Aryans in the south or south-east of Russia . Penka had placed it in Scandinavia . Other learned authorities have selected intermediate points between these extremes.l On the whole , the Aryan question to-day has no longer the importance which was formerly given to it . All that we can legitimately suppose is that , in the period touching the neolithic age , the inhabitants of Europe were Aryanised from the point of view of language , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or , probably , of their civilisation . Migrations of European Peoples during the Historic Period. ? It would require volumes to relate even succinctly all the movements and dislocations of European peoples . We can only recall here the more salient facts . The confirmation afforded by history respecting European populations does not go farther back than the eighth or ninth century n.c. for the Mediterranean district , and than the second or third century B.C. for the rest of Europe . But proto-historic archeology makes us acquainted with a movement of peoples between the tenth and the eleventh century B.C. The Dorians footnote ' According to Hirt , " Die Urheimat . . . d . Indogermanen , " Geo , r . Zeitscla. , vol. i. , p.649 , Leipzig , 1895 , the home of dispersion of the primitive Aryan language would he found to the north of the Carpathians , in the LettoLithuanian region . From this point two linguistic streams would start , flowing round the mountains to the west and east ; the western stream , after spreading over Germany ( Teutonic languages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upper valley of the Danube , and filtered through on the one side into Italy ( Latin languages ) , on the other side into Iilyria , Albania , and Greece ( Helleno-Illyrian languages ) . The eastern stream formed the Slav languages in the plains traversed by the Dnieper , then spread by way of the Caucasus into Asia ( Iranian languages and Sanscrit ) . In this way we can account , on the one hand , for the less and less marked relationship between the different Aryan languages of the present day and the common primitive dialect , and , on the other hand , the diversity between the two groups of Aryan languages , western and eastern .  | and the inhabitants of Thessaly penetrated at this date into Greece and forced a portion of the inhabitants of this country ( the Achwans , the Eolians ) to seek refuge on the nearest coast of Asia Minor . About the same period the Tyrrhenians or Turses ( a small section of the Pelasgians ) moved into Central Italy , taking with them the Mycenian civilisation , somewhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This nation drove back the Ombro-Latins or Pa/lutes , who , in their turn , expelled the Sicules ( a branch of the Ligurians , according to D'Arbois de Jubainville ) in Sicily . The Venetes and the Illyrians made their appearance at nearly the same period on the coasts of the Adriatic , and the Thracians in present Bosnia . Central Europe was occupied , probably from this period , by Celtic populations who , from their primitive country between the upper Danube and the Rhine , spread into the valley of the Po ( bronze age of the " terramare , " sites or foundations of prehistoric huts ) , in the middle valley of the Danube ( Hallstatt ) , and later ( seventh century B.C. ? ) into the north of Gaul , whence they reached the British Isles ( " ancient Celts " of the English archmologists , " Gaelic Celts " of the philologists ) . " It was also about the tenth century B.C. that the Scythians , established in Southern Russia some time before , spread themselves towards the mid-Danube . About @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of peoples .

The more audacious of them continued their course across Thrace and penetrated into Asia Minor , where they established themselves in the country , since known as Galatia ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the third century ) , which may be called Celtic , by analogy with that which followed , figure styled the Roman period , history mentions the Germans as a people similar to the Celts , and dwelling to the north-east of the latter . The Roman conquest of transalpine Europe , effected in the first centuries l.c. and A.D. , imposed the language of Latium on the majority of Celts , Iberians , and Italo-Celts , and maintained the populations within almost the same bounds during three centuries . The period extending from the second to the sixth century  | of the Christian era comprises the great historic epoch of the " migrations of peoples . " In this period we see the Slays spreading in all directions : towards the Baltic , beyond the Elbe , into the basin of the Danube and beyond , into the Balkan peninsula ; this movement determined that of the Germans , who invaded the south-east of England ( Angles , Saxons , Jutes ) , Belgium , the north-east of France ( Franks ) , Switzerland , and Alsace ( Alemanni @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and spread even beyond the Alps ( Longobards ) . The Celts in their turn pushed the Iberians farther and farther into the south-west of France and Spain , while the Italo-Celts absorbed little by little the rest of the Etruscans and I.igurians . Towards the end of this period a final wave of invasion , that of the Huns ( fifth century ) , the Avars ( sixth ) , and other allied tribes , once more threw Europe into a state of perturbation ; they spread out into the plains of Champagne , then drew back , severed the Slays into two groups ( northern and southern ) ,  | and subsided in the plains of Hungary , already partly occupied for several centuries by the Dacians . Almost at the same time the Bulgarians removed from the banks of the Volga to both sides of the Danube . After the sixth century other ethnic movements , less general , but not less important , occurred in every part of Europe . In the eighth or ninth century the invasion of the Varecks ( Scandinavians or Letts ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ninth century the Hungarians , pushed by the tribes of the Pechenecks and the Polovtsis who invaded the south of Russia , crossed the Carpathians and settled in the valley of the Tissa . From the ninth or tenth century , the Normans or Northmen ( Danes , Scandinavians ) established themselves in the north and east of the British Isles as well as the north of France , a part of which still bears their name . Almost at the same time ( tenth to eleventh century ) the Arabs made themselves masters of the Iberian peninsula , of Southern Italy and Sicily ; they maintained their position to the south of the Guadalquivir until the fifteenth century . In the twelfth century the Germans drove back the western Slays to the banks of the Vistula , which led to the expansion of the eastern Slays towards the north-east at the expense of the Finnish tribes . In the thirteenth century came the Mongols , or rather the Turco-Mongolian hordes ; they occupied the whole of Russia ( as far as Novgorod in the north ) , and penetrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon withdrew from Western Europe , but remained until the fifteenth century in the east of Russia , and even until the eighteenth century in the Crimea and the steppes of southern Russia . Finally , the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries witnessed the invasion of the Osmanli Turks into the Balkan peninsula , Hungary , and even into lower Austria , as well as the migrations of the Little Russians into the upper basin of the Dnieper . About the sixteenth century began the definite movement of the Little Russians towards the steppes of Southern Russia , and the slow but sure march of the Great Russians beyond the Volga , the Ural mountains , and farther , into Siberia ? a movement which continues in our own time .  | We can only mention other migrations or colonisations of a more limited range , that of the Illyrians and Albanians into Southern Italy , that of the Germans in Hungary and Russia , etc. , as well as the arrival of non-European peoples , Gypsies and Jerus , who are scattered at the present day among all the nations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PRESENT DAY .

I have thus succeeded in distinguishing the existence of six principal and of four secondary races , the combinations of which , in various proportions , constitute the different " European peoples " properly so called , distinct from the peoples of other races , Lapp , Ugrian , Turkish , Mongolian , etc. , which are likewise met with in Europe .

It is characterised by a very rounded skull ( average ceph. ind . on the living subject from 85 to 87 ) ; by shortness of stature ( rm. 63 or rm. 64 on an average ) ; by brown or black hair , light or figure dark brown eyes , rounded face , thick-set figure ( Fig. 98 , perceptibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mesocephalic , tall race , Littoral or AtlantoMediterranean race , so styled because it is found in a pure or mixed state along the shores of the Mediterranean from Gibraltar to the mouth of the Tiber , and on several points of  | the Atlantic coast , from the straits of Gibraltar to the mouth of the Guadalquivir , on the Bay of Biscay , in the lower valley of the Loire , etc .

Linguistic study being older than anthropological study , the classing of the best known peoples in Europe is that which is based on difference of language . Nearly every one knows that the ethnic groups of our continent are as a consequence distributed into " Aryan " and an-Aryan peoples . The former are divided ( I ) into three great linguistic families , Latin or Roman in the south-west of Europe , Teutonic in the centre and north , Slav in the south-east and east ; and ( 2 ) into three smaller ones : Celtic in the extreme north-west of the continent , Helleno-Illyrian in the extreme south-east , and Letto-Lithuanian in the centre . As to the non-Aryan group , it comprises the Basques , the Finno- Ugrians , the Turks , the Mongols , the Semites , and the Caucasian peoples . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Bull . Soc .

What , for example , have the two Latin peoples , the Portuguese and Romans , in common ? or the two Slav peoples , like the Kashoobs , fair , short ; thick-set , peaceful cultivators of the plain , and the Montenegrins , dark , tall , slender , warlike shepherds of the mountain ? What more striking contrast can we imagine than that between a Norwegian , tall and fair , a bold sailor , whose flag floats in every port of the world , and a Tyrolese of the north , dark and short , a sedentary cultivator of the soil , whose horizon is bounded by the summits of his mountains ? However , both these are included in the " Germanic " group . Nevertheless , and only to bring out better the differences between linguistic divisions and those of ethnography and ethnology , I shall rapidly pass in review the " peoples " of Europe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ETHNIC " ARYAN " GROUPS . I. Latin or Roman Peoples , that is to say speaking languages derived from the Latin . The majority of philologists divide them into seven distinct groups , viz. , French of the north , Languedocian-Catalan , Spanish , Portuguese-Galego , Italian , RomanschLadino , and Rumanian. i . The French group of the north , or the Langue d'oil , comprises the populations ( Fig. 98 ) on the north of the line which , starting from the Gironde , passes by Angouleme , Montmorillon , Montlucon , Lyons , and the crests of the Jura , to terminate in the neighbourhood of Berne in Switzerland ) . Among the numerous dialects recognisable in it , we must make special mention of LL " allon , spoken in the southern part of the department of the north in France , and in the southern half of Belgium , 2 in the commune of Malmedy in Prussia , and in footnote 1 Ch. de Tourtoulon and Bringuier , " Limite . . de la langue d'oc , etc. , " Arch .

Northern French is likewise spoken in the west part of Lorraine and lower Alsace annexed to Germany , as well as in several places in upper Alsace. 2 . The Languedocian-Catalan group , or the Langue d'oc , situated south of the line referred to above , comprises four great dialectal divisions which make a distinction between figure the Gascons ( south of the Garonne ) ( Figs. 99 and ioo ) and the Languedocians and Provencals ( Fig. 94 ) , while admitting the mixed so-called Rhodanian group ( basin of the upper Rhone , Roman Switzerland , Savoy , and the French valleys of Piedmont ) and the Catalan group ( Roussillon in France , footnote 1 H.

The Spanish group comprises the peoples of Castillian language , that is to say , the whole population of Spain , with the exception of the Catalans and the inhabitants of Galicia ; the latter speak Galego , an idiom allied to Portuguese , and form with the population of Portugal our fourth linguistic group , Galego-Portuguese. footnote 3 . The Italian group comprises the Italians 1 of the peninsula , of Sicily , Sardinia , and the inhabitants of Corsica , of southern Tyrol ( south of Botzen ) , of the Swiss canton of Tessin , and of the coast of Istria and Dalmatia . The Italian dialect enters also into the constitution of the Maltese jargon , derived for the most part from the Arabic . 6 . The Romansch-Ladino or Rheto-Roman group is formed footnote 1 F. Pulle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . p . Anln , 1898 ( with maps ) .  | by the Romansc7zes of the southern part of the canton of Grisons ( German Switzerland ) and by the Ladinos of the south-figure figure east of Tyrol ( Groedner Thal , etc . ) . These are probably the remnants of the old Alpine population , having adopted the language of the Roman legionaries of the time of the conquest .  | They are , moreover , in process of extinction as a linguistic unit ; their language gives place to Italian in the Tyrol , to German in Switzerland . It is the same with the Friulans who are related to this group , and who inhabit the basin of the Tagliamento in Venetia. 7 . The Rumanian group comprises the Rumanians who are found , beyond Moldo-Wallachia , again in Transylvania ( Austria ) , the south-east of Hungary , the north-east of Servia , Bessarabia , and in the lower valley of the llniester ( south-west of Russia ) . To the Rumanians are related the Aromunes or Matzo-Vlahlzs , or Zinzars of Epirus and Macedonia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by contact with Turks , Greeks , and Albanians . ) There is no unity of type in any of these seven Latin linguistic families . Among the Languedocian-Catalans we distinguish the presence of at least three races : Western or Cevenole , which prevails on the central table-lands of France , Littoral or Atlanto-Mediterranean , predominant in Provence and Catalonia ; Ibero-insular , which we find in Angoumois as in Catalonia ( see p. 329 , and Map 2 ) . In the same way we may perceive in the Italian group the existence of representatives of almost all the European races ( except the Northern ) ; we have only to recall the striking contrast between the Venetian , tall , chestnut coloured , brachycephalic , and the inhabitant of Southern Italy , short , dark , and dolichocephalic .

The Germans of the north ( Saxons , Hanoverians , etc. ) speak low German ( plaitDeutsch , nieder-Deutsch ) .

" Let us take , for example , the Anglo-Frisians . We find among them at least three races in manifold combinations . The Northern race ( see p. 328 , and Map 2 ) is prevalent in the Frisian countries of figure Germany and Holland , as well as in that part of England situated north of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ east coast , south of this line ( Figs. 88 , 91 , and 97 ) . The secondary North-west race preponderates in the centre of England ( counties of Oxford , Hertford , and Gloucester , Fig. ' or , etc. ) , while the influence of the secondary Sub-  | northern race is especially felt in the counties of Leicester and Nottingham , and on the south coast , with the exception of Cornwall and Devon , where the Northern and North-western races are counter-balanced ( Fig. 92 ) . In Scotland the Northern type is often disguised by the dark colouring of the figure hair ( Figs. 95 and 96 ) . The Scandinavian group is fairly homogeneous , especially formed as it is of the Northern race ( Figs. 88 to 90 ) . But in the German group diversities reappear , and we find in it elements of almost all the races of Europe except the Littoral and Ibero-insular ones . III . The Slav peoples may be divided into three great  | linguistic groups ? eastern , western , and southern.1 The eastern group comprises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 105 ) , the Little Russians or Malorousses , otherwise called Ukrainians or Ruthentizus , and the Bielorousses or White Russians . The latter inhabit the upper basins of the Dnieper , the Dwina , and the Vistula as far as the river Pripet ( a tributary of the Dnieper ) , which separates them from the Little Russians . As to the boundary between these and the Great Russians , it follows an undulating line from the town of Souraj towards the Don , then a little to the north of the province of Kharkov , and thence to the south as far as the shores of the Sea of Azov . The Little Russians of eastern Galicia and Bukovina are known by the collective name of Ruthenians , or the local names of Gorales ( mountaineers ) , Huzules , Boiki , Tukholtsi , etc . The colonisers of eastern and northern Russia have been Great Russians ; the Little Russians have founded colonies in the south-east of Russia . The western Slav group is composed of Poles of Russian Poland , western Galicia , Posen , and eastern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhat common in Lithuania ; of Wends or Lujichanes or Sorobes , of the kingdom of Saxony and the Prussian province of Saxony ( several thousands are in process of being germanised ) , of Czechs or Bohemians of Bohemia , and of a part of Moravia , of Slovaks , of Moravia and Hungary . As to the southern group , it comprises the Slovenes or Slovintsi of Carniola and the interior of Istria ( AustriaHungary ) , and the Serbo-Croats , known by the name of Khorvates in Hungary , of Serbs in Servia , of Morlaks , footnote 1 See for the Slav languages : A.

The Servian tongue is also spoken in a portion of Macedonia . The Slav colonies which still existed some centuries ago in Greece and Thessaly must have been formed largely of Serbo-Croats . We must , lastly , include in this group the Bulgarians , a people of Turco-Finnish origin , slavonised for at least ten centuries ; their habitat is in Bulgaria , Rumelia , a part of Macedonia , and several localities of Turkey . There exist several Bulgarian colonies in Russia ( Crimea , northern shore of the Sea of Azov ) . No greater homogeneity is shown by the Slav group than by the two great preceding ones , from the point of view of corporeal structure , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Among the Slav peoples there is an interblending , as far as is known at present , of three principal and three secondary races , without taking into account the TurcoUgrian elements . The traits of the secondary Vistulian race appear especially among the Poles of Prussia and Russia ; the Eastern race is most marked in the White Russians , but is also met with among the Great Russians , the Mazours , and the Wends ; the Adriatic race characterises the SerboCroats , as well as certain Czechs and Ruthenians ; the subAdriatic race is well represented by a section of the Czechs , while numerous elements of the Western race are met with among the Slovaks , the Little Russians , and certain Great Russians . Joined to the three great linguistic groups of Aryan peoples which we have just characterised are three others , less considerable but not less interesting , their manner of speech perhaps being nearer to the primitive Aryan tongue . These are the Letto-Lithuanian , Helleno-Illyrian , and Celtic groups . The peoples of the first group are the Letts of Livonia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the provinces of Vilna , Grodno , the north of Russian Poland , as well as western Prussia , where they are germanised for the most part . The majority of the Letts belong to the Northern or Sub-  | northern race , while the Lithuanians exhibit elements of the Sub-northern and Eastern race . Among the peoples of the Helleno-Illyrian group the Greeks arc distributed outside the political frontiers of the kingdom of Greece , in Epirus , and on the coast of Macedonia and the Propontis . Greek colonies are found in the rest of figure Turkey , in southern Russia , and in the south-east of Italy ( province of Lecce , Terra d'Otranto ) . The Albanians or Skiptars form a people whose linguistic affinities are little known . Two sub-divisions are recognised , formed of very distinct elements from the physical point of view : the Gegs and the Mirdites on the north , the Tosks on the south .  | Albanian colonies are found in Greece , in the south of Italy ( Basilicata , Calabria , and Sicily ) , and Corsica ( in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Greeks , and still require to be studied . The Albanians of the north appear to be connected with the Adriatic or sub-Adriatic race , but nothing is known about the southern Albanians . The figure Albanian colonists in Italy and Corsica have the same physical traits as the surrounding population . The peoples speaking Celtic languages are divided into two sections according to dialect : the Gaelic section comprises the Celts of the north-west of Scotland , the west of Ireland , and the Isle of Man . The second or Cymric section is composed of the inhabitants of Wales ( Welsh language ) and  | of Brittany ( Bas Breton ) . The Cornish language , spoken two centuries ago in Cornwall , is now a dead language . The other Celtic dialects are also destined to disappear owing to the spread of such highly developed and widely known languages as English and French . There is no " Celtic " type or race . The Gaels of Scotland , as well as the Irish of Munster , appear to be connected with the Northern race ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the secondary North-western race , which is predominant among the Welsh , and which is found again modified in Cornwall and in Devon ( Fig. 92 ) , by side , perhaps , of the remnants of Neolithic types ; and lastly , the Low Bretons belong to the Western race , more or less intermixed , like the French of the central table-land . ' B. ? AN-ARYAN PEOPLES . As we have already said , peoples speaking Aryan tongues are not the only ones to inhabit Europe . We find in it the representatives of other linguistic families : Basque , FinnoUgrian , Turkish , Mongolian , Semitic , etc . The Basques inhabit the extreme south-west corner of France ( in the department of the Basses Pyrenees ) and the adjoining part of Spain , provinces of Guipuzcoa and Biscay ( as far as Bilbao on the west ) , and the north of the provinces of Navarre and Alava . The affinities of their agglutinous language have not yet been clearly determined . As to their physical type , it is also quite peculiar .

The western Finns are divided into Finns properly so called or Suomi , Baltic Finns , and Karelians . The Suomi ( in the singular Suomalaiset ) occupy Finland , with the exception of certain points on the coast , taken by the Swedes ; they are sub-divided into several small sections , according to their dialects : Savolaks , Tavasts , Kvenes or Kvanes . The latter inhabit the north of Sweden . The Baltic Finns , formerly very numerous , are reduced to two peoples , the Esthonians or Esths of the Russian provinces of Esthonia and Livonia , with the adjacent islands ( Osel , Dago , etc. ) ; and the Livonians , quartered to the number of 2000 at the extremity of the north coast of Kurland ; they have entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

More to the south , in the middle basin of the Volga , as far as about the both degree of north latitude , we find the southern group of the Ugrians composed of Cheremiss ( Fig. ro6 ) on the left bank of the upper Volga and of Mordva or Mordvinians on both banks of the middle Volga in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We may class among the Finns , for linguistic reasons , three peoples differing from each other as much as they are distinguished from the groups I have just mentioned .

They appear to have been formerly spread much more to the south of their present habitat . They are the shortest in stature of all Europeans , and almost the most brachycephalic ( see Appendices I. and II . ) . One portion only of the Samoyeds inhabits Europe , on the east of the river Mezen and to the north of the polar circle ; the rest wander about Siberia between the Arctic Ocean and the lower Obi .

All who have seen the ethnographical maps of the Caucasus must have been struck by the motley appearance which they present ; fifty various figure tribes may in fact be counted in this isthmus , the area of which is less than that of Spain .

The Caucasians are sub-divided into four linguistic or ethnic groups : the Cherkess ( on the north-west of the Caucasian range ) , the Lesgian Chechen ( on the north-east of the range ) , the Kartvels or Georgians ( on the south-west of the range ) , and the Ossets ( in the centre of the range on both slopes ) . The last , by their language , are the nearest to the Iranians and the Armenians , but the three other groups form a perfect linguistic unit . The dialects which they speak preserve the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which has nothing in common with any other . The Cherkess or Circassians , until the middle of this century , inhabited all the western part of Ciscaucasia ; but , since the conquest of their country by the Russians , they have emigrated en masse into the Ottoman empire . At the present day there are only a few remnants of them in the Caucasus . Principal tribes , Abkhazians , Adighe or Cherkess ( Circassians ) properly so called , Kabards of the plain , Abadzeh , Chapsugh , etc . The Chechen-Lesgians are divided , as the name implies , into two groups : the Chechen ( with the Ingushes , the Kists , etc. ) of the upper basin of the Terek , who have long been considered as a population apart ( Figs. to and III ) , and the Lesgians of Daghestan . These last are sub-divided into five great sections , according to their dialects : ( I ) The Avars-Ands , with the Dido , whose language tends to preponderate owing to the historic part played by the tribe of the Avars , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Caucasus , whose memory still lives . ( 2 ) The Dargha in the centre of Daghes. ' an , the best known tribe of which is that of the Kubachi , living in little houses piled one above the other on the sides of the mountains . ( 3 ) The Kurines of the Samur basin , with the Tsaklzurs ( Tabassaurans , etc. ) . ( 4 ) The Laks or Kazi-Kumyks , with which are connected lesser known tribes , like the Agin , the Budukh , and the Khinalugh , whose  | language is distinct from all the other dialects of Daghestan. ( 5 ) The Udes , an ancient Christian tribe converted to Islamism , of which there remain but 750 individuals still acquainted with their mother-tongue ( district of Nukha , province of Elisabetpol ) . The Kartvels , Karthli or Georgians , who alone of the figure Caucasians possess a special mode of writing , and a literature , are divided into three linguistic sections : ( 1 ) Gruzin , which comprises the Georgians tr.V erly so called of the plains of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Khevsurs , Pshays , and Toushs , 21,300 in all ) , and the Imers ( Fig. 109 ) with the Gurians.

( 3 ) The Swan section , comprising the tribe of Swanet or Swanetians , driven back into the unhealthy regions of the province of Kutais , where the race degenerates ; cretins and those afflicted with goitre form a third part of the population . The Ossels , while speaking a language which ( in the Digorian dialect ) is nearly allied to Iranian , have nevertheless figure much in common with the other Caucasians , from whom they are distinguished perhaps by the frequent occurrence of fair hair ( co per cent. ) and light eyes ( 29 per cent. ) ; more frequent than among all the other Caucasian peoples , the Imers , the Lesgi-Dido , and the Chechen excepted . But figures are still too inadequate in regard to the number of subjects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent. ) to enable us to affirm , as all authors from Am . Marcellinus to our own days have done , that the Ossets are a people of fair  | race . They are above the average in stature ( rm. 68 ) , and sub-brachycephalic ( ceph. ind . on the liv . sub . 82.6 ) . As to the somatic characters of the other Caucasians , we know little of those of the Cherkess ( sub-brachycephalic , of medium height ) , but we are better informed in regard to the Lesgians and the Kartvel . The contrast between the two groups is striking . The Lesgians are very brachycephalic ( see Appendix II. ) , especially the tribes of the east ; their stature is figure fairly high . To these characters are united others which , in their totality , produce the most singular effect ; the prominent nose , straight or curved , recalls the Semites , while the projecting cheek-bones , broad face , and angles of the lower jaw directed outward , suggest the Mongols ; lastly , the whole aspect becomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes , and fair or chestnut hair , so common among the Lesgians ( Figs. rro and rrr ) . Quite different are the characters of the Kartvel . In the first  | place , they form a less homogeneous group ; we must distinguish in it between the eastern and the western Georgians . The former ( Gruzins ) are true brachycephals , though in a lesser degree than the Lesgians , while the latter ( Mingrelians , Imers ) are distinguished from all the other Caucasians by the elongated form of the head ( see Appendix II . ) . The stature varies in harmony with the cranial forms ; the Kartvel tribes with rounded heads have the shortest stature , and the dolichocephalic tribes the highest ; light hair is less common in the two groups than among the Lesgians , but we find among the Georgians in general a great number of subjects in whom the iris has a particular yellow colour , a grey or greenish yellow . The Gruzins have a rather rounded face and broad nose , while the Imers have an elongated visage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fig. 109 ) ; their physiognomy reminds one of a goat 's head , according to Pantiukhof , who considers the Imers to be the purest representatives of the primitive Kartvels.l footnote 1 For particulars see Deniker , lac. cit .

It is a common practice to call Asia , or at least certain regions of Asia , " the cradle of mankind , " the " officina gentium . " The migrations and invasions of the Asiatic peoples into Europe , which took place from the most remote times , gave birth , naturally enough , to this idea among the western peoples ( p. 317 et seq . ) . However , no serious data authorise us to say that the first man was born rather in Asia than Europe . Nowhere do we find there any traces of tertiary man.1 Eugene Dubois discovered , it is true , quite close to the footnote The flint flakes resembling palseolithic tools , found by F. Noetling ( Records Geol .

But Java belongs to-day as much to the Oceanian world as to Asia , and the Pithecanthropus is not altogether a man , either according to his discoverer or many other authorities . figure Some regard this being simply as a gigantic gibbon , while others ( myself among the number ) hold that he is a being more closely related to man than to the anthropoid apes , or even a man of a race inferior to all existing ones .

Prehistoric objects in polished stone and bronze have been found at other points of Asia Minor ( A. Martin ) , in Lycaonia ( Spiegelthal ) , in the Sinai peninsula ( Bauermann and Richard ) , on the shores of Lake Issik-koul ( Russian Turkestan ) . Southern Siberia , the Kirghiz steppes , north and north-western Mongolia are covered with stone circles ( Kereksur ) , barrows , tumuli , menhirs ( Kishachilo ) of every form , with burial-places in which are found objects in wood , bone , bronze , copper , iron ( Radloff , Potanin , Klementz ) .

If , as Uvarof says , the age of the mammoth was earlier in Siberia than in Europe , it is none the less true that many peoples of Eastern Siberia were still in the midst of the " stone age " at the time when the Russians penetrated into this country ( seventeenth century ) .

PRESENT INHABITANTS AND RACES OF ASIA. - It 15 impOSsible in the present state of our knowledge to draw up a complete table of the migrations which have taken place on the Asiatic continent in historic times . I shall mention those in connection with some peoples whose history is partially known ( Chinese , Turks , Mongols , Thai ) . So also , in the present state of anthropological knowledge , we can only discern in the midst of the numerous Asiatic populations , in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eleven races : ? Five races peculiar to Asia ( Dravidian , Assyroid , Indo-Af ; ' lion , Ainu , Mongolian ) , and six races which are also met with in other parts of the world : Negrito , Indonesian , Arab , Ugrian , Turkish , and Eskimo ( leaving out of account the Assyroid and Indo-Afghan races , which are found again among the Jews and the European Gypsies ) . I have already given ( p. 285 et seq. ) the principal characters of these races ; it only remains to say a few words as to their geographical distribution in Asia . The Eskimo race is quartered in the north-east of the continent ; that of the Ainus in Saghalien , Yezo , and perhaps in northern Japan ; while the Ugrian race is represented by its Yeniseian variant . The Mongolian race ( with its two secondary races , northern and southern ) is found almost all over Asia . The Turkish race is limited more particularly to the inland regions of Central Asia . The Indonesians are numerous in Indo-China , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Dravidians and IudoAfhans abound in India . The latter are also met with in anterior Asia , side by side with the Assyroids and Arabs . Some representatives of the Negrito race inhabit the Malay peninsula and the Andaman Islands ; the elements of this race are also found among the inhabitants of Indo-China and perhaps India .  | As to existing populations of the Asiatic continent , I shall rapidly pass them in review , grouping them , according to geographical region , under six heads : peoples of Northern Asia ; of Central Asia ; of Eastern Asia ; of Indo-China ; of India ; and lastly , of Anterior or Western Asia . I. NORTHERN ASIA , consisting almost exclusively of Siberia , a cold country covered with dense virgin forests ( taiga ) or marshy , frozen plains ( tundra ) , harbours , in addition to Russian or Chinese colonists , only a few somewhat wretched tribes , mainly hunters , but depending partly on fishing and hoeculture . We may group them thus : ? ( i ) tribes of Western Siberia , having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which I shall call Yeniseians or Tubas ; ( 2 ) peoples of the extreme north-east of the Asiatic continent , whom Schrenck describes as Paheasiatics ; ( 3 ) the Tunguses of Eastern Siberia and Manchuria . r . Yeniseians or Tubas. ? Besides the Samoyeds of Asia , who differ from their kinsfolk in Europe only by their more Mongoloid features , the Yeniseians comprise two distinct groups of populations . In the first place the so-called Ostiaks of the Yenisei , on the right bank of this river ( between Yeniseisk and Touroukhansk ) , probable descendants of the Kien-Kouen and the Ting ling of the Chinese annals . It is a tribe in process of extinction , whose language differs from the Samoyed tongue and the Finnish dialects properly so called ( Castren ) . Then come the tribes who formerly formed the Tuba nation , mentioned until the seventh century A.D. by the name of Tup by the Chinese annalists ; they inhabited the basin of the upper Yenisei , the Altai region , and north-western Mongolia , and bore the local names of Matores , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These peoples have disappeared as linguistic units , ' but footnote 1 Schrenck , Reisen in Amur-Lande , vol. iii. , Parts I. and II. , St. Petersburg , 1881-91 . Muller and Gmelin saw in 1753 the last surviving Arines , and in 1855 Castren was still able to find five individuals speaking the Kotte tongue .  | their physical type , some of their characteristic manners , as well as a few words of their language , are preserved among certain populations speaking a Turkish dialect . The Russians call these populations " Tatars " ; they might more suitably be called by the name of Altaians . This ethnic group , whose physical type has been altered by intermixtures with peoples of Turkish or Mongolian race , comprises the " Tatars " of Abakan , that is to say , Ka/chines , Koibals ( eight hundred individuals ) , Sagai , and Kizils ; the " Tatars " of Altai and those of Chulim , among whom must be noted the " Tatars of the black forests " ( Cherniezyie Tatary in Russian ) , called " Tubas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of medium height ; they have abandoned little by little the hunting state , and become primitive cultivators of the soil ; they break up the ground with the hoe , which was used by them until not very long ago to dig up edible roots , and they cut their corn with hunting-knives ) . The Soiots or Soyons of North-western Mongolia , who call themselves Tubas , are probably the descendants of the ancient Uigurs ( Turkish nation ) commingled with aboriginal Yeniseians of this country and partly Mongolised about the seventeenth century . 2 . The Falceasiatic group should comprise , according to Schrenck , all the ancient peoples of Asia driven back at the present day towards the north-eastern extremity of the Continent . The more important of these peoples are the following : ? The Chuchi ( or Chukchi ) , numbering about 8000 , are the most typical representatives of the group ; they inhabit the northeast of Siberia , and the occupation of some is the breeding of reindeer , and fishing of others ; however , the distinction between the nomadic and fishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Koriaks dwell to the south of the Chukchi , as far as Kamtchatka ; they b:ar a close resemblance to them and speak the same language .

At the present day they are not found except in isolated camps on the coast and in the islands of the Behring Sea . They differ but very little from the Eskimo of Alaska ; their ornaments , however , recall rather those of the Aleuts . The Kamtchadals of the centre and west of Kamtchatka differ from the peoples just mentioned . They number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very rapidly . They have completely given up their language , which has no relation to any linguistic family now known , and they speak a very corrupt form of Russian . Nominally orthodox Christians , they are at bottom animists , and the anthropomorphic element , often under obscene forms , occupies a large place in their myths and legends . They are fishers and hunters . The Yukaghirs are the last remnants of a somewhat powerful people who formerly occupied all that part of Siberia situated to the east of the Lena , and who were composed of several tribes : Onzoks , Anauls , Cheliags , etc.l It was believed until the last few years that even the Yukaghirs had disappeared , but quite recently Iokhelson2 ascertained that there are at least 700 individuals , and that their language , which has no affinities with any of the Uralo-Altaic dialects , is spoken by a certain number of Tunguse-Lamuts ( see p. 373 ) , their neighbours . On the other hand , the Yukaghirs of Verkhoiansk , have adopted the Lamut dialect , and those of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real . The Anauls , in the neighbourhood of the Gulf of Anadyr , exterminated by the Cossacks in 1649 , were only a fraction of the Yukaghirs , as is indicated by the termination " ul " which is found again in the name " Odul , " which the Yukaghirs use to describe themselves . The word " Omok " means simply people , " tribe " in Yukaghir language . As to the Cheliags , who , according to the Cossack Amossof , occupied at the end of the last century the Siberian coast between the Gulf of Chaun and the mouth of the Kolima ? they were probably one of the Chukchi tribes . 2 Iokhelson , " Izviestia , etc. , " Bull .

They form a group by themselves , different from all the other peoples of Asia . Their elongated heads ( ceph. index on the liv . sub . 77.8 ) , their prominent supraciliary ridges , the development of the pilous system , the form of the nose , give to them some resemblance to the Russians , the Todas , and the Australians ; but other characters  | ( coloration of the skin , prominent cheek-bones , short stature , frequent occurrence of the os japonicum , etc. ) distinguish them from these peoples and afford grounds for classing them as a separate race ( see Chap . VIII . ) . According to Japanese historians , the Ainus or Asuma Yebissu occupied the whole of Nippon from the seventh century B.C. until the second century of the Christian era . In the seventh century A.D. they still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ north of the 38th degree of north latitude , and even in the ninth century the chronicles speak of the incursions of these " barbarians . " Thus the Ainu element enters very largely into the composition of one of the types of the Japanese people , not only at Yezo but in the north of Nippon ( province of Aomori ) , where several Ainu words still survive in current speech . In the Kurile islands the Ainus are intermixed with the Kamtchadals and the Aleuts introduced by the Russo-American Company about the middle of the present century . It is calculated that there are about 18,500 Ainus ( of whom 1,300 are in the island of Saghalien ) at the present time ; their number at Yezo has remained stationary for several years . The dress of the Ainus is a sort of greatcoat with broad sleeves , fastened with a girdle so that the right lappel covers the left lappel as among Turkish peoples , and contrary to the way it is done among the Chinese and Mongols . The chief occupation of the Ainus is hunting and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religion is pure animism ; the word Kamui , which means spirit ( like the Ki mi of the Japanese Shintoists ) , also serves to indicate everything incomprehensible , in the same way as the word t ? shif , " the literal meaning of which is " animal " ( may this be a word corresponding to totem ? ) . The Ainus , like most Asiatic peoples , such as the Giliaks , Tunguses , etc. , have a special veneration for the bear ; they organise festivals in its honour , during which a bear is killed , after having received the homage of many inaou ( staffs decorated with shavings ) .  | The Ainu language is agglutinative , and has no analogy with any known language ) . The Giliaks , who inhabit the north of Saghalien , and the mainland to the north of the mouth of the Amur , suggest by their traits sometimes the Ainus , sometimes the Tunguses , but they are brachycephalic . They are a people of fishers , living on the banks of rivers and the sea , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the summer in little houses on piles . The Giliaks are readily disposed to trade , and are distinguished by their taste for ornaments . Their number hardly exceeds 5000 individuals.2 The Tunguses , while speaking a particular language , exhibit the Mongol type , softened by intermixtures with the primitive inhabitants ( Paltasiatics ? ) of their territory , which extends from the Arctic Ocean to the 4oth degree of north latitude , and from the Yenisei to the Pacific Ocean . Their number can hardly exceed 50,000 individuals over this immense stretch of country . They are divided into southern and northern Tunguses and maritime Tunguses or Lamuts . The river Amur forms the approximate boundary between the first two sections of Tunguses . The Latnuts occupy the shores of the sea of Okhotsk , the north-west of Kamtchatka , and extend more to the west to the river Iana . The Northern Tunguses are split up into several tribes , of which the following are the principal , going from east to west : ?

As to the southern Tunguses , they comprise the Goldes of the lower Amur and Ussuri , of a very pure type , and having a fairly well developed ornamental art ; the Oroches of the coast ; and lastly the Solon-Daurs , very much intermixed with the Mongols , of which colonies exist in the Kuldja . The Manchus , reduced to a small number , belong by their dialect as well as by their physical type to the Tunguse group . They are being absorbed more and more by the Chinese , and hardly form a tenth part of the population of the country which bears their name ( Pozdnieef ) . It is probable that the Niu-chi or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corea , mentioned in the Chinese annals , were Tunguse tribes . The type which predominates among the Tunguses represents the secondary race called North Mongolian and characterised by mesocephaly or a slight sub-dolichocephaly , and by a rather elongated face . The stature varies ; the Orochons are of average stature and the Manchus very tall , etc . ' . II . PEOPLES OF CENTRAL ASIA. ? The immense central Asiatic region , whose waters have no outlet towards the sea , is formed principally of denuded table-lands ( Thibet ) or of plains , sometimes grassy , sometimes desert ( Mongolia , Turkestan ) . It is inhabited for the most part by populations which may be grouped from the linguistic point of view under three heads , Turks , Mongols , Thibetans.2 footnote C.

See my articles " Turks " and " Tatars " in the Diet . Univ . de Ceogr. of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1894 ; and for details the works of Radloff and Vambery , to which reference is therein made . a These " Tatars " have sprung from the intermixture of three elements : the primitive Tatars , the probable descendants of the Tu-Kiue of Chinese authors , the founders of the kingdom of Sibir destroyed by the Russians in the sixteenth century ; the Sartes and the Uzbegs , coming especially from Bokhara ; lastly , the Tatars of the Volga , immigrating in the wake of the Russians . In the west of Siberia there are also Ostiak tribes which bear the name of Tatars ( such as the Zabolotnyd Ta/ary ) , because they have adopted the customs and religion of their neighbours the Tatars .  | Afghan elements ; the Yegurs of the province of Kan-su in China , etc.1 The central group comprises , in the first place , the KirghizKazak of the plains between the Irtish and the Caspian , with the Kara-Kirghiz of the Tian-chan mountains , typical nomads who under a Mussulman veneer have preserved many ancient Turkish animist customs ; 2 then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or less mingled with Iranian elements , of Russian Turkestan ; and finally the Tatars of the Volga , or of European Russia . Among these last , the so-calledKazan Tatars , descendants of the Kipchaks , must be specially mentioned . Arriving on the banks of the Volga in the thirteenth century , they intermingled there with the Bulgarians . They differ from the Astrakhan Tatars ( Figs. 207 and Io8 ) , descendants of the Turco-Mongols of the Gold horde , mixed with the Khazars , as well as from the Nogai of the Crimea , ' representatives of whom we find also in the Caucasus , near Astrakhan , and in Lithuania , where , while remaining Mussulmans , they have adopted the language and the garb of Poles . With this group we must connect the Bashkir-Afesthcheriaks , a tribe intermixed with Turkish , Mongol , and Ugrian elements ; and their congeners the Shuvashes , as well as the Kumyks , the Karachai , the Kabards , or Tatars of the Caucasus mountains , distinct from the true Kabards .

These are the Islamised descendants of the ancient populations of the Taurus ( Kipchaks , Genoese , Greeks , Goths ) . The Nogai belong to the Turkish race , more or less crossed , while the Tauridians have many traits of the Adriatic and Indo-Afghan races .  | of the Caucasus and Persia , and lastly the Osmanli Turks . Included under this name are subjects of the Sultan speaking the Turkish language and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Osmanli , much intermixed , and the nomadic tribes ( Turkomans , Yuruks , etc. ) , who exhibit several characteristics of the Turkish race . The Turkish race , so far as can be gathered from recent anthropological works , is preserved in a comparatively pure state among the Turks of the central group , but in the eastern group it has been profoundly modified in consequence of intermixtures with the Mongolian , Tunguse , and Ugrian races ; as also in the western group , in which we have to take into account elements of the Assyroid , Indo-Afghan , and Arab races , and certain European races ( Adriatic chiefly ) . The Turkish race may be thus described : Stature , above the average ( 1m. 67-rm. 68 ) ; head , hyper-brachycephalic ( ceph. ind . on the liv . sub. , 85 to 87 ) , elongated oval face , nonMongoloid eyes , but often with the external fold of eyelid ( p. 78 ) ; the pilous system moderately developed ; broad cheek-bones , thick lips ; straight , somewhat prominent nose ; tendency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when they change their mode of life it is rather towards the chase , commerce , or trade that their efforts are directed ; the true cultivators of the soil ( Taranchi , Sartes , Osmanli , Volga Tatars ) are Turks already powerfully affected by intermixtures . The Turkish tent is the most highly finished of transportable habitations ( p. 164-166 ) . Meat and milk products form the staple foods , as they do among all nomads . With the exception of the Christian Chuvashes and the Shaman Yakuts , all the Turks are Mussulmans ; but often they are only nominally such , at bottom remain- footnote ) For statistics as to stature , ceph. index , etc. , see Appendices I. to III . ; these figures are borrowed from the works of Benzengre , Bogdanof , Chantre , Elissieef , Erckert , Hecker , Kharuzin , Lygin , Malief , Merejkovsky , Nazarof , Paissel , Pantiukhof , Sommier , Ujfalvy , Vyrubof , Weisbach , Weissenberg , Yadrintzef , etc .

It is perhaps to this mixed origin that they owe the relative stability of the state which they have founded , for no nomadic Turkish tribe has been able to create a political organism of long duration , and the vast empires of the Hiungnu , the Uigurs , the Kipchaks , have had only an ephemeral existence . 2 .

It appears that at the present time these tribes have only preserved of their origin a few physiognomical features ; they speak a Turkish dialect and have intermixed with the Jemchids , whose mode of life and religion they have adopted .  | Eleuts , and whom the neighbouring peoples call Kalmuks , are scattered , owing to wars and migrations , over the immense tract lying between Siberia and Lassa , from the banks of the Hoang-ho to those of the Manich ( a tributary of the Don ) . The more compact groups are found in European Russia ( Kalmuks of Astrakhan , Figs. 20 and 44 , and the Caucasus ) ; in Dzungaria ( the Torgoots ) and north-western Mongolia , between Altai and Thian-Shan ; lastly , in Alashan and farther to the west in the Chinese province of Kuku-Nor and northern Thibet . They number about a million . The Eastern Mongols occupy almost the whole of the region known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the south of this country they are broken up into a multitude of tribes ( Turrets , Shakars or Tsakhar , etc. ) ; while in the north they form a single nation , that of the Khalkhas , which has still preserved , in spite of its submission to China , some traces of its ancient political organisation . The Khalkhas number about 200,000 , and the southern Mongols 500,000 . The Burials form a population sprung from the Khalkhas , intermixed at several points with various Siberian elements , Tunguse , Yakut , Russian ; they occupy the steppes and forests of the province of Irkutsk , but their central seat is Transbaikal , whence they spread out even into Mongolia , into the valleys of the Orkhon and the Argun . They number about 250,000 . The type of the Mongolian race is very strongly marked among most of the Kalmuks and Khalkhas ; it is less distinct among the Buriats , etc . It may thus be described : Nearly average stature Om . 63-64 ) ; head , sub-brachycephalic ( ceph. ind . on the liv @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pilous system little developed ; the skin of a pale-yellow or brownish hue , prominent cheek-bones , thin straight flattened nose , Mongoloid eyes ( p. 77 ) , etc . With the exception of some Buriat tribes the Mongols are typical nomadic shepherds . Their live-stock , camels , sheep , and horses supply them not only with food , the raw material  | for the manufacture of tents and garments , but also means of transport and fuel ( camel excrement or dried dung ) . Unlike the nomadic Turks , who are fond of fighting , the Mongols of the present day are gentle and peaceable folk . Can this be the effect of the influence of Lama-Buddhism , which they all profess except a few small Buriat tribes , who have remained Shamans ? We are inclined to believe this when we consider the important part which this religion plays in the daily life of the Mongols . 3 . Thibetans . ) ?

The Abors , Mishmee , etc. , of the Himalayan country who dominate Assam are also included among the Thibetans , but they approach the Indonesians in type . It is the same with the Garro and their neighbours on the east , the Khasia or Djainthia , whose language , however , differs from the Thibetan.2 Most Thibetans are cultivators of the soil or shepherds , pillagers in case of need , and fervent votaries of numerous Lamaite-Buddhist sects , of which that of the Geluk-pa ( yellow caps ) represents the ruling church . Its chief , the Dalai-Lama , residing at Lassa , is at the same time the sovereign of Thibet. footnote 1 Cf. Prjevalsky , Trltie , etc .

This type , moreover , is found beyond Thibet . The lo-lo or Nesus , as they call themselves , of western Sechuen and the north-east of Yunnan , with whom we must connect the Kola or Golyk of the country of Amdo ( east of Thibet ) , perhaps represent it in its purest form , if the portrait of them drawn by Thorel is correct .

The language of the Lu-tse differs from that of any of the neighbouring peoples , and their physical type places them between the Lissus and the Indonesians , such as the Naga for example ; they are short Om . 56 according to Roux ) , but strong and vigorous ; their hair is frizzy.l The Mu-Ise mentioned by Terrien de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Muzours of T. de Lacouperie or the Musos of Archer , the Kas-Khuis of Garnier , scattered between the Mekong and the Salwen from the twentieth to the twenty-fifth degree of north latitude , are probably akin to the Lo-lo and the Mossos.2 III . POPULATIONS OF EASTERN ASIA. ? The far east of Asia is inhabited by three nations of mixed origin : Chinese , Coreans , Japanese . I. The Chinese form by themselves alone more than the third , if not the half of the population of Asia . They occupy in a solid mass the whole of China properly so called , and footnote 1 Roux , Le Tour du Mande , 1897 , 1st half , p. 254 . The adorning of the body and limbs with rings , so characteristic of the Dyaks and other Indonesians , is also found among the Lu-tse ; they wear around the loins and limbs numerous iron wire rings coated with black wax and fastened together in two places with metal rings .

" Manchuria , Southern Mongolia , Dzungaria , a portion of Eastern Turkestan and Thibet have been invaded by Chinese colonists ; and outside of the Empire it is estimated there are not less than three millions of " Celestials " who have emigrated to Indo-China , Malaysia , the two Americas , and even to the islands of the Pacific Ocean and Africa . The Chinese people have sprung from manifold intermixtures , and indeed there are several types to discover in this nation , the anthropological study of which is scarcely more than outlined ; as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may presume that five or six various elements enter into its composition . We know from the books of Shu-King that the primitive country of the Chinese was the north of the present province of Kan-su . Thence the agricultural colonists moved ( about the year 2200 B.C. , according to a doubtful chronology ) into the fertile valley of the Houng-ho and its tributary the Wei or Hwei . Little by little , the Chinese colonists spread along other valleys , but it took them centuries to conquer the aboriginal tribes ( the Djoong , the Man , the Pa , the Miao-tse ) . Again in the seventh century B.C. ( when exact chronology commences ) the territory occupied by the Chinese scarcely extended beyond the valley of the lower Yang-tsi on the south and that of the Pei-ho on the north , and comprised within these limits several aboriginal tribes like the How ' , of the valley of the same name , or the Lai of the Shantung peninsula , who maintained their independence . However that may be , the Chinese succeeded , little by little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the mountains of the west and south , where they are still found under the names of Man-tse , MiaoIse , I-gen , Mans , Thos , etc . ' While this work of driving back was carried on in the south , the Turkish tribes , the Tunguses , the Mongols , the Manchus , footnote See the summary of the data in this respect in Richthofen , China , vol. i. , Berlin , 1875 , and in Reclus , Ceogr . Univ. , vol. vi. , Paris , 1882.  | invaded in turn the north of the country . Thence resulted a marked difference between the northern and the southern Chinese , while the Chinese of the central parts have perhaps best preserved the original type ( Fig. 119 ) . The Chinese of the south belong very largely to the southern Mongolian race ( p. 293 ) ; they are short , sub-brachycephalic , except in Kwang-si , where mesocephaly predominates , in consequence , figure interpreter to Embassy , twenty-one years old , height Tin . 75. probably , of intermixtures with the aborigines of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the north are on the contrary almost tall of stature ; the head is sub-brachycephalic with a tendency towards mesocephaly in the north , towards brachycephaly in the south ( Fig. 118 ) . The skin is lighter among the former than among the latter , the face more elongated , etc . One of the peculiarities of the Chinese skull is  | the retreating forehead , and the contraction at the level of the temples . The multiplicity of dialects is equally great . The Chinese of the various provinces would have long since ceased to understand one another had they not possessed as a medium of communication the common signs of the written language ( p. 141 ) , which the mandarins read in their own dialects and figure Foo-chow , eighteen years old , height Im. 52. languages not only in China but also in Corea , in Japan , and Indo China . We distinguish the Mandarin , or northern , dialect ( with which we connect the Hakka speech employed in Kwang-tung ) and that of the south , then the dialects of FuSee in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ etc. , from the works of Girard , Ilagen , Janka , Poyarkof , Ten Kate , AVcisbach , Zaborowski and my own observations .  | Kian , of Che-Kiang , etc . The peculiarities of the Chinese character ? filial love , attachment to the soil , aptitude for agriculture and commerce , peaceful disposition , love of routine , respect for letters , observance of form , etc. ? are sufficiently known.l Most of them are the corollaries of ancestor-worship , of the very rigorous patriarchal regime and the constitution of the commune ( p. 248 ) , the basis of the whole social fabric of the Chinese Empire , which , let it be said by the way , exhibits less organic cohesion than is generally supposed . The frequent co-existence of belief in three religions , Taoism , Confucianism , and Buddhism or Foism , in one and the same individual is one of the remarkable facts of Chinese sociology . Another fact , not less interesting , is the administrative and political mechanism inspired theoretically by very wise and moral ideas , but leading in practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which we find it difficult to form any idea in Europe . 2 . The Coreans , who by their civilisation are connected with China , have in all probability sprung from the intermixture of Tunguse , Indonesian , and Japanese elements . The men are of tall stature , 2 strong , with sub-brachycephalic head ( ceph. ind . on the liv . sub . 82.3 , according to Elissieef , Koganei , and Bogdanof ) . The women are more puny , and are not conspicuous for beauty ; they have a yellowish complexion , small eyes , prominent brow , and very small feet , but not deformed like those of the Chinese ( p. 175 ) . The Corean values only one physical charm in woman , and that is her abundant head of hair and eyebrows , " fine as a thread " ( Mme. KoIke ) . Besides , woman is of no account in Corean society ; she footnote Note also the inferior position of woman , her ability to move about limited by deformation of the feet ( p. 175 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Dr. Koike ( Internat . Arch . Ethnop-. , vol. iv. , Leyden , 1891 , Parts I. and II. ) gives the excessively high stature of Im. 79 as the average of seventy-five men measured ; while Elissieef ( " Izviestia " Russ . Ceogr . Soc. , St. Petersburg , 1890 ) found Im. 62 the average height , but according to the measurements of ten men only .  | is an instrument of pleasure or work ; she is kept strictly apart from men , rarely leaves the house , and must veil her face . The Corean language belongs to the Uralo-Altaic family , and is closely related to the Southern Tunguse dialects . Its mode of writing , called wen-mun , differs from the Chinese , and appears either to have been invented or derived from the Sanscrit by the Buddhist monks ( M. Courant ) . The Coreans have no state religion . Buddhism , introduced towards the close of the fourth century , has not taken root among them , and is more and more in danger of extinction . Most Coreans live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : sacrifices to the spirits of the forests and mountains , etc . The Corean civilisation was borrowed entire from China of the fifth or sixth century . The associative tendency , and regard for form and ceremony , are perhaps stronger in Corea than in China . Further , enslavement for debt , crime , etc. , exists as a regular thing in the country.l 3 . The Japanese exhibit , like so many other peoples , a certain diversity in their physical type ; the variations fluctuate between two principal forms . The fine type ( Figs. 16 and 120 ) , which may chiefly be observed in the upper classes of society , is characterised by a tall , slim figure ; a relative dolichocephaly , elongated face , straight eyes in the men , more or less oblique and Mongoloid in the women , thin , convex or straight nose , etc . The coarse type , common to the mass of the people , is marked by the following characters : a thick-set body , rounded skull , broad face with prominent cheek-bones , slightly oblique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .2 These footnote W.

The influence of the Ainu blood is shown only in Northern Nippon . ' In a general way the Japanese are of short stature ( rm. 59 for men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well proportioned . The colour of the skin varies from pale yellow , almost white , to brownish yellow . The Japanese have no colour in their cheeks , even when their skin is almost white ; at birth there is an accumulation of pigments on the median line of the belly and pigmental spots ( see p. 5t ) . The pilous system is scantily developed , except in cases where an admixture of Ainu blood may be suspected . The head is mesaticephalic as a rule ( ceph. ind . on the liv . sub . 78.2 ) , with a tendency to brachycephaly in the gross type , to dolichocephaly in the fine type . The skull , which is capacious , exhibits two peculiarities : the os japonicum ( p. 68 ) and the particular conformation of the upper jaw , which is very low and broad , without the canine fossa . With regard to Japanese writing , see p. 141 . The most striking traits of the Japanese character are politeness and aptness in concealing the emotions ; it must not be inferred from this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are honest , hard-working , cheerful , kind , and courageous ( Mohnike , Mechnikof ) .2 European civilisation and the re- footnote 1 It might be supposed that the representatives of the first type were the descendants of tribes who had come by way of Corea and the Tsushima and Iki-shima islands in the south-west of Nippon at some period unknown , but at any rate very remote . As to the coarse type , its representatives are perhaps descended from the warriors who invaded about the seventh century tt.c. ( according to a doubtful chronology ) the west coast of the island of Kiu-siu and then Nippon . These invaders , intermixing with the aborigines of unknown stock , founded the kingdom of Yamato , and drove back the Ainus towards the north ( see p. 372 ) .

The ancient chivalrous spirit of the aristocracy , holding trade figure in contempt , still survives at the present day , and partly explains the ardour with which persons of this class have flung themselves into political life , since Japan obtained a parliamentary administration ( 1889 ) . The Japanese have two religions , Shintoisnt , or the national worship of the Kam/ ( native p 391 divinities ) , and Buddhism ; but they are fundamentally very sceptical on the subject of religion . ' The islanders of the Liu-Kiu or Loo-clzoo archipelago resemble the Japanese ( Chamberlain ) , but they have a thicker beard and a darker complexion ( Balz ) ; they are of short stature ( 1m. 58 , according to Dr. Furukawa ) , and Wirth has even noted among them a tribe of pigmies 1m. 30 in height in the island of Okinava .

The former are met with almost everywhere , but chiefly in the north and west of the island , the latter have been driven back into the mountains of the interior and to the south coast . The Che-hoan are split up into several tribes ( Atayal , Vonum in the north , Pal-wan , Sarisen , Butan in the south , Amia on the east coast , etc. ) , and remind us of the Indonesians by their type as well as by several customs ( skull-hunting , tattooing , ear-ornaments , house in common or " Palankan " ) . Some of these " savages " are acquainted with agriculture , others live by the product of the chase . The languages of all these Formosans belong to the Malay family , especially approximating to the Tagal.2 IV . POPULATIONS OF INDO-CHINA. ?

In spite of the various names given to the Mois by the adjoining nations ( they are called Mois in Annam , Pennons in Cambodia , lihcas in Laos , etc. ) , and of the multitude of tribes into which they are divided ( the Mo , the Sas , the Bruns , the Bo/ovens , the Love , the Banuars , the Ede , the Late , the Thioma , the Trao , etc. ) , the Mois exhibit a remarkable uniformity in physical type and manners ( Neis ) .

Let us pass on to the mixed populations of Indo-China , springing from the probable cross-breeds of the autochthones and the invaders . The Cambodians or Khmers have the first place by seniority . At the present day they inhabit Cambodia , the adjoining parts of Siam , and the south of Cochin-China , but they formerly extended much farther . Two centuries ago , before the arrival of the Annamese , they occupied the whole of Cochin-China , figure while to-day they are found in any considerable number only in the unhealthy and marshy regions of the Rach-gia , Soktrang , and Tra-Vinh districts , where their number equals or exceeds that of the Annamese . It may be conjectured that the Khmers have sprung from the intermixing of the Malays and Kuis , with an infusion of Hindu blood at least in the higher classes of society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Annamese and the Thai , but almost as brachy-  | cephalic ( ceph. ind . on the liv . sub . 83.6 ) ; their eyes are rarely oblique , their hair is often wavy , etc . This population has preserved much of its primitive savagery in spite of the influence of several successive civilisations , of which remain the splendid monuments of Angkor-Vat , Angkor-Tom , etc.1 The population which chronologically succeeds the Cambodians is that of the Annamese ( Fig. 121 ) , the inhabitants of the delta in Tong King , of the coast in Annam , and most of CochinChina . Some Annamese colonies are also found in Cambodia , in Laos , and among the Mois . The Annamese people , fifteen to seventeen millions strong at the present time , is the outcome of numerous interminglings . Of western origin , according to its traditions , that is to say akin to the Thai peoples , it came at an early period into the country which it now occupies . It found already installed there the Mois , the Khmers , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the mountains and the unhealthy regions ; but it has had to support in its turn the continual immigrations of the Chinese who brought their civilisation to it . In spite of these complex interminglings the Annamese type is very uniform ( Harmand ) . The men are short in stature ( 1m. 58 ) , with slender limbs , brachycephalic head ( ceph. ind . 82.8 ) , of angular visage with prominent cheek-bones , and Mongoloid eyes . The Annamese of Tong King are a little taller ( 1m. 59 ) and darker than those of Cochin-China and Annam ( height 1m. 57 ) ; they have also a broader and flatter nose , the result perhaps of intermixture with the Thos mountaineers ( p. 401 ) who live near them.2 The social life of the Annamese is modelled on that of the Chinese ; the village community and the patriarchal family form the base of it , in the same way as ancestor-worship is the religious foundation . Annamese Buddhism is only a colourless copy of Chinese Foism and has no great hold of the footnote Moura @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vols. ; Aymonier , Geographiedu Cambodge , Saigon-Paris , 1876 ; L.

Very docile , the Annamese are intelligent , cheerful , and well gifted , without being exempt from certain defects of character , common to all Asiatics of the far East , such as dissimulation , hypocrisy , and perfidy . The Burmese or Illramma made a descent on Iudo-China perhaps at the same time as the Annamese , from their original country , which is supposed to be the mountains of the southeast of Thibet . To-day they occupy Upper Burma , Pegu , and Arakan . In the last-mentioned country they bear the name of iWag or Arakanese , and differ a little from the true Burmese of Upper Burma , who are the purest representatives of the Burmese people . Like the Annamese , they have attained a certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ India . We find existing among them monogamy , the order of castes , and Buddhism of the south but slightly altered . The Mag are mesocephalic ( ceph. ind . 81.8 ) and of short stature ( I m. 61 ) .1 The Thai. ? The numerous peoples speaking different Thai dialects were the last arrivals in Indo-China . Their migrations may be followed from the first century B.C. , when the Pay tribes came from Sechuen into Western Yunnan to found there the kingdom of Luh-Tchao . Another kingdom , that of Muang-ling , was founded more to the south-west in Upper Burma , etc . The recent researches of Terrien de Lacouperie , Colquhoun , Baber , Hosie , Labarth , Billet , H. Hollet , Bourne , Deblenne , and of so many others besides , enable us to show the relations which existed between these various Thai peoples and to assign the limits with sufficient exactitude to their habitat , which extends from Kwei-chow to Cambodia , between the 14th and the 26th degrees of N. latitude.2 footnote 1 Risley , loc. cit .

We put together , under the name of Thos-Muong , all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( except the mountain summits occupied by the Mans , allied probably to the Lo-lo ) , as well as the primitive inhabitants of Kwang-si , Southern Kwei-chow , and Eastern Yunnan , now driven back to the mountains . The Thos inhabiting Tong King to the east of the Red River ( basin of the Claire River ) , are sub-brachycephalic ( ceph. ind . 82.5 ) , of lofty stature ( rm. 67 ) , 1 having elongated face , straight non-Mongoloid eyes , and brownish complexion . They partly recall the Indonesians , and partly the still mysterious race to which the Lo-lo belong ( p. 381 ) . They are husbandmen , living in houses on piles , and wearing a very picturesque costume different from that of their ancient masters the Annamese . The Muongs of Tong King to the west of the Red River ( basin of the Black River ) , the Pueun and the Pu-Thai of Annamese Laos resemble them both in type and in language , which is a Thai dialect very much altered by Chinese and Annamese . The Tu jen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the population of Kwang-si , and found in the south of Kwei-chow and the north-west of Kwangtung , as well as the Pe-jen or Minkia of Yunnan , are Thos slightly crossed with Chinese blood in the same way as the Nongs of Tong King , the neighbours of the Thos . Most of these peoples have a special kind of writing , recalling that of the Laotians . The latter , as well as the Shans , differ somewhat from the Thos in regard to type , in which we may discern interminglings with the Indonesians , Malays , Mois , and Burmese . Among the Shans we must distinguish the Khanzti ( Fig. 122 ) , a very pure race , and the Sing:c with the Kackyen or Ka/chin , somewhat footnote r From Dr. Girard , quoted by Billet , loc. cit. , p. 69. 26  | intermixed with the Burmese , both of them races of mountaineers of the northern parts of Upper Burma , between the Lu-Kiang ( upper Salwen ) and the Lohit-Brahmaputra .

The Laotians are sub-brachycephalic ( 83.6 ) and of short stature ( Im. 59 ) ; those of the north tattoo their bodies like the Shans . They are husbandmen , shepherds , and hunters.l It is perhaps among the Siamese that the primitive Thai type has been most changed by intermixture with the Khmers , Kuis , Hindus , and Malays . In stature above the average ( im. 61 ) , very brachycephalic ( ceph. incl. 85.5 ) with olive complexion , they have prominent cheek-bones , lozenge-shaped face , and short flattish nose . They are fervent votaries of southern Buddhism , and are the most civilised of the Thai . They have succeeded in preserving their relative independence and forming a state in which several reforms of European character have been attempted in recent times . V. THE POPULATION OF INDIA represents about a third of the inhabitants of Asia ( 287,223,431 inhabitants according to the census of r8gl ) . It is sub-divided into a hundred tribes or distinct peoples , but this multiplicity of ethnic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily be incorporated into a small number of somatic races or linguistic families ; these groups frequently represent castes alone . Caste is indeed an institution peculiar to India . Of ancient origin , this institution has developed very considerably , assuming the most varied forms . Springing from a Hindu or Brahman source , it penetrated little by little the other ethnic and religious groups of the peninsula , and one might say that it is the basis of the social organisation for four-fifths of the population of India , despite of the fact that its power is declining at the present day beneath the strong hand of British rule . About 2000 castes may be enumerated at the present footnote 1 I-Iarmand , loc. cit. ; Aymonier , loc. cit . ( Voyage au Laos ) .  | day , but year by year new ones are being called into existence as a certain number disappear . ) The names of these castes are derived either from hereditary occupations ( tanners , husbandmen , etc. ) ; from a geographical source ( Pathani , etc. ) , or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , especially among the Dravidians , from figure objects or animals singled out as totems ( p. 247 ) . The essential characteristics of all castes , persisting amid every change The so-called primitive division into four castes : Brahmans ( priests ) , Kshatriya ( soldiers ) , Vaisyas ( husbandmen and merchants ) , and Sudra ( common people , outcasts , subject peoples ? ) , mentioned in the later texts of the Vedas , is rather an indication of the division into three principal classes of the ruling race as opposed , in a homogeneous whole , to the conquered aboriginal race ( fourth caste ) .  | of form , are endogamy within themselves and the regulation forbidding them to come into contact one with another and partake of food together ( Senart ) . Endogamy within the limits of the caste implies , as a corollay , exogamy among the sections of the caste . The typical form of these sections is the " gotra , " an eponymous group reputed to be descended from a common ancestor , usually from a rishi , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage is forbidden in all castes between relatives to the sixth degree on the paternal side and to the fourth degree on the maternal side . Caste has no religious character ; men of different creeds may belong to it . It is ruled by a chief and a council ( 1anclthyet ) , and has not limits as rigid as is commonly supposed ; the way is smoothed by compromises and liberal interpretations of rules for rich and clever people to pass from a lower to a higher caste . In this way or some other a man may rise from one caste to another : in Mirzapur many Ghonds and Korvars have become Rajputs , etc . ( Crooke ) . Employment is by no means the criterion of caste , as is very often supposed . " Those who have seen Brahmans , " says Senart , " girdled with the sacred cord , offer water to travellers in the- railway stations of India , who have seen them drilling among the sepoys of the Anglo-Indian army , are prepared for surprises of this kind .

To the bibliographic references to castes which are found in this excellent book must he added the " Introduction " to the work of W. Crooke , already quoted ; it appeared subsequently . 2 The ingenious deductions of Risley ( loc. cll. , Elbeno r . Glossary , vol. i. , Preface , p. 34 , Calcutta , 1892 ) , which may be summed up in the aphorism , " The nasal index increases in a direct ratio to the social inferiority of the caste , " have been criticised by Crooke ( loc. p. 119 ) , who however is too absolute in his statements , and does not take any account of the seriation of anthropometric measurements .  | the Cisgangetic Aryan or Aryanised peoples must be noted ; it is the village ( grama ) with common proprietorship of the FIG. 127. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which I can not dilate for want of space ( see p. 247 ) . India was the cradle of two great religions which have //  | become international , Brahmanism and Buddhism . This fact deserves to be borne in mind on account of the impress left on these two religions by the national Hindu character . The foundation of both is formed of those characteristically Hindu beliefs , ? the ideas of metempsychosis , final deliverance , and the doctrine of the moral world , which form a contrast with the Semitic religions . Brahmanism is professed by about three-fourths ( 72 per cent. ) of the inhabitants of India , while FIG. 128. - Santal of the Bhagalpur hills . Buddhism and its derivative Jainism only number , apart from the island of Ceylon , three per cent . of the total population of the peninsula . The most widespread religion after Brahmanism is Islamism ( 20 per cent . of the whole population of India ) . From the somatological point of view it may be affirmed today , after the excellent works of Risley , Crooke , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ etc. , that the variety of types found in the country is due to the crossing of two  | indigenous races , Indo-Afghan and Melano-Indian or Dravidian , with the admixture here and there of foreign elements : Turkish and Mongol in the north , Indonesian in the east , Arab and Assyroid in the west , and perhaps the Negritoid element in the centre . The Indo-Afghan race , of high stature , with light brown or tanned complexion , long face , wavy or straight hair , prominent and thin nose , dolichocephalic head , predominates in the north-west of India ; the Melano-Indian or Dravidian race , also dolichocephalic but of short stature , with dark brown or black complexion , wavy or frizzy hair , is chiefly found in the south . In it two sub-races may be distinguished : aplalyrhinian one , with broad flat nose , rounded face , found in the mountainous regions of Western Bengal , Oudh and Orissa , also at several points of Rajputana and Gujarat , then in Southern India , and in the central provinces to the south of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leptorhinian , with narrow prominent nose , and elongated face may be noted in some particular groups , especially among the Nairs , the Telugus , and the Tamils ) J. Alelano-Indians or Dravidians. ? This group , at once somatological and linguistic , includes two sub-divisions , based on differences of language : the division of Kolarians , and that of Dravidians properly so called . a . Kolarians.2 ? The numerous tribes speaking the languages of the Kol family and belonging to the platyrhinian variety of the Melano-Indian race , more or less modified by interminglings , occupy the mountainous regions of Bengal and the provinces of the north-west . Certain of these tribes , of the purest type , like the juang or Palma of Keunjhar and Dhenkanal ( Orissa ) , are distinguished by very short stature ( r m. 57 ) , E. Schmidt , " Die Anlhrop .

The Kols of the north-west provinces ( height 1m. 64 ; ceph. ind . 73.2 , according to Risley and Crooke ) are closely allied to the groups which I have just mentioned . The Savaras or Saoras , scattered over Orissa , Chota Nagpur , Western Bengal , and as far as the province of Madras , speak a language which Cunningham , Cust , and Fr . Muller consider Kolarian , while , according to Dalton , it belongs to the Dravidian family properly so called . Physically , they resemble the Male Dravidians , and exhibit the tolerably pure type of the platyrhinian sub-race of the Melano-Indians.2 The same r The word Ho ( Hor or Moro ) , which recurs in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , " and indicates their close linguistic relationship ; their manners and customs are also alike , especially in regard to the constitution of the community .

In their physical characters there are some differences ; the Munda and the Bhumij are short ( in. 59 ) and very dolichocephalic ( ceph. ind . on the liv . sub . 74.5 and 75 ) , the Santals are below the average height Om . 61 ) and a little less dolichocephalic ( 76.1 ) . The Ho , among whom we may assume a greater infusion of IndoAfghan blood , are of somewhat high stature ( nn. 68 ) . The number of these four tribes , united under the name of Santals in the census of 1891 , amounted to a million and a half . 2 Ball , Jungle Life in India , p. 267 ; Fawcet , " The Saoras of Madras , " Joumn .

These are in the first place the Mali ( plural Mater ) or Asal Paharia of the Rajmahal hills ( Bengal ) , probably one of the sections of the Savara people ( see above ) ; 1 the Oraons ( 523,000 in 1891 ) , several tribes of which are also found in the north-west of Chota Nagpur ; lastly , the Gonds ( three millions ) of the Mahadeo mountains and part of the central provinces situated farther south , between the rivers Indravati and Seleru , tributaries of the Godavari . To the east of the Gonds dwell the Khands and the Khonds ( 600,000 ) , who have spread into Orissa .

They are unacquainted with clothes of any kind , obtain fire by sawing one piece of wood with another , and have an animistic religion much less developed than that of the Gonds or Oraons.2 Dravidians of the South. ? To the south of the Godavari dwell five black , half-civilised peoples , having a particular form of writing , professing Brahmanism , and showing an intermingling of two varieties of the Melano-Indian race .

The KzIrs of the Mahadeva hills are closely allied to the Kharwar.  | tribes more or less uncivilised and animistic , having somatic types of considerable variety . The five half-civilised Dravidian peoples are the Telingas or Telugus of the Coromandel coast , of Nizam and Jarpur ( some twenty millions ) ; the Kanaras of the Mysore table-land ( about ten millions ) ; the Malayalnn of the Malabar coast ( nearly six millions ) ; the Tulus of Mangalore ( 350,000 ) ; lastly , the Tamils , occupying the rest of Southern India and the north of Ceylon ( about fifteen millions ) . As to the uncivilised tribes , some occupy the Anamalli hills ( the Nader , the Madavars ) , others inhabit Travancore ( Pulaya , Paligars , lir , Shanar , etc . ) . Also to be noted are the Choliha , at the foot of the Mysore hills , the Paniyans ( Fig. 126 ) of Vainad or Vinad ( Malabar coast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( ceph. ind . on the liv . sub . 74 ) , and very platyrhine ( nas. ind . 95.1 ) ; lastly , the very interesting tribes of the Nilgiri hills ; the Irulas ( Fig. 127 ) and , above these , the Kurumbas ( Fig. 8 ) , on the southern and northern slopes ; the Badagas , the Kolas , and the Todas on the plateau crowning these heights ) . The Kurumbas and the Irulas ( 58,503 in 1891 ) are of short stature ( Im. 58 and rm. 6o ) , dolichocephalic ( ceph. ind . on the liv . sub . 75.8 ) , and platyrhine ( nas. ind . 87 and 85 ) . They are the half-savage tribes of the jungles . As to the tribes of the plateau , they are distinguished according to their occupation and type . The Badagas ( 29,613 in 1891 ) are husbandmen , the Kolas ( 1,201 ) are artisans , and the Todas ( Figs. 7 , 129 , and 130 ) shepherds .

The Aryans of India form the greatest portion of the population to the north of the Nerbada and Mahanadi ; they speak different dialects of the neo-Hindu language ( ancient Bracha language , branch of the Frakril or corrupt vulgar Sanscrit ) . The following are the principal dialects : the  | Hindi , Bengali , Punjabi , Kashmir , Guzrall , and Sind . We distinguish several ethnic groups by these dialects , or the generic names designating aggregations of castes : Brahmans , Rajputs ( roe millions ) , fats and Gujars ( 9 millions altogether ) , .

Among the Hindus of Behar , of the north-west provinces and Oudh , among the Mahratis between the river Tapti and Goa , the type is still more changed in consequence of interminglings with the Dravidians ; the stature becomes shorter ( rm. 63 and rm. 64 ) , the head rounder ( ceph. ind . 75.7 ) , the nose broader ( nas. ind . 80.5 and 74 ) , the complexion darker , etc.2 With the Indo-Aryans are grouped , according to their type and language , the Kafirs or Siahposh of Kafiristan , and the Darai or Dardu , occupying the countries situated more to the east , between the Pamirs on the north , Kashmir on the south , Kafiristan to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say , Chitral , Dardistan ( Yassin , Hunza , Nagar ) , Gilghit , Chilas , Kohistan .

Biddulph affirms that one may often encounter among them individuals with light aid especially red hair . The forty-four Yeshkhuns and Chins measured by Ujfalvy were below the average height ( 1m. 61 ) , dolichocephalic ( ceph. ind . 75.8 ) , with black wavy hair , fine shaped nose , and rather dark skin ; while nineteen " Turki-Mardi " of Hunza-Nagar and Yassin measured by Risley and Capus give a stature above the average ( rm. 69 ) , and the cephalic index almost mesocephalic ( 77 ) . They are thus closely allied to the Chili-all ( stature rm. 67 , ceph. ind . 76.9 from six subjects only , measured by Risley ) .1 Most of the Dardu tribes are endogamous ; polygamy is general . In certain tribes there are to be found survivals of polyandry and of the matriarchate.2 The Baltis , neighbours of the Dardus on the east , speaking a Thibetan dialect , and the Pakhpuluk of the other side of the Kara-Korutn ( upper valley of the Karakash ) , speaking a Turkish tongue ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ races .

The Iranians or Eranians occupy the Iranian plateau and the adjoining regions , especially to the east . They speak different languages of the Eranian branch of the Aryan linguistic family . In physical composition the main characters are supplied by the Assyroid race ( Fig. 22 ) with admixture of Turkish elements in Persia and Turkey , Indo-Afghan elements in Afghanistan , and Arab and Negroid elements in the south of Persia and Baluchistan . Among Iranian peoples the first place , as regards number and the part played in history , belongs to the Persians . They may be divided into three geographical groups .

The Tajiks , moreover , spread beyond the frontiers of Persia into Western Afghanistan , the northwest of Baluchistan , Afghan Turkestan and Russian Turkestan , as far as the Pamirs ( Galcha ) , and perhaps even beyond . In fact , the Polu and other " Turanians " of the northern slope of the Kuen Lun , while speaking a Turkish language , bear a physical resemblance to the Tajiks ( Prjevalsky ) . Like the Sartes , settled inhabitants of Russian Turkestan , and the rats of the southwest shore of the Caspian , and the Aderbaijani of the Caucasus , they are Persians more or less crossed with Turks , whose language they speak . The Tajiks are brachycephalic ( ceph. ind . 84.9 ) , above the average height ( rm. 69 ) , and show traces of intermixture with the Turkish race , 2 while the Hajemis ( Fig. 22 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are called more particularly Talycli and Masandarani. 2 The interminglings with the Turks must be of recent date ; for if we may still discuss the " Turanian " characters of the Sumero-Acadian language , there is no indication of the existence of the Turkish race in  | some measure the Parsis , who are dolichocephalic ( 77 9 ) , and of average height ( im. 65 ) , are of the Assyroid or IndoAfghan type . The Parsis are not very numerous in Persia . Most of them emigrated into India after the destruction of the empire of the Sassanides ( in 634 ) ; they form there an important and very rich community ( 89,900 individuals in 1891 ) , having still preserved their ancient Zoroastrian religion . This community , if chiefly composed of bankers , has also many men of letters .

The Afghans of India and the Indo-Afghan frontier are divided into several tribes , of which the principal ones are the Afridis near the Khyber pass and the Yusafzais near Peshawar.3 The Baluchzis or Biloch of Baluchistan and Western India speak an Eranian dialect akin to Persian ; physically they belong to the Indo-Afghan race , but mixed with the Arabs on the south and the Jats and the Hindus on the east , with the Turks Asia Minor in ancient times .

In reality , the ethnic place of this population , predominant in Beluchistan , is yet to be determined . With the Iranian group it is customary to connect , especially from linguistic considerations , the Kurds , the Armenians , and the Ossets ( p. 356 ) .

As to the Armenians or Hai , they are found in a compact body only around Lake Van and Mount Ararat , the rest being scattered over all the towns of the south-west of Asia , the Caucasus , the south of Russia , and even Galicia and Transylvania . It is a very mixed and heterogeneous ethnic group as regards physical type . The stature varies from rm. 63 to rm. 69 according to different localities , but the cephalic index is nearly uniformly brachycephalic ( 85 to 87 ) . The predominant features are however formed by the Indo-Afghan , Assyroid , and perhaps Turkish and Adriatic races . Their language differs appreciably from the other Eranian tongues ) . 2 . The Semile linguistic group is represented by Arabs , Syrians , and Jews .

Their best known tribes are those of the Bakhtyari and Maanaaseni . The Lurs are above the average height ( rm. 68 ) , and subbrachycephalic ( ceph. ind . 84.5 ) , according to Houssay , Duhousset , and Gautier . Cf. Houssay , " Les Peuples de la Perse , " Bull .

Typical nomads , having in the religion founded by Mahomet a national bond of union , the Arabs make their influence widely felt over the world . Traces of the Arab type are met with not only over the whole of Northern Africa ( see p. 432 ) , but also in Asia Minor , the Caucasus , Western Persia , in India ; while numerous traces of the Arab language 1 and civilisation are found in Europe ( Malta , Spain ) , in China , Central Asia , and in the Asiatic Archipelago .

They are found in compact groups only in the neighbourhood of Damascus , at Jerusalem , and at the foot of the mountain-chain of Safed . It is well known that to-day the Jews are scattered over the whole earth . Their total number is estimated at eight millions , of which the half is in Russia and Rumania , a third in Germany and Austria , and a sixth in the rest of the world , even as far as Australia . The great majority of Jews are unacquainted with Hebrew , which is a dead language ; they speak , according to the country they inhabit , particular kinds of jargon , the most common of which is the Judeo-German . Physically the Jews present two different types , one of which approximates to the Arab race ( Fig. 21 ) , the other to the Assyroid . Sometimes these types are modified by the addition of elements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; 1 but , even in these cases , many traits , such as the convex nose , vivacity of eye , frequency of erythrism ( p. 50 ) , frizzy hair , thick under lip , inferiority of the thoracic perimeter , etc. , show a remarkable persistence . The Arab type is common among the Spanish Jews who practise the Sefardi rite , among the native Jews of the Caucasus , very brachycephalic however ( 85.5 ceph. ind. , according to Erckert and Chantre ) , 2 and among those of Palestine , while the Assyroid type dominates among the Jews of Asia Minor , Bosnia , and Germany .

ANCIENT INHABITANTS OF AFRICA. ? We are only just beginning to know something about prehistoric Africa . Egypt , that classic land of the oldest historic monuments of the earth , has yielded in late years , thanks to the excavations of Flinders Petrie , D'Amelineau , and above all , of De Morgan , a large quantity of wrought stone objects , similar in character to  | those of Europe , and if certain objections may still be raised in regard to the paleolithic period of Egypt , which is not dated by a fauna , we can scarcely deny the existence of the neolithic period in this country , the period which preceded or was contemporaneous with the earliest dynasties of which monuments have yet been discovered . ) Hatchets , knives , and scrapers of very rude pala ? olithic and neolithic types have been discovered in Cape Colony ( W. Gooch , J. Sanderson ) ; flint arrow-heads and implements of the Chellean type in the country of the Somalis , in the Congo Free State ; 2 ironstone arrow-heads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Numerous stone implements and weapons of various pakeolithic types , much finer than the preceding , as well as neolithic hatchets , have been found in Algeria ( at Tlemcen ) , in South Algeria ( at El-Golea , etc. ) , and as far as Timbuctoo ( Weisgerber , Lenz , Collignon , etc . ) . Lastly , Tunis presents a progressive series of palxolithic implements absolutely similar to those of Europe in several stations ( at Gafsa and , in a general way , west from the Gulf of Gabes ) .3 But all these finds are very isolated and too far removed one from another to enable us to 1 Fl .

Further , the absence of bronze implements , outside of Egypt , leads us to suppose that the majority of the peoples of Africa , with the exception of the inhabitants of Egypt and the Mediterranean coast , passed from the age of bone and wood to that of iron almost without transition .

Historic data are lacking in regard to most of the peoples of Africa , especially for remote periods , except in Egypt . However , combining the various historic facts known to us with the recent data of philology and those , still more recent , of anthropology , we may assume with sufficient probability the following superposition of races and peoples in Africa . The primitive substratum of the population is formed of Negroes , very tall and very black , in the north ; of Negrilloes , brown-skinned dwarfs , in the centre ; of Bushmen , short , yellow , and steatopygous , in the south . On this substratum was deposited at a distant but indefinite period the so-called Hamitic element of European or Asiatic origin , the supposed continuators of the Cro-Magnon race.2 This element has been preserved in a comparatively pure state among the 1 See for details , R.

While Flinders Petrie , De  | Berbers , and perhaps has been transformed by interminglings with the Negroes , into a new race , analogous to the Ethiopian , with which we must probably connect the ancient Egyptians . The Berbers drove back the Negroes towards the south , while the Ethiopians , a little later , filtered through the Negroid mass from east to west . This infiltration continues at the present day . A new wave of migration followed that of the Hamites . These were the southern Semites or Himyarites who crossed from the other side of the Red Sea . Probably as far back as the Egyptian neolithic period they began the slow but sure process of modifying the Berbers , Ethiopians , and Negroes of the north-east of Africa . The Negro populations driven back towards the south were obliged to intermingle with the Negrillo pygmies , the Ethiopians , and Hottentot-Bushmen , and gave birth to the Negro tribes composing to-day the great linguistic family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ north to the south , then in the opposite direction and towards the west , have been authenticated . ) As a consequence of the interminglings due to these migrations , the Negrilloes and the Hottentots have been absorbed to a great extent by the Bantus , and the rare representatives of these races , still existing in a state of relative purity , are to-day driven back into the Morgan , and others suppose that Petrie 's " new race " of the neolithic period which preceded Egyptian civilisation in the Nile valley is related to the Libyans coming from the north-west of Africa , and perhaps from Europe , Schweinfurth ( Zeitsh. f . Ethnol , 1897 ; Verhandl. , p. 263 ) thinks that these neolithic people were immigrants from Arabia ( Semites ? ) , who had come into the Nile valley from the south , through Nubia .

Putting on one side the Madagascar islanders and the European and other colonists , ' the thousands of peoples and tribes of the " dark continent " may be grouped , going from north to south , into six great geographical , linguistic , and , in part , anthropological units : 1st , the Arabo-Berbers or Semito-Hamites ; 2nd , the Ethiopians or Kushito-Hamites ; 3rd , the Fulah-Zandeh ; 4th , the Negrilloes or Pygmies ; 5th , the Nigritians or Sudanese-Guinea Negroes ; 6th , the Bantus ; 7th , the Hottentot-Bushmen.

Three-fourths of the " Arabs " of Northern Africa are only Berbers speaking Arabic , and are the more " Arabised " in regard to manners and customs as they are nearer to Asia . The nomads of the Libyan desert and Tripoli have preserved fairly well the Berber type , but they have become Arabs in language and usages . In Tunis and Algeria the Arab influence is still very much felt in the south ; in Morocco it is very trifling . From the social point of view , the contrast is great between the settled Berber and the nomadic Arab . To give but one example , the democratic regime of the former , based on private property , bears no resemblance whatever to the autocratic regime of the latter , founded on collective property . But all the Berbers are not of settled habits ( example : the Tuaregs ) , and several tribes have adopted the Arab mode of life . ) Physically , the Algero-Tunisian Berber also differs from the Arab . His height is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Arab is distinguished by his lofty stature . The Berber head is , generally speaking , not so long as the Arab , although both are dolichocephalic .

This characterisation is quite general ; in reality , 1 See for details , Hanoteau and Letourneux , La Kahylie , etc. , Pads , 1872-73 ; Quedenfeld , " Berberbevolkerung in Marokko " Zeits. f .

( I ) The Djerba sub-race , characterised by short stature , globular head ( ceph. ind . on the living sub . 78 to 81.7 ) , is well represented in the populations of the south-east and the east Tunisian coast , as well as by certain Kabyles , by the Maabs , 2 and the Shaw/as of the Aures.

The Bedouins of Egypt ( 237,000 in 1894 ) are Berber-Arabs divided into numerous tribes ( Aulad-Ali , Gavazi , Eleikat , etc . ) . The nomadic or settled Moors ( Fig. 137 ) of the western Sahara , extending from Morocco to the Senegal ( the Trarza , 1 Duveyrier , Les Touare ; du Nara ' , Paris , 1864 ; Schirmer , lac. cit. 2 Rohlfs , Querdurch Africa , vol. i. , Leipzig , 1888.  | the Brakna , etc. ) , speak Arabic and " Zenagha , " which is a Berber dialect . These are Berbers more or less crossed with Negro blood . It must further be observed that the name of Moors is very wrongly applied to the Mussulman inhabitants of the towns of Algeria and Tunis and to the Rtfans of Morocco.l The Fellaheen , Mussulmans ( 635,600 in 1894 ) of the lower valley of the Nile ( as far as the first cataract ) , mixed descendants of the ancient Egyptians , must be included among the AraboBerbers because they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Arabs , but many of them have preserved intact the type of the primitive Egyptians , fundamentally Ethiopian , so well represented on various monuments in the valley of the Nile.2 The ancient Egyptian language is preserved , however , under the form of the Coptic dialect which , until quite recent times , served as the liturgical language to the Christian section of the inhabitants of Lower Egypt , known by the name of Copts ( 500,000 in 1894 ; cephalic index 76 , according to Chantre ) . We must likewise add to the Arabo-Berber group the Barabra ( in the singular Berberi ) inhabiting to the number of about 18o,000 the part of the Nile valley situated between the first and the fourth cataract .

The Ethiopians or Kushito-Hamites , who are sometimes called Nuba or Nubians , l inhabit the north-east of Africa , from the 25th degree lat . N. to the 4th degree lat . S. They occupy almost all the coast land of the Red Sea , and that of the Indian Ocean from the Gulf of Aden to Port Durnford or Wubashi . Their territory is bounded on the west by the Nile , the Bahr-el-Azrek , the western edge of the Abyssinian plateau , Lake Rudolf and Mount Kenia.2 In the northern part of this territory dwell the Bejas or Nubians , the different tribes of which , Bejas or Bisharin , Hamrans ( Fig. 238 ) , Hadendowas , Hallengas , etc. , are stationed one after another between the Red Sea and the Nile , from the first cataract to the Abyssinian plateau . Certain Beja tribes , like the Ababdeh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , partly of settled habits , the Beni-Amer to the east , the Jalin to the west , are in a large measure Arabised , but still speak a Hamitic language , while side by side with them dwell Semitised Ethiopian tribes , speaking only Arabic like the Habab and the Hassanieh of the Bayuda steppe or the Abu-Rof and Shukrieh of the lower basin of the Blue Nile.3 Sometimes the Barabras are also similarly designated , in my opinion wrongly , for this leads to a triple confusion , " Nuba " being still the name of a Negro tribe ( see p. 444 ) . It would be more correct to employ this term as a synonym of Northern Ethiopian ; besides , according to Strabo ( Book XVII . ) , Eratosthenes refers to the " Nubians " in his time as a people distinct from the Negroes and Egyptians . The Barabras are not so dark , have not such frizzy hair , and are not so tall as the Bejas , the Hamrans , and other Ethiopians their neighbours , and consequently belong , not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to the Arabo-Berber group . a For general works see Paulitschke , Beth-age Etlino ; r .

The sub-  | stratum of the population of the Abyssinian plateau is formed by the Agaw , Ethiopian in type , Hamitic in language , but the Abyssinians of the higher classes are strongly Semitised .

To the north of the Gallas , between Abyssinia and the coast ( from Cape Jibuti to Hamfila Bay ) , are the Afar ( in the plural Afara ) or Danakil ( Dankali is in the singular ) , who form the bulk of the population of the French colony of ObokTajura . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arabised .

Under this term we include the whole series of populations resulting from the intermingling of the Ethiopians and the Nigritians ( or Sudanese Negroes ) , and extending from east to west across the whole of Africa , over a belt of 5 to 6 degrees in width . This belt passes through the following regions , starting from the east : The country of the Masai ( between Lake Rudolf and the 6th degree of latitude S. ) ; the region comprised between the upper valleys of the right-hand tributaries of the Bahr-el-Arab on the one hand and the basin of the Ubangi-Welle on the other ; Darfur , Dar-Runga , Wadai , Baghirmi , and Bornu ; Dar Banda and the upper basin of the Shari ; a good part of the basin of the Niger-Benue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This territorial zone may be divided from the ethnographical point of view into two distinct portions by the line of the watershed between the basins of the Nile and Congo on the one hand and the basins of the Chad , Niger , and Senegal on the other . To the east of this line dwell , in compact groups , the Zandeh or Niam-Niam , Masai , and other populations who have sprung from the intermingling of the Ethiopians with the Negroes of the eastern Sudan ( Nilotic Negroes ) , and in some rarer cases with the Negrilloes and Bantus . To the west , on the contrary , we find , scattered over an immense tract , isolated groups of one population only , that of the Fulahs or Peuls , sprung from the crossings of 1 See Appendices I. to III . for the measurements given from the works already quoted of Deniker , Paulitschke , Santelli , Sergi , and Virchow.  | Ethiopians with the Negroes of the central and western Sudan , and further impregnated with a strain of Arabo-Berber blood . In the eastern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group , we find the Masai and the Wakuafi peoples of an Ethiopian type modified by intermingling with the Nilotic Negroes of the north , with the Bantus and perhaps with the Bushmen of the south , to judge by the photographs published by Luschan . The Masai speak a Nilotic-Negro language . On the north-east they touch the habitat of the Gallas , and are surrounded on every other side by Bantu tribes , except on the north-west , where , between Lake Rudolf and the upper Bahr-el-Jebel , exist populations still imperfectly known , the Latukas , the Turkan , the Lurems , who are probably half-breeds in various degrees of Ethiopians and Nilotic Negroes , l as are the Drugu and the Lendu of the region of the sources of the Ituri , the Logos and the Momvus or Mombuttus ( who must not be confounded with the Mangbattus ) of the upper valley of the Kibali.2 To the west of these tribes , in the basin of the UbangiWelle , we find a compact group of several peoples who , under various names , have however a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customs , and language . These are , in the first place , the Niatn-Niam or Zandeh , who with their congeners the Banja dwell to the north of the 1Velle . They extend beyond the ridge which divides this river from the White Nile , in the upper valleys of the Sere , the Jube , and other tributaries of the great river . We also find a few isolated Zandeh groups to the south of the Welle , but the greater part of the country watered by the left tributaries of this waterway is the domain of the Ababuas , the Abarmbos , and the Mangbattus or Monbuttus , remarkable for their light 1 J.

The Niam-Niam extend to the eastward to the country of the Makaraka ( tribes of Bornbeh , Idio , etc. ) , where they intermingle with the Mundus and the Babukurs . On the north-west the Zandeh are in contact with tribes still little known , like the Krej ( basin of the upper Bahr-el-Arab ) , the Bandas , and the N'Sakkaras , who , however , seem to be closely related . ' The Niam-Niam and the Mangbattus , who may be taken as types of Zandeh populations , suggest physically the Ethiopians ; however , strains of Nilotic-Negro blood are manifest among then . They have a civilisation well characterised by several traits in their material life : anthropophagy ( see p. 147 ) , garments of bast ( p. 183 ) , ornaments worn in the nostrils and in the lips perforated for the purpose , spiral-shaped bracelets , weapons of a particular kind ( pp. 259 and 269 ) , partly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bolster , and so many other objects . They are cultivators using the hoe ( p. 192 ) , fetichists partly converted to Islamism and forming little despotic states.2 The populations encountered by the travellers Crampel , Dybowski , and Maistre westward of the countries peopled by the Zandeh , between the Ubangi and the Grinbingi ( one of the principal branches of the Shari ) , must also be connected with the Zandeh group . These are , going from south to north , the Bandziri , the Nth-is , the Togbo , the Languassi , the Dakoa , the Ngapu , the Wia- Wia , the Mandjo , the Awaka , and the Akunga . The physical type of these tribes suggests that of the Niam-Niam , except the stature , which is higher , ( Im. 73 , according to Maistre ) . The language common to all these peoples , Ndris , differs from the Bantu dialects spoken on the Congo , and appears to approximate to the Zandeh ' Schweinfurth , " Die Monbuttu , " leits. f .

It is a mixed population , the substratum of which is Ethiopian but with a predominance either of Arab and Berber , or Negro elements ) . The favourite occupations of the Fulahs , stock-breeding and war , lead them away on more or less distant migratory journeys and expeditions ; thus it happens that they are found dispersed among the Nigritian populations over a large tract of country comprised between the lower Senegal and 1o ? latitude N. on the one part , and from Darfur to the hinterland of the Cameroons on the other part . A fact to be noted in regard to their geographical distribution is that they have not yet reached any point on the coast of the Atlantic . They are especially numerous in the valleys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Futa-Jallon and Darfur . The latter country is probably the primitive country of the Fulahs , whence they set out towards the west and the south ; their migrations from the Senegal towards the east are of recent date and continue to the present day . IV . The Nigritians. ? We include under this name all the Negro populations who do not speak the Bantu dialects ; these populations exhibit as a rule the classic traits of the Negro : lofty stature ( from im. 70 among the Mandingans to im. 73 among the Furs and the Wolofs , according to Collignon , Deniker , Felkin , Verneau , etc. ) , very marked dolichocephaly ( ceph. ind . on the liv . sub . reaching from 73.8 among the Toucouleurs to 76.9 among the Ashantis , according to the same authors ) , black skin , woolly hair in a continuous mat , large and flat nose ( nas. ind . varying from 96.3 among the Negroes of Tunis to 107.5 among the Ashantis ) , forehead bulging on the median line and often retreating , thick lips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various peoples composing the Nigritian group may be defined as 1 Stature , rm. 75 ; ceph. ind. , 74.3 ; nas. ind. , 95.3 ( Collignon and Deniker on 32 subjects ) .  | follows : on the north , a wavy line which at first , going from the mouth of the Senegal to the great bend of the Niger , then deviates little from the fourteenth parallel going to the Bahr-elGhazal and the Nile ; on the south , the coast of the Gulf of Guinea to the Cameroons , then the mountain ranges of Adamawa and the seventh degree of latitude N. , to the countries occupied by the peoples of the Fulah-Zandeh group , and farther to the east to the basin of the upper Nile . The latter constitutes the eastern limit , while to the west this limit is clearly indicated by the Atlantic Ocean . ' Among the Nigritians we also class the Titus or Teaas of the country of Tibesti , which extends in the midst of the Sahara between the encampments of the Tuareg on the west and the Libyan desert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much mixed with Berber and Arab elements.2 The Nigritian group may be divided into four great sections : a , the Nigritians of the Eastern Sudan ( Anglo-Egyptian ) or Nilotic Negroes ; b , those of the Central Sudan ( French ) , that is to say the Hausa-Wadai group , with the Tibu already mentioned ; c , the Nigritians of the Western Sudan ( French ) and the Senegal ; lastly , d , the Nigritians of the coast or Negroes of Guinea . a . The Nigritians of the Eastern Sudan or Nilotic Negroes speak various dialects having a certain relationship , and brought together under the name of " Nilotic " languages . These populations are Negroes in every acceptation of the word , except the not uncommon instances where they are intermingled with the Ethiopians ( chiefly in the east ) or with the Arabo-Berbers ( principally in the north ) . Thus the Nuba and the Futje of Fazokl are connected by several facial characteristics to the Ethiopians ; they have besides even adopted a Hamitic dialect , just as the Negroes of Kordofan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previously that in many places the northern portion of the Negro territory is invaded by the Ethiopians , the Fulah-Zandeh , and the Arabo-Berbers .

The Negroes of Darfur ( the Furs or Furava and the Dajo ) , of high stature , and very black ( Nachtigal ) , are much purer ; they speak a Nilotic-Negro dialect . In the west of the country they are mixed with the Fulahs , and Arab tribes surround them on all sides . The predominant race is descended from pure Arabs established first in Tunis , who achieved the conquest of Darfur only in the nineteenth century ) . To the south-east of Darfur , separated from this country by the encampments of the Bahr-el-Huer or Bagarra , Arabised Nilotes , dwell other Nilotics of a well-marked negro type . These are , first , the JVvers of the right bank , and the Shilluks ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bahr-el-Ghazal from Mechra-et-Reg to Fashoda ; then the Dinka , Denka , or , jan ; , ha ( about a million ) of the low country watered by the righthand tributaries of the Bahr-el-Ghazal , and by the Bahr-el-Jebel or Upper Nile . All these tribes are shepherds , sometimes also fishers or husbandmen . The upper valleys of the right-hand tributaries of the Bahr-elGhazal are occupied by the Bongo Negroes , divided into several tribes : Morn , Mittu , Bongo ( said to be steatopygous ) . Slightly blent with the Ethiopians , they have an almost red skin , of the colour of the soil of their country , impregnated with ore . They are accomplished smiths and good agriculturists . Between the Bongo of the west , the Dinkas of the north , and the Niloto-Ethiopian tribes like the Latuka of the east , there are established in the country traversed by the Bahr-el-Jebel the Nilotic Negroes called Bari . As to the upper basin of the Bahr-el-Jebel , it is occupied by the Mad/ ( not to be confounded with the A-Math of the Welle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connects them with the Shilluks ) , and the Lurl , who are , like the Dinka and Shilluks , true representatives of the Negro race . Very tall and slim , they resemble , with their long limbs , the wading birds of the marshes whose approaches they inhabit ; for the most part their head is elongated and corn- Nachtigal , Sahara and Sudan , Berlin-Leipzig , 1879-89 , 3 v01G.  | pressed , the forehead retreating , their skin is black , and they are blubber-lipped ; the face is the prognathous face of the Negroes , such as , in accordance with convention , they used generally to be represented . They are settled cattle-breeders and tillers of the soil. ? b . The Nigritians of Central Sudan present almost the same type as the Nilotes . Such , for instance , are the Negroes of Wadai ( the Tama , the Massalits ) and of Baghirmi ( the Barmaghe ) , or at least those among them who have remained free from intermixture , either with the Fulahs or the Arabs . As much can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( p. 444 ) , nor of their neighbours the Kanem , to the north of Lake Chad , and the Kanuri of Bornu and of the north of Adamawa , who closely resemble them , but who are tillers of the soil . The great nation of the Hausas prevails in the region situated between the Benue , Bornu , the middle course of the Niger , and Sahara ( Sokoto , etc. ) ; it extends even farther , into Adamawa . Their language.has become the language of commerce in those parts of the country limited by the bend of the Niger , into which Fulah has not yet penetrated ; it extends also into Bornu and Adamawa to the east , and into the country of the Mossi and the Kong to the west . The Hausa nation comprises a large number of peoples and tribes , with a greater or lesser Arab and Fulah intermixture , among whom also should probably be classed the Sara and their near relatives the Tumok between the Shari and the Logone . The Sara are distinguished by tall stature ( average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colour , and globular head ( average cephalic index on the living subject , 82 ) .2 c .

Farther to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between Germany and England , are found the Dagomba , the Mampursi , and their congeners the Gonja ; these last , whose centre is at Salaga , have exchanged their primitive language for " Guang , " which appears to be a dialect of the Ashanti tongue ( Binger ) . In commercial relations they employ also the Hausa and sometimes the Mande and Fulah languages , just as do the Dagomba and the Gurunga . The Bariba , natives of Borgu , the hinterland of Dahomey , have affinities with peoples we have just enumerated . 2nd . The Mande , Mandingan , 2 or better Mandenke ( the word 1 The Diumma or Diammo , to the north-east of the bend of the Black Volta , are probably a branch of the Gurunga ; only having for long been subject to the Ashantis they have adopted their language , which is the only one they use in addressing strangers .

The domain of the Mande language extends much farther to the east than the territory of the Mandenke peoples properly so called ; it encircles Timbuctoo , the countries of the Gurma and the Diumma , where it competes with the dialect of the Fulahs , and encroaches even on the domain of the Dogomba and the FIG. 14o. - Bonna M'Bane , Mandingan-Sosse ; height , 111-1. 74 ; ceph. ind. , 74.7 ; nasal index , 102 .

The Mandenke properly so called includes a large number of tribes , which may be divided into two great clans : the Bamma or Bambara , whose " tenne " or totem is the crocodile , and the Malinke ( hippopotamus totem ) .

The Soninke or Sarakoles 1 inhabit the right bank of the Senegal , above Matam and the margins of the Niger , and below the Bamako as far as the vicinity of Timbuctoo ; they are crossed with the Torodo , Bambaras , and Fulahs . As to the populations of the coasts , the following , proceeding from north to south , are the chief.2 First , the Diola , 3 between Casamanze and the Gambia , who have remained fetichist . They are tall ( 1m. 70 ) and dolichocephalic ( cephalic index , 74 . E according to Collignon and Deniker ) . The principal tribe , that of the Felups , has imposed its dialect on all the others . To the south of the Diola are the Balantes and the Bagnoris , a bellicose and turbulent people ; the Papels , one of the tribes of which , the Mandjacks , is the most in harmony with its masters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Biafares , the Nalus , the Landumans , fetichists of Rio Nunez , having affinities with the Hausa ; finally , the Baga of the Compong delta , half-savage fishers , fetichist like the two preceding , but of much fairer skin and more pacific.4 To the south of the Pongo river are met the Sussus or Sosse ( Fig. 140 ) , driven from Futa-Jallon by the Fulahs . Their language is spoken fluently in French Guinea , and even among the Nalus and Landumans . To the south of Mellacory , in Sierra Leone , the Timni take the place of the Sussus ; then come the Vei or Way , who extend as far as Monrovia ; alone among Negroes , they appear to possess a special mode of writing . All the Mande peoples bear a strong likeness to each other in physical type ( high stature , Im. 70 , dolichocephalic , colour black , etc. ) , and the different tribes are only to be distinguished by tattooings and other signs of an ethnographic kind , and by their dialects.5 1 Faidherbe , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 80. 2 For details see C.
