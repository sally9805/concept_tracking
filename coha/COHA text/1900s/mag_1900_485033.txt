From the day the nominations are made until the day the votes are cast and counted , it is against the law in the United States to hunt bosses . At an rate , their chase is suspended during that period as if it were illegal . The most enthusiastic and determined hinter of the Boss Anzencanus hangs up his rifle while the Presidential election IS pending . Platt goes , for the time , unwhipped of the Tribune Croker is courted and lauded and fooled to the top of his bent by the great ones of his party , from the candidate down . it is the close season for bosses , - with none to molest or make them afraid The immunity which they enjoy for this brief period is not unnatural . It is the time when the American people resolves itself into a committee of the whole to solicit votes . No man 's vote is despised . Strike , but vote for me , is tl'e motto of every candidate , of all parties . The ballot , once in the box , does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number there is the sole caiestion . And the boss , as presumably the mightiest vote-compeller , bulks large in party plans and hopes . Both parties , even while they hate him , consult and flatter him in this their hour of need . This is but human nature  --  political human nature . Besides , there is a reason in the nature of political effort why the bosses should , through this time of electoral intentness and absorption , be left inivexed . We can not attack all questions at once . To insist upon solving all political problems at the same time bas been said to be the political vice of the French people  --  the secret of the sterility of their political struggles , the failure of their Parliament . Our way is to divide and conquer One at a time , We will attend to you later  --  are American political watchwords . It sometimes happens that the smaller vermin can be destroyed along with the larger ; but usually we have to suffer the local and partial evil , even allowing it to increase , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But it is only a truce Both Tammany and " Tom " will find that the peace without honor which they have known for six months past is a precarious and fleeting joy . Their close season ended on Tuesday . Directly the boss became again fair game , and the hunt will reopen with greater vigor than ever . It must not be supposed , however , that the bosses have left these undisturbed months of theirs unimproved . While ostensibly working for their respective parties , they do not in reality abandon for one moment their great principle of working for their own pockets all the time . Who supposes that Platt is at all concerned for the reelection of McKinley , except as it may result in strength ening his clutch on the Republican machine in this State ? Who doubts that Croker 's ostensible activity in Bryan 's cause is , only his way of masking his plans for his own pecuniary and political aggrandizement ? What they are giving their time and strength to is not work for party , but for their personal machines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and full-fledged now that the election is over . Just what they are , no man can now say ; but that they will cause an outcry , both within and without their own parties , we have not a particle of doubt . It is a part of their regular plan of operations to extract the most unexpected and astonishing " mandates " out of an election in which their side has been successful . The people of this city may think that they are voting in favor of one or another national policy ; but they will soon learn from Platt and Croker what they really meant by their ballots . Platt 's expected " mandate " is only foreshadowed dimly as yet . His oracles are usually dumb until after election . But he has let us see a part of what he will gravely assert the people intended him to do with the power they have intrusted to him . There will be , he has said , a State Constabulary Law if the Legislature is turned over to him bound and gagged . By a State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force of all the cities in New York , under a State Commissioner named by the Governor  --  that is , by Platt . What a monstrous measure this would be , devised solely for building up a political machine , we need not now stop to argue . At present we merely point out that this is a part of the " mandate " which the McKinley voters were , all unwittingly , to give to Tom Platt The remaining contents of the mandate will appear later , as it-may be convenient for the boss to unfold them . As for Crakes , his mandate is concealed from nobody . He merely asks for fourteen Congressmen to make him a power at Washington ; all the Assemblymen and Senators from Greater New York to make him a dictator at Albany and throughout the State ; and such a renewed hold on this city as will enable him to cry cut , with Bitches , as he surveys the accumulated wealth of New York , " Was fur Plunder ! " One thing , however , the boss never learns by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gain respectability by an apparent victory at the polls , and that his personality remains as odious in triumph as it is contemptible in defeat . So if Platt and Croker have surprises in store for us after election , we also have the old surprise awaiting them . They will find that they are not autocrats . Revolt will spring up against their tyranny even in their own party organizations . " If the fleas were of one mind , they would have us out of had . " This was the saying with which a veteran English Parliamentarian used to comfort himself . Rascals can not hold together . Already the signs of disruption in Tammany are visible and threatening Many of Platt 's victims are writhing ominously . The war against both is certain to be resumed with new intensity and implacability .

President Hadley 's statement that American Imperialism began with the construction of battle-ships some ten 3 ears ago , has attracted no little atten t , on from the press As with individuals , so with nations , it is often enough the first step which costs . We have , in these columns , maintained from the first that the possession of a large modern navy would carry with it the strongest kind of temptation to use it at the expense of weaker nations , and we see non mg in the events of the last two years to cause us to change our opinions . We are glad to observe that such influential independent journals as the Boston Herald and the Philadelphia Ledger , and Republican newspapers like the Philadelphia Bulletin , are not afraid to ask whether it is not time to call a halt in the acquiring of war-ships , now that the growth of the navy has reach ad the size demanded by those who believe in the necessity of a strong fleet for defence The modernization of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has grown with great rapidity . Bp to that year it had consisted of some twenty-five or thirty wooden cruisers left over from the Civil War , apparently quite sufficient for the patrolling of the seas , the safe-guarding of Amerisans in China and elsewhere , the pro tertion of American interests during South and Central American revolutions , the destroying of derelicts , and tae mapping of the coasts and sea-bottom . It does not appear that the prestige or honor of the country or the safety of American citizens abroad suffered in any way during the years 1866 to 1885 ? the era of a small navy In 1864 the personnel allowed by law consisted of some 1,425 active officers , 7,500 men , and 750 boys . In 1896 the enlisted men and boys numbered 10,000 , and by 1900 the figures had risen to 21 , - 550 officers and men , the Marine Corps having meanwhile grown to 6,000 . During the war of 1898 the laws were disegarded , and nearly 8,000 more men were enlisted than had been authorized by Congress . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the men In 1900 there are not nearly enough crews for all the vessels built or building , despite the doubling of the navy 's quota , and there is a loud demand for more , which is expected to make itself felt in Congress this winter . During this period the appropriations have grown in still greater proportion , as is shown by the following table : Table In the same period there were added to the navy list seven battle-ships and forty-five monitors , cruisers , and gunboats , as well as nineteen . torpedo-boats Furthermore , the war with Spain led to the purchase and retention of about thirty vessels which were converted into cruisers and gunboats , and sixty or more colliers , supply ships , and tugs , while twenty-four more war-ships of all sizes , from the Reins Mercedes of 3,090 tons , to the little Sandoval of 100 tons , were captured or purchased from Spain In addition to this great increase , there are at the present day under construction or authorized by Congress eleven battleships , six armored cruisers , nine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroyers . To the average citizen who has the fear of foreign invasion at heart , it might well seem that this force would suffice to prevent European armies from landing on our shores , and European navies from capturing our towns , particularly if the vast system of army coast defences be taken into consideration . Upon the construction of harbor forts and batteries many millions have been spent since 1889 , and , while the end is certainly not yet in sight , Secretary Root has already asked for 18,000 men as the minimum force required in time of peace to man and care for the guns already in place . But the Naval Board of Construction is by no means content with all this . On the ground , it is said , that the American navy must equal in size the fleet now planned by the German Emperor , the Board calls for the construction of three battle-ships , three armored cruisers , and perhaps twelve or more gunboats . This is merely a fraction of the increase to be authorized by Congress in 1901 . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the construction of these ships will tax the capacity of our shipyards to the uttermost . For this reason the Navy Board may have been magnanimously moderate in contenting itself with rivalling Germany . Perhaps in the course of the next two or three years , if public sentiment is not aroused against further increase , we shall learn that we must surpass Japan or Russia Nor must the fact be overlooked that our new insular possessions furnish a reason for lavish expenditure as being a great source of military weakness to us . Hawaii , the Philippines , and Porto Rico are now used as arguments for more ships , naval stations , and coast defences by some of the same men who , but the other day , declared that outlying points thousands of miles beyond our coasts were necessary for the protection of our harbors and cities and a source of strength . It is plain that the time has come for the American people to discuss soberly and earnestly the question of our future naval policy , and to decide whether we are to assume the crushing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the smallest possible fleet consistent with defence is the true American limit , will agree with the Philadelphia Ledger that the policy of running a race with Germany , France , or England is " sheer folly and dangerous folly , " and " an excuse for saddling the country with war taxes . " Those who believe that anything which makes for war is a step backward in civilization , should not fail to protest , in season and out of season , against any further expenditure for military or naval purposes . They can meet any charge of lack of patriotism by replying in the words spoken by William Everett in Congress in 1895 , that " the United States is too great , too noble , too modern to sink herself to the level of the military nations of the ancient world . " He spoke but the truth when he said that the true American enemy lies in our great cities , and that our first duty is to " train , to educate , to guard , to raise , to assimilate " their population . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussion of the Gold Standard in the present campaign , hardly anything has been said about the present or future supply of that metal . In the controversies of previous years , one of the arguments most stoutly insisted upon , and no doubt honestly maintained , was that the world 's supply of gold was in , sufficient , and that the decline in the prices of commodities which had been continuous since 1873 , was due to a shortage of metallic money consequent upon the demonetization of silver . Profuesor Suess of the University of Vienna affirmed , upon geological grounds , that the world was nearing the end of its gold resources , that the South African supply would soon be exhausted , and that then we should be in the presence of a financial and industrial crisis of great magnitude . When the German Government was considering the question of calling a new Monetary Confer once , it invited Dr. Suess to Berlin to give the reasons for his opinion in detail , which he did . This inquiry took place in 1894 Six years have passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by the way , was eagerly welcomed on this rude of the water and was put in active service in the campaign of 1896 . And what have we witnessed since 1894 ? The world 's gold production in that year was $181,175,600 . Four years later ( 1898 ) it had risen to $287,428,600 . The annual product had increased more than $100,000,000 in that short space of time , and nearly all the increase had come from veins in rock formation having the promise of more or less permanence ? differing in that respect from the placer mines of California , Australia , and Siberia , which gave such a remarkable output about the middle of this century . Prof. J. S. Newberry , a most competent authority , writing twenty years ago , said that fully nine-tenths of all the gold possessed by mankind had come from placer deposits . At the present time , much the larger share of gold produced comes from veins in which gold is held in a matrix of quartz , or in combination with other substances from which it is separated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold has been revolutionized within comparatively few years The means for its extraction from the earth have been improved in as great ratio as the means for making steel rails , building fast steamships , printing newspapers , propelling street cars , or doing any other thing by modern machinery . We not only have got a larger supply of material to work on than ever before , but have a vastly improved apparatus to work with . The results are correspondingly great . The highest rate of yearly production in the fifties , when the California and Australian placers were at them maximum , was $134,000,000 , or less than half the annual output at present . The largest gold-producing countries in 1898 were : TABLE The production of the States and Territories of the United States for the same year was .

There is no means in the United States of taking account of gold found by individual prospectors . If they have any reason for concealing their gains , they can not be forced to disclose them . Many Chinese laborers who have worked over old and abandoned diggings or have washed in. river beds where the returns are too small to tempt white laborers , have gone ' back to their own country , taking their gold dust with them , of which no report has been made This process is still going on in both the United States and Canada . The supply of gold in the immediate future will come from the places which now furnish the largest output , the WitwaterSrand of South Africa , Cripple Creek , Colorado , the various Australian deposits , the , Klondike , Alaska , and Siberia . There are still large placer deposits in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been suspended or crippled by the difficulty of impounding the tailings or detritus , which was formerly allowed to flow into the river-beds and thence over the adjoining land , to the ruin of agriculture . The receipts from the Klondike have risen to $16,000,000 the present year , and from Cape Nome and other Alaskan points to upward of $2,000,000 . The whole amount from the North is likely to be increased to $20,000,000 before the close of the season . The reasons for the increased production of recent years are new discoveries of ore beds , new mining and metallurgical inventions , and better facilities of transportation . The decline in the price of silver and its demonetization have turned the attention of the mining fraternity , to a considerable extent , from that metal and stimulated the hunt for gold . There is not the least reason to suppose that we have come to the end of great finds of the metal or of new inventions for extracting it There are probably just as extensive and just as rich deposits in the world , yet untouched , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Creek , the Klondike , and West Australia . The financial and industrial crisis due to a shortage of the yellow metal , so confidently predicted by Professor Suess and others a few years ago , is so far distant that nobody need borrow trouble over it . RICH MEN AND DEMOCRACY . I have been reading with much interest Goldwin Smith 's pamphlet entitled ' Commonwealth or Empire , ' reprinted by the Anti-Imperialist League from the Toronto Globe . I was particularly struck by what he says of the growing alliance between the English Tories and the American multimillionaires , and the resultmg attempt to give a popular endorsement to the policy of a " chocolate ? clair " like McKinley , to use Roosevelt 's phrase . But I must remind Professor Smith that the growth of the multi-millionaire class in America , and its effect on society and politics ; were foreshadowed more than sixty years ago by De Tocqueville , In his ' 136moeratie en Am6- rique . ' As I am writing at a distance from my " ' melts , I am unable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at considerable length , the tendency in all democracies , and particularly in the American Democracy , for the rich and energetic and successful to seek to escape from the common mass by setting up little organizations , or clubs , composed of persons who are or think themselves distinguished . This tendency began to show itself after the end of the civil war , in 1865 , by the formation of such organizations as " The Sons of the Revolution , " " The Society of Colonial Wars , " " The Colonial Dames , " " The Daughters of the Revolution , " " The Society of Mayflower Descendants , " " The United Order of Pilgrim Fathers , " " The St. Nicholas Society of New York , " " The Holland Society of New York , " and " The Hug-uenot , Society of America . " I suppose the first suggestion of these things came from the " Cincinnati , " although the " Cincinnati " was gravely disapproved of by some of the best men in the country , after the Revolution . Tocqueville points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any democracy based on equality , will be long content to share the common lot . In a moneymaking community , the rich and the energetic would be sure to accumulate large fortunes , and would consequently very soon begin to look upon themselves as a class apart , entitled to be " exclusive . " This prediction began to be fulfilled very soon after the civil war . Owing to the immense natural resources of the country , and the tremendous and inexpensive additions made to the population by immigration from Europe , Northerners at least began to grow rich , hand over hand . Fortunes such as Europe had never seen in any rank began to abound among American business men . At first there was a ludicrous difficulty in spending these fortunes , but it soon passed away . Just at the same time , the new engines made the passage of the Atlantic so quick that a trip to Europe , which used to take place only once in a lifetime , became a summer excursion , and the making of it became a sign , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life The result of this was a great increase of social intercourse between the wealthy classes of both countries , and a complete change in English feeling toward America . Americans in England , from being looked on with dislike and contempt , became great favorites in English society , and welcome at all the great English houses , for Englishmen like " the smell of money . " All their faults were eagerly overlooked in view of their wealth , admiration of which was greatly ; increased by the astounding size of American fortunes , and there was a rush of American heiresses to marry English titles . There was one bitter drop in the American cup , however , and that was that we had no coaling stations , no colonies , no subject races ; in short , that we were not a " world Power . " There was deep humiliation over this , in London ball-rooms and at dinner-tables , and our rich men determined to put an end to it . Washington and Jefferson we became a little ashamed of , and the Declaration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mass of " glittering generalities . " In order to inaugurate the new republic , a syndicate of rich men selected a canaldate for President that would suit them , who had no convictions of his own ; paid his debts , and got him ready for the office ; and were successful under the pretence of danger to the finances . He answered the purpose admirably He " put his ear to the ground , " treated the Constitution as a dead letter , annexed large provinces on the other side of the globe , appointed a full line of viceroys and warriors of his own choosing . doctored their communications with home , treated subject races as vermin , and very soon enabled our wealthy men to hold up their heads as a " world Power " in England , and put an end to all nonsense about freedom and equal rights . If their movement should succeed in getting endorsement at the approaching election , I believe it will be the most skilful conversion of a republic into an empire of the many that have taken place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from discontented soldiers as from discontented multi-millionaires . They are very rarely , if ever , content with a position of equality , and the larger the population which is said to be equal with them , the less content they are . Their natural desire is to be a class apart , and if they can not have titles at home , they wish to be received as equals by titled people abroad . That is exactly our present position , and would be the end of the American dream . All past republics have been overthrown by rich men , or nobles , and we have plenty of Sons of the Revolution ready for the job , and plenty of successful soldiers deriding the Constitution , unrebuked by the Executive or by public opinion . To make matters worse , the universities lave largely followed the multi-millionaires , and a tap on the shoulder , a flattering word , or a free trip round the world , is enough to make many a college president swallow his own words , and preach doctrines of devils to the young men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ably commented on by President Pritchett , a notable exception , in his inaugural address at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Boston the other day . In fact , there has not been a more complete abandonment of the cause of the plain people , by the rich and the learned , in modern times . I care little for either the Democratic or the Republican party , but I am concerned for the perpetuity of the American commonwealth , and for " the good old cause " everywhere , " the cause for which Sidney died on the scaffold , and Hampden died on the field , " to use the language of a distinguished Englishman ; a " cause ever dear to the wisest , the bravest , and the best , unfelt and abandoned only by the recreant and the vile .
