Lord Erskine once said to Canning that he thought Mr. Percival must be more of a man than Canning was willing to allow ; " for , " he added , " you never make a speech without making an enemy , and he never makes a speech without making a friend . That goes a good way in the long run . " Speech-making as a branch of the gentle art of making enemies has had abundant illustration in the present campaign . Mr. Bryan 's oratory has unquestionably repelled many ; whether it has , at the same time , won more , election day alone can tell . But as between Presidential candidates , the competition has been not that of-rival speakers , but of volubility against silence In no respect has Mr. McKinley been more lucky than in having to sustain the dignity of his office by keeping still . It is not only that a very pleasing " otium " goes with this " dignitas . " The President 's abstention from speaking is a positive political advantage to him . By observing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is traditional shrewdness , also , in looking wise and saying nothing . Many a Sir Oracle has shattered his reputation by opening his lips . In one way , however , Mr. McKinley 's advantage of silence seems somewhat unfair . His opponent has to answer ( or dodge ) questions . We do not remember that the English practice of " heckling " candidates has ever been so extensively used in this country as we have seen it this year . Every Republican committee , every newspaper , every rival orator , has a triumphant list of questions which Mr. Bryan is challenged to answer . No such awkward queries confront President McKinley . He allows his supporters to go on advancing contradictory arguments for his election , and is not himself called upon to reconcile opposites . Yet if he were the leader of a party in the sense that Gladstone was , or Chamberlain is , he would not be permitted to take refuge in silence . He would have to explain his policy in the past , and sketch out a distinct programme for the future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the people would find out whether it could be said of him , as it was of Anselm of Laon by Abelard : " He was that sort of man that , if any one went to him being uncertain , he returned more uncertain still . He was wonderful to hear , but at once failed if you questioned him . " Some of the questions which Mr. McKinley would have to answer if , like Bryan , he had gone out to meet all corn , ers , relate to his Philippine policy , past , present , and future . A very embarrass-. ing que , stwnnaire could be presented to him on that subject . For example : ( 1 . ) Had you any warrant in law for declaring in your proclamation of De- , cember 21 , 1898 , that the United States had acquired " rights of sovereignty " in the Philippines , the fact being that we had , at that date , no more title to the islands than to Ireland ? If not , were you not guilty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for attempting to suppress this proclamation on the ground that it would drive the natives to take up arms ? ( 2 . ) Is it true that your original instructions to the Peace Commissioners commanded them to take only coaling and naval stations in the Philippines , or at most the island of Luzon ? Did you in those instructions speak gratefully of the services which the Filipinos had , as our allies , rendered to our arms ? Did you state as . a reason for not surrendering Aguinaldo to Spain that he had been of the greatest assistance to our army ? If none of these things were said in those parts of your instructions which you have suppressed , what was said , and what defence have you for garbling a public document ? " ( 3 ) Did you say to Senator Wellington , when urging him to vote for the treaty , that its ratification was the surest way to secure the Filipinos their independence ? Is Senator Hoar right now in saying that you will soon advocate Philippine independence ? If the Supreme Court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that their inhabitants may freely come to compete with our labor , will you still say that Duty and Destiny require us to keep the Philippines , or will you scuttle as precipitately as Senator Foraker has said you would ? There are many things about the President 's intentions in Cuba which the Cubans and many other people would mightily like to know . The questions would cover points like these . What did you say to the Cuban leader , Setor Cisneros , which made him go from Washington to Havana and declare there that you had no intention of allowing Cuba to become independent ? ' Did Gen. Wood speak with your authority and approval when he told inquiring Cubans that the United States would insist upon maintaining forts and garrisons in Havana and Santiago , and that Cuba would not be permitted to have a diplomatic service , nor an army , nor a navy , neither would she be allowed to contract a national loan without the consent of the United States ? Do you consider a crippled independence such as that would be , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Several other important questions relating to the future policy of President McKinley would gladly be put to him by troubled voters . For instance Are you now negotiating for the purchase of St. Thomas , and will the acquisition of that island be announced among the other good things we are to look for " after the election " ? lRo you mean to take a vote of the inhabitants , as Sew . ways of subjugating a people . One is by means of law , another by the aid of religion , and the third is to " cut the throats of a part of the nation in order to govern the rest . " We have tried a little of each , though our main reliance has been throat-cutting ; but by neither method , nor by all three together , have we won any appreciable success . Among the accumulating proofs of this we note an interview with Mr. Spencer Pratt in the Singapore Free Press . Mr. Pratt was formerly United States Consul at Singapore , and had much to do in getting Aguinaldo to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friendship with many Filipinos , and spent some time in the Philippines this past summer . Condensing what he says of the state of affairs there , we find him declaring that " the situation , from the military point of view , is very unsatisfactory " ; that there is " gross maladministration " and " corruption " in the civil government ; that the army , from top to bottom , has a strong " distaste for their present work , " one officer telling him that " at least 100,000 men will be required to effect the pacification of the islands " ; that the President 's amnesty proclamation was " not taken seriously , " and fell absolutely fiat ; that the natives do " not believe that the American people know the facts of the situation , or that they had given any moral authority for the things that were being done . " Ex-Consul Pratt said , in concluding his interview : " It is a great pity some one was not sent to learn the truth and tell it to the American people ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed . " Prof. Ferdinand Blumentritt , of the Berlin Society of Ethnology , is the leading German authority on the Philippines . We have before cited his writings . He has now issued a pamphlet , covering the latest developments , which has been translated by Dr. D. J. Doherty , and published by Donohue Bros. , Chicago . It ought to be read by everybody desirous of knowing the truth . Professor Blumentritt 's closing section is headed " American Blunders . " It is not pleasant reading for Americans , but it would - be wholesome reading for them . It is an impartial account Of tb:e frightful results of an ear-to-the-ground policy when the welfare of 8,000,000 human beings is in , volved . The Washington Government fumbled and backed and filled through all the critical months ; the American officers in Manila fumed and fretted , and were evasive or tongue-tied in their dealings with the natives ; then when , at last , the United States made up its mind , so fatally late , to keep the islands , the crowning blunder was made of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and assistance , of crushing , instead of cherishing , an existing local government , of hunting trusted native leaders to death , ? in'short , of floundering about in domineering i  --  norance and brutality as if the A B C of colonization and government of protectorates had yet to be learned by the United States . This severe indictment by Prof. Blumentritt Of American management in the Philippines has a striking side-light thrown upon it in the last annual report of Sir Frank Swettenham , Resident-General of the Malay Protectorate . It is a record of remarkable prosperity , progress , and contentment . Now the point is that the Federated Malay States are peopled by a race kindred to the Filipinos , and that , in 1874 , their pacification was undertaken under the protectorate of Great Britain . The thing was done without military operations . Sir Andrew Clarke , who did the work , wrote out an account of his methods , which was published among the documents printed along with the Paris Treaty . It might as well have . been written in a Malay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No troops , no force of any kind , urged Sir Andrew , but native rule under an upright and able protectorate . There was the whole open secret . By all means , wrote Admiral Clarke to Capt . Mahan , bind Aguinaldo to you ; make him Governor of Luzon at a fixed salary ; select other native rulers for other groups . The Filipinos will be easier to govern than the Malays , wrote Sir Frank Swettenham to Consul Pratt , because they are more intelligent , and un . derstand better the ways of white men . Thus we see that , to an experienced English Resident-General , the problem before the United States seemed simple and easy . All that one had to do was to know as much of colonization as is taught in the kindergarten . But we were too proud to learn . We would show the world how to do it . We would hew out our own way . Well , we have done it , and as we look about at the ruin we have wrought , we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' cuteness , the traditional inventiveness and energy and readiness of our country ? what have they to show in the Philippines ? If they had aimed at making a desolation , could they have been more successful ? Our miserable and tragic failure there has been mainly due to a wilful blindness to experience . Our folly in taking the islands at all is but heightened by our demonstrated lack of sense and tact in governing them . The capital blunder we have committed has been the neglect of that first principle of modern colonization laid down by Sir Andrew Clarke , namely , the prime need of a " sympathetic administration , " which " deals tenderly with native prejudices , and seeks to lead upward a free people instead of forcibly driving a subject race . " END OF THE GOAL STRIKE . The strikelof Miners of anthracite coal has ended in a substantial victory forthe men , and this without any considerable disturbance of the peace . They get a 10 per cent . advance in wages , which is perhaps equal to 25 cents per ton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in view of the severity of the labor they perform and the dangers they incur , few persons who know anything about coal-mining will deny . The only question really open to dispute was whether the market would justify such an advance . This question is a very complicated one . It is a question of supply and demand , and it takes in the whole range of coal supply , anthracite and bituminous . It touches also the question of foreign and domestic demand and supply , since we are both imparters and exporters of coal . We export largely to Canada at the same time that we import from Nova Scotia , whose mines are capable of sending us a much larger supply than we now receive if the price is raised sufficiently to neutralize the tariff . We are beginning to export coal to the Mediterranean countries , and this , too , is a question of price . In our own market the competition between anthracite and bituminous is severe , and the problem with the operators and the carrying companies has been whether they could recoup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase of the market price of anthracite . To do so they must get a little more than the additional price per ton which the increased wage calls for , since the increased price will lessen the quantity consumed . There is always a certain margin of consumption at $5 per ton which will cease when the price rises to $5.25 , and the loss of this proportion of sales may make , all the difference to an operator , and may take all the profits of his business . It is possible , on the other hand , that the market price may be raised sufficiently to put the operator in a better position than he  --  was before . We say that this is possible , but it is not probable . It must be assumed , in any calculation of chances , that the producers of anthracite were charging all that they , could get , in competition with the producers of bituminous , before the strike began , and that this competition will not be relaxed by reason of the advance of wages in the anthraRite field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recoup themselves . Anthracite has some properties which give it a preference over bituminous . It produces no smoke . It is preferred for domestic use . Its use is compulsory in New York city and in some other large markets . In such places it is only necessary for the producers to combine and agree not to give away their coal as they have done sometimes , under the fierce stress of competition , heretofofe . Nothing but an experiment can solve these various problems . Nor are the economical problems all on one side . If for any reason the public will not pay the increased price for anthracite , the increased wages can not b , e paid for any great length of time . The Salvance will not in that case be sus-. tained beyond the lst of April . If the consumption should fall off 10 per cent . by reason of the increased price , then 10 per cent . of the men employed in mining will have to be laid off , or their working time correspondingly reduced . There is the chance also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the mining field , and thus eventually bring on an undesirable competition in the labor market . These problems will also solve themselves by time . The men immediately concerned , the strikers , were not bound to consider remote consequences , which may not come at all . They were right in looking to their own present interests , because if they did not do so , nobody else would . They have won a victory of considerable magnitude , and they and their leader , Mr. Mitchell , are to be congratulated on the orderly course that the proceedings have generally taken . The action of the strike leaders in calling out men who were working under agreement to arbitrate has , as we have before remarked , dealt a severe blow to the cause of arbitration in that region . The operators are not likely to enter into such agreements with their men in the immediate future . The men have received " concessions , " but they do not go back to work under any " agreements . " The operators have merely " declared " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the strike leaders have done exactly what they have said all along the would not do  --  namely , order the men back to work at the mines where satisfactory concessions had been received without waiting for such concessions everywhere . When the strike was declared off , a number of operators had made no concessions , and the official or- , der continued the strike at these mines . If this policy had been adopted at the start , the levelling-down process might have been avoided , and the employees of G. B. Markle &; Co. might now be working under a definite agreement to arbitrate differences as before . The policy adopted by the strike leaders of treating all operators alike has removed all incentives , for individual operators to make any special concessions to their employees in the future . This makes the miners ' victory much less of a victory than it might have been . What effect will the strike have on politico ? has been asked more than once . It is the general belief that if it had gone on , and especially if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect would have been disastrous to the Republican party . The Republicans are looked upon as the party of capital , and it is true that events during the past few years have driven capitalists increasingly into that party . The demand for bad kinds of money which the Democratic party has put into its platform has contributed more than aught else to this result . The disposition in the same party to tamper with the courts of justice has had a tendency to turn Democratic lawyers of influence and distinction away from their own camp , and naturally many of their clients follow them . Alliance with ' the Populists has had the same effect , so that in ' one way and another capitalism and Republicanism have become - associated together . This is not a desirable condition , since it creates class distinctions which widen and deepen , and may end no one knows how . The fact for present consideration is that if the strike had not been settled before the election , it would have been very damaging to the Republicans . If it had been accompanied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everywhere , and must have injured McKinley . This dangerous factor is now removed , and nobody will be more rejoiced than Senator Hanna , who has allowed it to be understood thk't he had a hand in bringing about peace So upon the whole it is probable that the Republicans have not lost any votes , but may have gained some , as the outcome of the strike . CO-OPERATION IN FRANCE . Full official reports of the coOperative congresses which assembled in Paris this summer are now appearing , and they give an account of the movement in France which is full of interest . France is the land of productive cooperation , much as Germany is the land of credit and England of distributive cooperation . Without including the earlier more purely socialistic experiments , the cooperative movement in France dates back to the middle of the century , when the Government interested itself in workingmen 's associations and advanced large sums of money to them for capital . These loans were placed without sufficient care , were seldom repaid , and were soon dissipated . The Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protection and favor , nor have cooperative associations on their-part ceased to look to the Government for aid . The cooperative establishments are the " infant industries " of France It is this dependence upon public favor which led the National Congress of Cooperative Producers to devote its attention so largely to a discussion of means to be employed for enforcing rigorously a decree issued June 4 , 1888 . The Congress began and ended its session with a discussion of this decree relating to the award of public contracts . Its essential provisions were that such contracts should be divided up and let out piecemeal wherever possibleain order to give opportunities to coOperative societies ; that the associations need not deposit any guarantee fund where contracts did not exceed 50,000 francs ; that such societies should be given preference , where bids were equal , over other contractors ; and that accounts for work performed should be settled every fifteen days . The provisions of this decree , which have been extended to departmental and municipal contracts , have been so generally disregarded in the public awards that M. Waldeck-Rousseau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a circular to departmental officials , warning them that they were liable to suits for damages where contracts were awarded illegally . On February 4 , 1900 , at a banquet tendered him and M. Millerand , Minister of Commerce , by certain cooperative associations , M. Waldeck-Rousseau declared- that he believed the state should be the first client of cooperative associations , the first to manifest confidence in such societies before all people . As a witness of his own confidence , he gave out certain building contracts in connection with the Exposition to cooperative societies , and after the work was finished , he tendered those associations a banquet , in which he drank to the health of cooperators and gave assurances of more work to be done . Having prepared and addressed to the several Ministers of State a memorial reciting the original decree of 1888 , and later decrees relating to its non-enforcement , the Congress proceeded to consider a question of more general interest It asked itself what were the essential features of cooperation . The Congress displayed an almost morbid sensitiveness in taking up what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which could be brought before it . Many of the French societies have borrowed money , or secured necessary capital , by issuing shares to outsiders who have been given the privilege of voting on their holdings of stock In many lines of industry , such advances of capital to associations of workingmen are absolutely essential to their establishment and ' successful operation The provisions in ' accordance with which these outside shareholders have been allowed to vote and enter into the management of concerns , have varied from society to society Some voice in- the management they have demanded Is a condition of making any advances whatever A society operating with capital contributed by outsiders obviously begins to assume the features of a joint-stock company , and this similarity is decidedly embarrassing for cooperators . Moreover , cooperative societies of producers , even when they have not secured outside capital , have shown a marked tendency to develop into joint=stock concerns One shareholder after another drops out , the more enterprising mem-bers buy up the less enterprising , some die , and in oneway or another shares Come into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incomes . The number of employees not owning shares increases , and as the concern prospers in a business way , it contracts as a cooperative association , until those who own the stock develop into full-fledged capitalists . Now to define a cooperative society is to determine the exact point at which a society of cooperators becomes a society of bourgeois capitalists . The Congress set about answering this question , and determined upon a number of essential requisites for a society which should undertake to qualify as cooperative . M. Bougot proposed that no member be accorded more than one vote , whatever the amount of his shares , and this democratic principle was agreed to by a vote of 34 to 24 . Immediately upon adopting it , however , the delegates began to seek a less radical provision . It was felt that societies would find difficulty in securing necessary advances of capital on such terms , and a compromise was effected in the adoption of a resolution that , to be a cooperative society in good standing , an association must not require a payment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving theta a voice in the management of the concern , nor more than 1,000 francs ( $200 ) as a condition of eligibility to the Board of Directors , three-quarters of whom must be working cooperators ; it must not allow more than five votes to any one shareholder , nor more than one vote for every 500 francs ( $100 ) of subscribed capital , and when a question of amending the statutes of a society or of dissolving it should arise , members must vote on the one-man-one-vote principle . In France the societies of producers are not closely affiliated with the societies of consumers , as they are in England , where productive societies have been established by the distributive societies . Indeed , no close affiliation of this sort is possible in France , because the productive societies in general do not produce what the distributive societies want . Instead of producing for an assured market through distributive societies , the French cooperative producers have entered into the general field of industrial competition . In meeting this competition they have been less agile than capitalistic employers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wall , although they have enjoyed special privileges and favors from the Government . They lack the spirit of aggressive and self-reliant independence which characterizes the English societies . The French cooperator , on the other hand , is doctrinaire , and finds in his philosophy an inspiration akin to religious enthusiasm  --  a spirit entirely lacking among English cooperators . MAX MULLER . In this decade have died three men who , born in the twenties within five years of each other , have occupied , each in his own field , the same relative position in respect of science on the one hand and of the general public ' on the other . Tyndb. " 11 , Huxley , and Max Muller , who died on October 29 , at Oxford , for half a century represented to the world at large the oracles of their respective fields of knowledge . Yet none of the three held this position in the eyes of the inner circle of scientific workers , who , indeed , recognize no oracle , and judge their colleagues exclusively on technical grounds The general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man as revealed in his general thought and especially in his style Perhaps this judgment , though often extremely inaccurate in details , is , on the whole , not less just than the narrower appreciation of the scientific world These three men well illustrate the difference m the two points of view While not admitted to any lofty rank by his scientific brethren , Tyndall held his materials in a firm grasp and was master of a clear style and- a thought behind it equally gleaming and incisive . In like manner Huxley will be remembered less as a comparative anatomist and taxonomist than as a popular lecturer and writer of books comprehended of the people , and well weighted with careful thought Both of these men died in the full glory of popular applause , and therein they were happier than the third of this remarkable trio , for Muller 's fame waned before his death , and for the last ten years no critic has been too bumble to speak of him lightly in his capacity of linguist and mythologist . But the master of a-generation ago can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his ability and to the work actually accomplished by him . It is true that he was at his best as an interpreter . His unrivalled style , his enthusiasm , his eloquence in a domain distinguished for arid research , made him and his field known to those who would otherwise have bad no interest in the line which he represented . But is this a slight thing ? There are many who owe to Muller 's magnetism the first impulse to tread in the path which he opened for them , many who have been accustomed to sneer , and yet have him to thank for the ability to do so . In a word , Muller , even as a middle-man between the inner shrine and the outer world , deserved well of two generations . In his matured strength he was an inspiration , and he always aided his chosen science by his poetic insight and suggestiveness , even when the cause for which'Ili% fought was wrong Regarded solely from the material side , the benefit he conferred upon Sanskrit studies in winning means for others as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a small item in the score of good he must have entered to his credit . But in point of fact , despite the unsatisfactory nature of much of his later work , Muller was by no means a mere go-between , feeding the public with grain raised by others It is true that he was somewhat vainglorious and not very scrupulous in the allotment of praise which should be rendered for what was done by others under his supervision What he constantly proclaimed to be his own great work , the edition of the ' Rig Veda , ' was in reality not his at all A German scholar did the work , and Muildr appropriated the credit ' for it . But , even in this case ; - though ' the judgment be true , it is harsh . The German scholar was paid for his labor , and did the best he could to circumvent Muller in getting out his editio prima The incident is not altogether creditable to either party , but one thing is certain ; there would have been no schOlcar doing the work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left the plough and he hired some one else to do willingly what he was unwilling to complete , is a matter of minor importance . Then , again , Muller 's ' Ancient Sanskrit Literature , ' published forty years ago , was an independent ' Slid thoroughly scholarly book , which has ever since held its own with the first publications in this complex field of investigation . When , after twenty years , Muller returned to the special study of literature , from which-'his phonetic and mythological pursuits had withdrawn him , although the volume published under , the title , ' India , What Can It Teach Us ? ' showed a marked decline in power in the body of the book , the learned appendix on the " Renaissance of Sanskrit Literature " proved that the old scholar was still there , vigorous , ingenious , persuasive . But the very circumstance that the most important part of the book was relegated to an appendix , while the main part was taken up with such bagatelles as " The Truthful Character of the Hindus , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicative of a grave change in Muller 's attitude . He had catered to the public so long that scholarly work had become of only secondary consequence . For his general reputation this was a fatal error , since the very public he served repudiated him as a guide , while the scholars he had deserted , and to whom , in his eagerness to be always the first , he had been insultingly unfair , were more prone to ridicule'his pretensions than to admit the genuine worth of his contributions to knowledge . It is no time now to speak of the unhappy quarrels which disfigured the later years of Muller 's life . Not only in this country , but in Germany , his bitterest enemies were those of his own household . Sanskrit scholars - could not forgive the dishonesty of statement which marked his ex-parte presentation of facts , nor the maliciousness with which he pursued the objects of his dislike . But let that pass . What remains that is good ? , The noble edition of the ' Rig Veda ' and the authoritative ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most solid attainment in Sanskrit scholarship Apart from these , as editor-in-chief of . the ' Sacred Books of the Bait , ' he has been instrumental in furthering , to the best of his ability , the good cause of publishing translations of the most important Oriental records . His own work in the series was slighand the two volumes of Upanishads and one volume of Vedic Hymns , translated for it by him , are of ephemeral value . Nor do the slighter volumes of text-books which he prepared at intervals , call for special remark . They were the parerga of necessity , potboilers , such as no scholar loves but most must undertake . But while this list records the most valuable of Muller 's works in one field ( though even here one should not overlook his adjutancy in the publication of Pali books as well as of Sanskrit ) , that which has really ' given him his widest renown has as yet been scarcely referred to . And it is surely not a small matter that a scholar can win a hearing in two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be generally regarded as the concomitant of Sanskrit scholarship , it should be remembered that they have no more to do with each other than have Greek and folk-lore . The ' Science of Language , ' ' Chips from a German Workshop , ' and other related volumes represent the middle period of Muller 's career , and have perhaps had the widest influence They were not very correct , but they were very popular , and they lighted up a dark field and encouraged research As Muller advanced , he appears to have fallen a victim to the very factor in his mental furnishing which made his books so interesting to beginners , even an imaginative , fanciful way of looking at facts He seems to have regarded words as endowed with some mysterious potency , and thus was drawn to the peculiar - view which he upheld in. his mythological studies and later in his ' Science of Thought . ' Thought was bred of words , not words of thought . And so we got the showy but too airy structure called science of mythology , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of etymological mythology was already past The position taken by Muller on this subject was never renounced by him , and when , but a couple of years ago , he published his ' Contributions to the Science of Mythology , ' he reasserted his opinions with the obstinacy of desperation , for he saw clearly that In this regard the world had passed him by But toward the end of his life , amid much frivolous writing , such as his ' Auld Lang Syne , ' published in 1899 , wherein the man 's egotism comes unpleasantly to the fore , he returned for his last work to that special pursuit which , it would seem , he held particularly dear , and in which , with pardonable self-esteem , he evidently thought himself peculiarly fitted to direct opinion . This was pure philosophy Muller always pretended to speak of his other work as merely preparatory to the deeper studies of the relation of mind and matter , and in his translation of Kant 's ' Critique ' and his own various publications on religion and philosophy he doubtless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a European sense , an idealist ; and in the exposition of idealistic philosophy he believed that he was performing advanced work as well as gratifying his own tastes His very latest book , the ' Six Systems of Indian Philosophy , ' reveals not only his constant predilection for philosophical studies , but his inner sympathy with that great monastic system which proclaimed that all was one and that that one was God . Of Muller 's private life little need be said . Coming from Germany when but a young man , he settled in England , which he ever after made his home , living the quiet life of an Oxford scholar . The death of his daughter some years since was his first great blow , and one from which he never fully recovered , being affected by it physically and mentally . For a while , his morale was shattered , but , after a time , he bravely resumed the forsaken labors of his life . He was one who welcomed distinction and he received many honors In his death the world has lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but one whose labors have not been wasted . He made no great discovery , but he was an able scholar and did much that will endure . WAR AS A MEANS OF PEACE . If I were a millionaire , instead of giving more Bibles to all the schools , I would spend a few millions in distributing through What a Congressman would call " the homes of the land " copies of a little book by M Novikoff , which was sent to me from France a few years ago , called , ' Les Pr ' ? tendus Bienfaits de la Guerre . ' War is to this age of the ' world what the rescue of the Holy Sepulchre from the infidels , or the conversion of the heathen , was to the Christian of the Middle Ages . It is the crying evil of the time To the promotion of war even the clergy of our day are openly or secretly devoted . Many modern parsons are really as busily engaged in stirring up strife as was Friar Tuck , and just as ready , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves , and this in spite of the fact that they have seen civilization contending for two thousand years for existence against the spirit of war and conquest . Man 's fondness for killing his fellow has been so inveterate since the dawn of civilization that Christianity itself has been made an additional pretext for destroying life . In fact , ever since then , we find that man 's principal and noblest occupation has been the destruction of his fellows . Of course , he would not acknowledge that his object was simply destruction . At the outset only , as in the case of the Indians , did he admit that he meant simply to kill He very soon began to give reasons for this killing ; for instance , that the other fellow wanted to kill him , or did not hold the true faith , or was the possessor of something which the aggressor desired for himself One of the most desolating of African wars , at the beginning of this century , was caused by the gift to an African chief , by a British naval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As the chief wore it as a sort of breastplate , it excited the envy and hatred of neighboring potentates , who fought splendidly in order to secure it . But the worst wars in history have been caused by somebody 's failure to believe the right things about the next world . There has always been a body of persons , priests or ministers , who knew exactly what was going on in the next world , and egged on the warriors to kill the people who did n't believe them This caused what were called " religious wars . " To them succeeded wars about " the balance of power " What " the balance of power " meant was , that somebody else was getting too strong for our comfort . There are traces of the religious wars to-day The Philippine war is partly religious , we are told , and a good many bishops and parsons are promoting it because it gives a good chance of converting unbelievers . M. Novikoff discusses these various causes of war , and he shows that in a very large number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very foolish , did not exist Whether any particular faith or custom is good for humanity , we can not tell a priori We find out , for instance , whether wars are foolish , mainly by the result . M. Novikoff goes over the history of a good many of them , considering them , as their admirers say , as means of deciding disputes between nations . The vast majority do n't decide anything , stronger except which of the combatants is the or tile time be-ing The Spaniards spent 100 years trying to convert the Dutch , and failed . Louis XIV . trieiifor fifty years to make France the greatest military Power in Europe , and was forced to confess , on his death-bed , " qu'il await trop amid la guerre . " Spain tried to retain the hegemony of Europe and the possession of the American continent for 200 years , she now has no fleet , has not an inch of soil on the American continent , and has no army of which any one is afraid . England tried to retain the northern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under Louis Napoleon , tried to subjugate Germany , and was defeated with frightful loss . Russia tried to seize Constantinople , and was defeated . England tried to exclude her from the Black Sea , and found all her gains gone in ten years Austria tried to retain Italy , and lost it . America has been trying to annex the Philippines for two years , without success Most of these things have occurred in our own time I need not refer to Napoleon 's attempt to found a great European empire , and to the manner in which the attempt turned out . The most comic result of it all is , that we in America , who have seen all this , and who , we thought , had learned something from it , have taken up the business of fighting just as the foremost men of the older world have concluded that , as a means of deciding quarrels , war is a mistake . The principal use of Novikoff 's book is in showing the absurdity of war as a human occupation . He does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully as he might . As a general rule , no causes of war are ever discussed until passions are aroused and the war is on the point of breaking out These causes will be found mainly in the education of young people . The young man is taught that somebody is going to attack his country , and that his highest duty is to defend it His mind is familiarized from his school days with the idea that he will be called upon to fight in its defence . The feeling is consequently maintained that the natives of every other country are possibly enemies Lord Salisbury , for instance , who commits so many " blazing indiscretions , " astounded the English by warning them a few months ago that they ought to have targets for rifle-practice in their back yards , and must be constantly ready to repel foreign attempts to invade them . Chamberlain. , the new Radical apostle , hurled defiance to the four corners of the earth , and is strongly in favor of the embodiment of yeomanry In fact , nearly all the addresses at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of death on the battle-field as something that lies in every one 's path The fact that wars are diminishing in number is concealed as far as possible The fact that the increasing manufactures and commerce of the world indicate the devotion of a much larger proportion of time and attention than formerly to the arts of peace , is carefully ignored by political prophets and apostles . The condition of " our national defences " is referred to with dread . In fact , nothing is left undone to keep alive the medieval apprehension that a nation which is not constantly thinking of or preparing for war , is in danger at any moment of being attacked by somebody One of the most comic illustrations of our unwillingness to devote ourselves to the things that make for peace , was our choice of one who had been the captain of a manof-war as one of our representatives in the deliberations of the Peace Conference at The Hague , a year ago Peace is a thing which , even more than anything else , needs to be promoted by men who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , either naval or military , has been all his life wishing for war and finding reasons for making it To depute him to find reasons for being at peace with all mankind , is very like the Congressional device of referring a political measure to a hostile committee . Perhaps there could not have been found , in the army or navy , a better man to be our delegate than Capt . Mahan , but he was still a man whose fame and promotion depended on his mastery of the art of war . The result is , that in the articles he has since written on the subject of peacemaking , he generally treats it much as the French Deputy , on hearing that there were anarchists in his district , treated anarchy , through fear of losing anarchist votes : " My friends , " said he , " there is a great deal of good in anarchy ; only we must not abuse it " So , likewise , " a world-power " may have a little peace now and then , but it may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace , be guilty of base compliances , of forgiveness of injuries . It must set men like Roosevelt of New York , or Morgan of Alabama , to putting things right in the world by frequent bouts of slaughter . The fact is , what our modern education needs more than aught else is the duty of keeping before the eyes of children the value of peace , for nations as for men Preaching war at peace conferences is as ridiculous and needless as wearing swords at evening parties We have tried for centuries the plan of training our young men to be ready to kill each other ; why can we not try , during one generation , the plan of training young men to " do justice and love mercy " ?
