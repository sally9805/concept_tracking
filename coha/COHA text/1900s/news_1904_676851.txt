txt Eugene F. I Ware , Commissioner of Pensions , to-day tendered his resignation to the President to take effect Jan. 1 , 1905 . The resignation was accepted . It is rumored that James L. Davenport . First Deputy in the Pension Bureau , will be appointed Commissioner to serve until March 4 . Mr. Ware 's resignation has long been contemplated . He would have resigned months ago had it not been for the newspaper agitation on the subject . Mr. - Ware is a poet , as well as a lawyer , and his official life has not been a poet 's dream . He was appointed to succeed Henry Clay Evans , who was practically forced out of office by Grand Army complaints . The President sent for Mr. Ware and offered him the appointment . Ware was a Topeka ( Kan. ) lawyer , and said to the Presi-dent : " Mr. President . I do not want the office . " " Yes . " replied the President , " and the longer you have it the less you will want it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action in any way . except to say that the newspapers of the country had been " resigning " ' him for the Past two years . ; For at least one year , however , it has been definitely known that Mr. Ware would retire from his office soon after the Fall elections and return to his home in Kansas to resume his law practice . It is believed here that Commissioner Ware 's action was not due to any suggestion that the severance of his relations with the pension office would be agreeable to the President . On the contrary , it has been no secret that Commissioner Ware soon after assuming his duties found the duties of his office distasteful to him and that this distaste steadily increased . There is no intimation to-night as to who his successor will be . in discussing his resignation Mr. ' 1-Vare observed that the President-had told a greats truth . The Pension Commissioner got into several unpleasant discussions with members of Congress , and there was almost constant friction between him and the Secretary of the Interior , who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of official Washington by submitting a report that 100 good clerks could perform the work now being done in his bureau by 500 superannuated pet sons . and he again made enemies in the department by promoting clerks who had declined to take the month 's vacation allotted to them . He had a scheme for promoting clerks as a reward for merit that was not popular , and the Grand Army did n't like many of - his rulings . The most conspicuous event in his administration was the issuing of Order No. 7S , which gave pensions to all soldiers who had reached the age of sixty-five . DR .
