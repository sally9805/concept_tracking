txt Unreconciled to Ill-Smelling Water . In your edition of to-day the reply by " A Bacteriologist " to my complaint about the present condition of the Croton water Is needlessly vigorous , but not to the point and , in fact , misleading . A good drinking water should be clear , tasteless , and odorless . The mud does not by sedimentation aid in purifying the water , but it gets into your glass with the water and you have to swallow it , mud , water , and all . Algae living in fresh water may be harmless ; but the nauseating moldy taste and smell of the Croton water at present are due to the presence therein of a considerable portion of decayed matter , animal , vegetable , or both , and the statement that such is harmless is most surprising if it comes from a " bacteriologist , " who claims to know . Living algae are not the cause . Kindly permit me to add a suggestion : It will be a long time before our city will have a filtration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a comparatively small expense , install in every public school a water filter of adequate capacity and thus secure a supply of good drinking water , pure all the time , no matter whether Croton water happens to be good or not .
