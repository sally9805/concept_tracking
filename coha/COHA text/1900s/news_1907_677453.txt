txt Leonidas F. Livingston , Representative in Congress from the Fifth Georgia District , and Harvie Jordan , President of the Southern Cotton Growers ' Protective Association , submitted to the Post Office Department today a formal request for a fraud order against the New York Cotton Exchange . A statement , setting forth the alleged fraudulent practices of the concern and a number of exhibits tending to support the claims made therein , were filed with Postmaster General , Cortelyou , who took the ease under advisement . Mr. Livingston acted in behalf of the cotton growers of the South generally , and Mr. Jordan as a representative of the organization of which he is the head . The charges , which were accompanied by many supporting affidavits and include seven counts , start off with the statement that the New York Cotton Exchange has ceased to be a. commercial spot cotton market , and that the staple delivered on the contracts traded in can not be used for spinning purposes , and serves only to depress the price of spinnable grades in the South . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the statement is made that from Sept. 1 to Dec. 31 last only 10,046 bales of spot cotton were delivered to shippers from the New York Exchange out of a total of about 8,000,000 bales placed upon the markets of the country at other points . The , charges also point out the wide difference in the price of spot cotton and futures in the New York market on . Dec. 28 , a matter of 163 points , or $8.15 per bale , " clearly showing fraud , " and continues ; Out of the advertised stock of cotton at present stored In the warehouses of New York City , amounting to 114,000 bales , fully 70,000 bales of said cotton is of such inferior grades as to render the staple unfit for spinning or manufacturing purposes , and a considerable portion of said cotton has been held in said warehouses far years and is totally unfit for any purpose whatever except to be tendered on the fraudulent contracts of the ? New York Cotton Exchange , to the serious detriment and injury of the legitimate cotton trade of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Postmaster General of the United States , send a representative of your department to the warehouses of ' New York City and have all the cotton stored there Inspected and graded ; In order to officially determine the character of the unspisnable --  and unmarketable grades-of cotton stored in that market , to tender under the fraAltient contracts of the New York Cotton Exchange under the present ? practices of ' that Exchange . Your petitioners further state that they have no desire to jeopardize any legitimate transactions that are made through any of the dotton exchanges of this country . This is no ffght against the New York Cotton Exchange as an exchange to be used for the purpose . of safeguarding , protecting , and furthering the legitimate cotton business of the whole country , but the charges nere preferred and efforts made are directed solely against any and all debased and fraudulent contracts and transactions which are at present practiced by those who are in authority In making effective the present rules and methods of that exchange to the detriment and injury of the legitimate cotton trade of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a secret circular sent to members of the New York Exchange under date of Dec. 27 , by Atwood Violett , prominent member . This circutar is . In the nature of a protest against the pressent methods of the New York Exchange , and is held by Messrs . Livingston and Jordan to support their contentions . Accompanying the circular is a . letter from a Fall River manufacturer to Mr. Violett , in which the writer points out the unsatisfactory and unfair character of the system now in use . Mr. Jordan explained yesterday that he expected to find another point of attack . He is looking into the charter under which the Exchange operates to see if it is governed by the same laws as the Stock Exchange . " Stoek brokers in New York , " he said , " are compelled to have in their offices whatever shares of stock they buy or sell . If the Cotton Exchange operates under similar authority , its members would have to keep on hand the enormous amount of cotton in which they deal , instead of buying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illegitimately reducing the price of the South 's principal staple . " Mr. Livingston , when asked as to what would he accomplished by this move , said that whether or not a fraud order was issued by the Post Office Department he was sure there was fraud , and the fact now brought to light before the whole country was bound to have its effect . " The New York Cotton Exchange must revise its regulations " he said , and be conducted either as the Stock Exchanges or as the New Orleans Cotton Exchange , so . that when good middling is specified ' in , contracts and delivery : Ailed for , then if , good middling is not available , . at least syiinnable cotton must be delivered . " President Hubbard of the Cotton Exchange made public yesterday a letter ' sent to Postmaster General ** on Monday requesting official information of the charges . The letter said in part : May 1 request you to favor the New York Cotton Exchange with copies of any complaint made against it , in order that proper action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - unwarrantable attacks ? To this I would add that It is deplorable that such assaulupon ! assault ' upon the New York Cotton Exchange , a chartered institution of over thirty-five years ' standing . founded by merchants of the city , or that such implication as to the integrity of its members should be made under any pretext or for any purpose whatever . . - NeW York cotton men admit that the staple delivered on contracts here is of a low grade , but they explain that the same may bo said of any Cotton Exchange in the country . Ali or the higher grades of cotton , they say , are bought by dealers on . the ground , and fete of the selected bales ' find ' their way into the general market .
