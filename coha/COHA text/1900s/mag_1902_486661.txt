Notes . At last we have the long-desired Index to the ' Publishers ' Trade-List Annual , ' edited by A. H. Leypoldt and issued from the office of the Publishers ' Weekly . It is a fairly handsome octavo volume of 1,104 Pages , embracing in one alphabet the author 's name ; the first significant word of the book 's title ; and , where the latter includes a class designation ( Cookery , Dante , Garden , Lexicon , Poetry , Recollections ) , this for a , third set of rubrics , in bold-face letter . This arrangement will probably be found quite sufficient for working use of the Index . Each entry supplies price and publisher 's name , and generally requires but a single line . The promptitude of the appearance of this invaluable key to the current ' Trade-List Annual ' distinguishes it from the English Index to the corresponding ' Reference Catalogue to Current Literature ' Whether there will be a successor or an annual series will depend on the demand and the remuneration afforded .

The character of Mr. Lionel Strachey 's latest translation is sufficiently indicated in the long title , ' Memoirs of a Contemporary ; Being Reminiscences by Ida Saint-Elmo , Adventuress , of her Acquaintance with Certain Makers of French History , and of her Opinions concerning Them . From 1790 to 1815 ' The book is well made by Doubleday , Page &; Co , and fittingly illustrated by portraits from contemporary prints . Ida Saint-Elme was married at twelve , forsook her husband for Gen. Moreau , had a lifelong infatuation for Ney , which did not prevent a multitude of transitory relations with the great personages of the Napoleonic circle , from Bonaparte down . She followed the wars ? Italy , Austria , Russia , Waterloo  --  often in men 's costume . Her extraordinary story must probably be accepted with all reserves , as history .

C. McClurg &; Co ) , which first appeared in 1874 . Even at that date the texture of this idyll seemed a century old to any Anglo-Saxon mind , but for the occasional quotation from a contemporary English poet . But part of its charm lay in this , as Blanche Ostertag has felt in designing her full-page illustrations and embellishments . These are quaintly in keeping with the sentiment of the simple narrative , and will support , if they do not justify , this new and pretty edition . The general admiration for Bishop Whipple 's character and humanitarian work doubtless justifies a reprint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ( Macmillan ) This autobiography , undertaken against his own feeling on the urgency of some of his colleagues and many others , first appeared in 1899 . Lengthy as it is , the style is plain and curt , giving facts rather than comments , and the record " most unconventional and incomplete " ; yet the two chief traits of the man , decision and devotion , stand out on every page Incidentally , some wise sayings of older divines are cited , as when a man professed belief in the Apostles ' Creed , but was not sure he interpreted it exactly as his questioner did , and was answered : " The Church has not bidden you to accept Bishop Hobart 's interpretation " , and when a young preacher , thinking he might " well feel flattered that so great a crowd came to hear " his sermon , was told . " No , for twice as many would have come to see you hanged . " Prof J.

The contents of this volume are consequently very various , and , though they testify to the wide range of Professor Baldwin 's interests , it is not easy to discover any central topic or doctrine round which they naturally group them -- selves . Nor does the preface yield any light ; it contains only a notable suggestion ( which , however , is hardly borne out by anything that follows ) , that aesthetic appreciation of the universe is the final form of the philosophic impulse , and a dubious use of the term Naturalism , as equivalent to the study of Nature , which one would hardly have expected from the editor of a dictionary of philosophical terminology The articles themselves are reprinted with practically no alterations , and , as they are not infrequently polemical , the effect on the reader is somewhat disconcerting when he discovers , for instance , in the " postscript " to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the author criticised has since written an article which entirely removed the whole ground for controversy , and that all this happened eight years ago . On the whole , therefore , it may be said that , while Professor Baldwin and his pupils may no doubt find this volume a convenience and be glad to have his minor writings in an accessible form , it is best regarded as a sort of appendix to the more systematic writings which he is producing at no mean rate . ' Walter Crane , ' by Otto von Schleinitz , is the latest addition to the " Kunstler Monographien " ( Leipsic : Velhagen &; Klasing , New York : Lemcke &; Buechner ) . The book , like its fellows in this series , is fully illustrated , and its one hundred and forty illustrations give a very good idea of Mr. Crane 's various activities as industrial designer , sculptor , mural painter , and book illustrator Since he is generally known only in the latter capacity , the book is a real addition to our knowledge of his graceful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Famous Writers ' ( Dodd , Mead &; Co. ) is another of the compilations which Miss Esther Singleton has put forth under sm. ilar titles , and , , between its glittering covers , it has most of the faults of which such a compilation is capable . It reminds one of Dr Johnson 's leg of mutton , which was " as had as bad could be , ill fed , ill killed , ill kept , and ill drest . " The selections are poorly made , most of them being of the most gushing and frothy kind , and two of them not even dealing with the pictures which accompany them , those from foreign authors are badly translated and all are badly printed , errors typographical and other abounding , there are no references to the works from which the extracts are made , and only the vague indications " Paris " or " London " to show the whereabouts of the paintings discussed . There are , however , plenty of pretty pictures , and the book will serve its purpose , which is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little book which ought to awaken much interest among lovers of poetry is ' Marie Eugenie delle Grazie ale Dichterin and Denkerin , ' by Bernhard Munz ( Vienna : Braumuller ) This gifted woman published her first volume of poems when she was only seventeen years old  --  a volume which met with a very cordial reception , and which passed to a third edition ; she is still of such an age that much good work may yet be expected from her pen Moriz Benedict , writing on the subject of the drama in the Deutsche Revue , speaks of her Schlagende Wetter ' as a work of Shaksperean penetration and mastery , and considers that so deep an insight into the nature of the tragic , and so vivid a presentation . of - it , is not too often to be found in the literature of the world . belle Grazie is a-leader in the school of the " ganz modern " in Germany , in Weltanschauung as well as in poetry , at the same time grace and charm are the marked characteristics of all that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

The whole number of volumes is nearly 100,000 , of which 6,819 were added during the year . An indication of the prevailing trend of thought at the present time is to be found in the fact that the growth of the collection of books on Social and Political Science was greater than that of any other subject .

Though the United States has gained more rapidly , for some years past , the prosperity of Great Britain is real and is well attested by the most substantial proofs , such as the growth of the income-tax assessment , the Clearing-house reports , the paid-up capital of stock companies , the tonnage of shipping , the volume of business done in cotton , coal , and iron , the deposits of savings-banks , the capital of cooperative societies , the funds of trades-unions , etc .

" In the " Point of View " we have some very pertinent suggestions as to the danger which lurks in the growing habit of depending upon the gifts of men of great wealth for our city parks , fountains , libraries , and similar conveniences A town or city may become a chronic beggar , just as an individual , and the moral deterioration which we admit to be the result of beggary in the unit , we must expect to find under similar conditions in the mass . ? Prof. Ira N. Hollis , in the Atlantic , effectively clears away some of the fog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intercollegiate athletics . It does not stand to reason , he says , that a student participating in these sports can do as much work as one who devotes his whole time to study . The six weeks of the football season are practically thrown away , so far as classroom work is concerned The members of the team may be obliged to attend lectures , but their minds are upon the signals and plays of the coming games . In answer to the question whether the athletes gain anything that compensates for this loss of time , Professor Hollis can only say that many do . He asserts roundly that winning is put above everything else at present , but hopes that this may prove a temporary evil , and that the games may finally be made to build up character , and teach patience , grit , and courage . Under present rules , he expresses serious doubt whether football ought to have any place on college grounds . He recognizes the tendency of intercollegiate games to confine athletic sport to the few , and considers it difficult to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to outdoor sports . There can be no healthful condition without more competition in each individual college . Edward Atkinson contributes a vigorous defence of " commercialism , " as against militarism , and denounces rather vigorously the assaults of the pulpit and the press upon the former The reader may question , however , whether he is not fighting men of straw , It is not commerce itself that isdenounced . No one of any consequence denies that the world 's needs must be supplied in this way , or criticises the man whom he supposes to be trying honestly to supply these needs , and to reap a legitimate profit in the process . It is the greed which is unwilling to be bound down to honorable methods , which will create artificial means of extorting enormous profits , which sinks every other consideration in favor of the one desire for gain , that meets with denunciation . As this is not the commercialism which Mr. Atkinson defines and upholds , the issue does not seem to have been fairly joined . Harriet Waters Preston studies from an interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George Meredith , ' One of Our Conquerors , ' ' Lord Ormont and his Aminta , ' and ' The Amazing Marriage .

The great ' Thesaurus Lingua : Latinm ' is making progress , though but slowly . Four parts of the first and three of the second volume have now reached this country , where each fascicle is received by the Latin scholar with the welcome that his English brother accords to a fresh section of the Oxford Dictionary . We wonder how many are profiting by the opportunity to secure this work at a comparatively slight expenditure while it is coming out in parts . The merest glance over one of them is enough to suggest how indispensable the whole will be , but a brief comparison between the fourth fascicle of the first volume ( adiunctor to Aegeus ) and the corresponding portion of the best Latin-English lexicon now in use will set the point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mere cross-references ) in this part of Lewis and Short 's work ; in the Thesaurus there are about 450 ( allowing for a few differences of arrangement ) . Of the two hundred additional lemmata in the latter , over a hundred are proper nouns , about thirty are drawn from the glossographers alone , and the remaining sixty or so come chiefly from such writers as Diomede , Firmicus , St. Jerome , Irenmus , Fulgentius , Cassiodorus , Boethius , and others of similar periods and character . We have observed only four newly booked words which are drawn from the authors more familiar to the classical student . These are ado/escere ( from adolere ) occurring in the Georgics , in a passage cited in our Lexicon under the other adolescere ; adnarrare , from Statius ; adunco , from Paulus 's epitome of Festus ; and the doubtful adversabzlas , used perhaps by Accius . ? But if anybody thinks that the gains are to be only or mainly in the field of late Latin , let him examine the treatment of some familiar word and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be . Take , for instance , ( bodes ; in the Lexicon the treatment of it occupies eighty-two lines ; in the Thesaurus , 724 lines . In the former its usage is illustrated quite insufficiently and from only fifteen authors . It is true that these are well chosen , but even such writers as Lucretius , Ovid , Tacitus , Martial , and the younger Pliny do not figure among them . In the Thesaurus the state of things is very different ; it is not easy to think of an author who is not cited , from the first occurrence of the word in Livius Andronicus down to the latest times . The article begins with the usual brief etymological note , by Thalheim , in which he adopts the view of Georg Curtius ( not ap= proved by our Lexicon ) that cedes originally meant ' hearth . ' A rich collection of passages follows , illustrating the usage of the two forms of the nominative singular aedea or aedis , and the nominative plural ( teas , with a warning against the confusion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then comes the main body of the article , divided into two chief parts . The first illustrates the meaning ' house , ' ' room . ' For the singular number in either sense only Curtiss , Ammianus , and Paulus can be cited , the Plautine passage in our Lexicon being now taken as a nominative plural . Many examples are given of the plural in this sense , but there is no subhead to indicate that it may mean ' houses ' as well as ' house , ' though this may be gathered after considerable groping through solid lines of all too similar type . It is strange that Vitruvius 6 , 5 , 2 , is not cited , for this is the only passage in which that author , who is extremely careful in distinguishing templum and cedes , employs the latter , either as singular or plural , of any but a sacred building , except in the phrase case aedlum . The first part of the article closes with the citation of a few passages from poetry in which the word is used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dwellings of the dead . The second part , on cedes denoting a ' sacred building , ' opens with an excellent note of some forty lines on the topic , with an explanation of the difference between aedes and templum , and remarks on the adjectives which are used with cedes in this sense . Both here and throughout the whole article , useful references are given to modern books , including even Wissowa 's recent work on the Roman religion . This last reference shows how truly up to date the Thesaurus is . ? The English-German part of Schroer 's Grieb 's Dictionary ( H. Frowde ) has already been noticed by us The German-English volume is now to hand . Its arrangement is on the ordinary German method , but the umlaut is not allowed to disturb the alphabetic vowel order . Pretence to " completeness " is expressly disavowed , and a reasonable fulness and freshness alone aimed at . In orthography , silent le in tli is ignored , in accordance with recent changes towards simplification ( as , Rat for Rath , Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have been useful to couple the old form with the new for the sake of foreigners reading in the old orthography . On the subject of phonetics , the editor envies the English their standard pronunciation , through the gradual supersession by London of provincial and dialectal peculiarities . Berlin , he declares , is now approaching the same domination , but its authority will long be disputed . Some hope of a provincial propaganda he sees in the movement to erect a uniform stage standard of pronunciation . Amid the prevailing differences , the pronunciation is generally left unmarked in this work , reference being made to an exposition of values in the preface . In the case of interlopers like Interview , indication becomes necessary . Here , as also with mterviewen and Interviewer , the English pronunciation has been adopted ; whereas with Tramway the so sound is replaced by V. Both this substantive and Tram form their plural in 8 : and compounds , Tramhahn , Tramwagen , have been readily formed .

The same poverty of development is observable in Fernschrcsber as compared with Telegraph . We have Fernsehrcft only , and again no fernschresben . This dictionary is a very desirable addition to the resources of English-speaking students . THE MASTER-PAINTER OF HAARLEM . Frans Eels . By Gerard S Davies , M A. , of Charterhouse . London : George Bell &; Sons , New York : Macmillan . 1902 . Messrs George Bell &; Sons seem to have almost a monopoly of the publication of serious works , in English , on the fine arts , and it is therefore quite natural that from their house should come the latest important book , and , so far as we know , the only such in our language , on Frans Hals To mention material things first , the volume measures about 11 by 81a inches and contains 157 pages , besides 18 pages of preliminaries , and 55 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others well-executed half-tones . The half-tone plates , like the photogravures , are inserted , there being no text illustrations , and the heavily glazed paper necessary for their proper effect is confined strictly to this purpose , the text being handsomely printed by the Chiswick Press , on good stout paper with a slight rib Besides a table of contents and a list of illustrations , there are an " approximate chronology of the chief known events of the life of Frans Hals , " an " approximate chronological list of the most important pictures " of the artist , a bibliography , a list of works arranged according to the galleries in which they are hung , a list of pictures attributed to Hals which have appeared at the Burlington House exhibitions since 1871. a list of prices obtained at various sales in the last century and a half , and an index These various lists and tables can hardly be without some errors and omissions ( the two good pictures in the Metropolitan Museum , for instance , are not noticed ) , but they have evidently been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the book is well and simply bound in dull green buckram with vellum back , and lies fiat when opened . In almost all particulars it is a model of how to do it After all this it may seem like saying a good deal to affirm that the text proper is as good as everything else , but it is not saying too much Clear , careful , thoughtful , critical , and sound , intelligent in method , cautious in conjecture , incredulous of legend ; hearty in admiration of its hero 's qualities , yet clearly conscious of his limitations ; above all , devoid of padding and of " eloquence " ? this is as nearly exemplary writing on art as one- often sees . The judicious reader will find himself almost always in accord with Mr. Davies 's conclusions , and , if he is obliged to differ with him , will do so with great caution and with profound respect . If we limit the meaning of the word strictly enough , there - can be no doubt that Frans Hals of Haarlem was one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accuracy of vision and brilliancy of execution , he has had no superior , and perhaps no equal but Velazquez ; yet his fame is singularly modern . He seems to have had a pretty high local reputation at one period of his career , but he died a pauper and was rapidly forgotten . In 1786 one of his pictures sold for five shillings , and , as late as 1852 , the life-size , full-length portrait of himself and his wife , now in the Rijks Museum at Amsterdam , fetched no more than ? 50 . Thirteen years afterward , " The Laughing Cavalier " was sold for ? 2,040 , and in this present year a " Portrait of a Gentleman " has reached the sum of 23,780 . What one of the great Doclen pictures , which in the eighteenth century were rolled up and stored in garret and cellar , would be worth to-day , if it came upon the market , it is difficult to guess Of course it was the painters who rediscovered Hals . Reynolds seems to have owned one of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it in words that might have been written yesterday About the middle of the nineteenth century Hals became a living influence among the painters , and upon his art and that of Velazquez the schools of Monet and Whistler , with their divers issues , were largely based . Then came Fromentin 's " lVfaitres d'Autrefois , " and another painter , in some pages of brilliant writing , revealed to the world what his fellows already knew . The long eclipse of a reputation was over , and the name of Frans Hals shone forth with a glory which is not likely again to be dimmed . To-day it is more necessary to distinguish than to praise , more important to show what the painter of Haarlem was not , than to demonstrate what he was , more difficult to guard against the possible evils of an overwhelming influence than to recognize the good it has accomplished . Unfortunately for us , during the long neglect of Hals and his works , most of the facts of his life and a great part of his production were allowed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his pictures , some of which have been Partially filled of late years , but which still remain puzzling in the extreme . His astonishing technical facility shows that his work was produced with great rapidity , while this same facility could have been maintained only by constant practice . There should be scores of canvases , big and little , for every year of his working life , yet there is more than one period of five or six years to which no known work can with probability be assigned . Above all , there is nothing known to exist that can with propriety be called an early work . He is now supposed , on slender enough evidence , to have been born in 1580 , though the date long accepted , on no discoverable evidence at all , is 1584 . He was therefore either twenty-nine or thirty-three years old when his earliest known picture was painted , in 1613 , and three years older when the next extant work was produced , the first of the great series of Doclen pictures at Haarlem . That he should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was already a master of considerable local reputation ; the picture itself shows even more clearly that Mastery had been attained . He is to do better work , but technical difficulties have already ceased to exist for him , and he can draw and paint anything he chooses . How did he learn ? Who was his first master ? What sort of partial successes and full successes put him in a position to be chosen for important work ? We can only guess . Mr. Davies 's conjecture that , during his young days in Antwerp , where he was born , Hals is likely to have studied with Rubens 's master , Van Noort , seems plausible enough ; but we know so little of Van Noort that , even if accepted , the conjecture does not greatly help us . It is put forth tentatively , and it is to be hoped that it will not , with the curious facility of such conjectures , get itself taken for fact by the next writer on the subject . Whoever was his first teacher , Hals must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty and thirty , and it is a pity that some of it has not survived for the edification of the student of to-day , who is inclined to begin where the master left off . We have the early paintings of Velazquez , and know through what hard , precise , " tight " work he trained the eye and hand that are later so surprising in their sureness and facility . Mastery has never been otherwise attained , and it is a safe prediction that if any of the work of Hals during this first decade shall be recovered and identified , it will be found admirable , no doubt , but otherwise admirable than the things we know . The work that Frans Hals did between his thirty-fifth and fifty-fifth years  --  the period of full maturity ? is pretty well known to us . A good deal of it must , indeed , have disappeared , but what is left is so all of a piece  --  the development is so normal and regular and the visible change so slight  --  that it is not probable that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our conception of the painter . Such as he was at the beginning of this period , he was at the end of it There is to be noted only a gradual increase of power , a slight broadening of vision , a growing looseness and lightness of touch . One of the notable things about this output is its limitation of subject . Mr. Davies gives a curious list of the things Hals did not Paint ; what it comes to is just this : he painted nothing but portraits . He only occasionally introduced a landscape background , and then in a thoroughly conventional and perfunctory manner . He never painted a horse and hardly ever a dog . He painted no " subject pictures . " We can think of no other painter in the whole history of art whose effort was so strictly liniited in its direction , and this narrowness grew upon him and is even more marked after 1640 than before that date . In his later , years his figures rarely have any visible surroundings of any sort In artistic qualities , also , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had only a rudimentary sense of composition : light and shade is , for the most part , interesting to him only as a means of drawing . His color is sometimes pleasing and surprisingly well harmonized , considering the particolored costumes he painted and the directness of his method , but he was hardly a colorist . His growing tendency to the use of black shadows in flesh would , alone , show an indifference to color . He was a painter of likenesses  --  a portraitist , pure and simple .
