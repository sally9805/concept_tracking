HAMILTON and Jefferson , Clay and Jackson , Douglas and Lincoln , ? these have been the three great rivalries of American politics . The third was not the least . If it fell short of the others in variety of confrontments ; if it was not so long drawn out , or accompanied with so frequent and imposing alignments and realignments of vast contending forces sit a broad and national field , it surpassed them in the clearness of the sole and vital issue it involved , in a closer contact and measuring of powers , in the complete and subtle correspondence of the characters of the rivals to the causes for which they fought . In March , 1834 , Stephen Arnold Douglas , an unknown youth from Vermont , poor , delicate , almost diminutive in physical stature , and not yet of age , was admitted to the bar of Illinois , and opened an office at Jacksonville , in the county of Morgan . From that day he rose faster than any other man in the state , if not in the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which many and many a young American was straggling toward eminence , and notwithstanding that Illinois was full , as later years were to prove , of young men exceptionally fit for such careers as lie was seeking . Within a month he bad got the leadership of the Democrats of his neighborhood and county . At twenty-one he was public prosecutor , or district attorney , of the judicial district , ? an office which at twenty-three he resigned in or . der to enter the legislature . At twenty . four he was register of public lands at Springfield . At twenty-five he was his party 's candidate for Congress in a Whig district , the largest in the country , and was beaten by five votes in a total poll of more than 36,000 . At twenty-seven , after serving a few weeks as secretary of state , lie was appointed a justice of the Supreme Court of Illinois . At thirty he was in the lower house of Congress , At thirty-three he took the seat in the Senate which he held until he cried . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 , when lie was nominated , his name was presented to every Democratic National Convention as a candidate for the presidency . When he was elected to the Illinois legislature , Abraham Lincoln , a Whig representative from Sangamon County . was already well known for his ungainly length of body , for his habit of reasoning in parables which were now Scriptural and now vulgar to the point of obscenity , and for a quaint and rare Lincoln 's honesty . He was four years older than the new member from Morgan , and nearly two feet taller . Douglas , many years later , declared that he was drawn to Lincoln by a strong sympathy , for they were both young men making an uphill struggle in life . Lincoln , at his first sight of Douglas , during his canvass for the attorneyship , pronounced him the least man he ever saw . " When Douglas , as register of public lands , scent to live at Springfield , which was just become the capital , be found Shields , McDlernand , Lincoln , and other rising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lincoln knew earls other well , for they lived together sev-eral years in an atmosphere of intimate personal scrutiny . For searching study of one 's fellows , for utter disregard of all superficial criteria of character and conventional standards of conduct , there is but one sort of life to be compared with tine life of a Southern or Western town , and that is the life of students in a boarding school or a small college . In sorb communities there is little division into classes , as of rich and poor , edu-cated and illiterate , well and obscurely born . On the steps of the courthouse , in the post office while the daily mail is sorted , ins the corner drug store on Sun-days , in lawyers ' offices , on the curb-stone , ? wherever a group of men is as there is the freest talk on every conceivable subject ; and the lives of men are opens to their fellows as they can not be in cities by reason of the mass , or in country districts by reasons of the solitude , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the presumption , which every New England man who goes southward or westward has to live down , that he would in some measure hold himself aloof from his fellows ; but the prejudice was quick-ly dispelled . No man entered more readily into close personal relations with whomsoever he encountered . In all our accounts of him he is represented as sun. - 227 rounded with intimates . Not without the power of impressing men with his dignity and seriousness of purpose , we nevertheless hear of hiw sitting 011 the knee of an eminent judge during it recess of the court ; dancing from end to end of a dinner table with the volatile Shields , ? the same who won laurels in the Mexicans War , a seat its the United States Sensate , and the closest approach anybody ever won to victory in battle over Stonewall Jackson ; and engaging , despite his height of scarce five feet and his weight of a hundred pounds , in personal encounters with Stuart , Lincoln 's athletic law partner , and it corpulent attorney named Francis . On equal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncommonly resourceful men , and he passed them all in the race for advancement . Buoyant , good-natured , never easily abashed , his maturity and sanoir7faire were accentuated by the smallness of his stature . His blue eyes and dark , abundant hair heightened the physical charm of boyishness ; his virile movements , his face , heavy - browed , round , and strong , his firm , rich voice , and his well-formed , extraordinarily large head gave him an aspect of intellectual power . He had a truly Napoleonic trick of attaching linen to his fortunes . He was a born leader , beyond question ; and he himself does not seem ever to have doubted his fitness to lead , or ever to have agonized over the choice of a path and the responsibilities of leadership . There is some reason to believe that Lincoln , strange as it seems , was successful as his rival in a love affair , but otherwise he left Lincoln far behind . Twenty years later , in 1858 , when he went back to Illinois to take the stump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was by far the most conspicuous figure in American public life . He had been for some years tine most active and the most brilliant man in Congress , and he was the leader of his 228 Lincoln 's Rival . party as Clay had been the leader of the Whigs . He had given it a policy on the uppermost question of the day , ? the question of slavery in the territories . The Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854 , which threw open to slavery the vast region consecrated to freedom by the Compromise of 1820 , was entirely his work . He had written it of his own motion , by himself , in his own house , and , as he truly declared , he had passed it himself . " I had , " he said afterwards , " the authority and power of a dictator through . out the controversy in both houses . " The famous measure had altered the whole face of American politics . The Democrats had adopted the principle of it ? the principle which Douglas called " popular sovereignty , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their platform of 1856 . It made the South so solidly Democratic that for a time all semblance of opposition disappeared in that quarter . In the North it summoned the Republican party into life . From motives of expediency the Democrats chose Buchanan , and not Douglas , to be their candidate in 1856 ; but he was no sooner in office than , in his subserviency to the Southerners , he took a course with Kansas in which Douglas would not follow him . The administration tried to force upon the Kansans the pro-slavery Lecompton Constitution , and Douglas , with a handful of followers in Congress , joined the Republicans , and defeated the daring last attempt to bring Kansas into the Union as a slave state , contrary to the will of the great majority of her people . He went home a victor in that stirring parliamentary contest , and Chicago , which in 1854 had hooted and hissed and stoned him into silence when he tried to defend the Kansas-Nebraska Act , now welcomed him uproariously . The whole North , in fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burnt him in effigy , was now beginning to praise him . Horace Greeley andother important persons were even seg. gesting that he might after all prove to be the very man to lead the new party to victory on a more moderate platform . But there awaited him in Illinois treason in the ranks of his own party , ? for the administration , beaten in Congress , attacked him at home , ? and au opposi . Lion now completely formed and led by the man whom Douglas himself in his own heart dreaded as he had never dreaded the ablest of his rivals at Washington . The Republicans had taken the unusual course of holding a convention to nominate their candidate for the Senate , and the candidate was Lincoln . Douglas was the very type of that instant success which waits on ability undistracted by doubt and undeterred by the fear of doing wrong , ? the best exemplar of that American statesmanship which accepts things as they are and snakes the most of them . Facile , keen , effective , he had found life a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marvelously active in manhood , he had learned without study , resolved without meditation , accomplished without toil . Whatever obstacles he had found in his path , he had either adroitly avoided them or boldly overleaped them , but never laboriously uprooted them . Whatever subject he had taken in hand , he hurl swiftly compassed it , but rarely probed to the heart of it . With books he dealt as he dealt with men , getting from them quickly what he liked or needed ; he was as unlikely to pore over a volume , and dog-ear and annotate it , as he was with car . respondence and slow talk and silences to draw out a friendship . Yet he was not cold or mean , but capable of hero worship , following with ardor the careers of great conquerors like Cesar and Napoleon , and capable , too , of loyalty to party and to men . He had great personal magnetism young men , especially , he charmed and held as no other public man could , now Clay was dead . deleted material than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then Lincoln 's unexpected survival of the early meetings drew the eyes of the whole country upon these two foremost Americans of their generation , face to face there on the Western prairie , fighting out the great question of the times . Elevated side by side on wooden platforms in the open air , thrown into relief against the low prairie skyline , the two figures take strong hold upon the imagination : the one lean , long-limbed , uncommonly tall ; the other scarce five feet high , bat compact , manful , instinct with energy , and topped with its massive head . In voice and gesture and manner Douglas was incomparably the superior ; as he was , too , in the ready command of a language never , indeed , ornate or imaginative , and sometimes of the quality of political commonplace , but always forcible and always intelligible to his audience . Lincoln had the sense of words , the imagination , the intensity of feeling , which go to the making of great literature ; but for his masterpieces he always needed time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his manner painful , save in the recital of those passages which he had carefully prepared or when he was freed of his self-consciousness by anger or enthusiasm . Neither of them , in any single speech , could be compared to Webster in the other of the two most famous American debates , but the series was a remarkable exhibition of forensic power . The interest grew as the struggle lengthened . People traveled great distances to hear them . At every meeting place , a multitude of farmers and dwellers in country towns , with here and there a sprinkling of city folk , crowded about the stand where " Old Abe " and the " Little Giant " turned and twisted and fenced for an opening , grappled and drew apart , clinched and strained and staggered ; but neither fell . The wonder grew that Lincoln stood up so well under the onslaughts of Douglas , at once skillful and reckless , held him off with so firm a hand , gripped him so shrewdly . Nonv the wonder is that Douglas , wrestling with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet and held his own . He was lighting , too , with an enemy in the rear when he turned to strike at the administration , Lincoln would cell out " Go it , husband ! Go it , bear : Apart from that diversion , however , the debate , long and involves ! as it was , fob lowed but three general lines . The whole is resolvable into three elements , ? per . sonalities , politics , and principles . There were the attacks which each made upon the other 's record , the efforts which each made to weaken the other 's position he . fore the people , and the contrary views which were advanced . Douglas began , indeed , with gracious compliments to his opponent , calling him " au amiable , kindly , and intelligent gentleman . " Lincoln , unused to praise from such a source , protested he was like the Hoosier with the gingerbread : " He reckoned he liked it better than any other man , and got less of it . " But in a me-scent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democrat , had made a coalition in 1854 to form the Black Republican party and get for themselves the two senatorships from Illinois , and that Trumbull had broken faith with Lincoln . Lincoln in turn made a charge that Douglas had conspired with Presidents Pierce and Buchanan and Chief Justice Taney to spread slavery and make it universal . The Kansas - Nebraska Act was their first step , the Dyed Scott decision the second ; but one more step , and slavery could be fastened upon states as they had already fastened it upon territories . Douglas protesting that to bring such a charge , incapable of proof or disproof , was indecent , Lincoln pointed out that Douglas had similarly taxed the administration with conspiring to force a slave constitution upon Kansas ; and afterwards took up a charge // of Trumbull 's , that Douglas himself had let lirst conspired with Toombs and other Senators to prevent any referenee to the people of whatsoever constitution the Kansas convention might adopt . When they moved southward , Douglas charged Lincoln with inconsistency in that he changed his stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these charges and countercharges , however , noire was absolutely proved , and no one now believes those which Douglas brought ; but he made them serve . And Lincoln 's , though he sustained them with far better evidence , and pressed thorn home with as wonderful clearness of reataming , ? once he actually threw his argument into a syllogism , ? did no great baron to Douglas . It was Douglas , too , who began the sparring for a political advantage . He knew that Lincoln 's following Was heterogeneous . " Their principles , " he jeered , " in the north are jet-black , in the centre they are in color a decent mulatto , and in lower Egypt they are almost white . " His aim , therefore , was to fix upon Lincoln such extreme views as would alarm the more moderate of his followers , since the extremists mast take hint , perforce , as a choice of two evils , even though he fell far short of their radical standard . To this end , Douglas produced certain resolutions which purported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1854 , and would have held Lincoln responsible for them . In a series of questions , he asked if Lincoln were still opposed to a fugitive slave law , to the admission of any more slave states , and to acquiring any more territory unless the Wilmot Proviso were applied to it , and if he were still for prohibiting slavery outright in all the territories and in the District of Columbia , and for prohibiting the interstate slave trade . It soon transpired that Lincoln was not present at the Springfield convention , and that the resolutions were not adopted there , but somewhere else , and Douglas had to defend himself against a eharge of misrepresentation . Nevertheless , when they met the second time at Freeport , Lincoln answered the questions . He admitted the right of the South to as fugitive slave law . He would favor abolition in the District only if it were gradual , compensated , rued accomplished with the consent of the inhabitants . He seas not sure of the right of Congress to prohibit the interstate slave trade . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would tend to aggravate the slavery controversy . He could see no way to deny the people of a territory , if slavery mere prohibited among them during their territorial life , and they nevertheless asked to come into the Union as a slave state . These mild and cautious answer 's displeased the stalwart anti-slavery men . Lincoln would go their lengths in but one particular : he was for prohibiting slavery outright in all the territories . Then he brought forward some questions for Douglas to answer . Would Douglas vote to admit Kansas , with less than 93,000 inhabitants , if she presented a free-state constitution ? Would he vote to acquire fresh territory without regard to its effect on the slavery dispute ? If the Supreme Court should decide against the right of a state to prohibit slavery , would he acquiesce ? " Cale the people of a United States territory , in any lawful way , against the wish of any citizen of the United States , exclude slavery from its limits prior to the forma-time of a state constitution ? " Douglas had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fourth ? the secured , as Lincoln read them ? he had in fact answered several times already , and in a way to please the Democrats of Illinois . But Lincoln , contrary to the advice of his friends , pressed it on him again , with a view to the " all hail hereafter ; " for it was meant to bring out the inconsistency of the prin deleted material Lincoln 's backward into the past , and Lincoln to come nearer and grow larger as he proclaims : " That is the real issue . That is the issue which will continue in this country when these poor tongues of Judge Douglas and myself shall be silent . It is the eternal struggle between these two principles , right and wrong , throughout the world . " Nevertheless , Douglas won the senatorship and kept his hold on the Northern Democrats . Immediately be paid a visit to the South . He got a hearing there , and so made good his boast that he could proclaim his principles anywhere in the Union ; but when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , controlled by Buchanan and the Southerners , had deposed him from the chairmanship of the Commit . tee en Territories , which he had held so many years , and from this time he was constantly engaged with the enemies he had made by his course on Lecompton and by his Freeport Doctrine . His Northern opponents were no longer in his way . He had overmatched Sumner and Seward in the Senate and beaten the administration , and held his own with Lincoln ; but the unbending and relentless Southerners he could neither beat nor placate . It was men like Jefferson Davis in the Senate , and Yancey at Southern barbecues and conventions , who stood now between him and his ambition . That very slave power which he had served so well was upreared to crush him because he had come to the limit of his subserviency . His plan of squatter sovereignty had not got the Southerners Kansas or any other slave state to balance California and Minnesota and Oregon . They demanded of Congress positive protection for slavery in the territories . The most significant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side and a group of Southern Senators , led by Jefferson Davis , on the other . He stood up against them manfully , and told them frankly that not // a single Northern state would vote for any candidate on their platform , and they as flatly informed him that he could not carry a single Southern state on his . He was too good a politician to yield , even if there had been no other reason to stand firm , but continued to defend the only doctrine on which there was the slightest chance of beating the Republicans in the approaching election . One method he took to defend it was novel , but he has had many imitators among public men of later years . He wrote out his argument for Harper 's , the most popular magazine of the day . The article is not nearly so good reading as his speeches , but it was widely read . Judge Black , the Attorney-General of Buchanan 's Cabinet , made a reply to it , and Douglas rejoined ; but little of value seas added to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Southerners , however , would not take warning . As they saw their long ascendency in the government coining to an end , their demands rose higher . Some of them actually began to agitate for a revival of the African slave trade : and this , also , Douglas had to oppose . His following in the Senate was now reduced to two or three , and one of these , Broderick , of California , a brave and steadfast man , was first defeated by the Southern interest , and then slain in a duel . John Brown 's invasion of Virginia somewhat offset the aggressions of the South ; but that , too , might have gone for a warning . The elections in the autumn of 1859 were enough to show that the North was no longer disposed to forbearance with slavery . Douglas went as far as any man in reason could go in denouncing John Brown , and those who seers thought to have set him on ; and he supported a new plan for getting Cuba . But Davis , on the very eve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Senate a series of resolutions setting forth the extreme demand of the South concerning the territories . He was as 234 Lincoln 's Rival . bitter toward Douglas as he was toward the Republicans . At Charleston , Yancey took the same tone with the convention . Practically the whole mass of the Northern Democrats were for Douglas now , and the mass of Southern Democrats were against him . The party was divided , as the whole country was , by a line that ran from cast to west . Yet it was felt that nothing but the success of that party would avert the danger of disunion ; and the best judges were of opinion that it could not succeed with any other candidate than Douglas or any other platform than popular sovereignty . His managers at Charleston offered the Cincinnati platform of 1856 , with the addition of a demand for Cuba and an indorsement of the Dred Scott decision and of any future decisions of the Supreme Court on slavery in the territories . But the Southerners would not yield a hair 's breadth . Yancey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they slid not dare to tell the North that slavery was right . In that strange way the question of right and wrong was forced again upon the man who strove to ignore it . Senator Pugh , of Ohio , spokesman for Douglas , answered the fire eaters . " Gentlemen of the South , " be cried , " you mistake us ! You mistake us ! We will not do it ! " The Douglas platform was adopted , and the men of the cotton states withdrew . On ballot after ballot , a majority of those who remained and a majority of the whole convention stood firm for Douglas ; but it was decided that two thirds of the whole convention were required to nominate . Men who had followed his fortunes until his ambition was become their hope in life , wearied out with the long deferment , broke down and wept . Finally , it was voted to adjourn to Baltimore . In the interval Davis and Douglas fell once more into their bitter controversy in the Senate . At Baltimore a new set of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but they were no sonnet admitted than another group withdrew , and even Cushing , the chairman , lett his seat and followed them . Douglas telegraphed his friends to sacrifice Inns if it were necessary to save his platform ; bat the rump convention adopted the platform and nominated him . The two groups of seceders united upon the Yancey platform , and Breckinridge , of Kentucky , for a candidate . A new party of sincere but unpractical Union - Savers took the field , with John Bell , an old Whig , for a candidate , and a platform of patriotic platitudes . The Republicans , guided in ways they themselves did not understand , had put aside Seward , and taken Lincoln to be their leader . The rivals were again confronted , but on cruelly unequal terms . From the first , it was clear that nearly the whole North was going Republican , and that the cotton states were for Breckinridge or disunion . Whatever chance Douglas had in the horsier states and in the Democratic states of the North was destroyed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head of the true party of Jefferson ; he felt that the old Union would not stand if he were beaten . He was the leader of a forlorn hope , but he led it superbly well . He undertook a canvass of the country the like of which no candidate had ever made before . At the very outset of it he was called upon to show his colors in the greater strife that was to follow . At Norfolk , in Virginia , it was demanded of him to say whether the doctrine of a Black Republican President would justify the Southern states in seceding . He answered , no . Pennsylvania was again the pivotal state , and at an election in October the Republicans carried it over all their opponents combined . Douglas was in Iowa when he heard the news . He said calmly to his companions : " Lincoln is the next President . I have no hope and no destiny before me but to do my best to save deleted material 236 The Fame of Victor Hugo . were the last he ever spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the trymen , for at once lie was stricken down first . with a swift and mortal illness , and hur But first he never could have been ried to his end .

He roused him His place is secure among the ventureself , and said , " Tell them to obey the some , strong , self-reliant men who in laws and support the Constitution of the various ages and countries have for a United States . " He died on June 11 , time hastened , or stayed , or diverted from 1861 , in the forty-ninth year of his age . its natural channel the great stream of It was a hard time to die . War was affairs .
