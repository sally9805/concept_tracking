txt Benjamin E. Valentine , the Brooklyn lawyer charged with uttering a forged deed , was convicted yesterday by the jury that had been sitting for a week at Mineola . The jury was out an hour and a half . Valentine , cool and unemotional as he has been , quailed before the steady eyes of the jurors while the foreman delivered the verdict . He stood for a moment and then sank into his chair while his counsel began making the customary motions . Justice Rogers entertained a motion for arrest of judgment , and named Saturday , Feb. 24 , for argument , ordering that briefs be submitted to him in the meantime . Bail was increased from $2,000 to $5,000 . John Lyon of Hempstead , the bondsman , will qualify in the larger amount . Harvey Spencer , a Manhattan handwriting expert , was the last witness for the defense . District Attorney Franklin A. Coles , who had said that two of Valentine 's daughters would be called as witnesses by the prosecution , decided that the people did not need their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signature to a deed transferring property in Nassau County . The witness Spencer testified that the general aspect and particular characteristics of the disputed signature were like the admitted genuine signatures of Marie A. Valentine . An exact similarity , he contended , would raise a suspicion . Timothy M. Griffing , counsel for Valentine , summing up , said : " My client produced the deed here in open court . Consider what he might have done , what indeed any guilty man would have done . He might have destroyed the deed , or hidden it so effectually that it could not be found . That could have been done by him before it was photographed . Mr. Rand , for the people , declared : " I will say one thing for all the witnesses , and that is that every one told the truth as he or she saw it . " If the signature on the deed was genuine , why did Valentine try to secure the services of Carvalho , as has been shown here ? " demanded Rand of the jury , but looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and showed him many signatures which he said were genuine beyond all question . But Carvaiho had already studied the handwriting , and , while he told Valentine that he would cheerfully go before a Judge and proclaim his own error if he could be convinced that he had made one , Valentine was unable to prove to him that the signature upon the disputed deed was that of Marie A. Valentine . Lawyer Griffing and his client contend that there is no such crime known to the statutes of this State as " uttering a forged instrument . " The case will be carried to the Court of Appeals if Justice Rogers does not dismiss it upon the indictment . $3,000 A FRONT FOOT . Remarkable Advance in 125th Street Property Within Three Weeks .
