txt The dinner given by the Brooklyn Demo. cratic Club in honor of the one hundred and fifty-seventh annlversay of the birth ' of Thomas Jefferson , for the purpose of making a protest against the nomination of William Jennings Bryan for the Presie dency , took place at the house of the Germania Club , 120 Schermerhorn Street , Brooklyn , last night . Over a hundred members of the club , which is identified with the Shepard faction of the Democratic Party of Brooklyn . took part in the dinner , though Edward M. Shepard , the leader of the faction and the Vice President of the club , because of ill health and social oblia gations , was unable to attend . MR . CLEVELAND 'S LETTER . It had been the desire of the club to have ex-President Cleveland deliver one of that speeches , but Mr. Cleveland could not be present . Instead , he sent the following lets ter : Princeton , April 12 , 1900 . , ' Louis F.

" When those who profess the Demoa cratic faith meet to celebrate the birth of the man who first gave that faith a case tinct formulation their pride in the achieve- , meats and triumphs of the party which he founded should not entirely displace all thought of its present situation and the conditions , which , in the light of expert ence , appear to be essential to its success . " Though the faults of the party in power are many , and though its offenses against the political health and safety of the coon , try are flagrant , these things should not encourage us to base an expectation of success and a hope for the restoration of wholesome administration upon the shortcomings of our adversaries . We should too well understand their ability to attach to their fortunes the powerful contingent of selfish interests , to place confident reliance upon the weakness which ought to be the penalty of their misdeeds . STRENGTH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close our eyes to the fact that the Democratic party is only formidable in its own strength . Its power to win victories has always been found to depend upon a sturdy and con. sistent adherence to its time-honored principles , which have proved sufficient to meet every emergency of our National life . Whatever successes may have attended a party of opportunity , with sails spread for every transient breeze of popular sentiment or excitement , experience has abundantly demonstrated that Democracy is so constituted that it is only strong when coma a-eous in the right , and only victorious when its forces are marshalled under its old and well-recognized standards . " Our principles are so simple , and they accord so well with the honest American disposition , which loves freedom and cares for the public v'elfare , that they are easily understood by the Democratic masses .

WAY TO AVOID DISASTER . " The healthfulness of our party may well be questioned when it shrinks from such an examination of its position as will enable it to avoid disaster by keeping in al course of safety under the guidance of true Democracy . Therefore those who claim to be followers of Thomas Jefferson will fail to discharge a solemn duty if , in this time of doubt and temptation , they neglect such an examination , and if this discloses a tendency in party control to subordinate the principles of pure Democracy , and to distrust their conquering power , then conditions should not continue without al brave and early Democratic protest .

EX-GOV . BOIES 'S LETTER . Another letter of regrets that was re .. ceived with loud cheers was one from ex . Gov . Horace Boles of Iowa , who , after re .. ferring with praise to the motives that ledl up to the declaration of war against Spain , deplored the acquisition of territory which that combat resulted in . Continuing , Mr. , Boles said : " Turning from the sight of blood-stained fields and desolated homes to the little Island of Porto Rico that welcomed us as deliverers from an oppressor 's hand , what do we find ?

Anti-imperialism. anti-militarism , anti-monopoly , and death to trusts is the unmingled acclaim of all who oppose the present Administration . If these are the planks that will make the Democratic platform , there will be no breach in the ranks or those who would sacredly guard the most vital principles on which this Government is grounded and on whlch it must remain if it is to endure forever .

" DEWEY 'S NEPHEW PRESENT . Letters of regret were also received from Gen. Joseph Wheeler , Perry Belmont , Norris d . Osborn of Connecticut , who was to respond to the toast " Thomas Jefferson . " and Edward M. Shepard . Early in the speech-making Edward W. Dewey , a nephew of Admiral Dewey , entered the banquet room . Mr. Dewey 's coming was unexpected and his entrance was unnoticed . The first toast . " A Ceptury of Democracy , " was responded to by Joseph J. Willett of Alabama , who delivered the " long talk ? ? at the Tammany Society Fourth of July celebration last year . On that occasion Judge Willett 's speech , which was anti-Bryan in its spirit , was counteracted by a shorter one made by ex-Gov . James 8 . Hogg of Texas , who awakened a great deal O ? enthusiasm by declaring for the reaffirmation of the Chicago platform and the renomination of Mr. Bryan . Mindful of his last experience , Judge Willett , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seriousness " Is Gov . Hogg of Texas here ? " " No , no. " the reply came from several parts of the room . Then . " Judge Willett exclaimed , " I. guess I 'm safe . " Judge Willett began by declaring that he had voted for Mr. Bryan in 1896 and would vote for him again if he were again nominated this year . He called attention to the fact that the recent municipal elections in the West had resulted in Republican victories and argued that there was little . hope for better days for the Democratic Party unless it settled its disputes . This was possible , he said , only by relegating to the rear the questions on which the party is now divided and by getting together on issues on which it is united . " Unquestionably , " he said , " the silvet question split our party open , and , as it is settled for four years now , it should be relegated to the rear . The great danger is the apathy of the North and the splendid material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withdrawn the minds of the people from politics . CONDEMNS TEE CANDIDATE . " But say that we relegate. silver to the rear and agree upon the platform , . how about the candidate ? It Is clear to my mind we can not nominate Mr. Bryan and relegate the silver question . He is the very incarnation of that question , and the very - name of Bryan throughout the whole country means free silver , 16 to 1 . It would be illogical and against his wishes , not to say absurd to adopt a conservative platform and , nominate Mr. Bryan upon it . The man in this case would be the platform . " It is said the stars in their course fought against Sisera , ' and truly the stars ? have fought against Mr. Bryan since 1896 . His Cassandra-like prophecies have failed ? of fulfillment and the country was never more prosperous than to-day . His argument about the intimate and indissoluble connection between the prices of silver , cotton and wheat now seems positively ludicrous in the light of recent experience . while his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prices awakes our genuine and unrestrained mirth when we see prosperity on every side and prices jumping into the sky . It is as good as a show . How can you elect a man of whom the whole commercial world is making fun ? " Mr. Bryan is no longer regarded by any considerable body of men in the South as either a statesman or as a profound man . His strength comes from his having been the leader of a great party in 1896 , from his fatal facility of speech , and from the great purity of his public and private life . He has the commercial and manufacturing classes arrayed against him , and even the politicians who are shouting for him admit it is impossible to elect him with this handicap . " Our National Committee has prostrated itself into a machine to promote the aspirations of one man . Why , this committee . I am told , has just sent out a circular telling Democrats , that they should support Only one man . and that any one who en- I couraged the Presidential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it any wonder we have fallen so low in influence and power ? ISSUES FOR DEMOCRATS . " Fortunately for us , we have several issues en which we can unite . There is the tariff issue and its resultant , the trust question . After building a tariff wall about the industries of the country , the Republican Party created trusts , and never was there greater need for reform . Trusts have thrown thousands of drummers out of employment These drummers , if organized in our behalf , would be more terrible than an army with banners . They could be organized for Augustus Van Wyck , but not for Mr. Bryan . Then there is the issue of anti-imperialism . " We can only fight the battle of - 1000 by opposing the well-paid , well-disciplined troops of the Republican Party by organisation and union . We have tried fusion , but it has failed , and has almost wrecked our party . We are never so strong as when we command our own ship and fly our own colors , and never so weak as when we seek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Campbell of Ohio responded to the toast , " The Restoration of Jeffersonian Democracy . " Jefferson , he said , had stated with great precision the distinction between ratio and coinage , and so long as the Democracy adhered to the distinction he had drawn it was victorious . EX-GOV . CAMPBELL SPEAKS . " In 1896 , " ex-Gov . Campbell said . " the Democratic Convention grasped at the shadow and threw away the substance , aed determined to go to the country . on the question of ratio The Populist Party , with its curious jumble of truth and fallacy , had gained a footing , and the Chicago convention unwisely undertook to cater to this element , which can never be merged with true Democracy . The attempt to combine Democracy with Popul sm may have been well intentioned , but the result in November did not indicate that it was born of sound judgment . " A majority of the electors of the country were bimetallists , but they did not favor the free coinage of silver at a ratio that must result in silver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monometalism , they selected gold , and thus they were saddled not only with the gold standard but also with a financial bill that creates the most dangerous of all trusts ? a money trust . Whether they chose wisely it is too late to discuss . It is sufficient to know that ' 16 to 1 ' is dead , and that so long as we proclaim our intention to resur rect it just that long will our resurrection be postponed . " This may be our last stand . Let the Party of Plutocracy once more succeed , and the census and the election statistics will become the powerful weapons whereby the Democratic South shall be deprived of her rights under the tattered remnants of the Constitution . At the last election leepublican Ohio polled an average of 37.000 votes to a Congressional District , while , in Democratic Mississippi , the average was less than 4,000 . It is easy to draw the conclusion . If the men of the South love Populism more than they love truth , let them adhere to it ; let them again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cause of Sixteen to One . ' and cnce more  --  and for all  --  drive the knife into the vitals of Jeffersonian Democracy . Their day of repentance will come , but it will then be everlastingly too late . A GLIMPSE OF LIGHT . But this evil day must not come . A glimpse of light , which may herald the rising sun of Jeffersonian restoration , dawned a few days ago in the State of Pennsylvania . There the representatives of a half million Democrats gathered under the skillful leadership of one who was sagacious enough to blaze the path which leads to the broad road of success . That wise convention proclaimed the gospel of 1900 . " No mention was made of the Chicago platform ; nothing was said about sixteen to one , but gathering from highway and byway every shred of Jeffersonian doctrine , they constructed a creed that no true Democrat dare repudiate . Let us hope and believe that this may be the harbinger of what shall occur at Kansas City on the Nation 's birthday , and that under . the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thomas Jefferson a regenerated Democracy shall redeem the country , and restore the reign of the common people . " When ex-Gov . Campbell finished his speech he was cheered again and again , and he was hailed in song as " A jolly good fellow " till he blushed with pleasure . As he resumed his seat a man in the room cried out , " Has Gov . Campbell any choice ter the nominee for the Presidency ? " Ex-Gov . Campbell arose , and , laughing heartily , replied : " So long as I do not get the nomination myself I do n't much care where It goes . " The speech , in response to the toast " The Brooklyn Democratic Club , " was delivered by Louis F. Burchard . ON DE W EY 'S CANDIDACY . F. W. Hinrichs responded to the toast " Thomas Jefferson . " He said Bryan had had an opportunity to become President , but that recently it had been found that he did not possess the qualities that go to make up a great statesman . He said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candidates for President had been military men , and added that , while he neither advocated nor opposed the candidacy ofex-Justice Van Wyck , he wanted to advise those who desired to see Bryan beaten that Dewey was a popular hero , and that under his leadership the Democratic Party was sure to win .
