txt Two hundred passengers and a quarter of a million dollars ' worth of gold dust , rescued from the wrecked steamer Hating , arrived in Vancouver this afternoon by the steamer Willipa . All the stories told by the passengers vary slightly , but the main facts are the same . W .. M. Brewer , the well-known Aperican mining engineer , said that the Accident could not have been avoided ; that the illluck following the Canadian Pacific steamers had overtaken the Hating , and that the cleverest navigator in the world could not have prevented the accident . " I was in the bow of the boat , " he said , " when the vessel struck , and although the shore was fifteen feet away , the fog was so dense I could not see it . When the Hating rammed her nose on the rock the women screamed .

While they were on shore the wreck was examined .

A testimonial to the Captain was passed around to the effect that the passengers held him blameless and believed him an able and careful navigator .
