NOTHING could be snore remarkable than the extent of the modern indulgence in sport , except perhaps the raphlity with which it has come upon us . Men who still regard themselves as ; ' oting recall the time when , outside a small circle in two or three Eastern universities , sport was associated with schoolboys in knee trousers and with corner loafers in highly colored linen and cheap jewelry . But nowadays the hunch and the bar may be seen to glory in knickerbockers , while pink shirts have not been unknown to the most exquisite . It is perhaps natural that cautious parents have tried to dissuade their offspring from what seems at the best childish , and at the worst perilous ; and that the most scholarly of our magazines , reviews , and daily papers have been divided on the question of intercollegiate contests , while the very faculties of the universities have neglected academic administration and finance in an effort to grapple with it . The satirist is more than justified who described the American university as a place where the students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . professors manage the sports . Yet many a doubtful pass might have been clear , and many a hard word might have been spared , if we had all realized that the point at issue has been pretty well threshed but in the mother country of modern sport , and that it is , in fact , one of the oldest questions in history . The animus of the puristic , press is precisely that of the modern English Puritan , ? Trafalgar-Squaring , as Mr. Pinero would say , on the Curse of Sports ; and this , iu turn , is milk and honey beside the invective of rare old Stubbs in his sixteenth-century Anatomic of Abuses . And long before Stubbs the spirit of sport was /nighty in the land . While yet the " friendlie fights " of " base foot ball players " were unknown , chivalry flourished like the green bay tree , transcending the glory of modern football ; Rome made a political centre of the chariot races , and the calendar of Hellas was regulated by Olympiads . More than this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a royal virtue of braving the perils of the chase , as any one may see in the exquisitely spirited sculptures , now in the British Museum , which once graced the banqueting hall of Athrbanipal . And one need not rest with the evidences of even the most ancient history . The instinct for play is native in all animal life , and has lately been made the subject of a shrewd psychological research by Professor Karl Gross , of the University of Basel , in two works on The Play of Animals and The Play of Man . It need not surprise us if it is one ( lay discovered that the original protozoan prepared its offspring for the struggle of life by holding oozing matches in the depths of ocean . The only question which tyrannous nature has left ( Ten to us is , not whether there shall be sport , but how we shall derive the most benefit from it . That the national games of Greece bore an important part in the cultivation of Hellenic manhood does not admit of argument ; and the jousts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the military system . The importaaer of modern athletics as an element Of na. tional defense should be equally cleat and indeed was made so some years ago in English discussions of the relation 1,1 school sports to the national army . The signal aspect of our athletic system i , , an aspect in which it differs Tana that of all other ages . The new factors au , those which have made a tabula m in so many phases of modern life , ? Flea , and electricity ; in a word , machinery . To the gentleman of Washington 's day ? and for that /natter , of very mach later ? the walks of life were literal walks , or else journeys , no less athletic , in the saddle . To the modern the so-called walks of life have become toad rushes by railway , trolley , or looter car . The mechanic of our fathers worked loom by hand , wielded the cobbler 's hammer or the carpenter 's saw and chisel . l'o-day the mechanic feeds a machine or directs pneumatic tools . while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old ploughed , liar . rowed , and hoed by haul ; the modem , farmer is a master machinist . In short , that struggle for existence , a i rich we now know to be the origin and rough foster father of progress , is no longer waged by muscle and sinew ; it is a matter of intelligence and of nervous energy . This fact , I take it , has been , consciously or unconsciously , the major premise of those who reprobate athletic sports . We are no longer doomed , they say , to live as mere animals . What need of lithe muscles and sinews trained to endurance , when applied knowledge is the only power ? Warfare itself ? since so much of the brute is still honored among us ? is soon to be a mere matter of railroading , marine engineering , and machine guns . Some such fact must lie granted , but is the deduction sound More sound than sense , one is tempted to say . The logic of the position outlined can lead to only one conclusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the present the sinews tool the muscles are disappearing , x to- , aber with tonsils , vermiform appen- dives , and sundry other survivals of all earlier stage of brute life ; the sooner we are rid of them , the better . If this ruully were the ease , however , we should eNpre1 the man of the present to be a creature of sounder nerves and a more tireless brain than the mail of history . The patent fact is that he is rather a vintill ; of neurosis and mental derange-went . Luis medicine is to rest long wanks in bed and to feed hugely en the most nourishing foods . The severest exercise his shattered nerves can endure is a massage . lYlien by these means his muscles and viscera have been resuscitated , his medicine is golf or a constitutional horseback ride . ' Many of its have oat forgotten an eloquent paper in which Professor William James showed that not only the nervous and intellectual forces , but even the natural Inunan emotions flourish most in 0 sound body . The conditions of modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dispense with athletic culture , make it all the more necessary . The intellectual vigor of the race , to say nothing of its physical prowess , can be maintained only by availing ourselves of the instinct of play . If in maturity and old age we wish to work on , snapping our fingers at the admirable rest wore of Dr. Weir Mitchell , we must in youth and manhood take enough physical recreation to make sure that all our animal functions are sound . In any sporting contest the element of physique is of primary value . The man who has the stronger digestion and assimilation , a heart of greater pumping power , muscles of finer fibre , and more vigorous nerves to drive them has the game half won . The other half , however , is the better part . It is technically known as training , and no one who has not tried it knows the difference it makes . A man who , untrained , can run n quarter of 0 mile in a minute , tout in a few weeks reduce his time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a season by six to eight seconds ; 551151 51 fifth of it second in 51 MIT may be as decisive as the proverbial inch on 0 man 's nose . In all contests , from football to golf , the difference between the trained and the untrained is as great , though perhaps less calculable to the uninitiated . A young fellow whose main hope of distinction in his college lies in athletic prowess soon learns , that much indulgence in tobacco and malt liquors , in some mysterious but painfully evident manner , clogs his lungs , and that the fonder he is of spirits and wine , the more treacherously they Sap his energies ; while the 151055t cheerful night owl learns the blessing of early sleep . A man may be gifted with twice the natural powers of his self-disciplined rival , but unless lie masters himself there is an end of all hope of excelling . Let us not cry /fowl/ faculty residutions , the college sermon , or the Young Men 's Christian Association , ? they are a source of mach comfort to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the undergraduate who stands most in need of a jog to conscience is most easily reached by lie lesson of experience Oil the athletic field . This physical training is not all . No type of athlete is more familiar than the man who has a superlative physique , superlatively trained , and yet somehow , in the final test , fails to excel . In practice he is capable of the most brilliant fielding , the most marvelous running and tackling , breaks all records on the track ; but in the important contest he is a cipher . Because of some defect of //dial or of temperament a crisis undoes him . Every earnest athlete knows how he feels , ? the sinking in the vitals at the thought of a contest , the haunting dread , the nights of wakefulness and worry : it may almost be said that unless a man has felt all this his fibre is 604 The Modern Chivalry . too coarse to respond to the demand of the final struggle . if these swarming suggestions of the nerves are not mastered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man above himself . The difference is a question of self-conquest , which is a purely moral question , and quite as important now as in the days when it was thought desirable to take a city . The rough material of success in life is a good physique ; but this is quite useless without discipline and self-command . It is perhaps possible to claim a further virtue for sport . Sir Philip Sidney has related of I is riding master how he discoursed so eloquently the praises of horses and horsemen that in hearing him you would think there were no such great virtue in the world as horsemanship ; " and such more , that if I had not been a piece of a logician before I came to him 1 think he would have persuaded me to have wished myself a horse . " Sir Philip archly begs indulgence for speaking in a similarly exalted straits in defense of poesie . The conceit is a pleasant one , for what was chivalry but the poetry of horsemanship ? It may not make us think the worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying in modern terms . All praise to the discipline and self-command of the athlete ; but at best these are mere moral qualities , the products of enlightened self-seeking . There are higher manifestations of sport , known as sportsmanship . In America , it is to lie feared , the word is still discolored by the Puritan abhorrence of all delight ; one can not be sure that it does not suggest hoarse voices and the tobacconated air of the poolroom . But in England it stands for a spiritual attitude that ennobles both winning and losing , the preparation and the fight . Of what use is it to he strong and steadfast unless the spirit , like the flesh , rises superior to the conflict ? How ignoble to desire success unless we can be serene in defeat ! A football Man , let us say , has worked hard all thentull the autumn , and in the end is beaten professionalism Or illegal roughnes , tt the part of its opponent . How easy to make it public protest ? and lion on . desirable ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , with t prospect of being beaten again in the same way ! A baseball team is playing on the grounds of its rivals , and at the crisis of the game is purposely " nutled " by the organized shouting aid cheering of its hosts , and loses the game . How difficult and how infinitely worn , while to master rage and disappointment , and , when the return game is played , to meet discourtesy and unfairness with a courteous desire that the bet . ter team win ! And yet the remedy is such a simple matter , consisting only in a will to prefer the sport to a champion . ship , the amenities of life to any facti ? tious success . It is the will to Is this that denotes the sportsman . May no ; Sir Philip 's riding master have been thinking of sense such virtues when le was so eloquent in the praises of Ainalry ? The bare struggle for existence exacts strength and masterhood , hot to live in the fair name of a sportsman it is necessary to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a natural love of things of the mind , but even in a university the greater number find their really sleep interests only in actual life . To these , athletic sports , while they are more indispensable nowadays than ever for the preservation of health and strength , have this farther advantage : that , like the chivalry of old , they afford the most generally available school tar the humanities of living . IV . It is in England that the spirit and the practice of sport are oldest and most thoroughly developed ; and it is from England that we have taken and are // taking our outdoor recreations . Perhaps lofting is so enlightening with regard to the potentialities of sportsmanship as to understand fully its place and its functions in English life . To trace its mane manifestations to their source is hardly possible , but we shall not be fur wrong if we begin with the climate . Of all known climates the English is at ? , 111.0 the worst and the best . From year 's end to year 's end the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damp of the four surrounding seas . A long and drenching rain is almost unknown ; if a maul can forego the vanity of being quite dry , and is not above an occasional retreat into a cab , an umhrulla or a rain coat is scarcely necessary . Yet the sky is never crystal-clear , as it so often is with us ; the snit seldom dazzles ; the stars never flicker and blaze . Month in and month out the landscape is blurred in all-pervading damp : thin , almost imperceptible in summer , yet changing the verdure to an olive green ; azure and opalescent in spring ; purple in autumn ; golden gray or lurid dun color in winter . And frost aril snow are as rare as the heat of pure sunlight . The defects of this climate are at one with the virtues in that they drive men into the open ; indeed , it would not be easy to say what are defects and what virtues . The temperance of the summer heat snakes out of doors a paradise . In the winter one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only American residents , but the natives themselves , if they stay long indoors . The coal consumed seems enough to heat the entire island to incandescence ; yet such is the efficiency of the open fireplace of the country that the loan who crouches before it goes blue in the lips and white to the roots of his nose , while the particles of half-consumed carbon gather minute globules of mist above the chimneys , shroud the city in a black natural fog and the citizens in a fog of the spirit . At least I can think of no other explanation of these concurrent phenomena , unless indeed we assume with the satirist that it is the people who give rise to the fogs . In many countries commonly reckoned temperate much exercise is dangerous during the greater part of the year . The heat of summer threatens sunstroke , and the cold of winter pneumonia ; only in the spring and autumn is it pleasant and profitable to be long in the open , and even then drenching rains are not infrequent . The climate of England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green fields and mild skies of summer beckon , small wonder if the white flannels of the cricketer enliven every common , and the red blazer of the golfer blooms among the poppies of heath and down . In winter the weight of the low-hanging skies can not be sustained without the stimulant of constant recreation , ? rowing , rackets , field hockey , cross-country running , Association and Rugby football , ? while the fields are even softer and greener than in summer . Under the brisk American climate , a man may , without knowing it , go into nervier ; prostration for the lack of exercise ; but in England it is necessary to exercise daily , or else to fall daily into a blue fit on the fender . So all England goes sporting , each according to his lights . In the short days of winter the Saturday half holiday is celebrated by eountless paper chases , games of field hockey , and football matches . In sunnmet daylight lingers until almost ten o'clock , and the drudging city clerk and the factory laborer can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dingy alleys of Whitechapel the roster hoots rats with his terrier , or races whippets . It is not unlikely that the very character of English and American athletes and the genius of the national sports has been determined by the difference of climate . If our summer evenings were as long as those in England , it is not improbable that baseball , like the kindred game of cricket , would require three long days for a match to reach a conclusion , instead of taking scarcely longer than the far more strenuous football . The sparkle and brilliancy of American skies and the sharp alternations of heat and cold must have not a little to do with giving our athletes a keen , nervous , and resourceful temperament . Certain it is that the American , by virtue of his energy : Ind skill , can outsprint and out-jump the English athlete , and per contra falls behind in contests of endurance . Baseball is not only a shorter game than cricket , but gives inure scope to ingenuity and skill in team play , with a concomitant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the rapid alternations of innings it is infinitely more dramatic . American Rugby differs from English Rugby as a complex modern military campaign differs from a medieval melde ; and it must be added , owing to the severity of the preparation required and the keenness of existing rivalries , it offers temptations to roughness and foul play thattare as yet imperfectly resisted . V. As exercise is peculiarly needful in England , it is fortunate that English life is everywhere peculiarly well organized for its enjoyment . This is especially the case in the public schools and universities which are the ancient homes of sport and the great modern training grounds of sportsmanship . The first requisite is a community organized into separate units on which to base genuine rivalries ; and nowhere is the life more thoroughly developed in small communities than in the public schools and universities . The public schools , in spite of the name they are known by , are in point of fact private and select , being quite like what we call preparatory schools , with these important exceptions : that instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being mainly subsidiary to the universities they are the characteristic and all-important educa-duc tiona tional institution . They are , in fact , responsible for the bulk of the education of the middle and upper classes , and the lad of fourteen to nineteen years of age who does not go to one of them is is much the same position as the piling American who does not go to college . Not only do they afford the inevitable matches between rival schools , but each institution is so organized as to scope to au infinity of civil contests. order to insure home life and hid ivithod care , the schools are generally divided into separate " houses , " each containing a score or two of boys under a master . Every house maintains a football temp and it cricket eleven , and a boating mar if the school is near water , each of which enters competitions with teams of other houses for the school championship . There may be house matches also in golf , tennis , rackets , and fives . The national respect for sport may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compelled , not only by ' , oldie opinion but by the authority of his superiors , to take regular exercise . It does not much matter what his sport is , but sonic sport lie must have , and he must do honest work at it . If a hid who elects to play cricket is slack at his fielding or batting , one of the sixth-ham boys in authority remonstrates with hint ; and if this is not enough , canes hint soundly , with the full approval of the masters . If it youthful football player does not fairly bear out his part in the scrimmage , the game is stopped while he is taken to the side lines and smacked . Such means are not often necessary . In fact , the shoe is on quite the ether foot , ? at least from the point of view of the Puritan parent , who keeps up a pretty constant outcry against the waste of time and energy in sports . At Oxford and Cambridge there is no actual compulsion , but the rivalry among the score of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools . And when a college of a hundred and fifty to two hundred and fifty undergraduates main- // tains a team in each of the half dozen chief pastimes , there is need of the services of every able-bodied man . To hair a sport is as much a matter of racist ' as to bathe . The fellow who can Flay ? ind wo n't play is made to play ; and the force of a public opinion now and Own expresses itself even by means of persinial assaults , known as " ragdew. " " or as we should say , by hazing. ' s The very studies seem to be planned as secondary to sport . The system of instimetion makes attendance at lectures optional , and the tutor is rare who has the courage to hold forth between luncheon and tea , ? the time which custom givws IlVer to recreation . Furthermore , in ( mhr to take the degree , it is mienssalT not only to pass certain examinations , but to complete a minimum of residence , ? three years . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is dull or negligent , he may , by a special dispensation , stay on four years , or even more . As for the studious part of the university life , a man may have done with it , if he is clever or diligent , a full term before the appointed time ; lc he is allowed no such liberty with the social and athletic part . He is required to keep on residing , studies or no studies , until the minimum is Coolpleted . To a sportsman brought up under American faculty regulations this is the most delightful of paradoxes ; but it is very characteristic of the English-non , who rivals the Chinaman in standing fixed ideas upon their heads . The " solid-reading man " who goes in for honors differs from the passman only in degree . His whole duty is supposed to he fulfilled if , as the phrase goes , he reads his five good hours a day . Oarsmen and cricketers often stanch high in the schools , and he who runs may read . There is reason in all this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the historical undergraduate , and little short of a convulsion could disestablish him , ? that is the best of British reasons . And then , the authorities argue amiably , if it were not for the pass schools the majority of the passmen would not come to Oxford at all , and Would spend their impressionable period in some place of litel ' less amenity . Clearly they learn all that it is needful for a gentleman to know , especially in the way of sportsmanship ; and they are perhaps kept from a great deal that is dangerous to young fellows with money ; old leisure . It means much to the aristocracy nobility of England that , whatever their ambitions and capacities , they are encouraged by the pursuit of a not too elusive A. It . to experience four years of the sport and good-coniradeship of the university . Even the ambitious student profits by the arrangement . Wherever his future may be passed , ill the public service , in lass " , medicine , or even theology , it is of advantage to know men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the contests of field and river , ? of far greater advantage , from the common sensible English point of view , than to have been educated in au atmosphere of exact scholarship . Still more than in America athletic success is the great distinction of school life . The leading athletes constitute an aristocracy as well recognized and as well organized as the house of peers . At Eton the cdqdain of the boats wields an authority in his little kingdom as well established as that of the sovereign across the river at Windsor , and far more absolute . At the universities a great athlete is awarded the privilege of wearing the colors , which makes him a " blue , " much as a successful general is awarded a peerage ; and there are half blues as there are baronets and knights . The instinct of play is not only cultivated in England ; it has been organized into one of the unrecorded institutions of the realm . The man who has spent his boyhood and youth in school or university athletics falls beneath a tyranny of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of the climate . When a mind that Itas been highly cultivated is doomed to mere workaday life , it falls prey to a malady of unrest which is too well known ; and the body that has once felt the high title of physical well-being is as loath to revert to tut ignoble estate , Like the other muscles , the heart develops with exercise . The lungs expand and build up new air cells ; the blood vessels increase in size and in number . On a sudden change to a sedentary life , the increase of tissue , now superfluous , degenerates , and brings it physical stupor greater than that of the man who has never trained . Not infrequently the degenerate tissues offer lodgment to diseases which a normal physique would shake off . When , as sometimes happens , a famous oarsman or football player is carried away in middle life , the fault usually lies with the inactivity of Iris postgraduate days . Theworst results can be avoided by making the transition front activity to inactivity gradual , ? by tapering off , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Once an athlete , always an athlete . The fall development of national sport requires sports for all ages as for all . seasons . Hunting has been followed in England ever since there were vermin in the fields and men of some leisure with horses in their stables ; shooting since there were stone arrows , beasts and birds . The primitive form of football ( if not , as some maintain , its spiritual prototype ) is said to be a prehistoric festival in which the Saxon inhabitants of the midlands made a pastime of kicking about the heads of vanquished Danes ; and cricket traces back through dimly shadowed centuries of stoolball to the unrecorded annals of rounders , ? the parent also of our own baseball . But the nineteenth century , which witnessed the sudden flowering of school and university sport , brought a new era in the sports of the nation at large . The old boy and the graduate have clubbed together for the cultivation of their fa vorite games in every possible walk rtI life and with sportsmen of all feedlot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ing rivers are crowded with entvir2 , clubs , in most of which school and versity oarsmen have been leading sill . its ; and there are many regattas on cud , of them , of which Healey is only tit , most famous . Every town has its football field , and the sport is SO universal and so much a part of the life that clubhouses for its cultivation are rare . E Vett village green has its cricket creases , aid many a common its golf course . In it , cities , each of the large business houses is likely to maintain teams in all the most popular sports . One of the many functions of the houses of Parliament ; . that of a golf club . The Hon. A. Balfour is not unknown as a cabinet minister and as the author of a philosophic disquisition on the Foundations Bulief ; but it is said to be his particular pride that he is a winner of the pais liamentary handicap . It is the same in all professions . fir . Dan Len ? , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and on the music-hull stage , lately ended has season by nap . mining a cricket eleven of fellow set it-s ; and in a charity match against a rival team of professionals of the boards , he enacted cricket with such histrionic distinction that the conscientious scorer felt obliged to credit him personally with 9999 runs .

" Dr. COnall Doyle achieved equal success in captaining an eleven of authors against an eleven of artists . As opponent alter opponent fell before his bowling , the secret of his prowess became known , No man of sensibility , the artists explained , could keep his eye in while that hulking figure in a pink shirt stood against an olive-green background . So indigenous are country life aiel sport that what we call country club ' , are all but unknown . Each household estate outside the large towns is a coon- // try club in itself . When clubs and clubhruses exist , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ located in the suburbs .

They are luxurious in their way , and t heir membership is closely guard- , d ; but they are not very expensive , according to American standards . The Queen 's Club , Kensington , where the inter-university athletic and football meetings are held , as well as international athletic contests , has accommodations also for fives , rackets , and tennis . The famous Lord 's , the historic guardian of cricket and its very citadel , is in St. John 's Wood . Both are accessible from the city by the Tuppenny Tube and an omnibus . The initiation fee and does of the purely sporting clubs seldom exceed live guineas each . Within an hour , d'f er leaving his office , and at the expense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be playing his favorite game . ' finis teeming athletic life of England has been organized , according to preexisting boundaries , into rival communities which bear something the same relationship to the nation as a whole that the " houses " bear to the school , and the colleges to the university . Long ago Norman rule trod out the warring Saxon kingdoms , and now railway and telegraph are banding Scotch , Irish , and Welsh into is common nation with the English . But sport has preserved many of the rivalries which statesmanship has destroyed . As long " Willow the King , that monarch grand , " roles the summer ( and his reign is known to be everlasting ) Sussex will meet Middlesex in the cricket field , as South Saxon of old met Middle Saxon ; and the strife will be as serious , if not as sanguinary . And as long as football reigns in winter there will be fierce warfare among English , Scotch , Welsh , and Irish . For some years to come , it would seem , England , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will be ruble to bear up against the increasing tension of modern life , and to make the best of its instinct for play . The national heart will beat strong and true , and the national limbs will be lithe . Countless keen contests by field and river will teach thousands and hundreds of thousands of young men the stern virtues Hutt make for success in more trying mid more enduring struggles of life . Best of all , this love of sport will foster the spiritual ideal of sportsmansliip , ? candor , good sense , and generosity , that rise higher as the contest grows hot . stir . Yet the prophet of despair is abroad in the land the commercial economist has joined the Puritan in crusading against the curse of sports . And there are abases enough to anatomize . Let a fox bunt sweep by a factory , and every hand is outdoors gaping : it the men in pink until they are out of view ; when a race meeting conies to the neighborhood , work is virtually suspended until the races are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pleasures of hope by placing a shilling or a half crown on the Ascot or the Derby . The Saturday half holiday and the numerous bank holidays are as sacredly observed as the Sabbath of old , which itself has yielded to the passion of the sportsman . All this tends to increase greatly the cost of production . Labor , it is true , is cheapenr by the day in England than with us ; but the holidays of the sportsman combined with the inertia of life in an aristocracy have apparently reversed the balance as regards relative results . If an American business horse is pressed with orders , it works overtime , nights and holidays , until the rush is past . An English than is more apt to refuse the orders , keeping on with its holidays , while the neglected orders fatten its rivals . The capitalist is more lavish than the improvident laborer in taking holidays for sport .

The cricket match at Lord 's , between Eton and Harrow or the two universities , must not be neglected though the weightiest affairs go by the board .

Is it necessary that a board of directors shall meet and take action on August 12 , or thereafter ? Quite out of the question , fur that is the opening of the grouse season , and the members of the board will be scattered to the moors of the four kingdoms . As for Parliament , nothing short of a foreign invasion could keep it from adjourning before that magic day . An American going to London on business will do will to allow two weeks for what he could do in one Week in New York or Chicago ; and if his business is of a kind to demand judgment and 4106810/1 from his Englishman , he will lie lucky if he gets through it in four weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while his heels are cooling , and bursts out in sarcasm , invective , and rude profanity . But he may comfort himself by the thought that in the long run these leisurely ways enable him to do the business the islander is neglecting . Like all the great functions of life , sport may be a curse as well as a blessing . The problem is the old one of the golden mean . During the past decade the ' United States has caught the mother country napping , and has made deep inroads into her sources of national wealth ; but the fate of a great nation is seldom determined in a decade or in a century . We have made a brilliant foray : can we maintain our position ? The question is largely one of solidity anti enduranee ; and it is just here that the Amerlear physique and temperament , keen and active as it is , is likely to prove lacks ing .

Mg business in London . It is to this effect : the American is keener and More rapid ; the Englishman lives his lite slowly and more fully . As a business man , the American is said to be linnet up to forty-five or fifty ; after that he is seldom as capable as the easy-going Englishman , who keeps his faculties steady and alert to a green old age , It is a sign of the times that no small part of the plentiful earnings of the Amer. lean pioneer in English trade has one into country houses and shooting boxes , and even the younger men are finding the " week-end outing " of commercial value . In the long run American in. thistly can probably profit by more hull . clays and less worry . In the larger business of empire-build. ing the importance of athletic sports is even more evident . There is a saying that the English colonist plays crieldt , drinks Scotch whiskey , and flourishes in numbers , while the French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And the humanities of sport are no less important than the discipline .

Bethe general balance in favor of sports is wiped away there most lir many decades of commercial and colonial reverses ; if America is to enter into a lasting competition with the mo ; kir country , it will be necessary not only to avoid the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its virtues . In determining these virtues the national phlegm is is not unimportant lactor .
