 |p700  EVEN those who do not accept Jesus Christ as a Master whose example and instruction possess a divine authority may yet well think him the greatest religious teacher the world has ever seen , and his methods and spirit therefore worthy of the most thorough and reverent study . He " has founded absolute religion , " Ernest Renan says . " The genius of nineteen coming centuries , " Goldwin Smith calls him . In this article I ask the reader to consider the methods of the preaching of this founder of absolute religion , this genius of nineteen coming centuries . Certain negative conclusions respecting his method seem very evident . He did not depend for his power on dramatic effects . He did not act upon the counsel of Demosthenes , who declared that action was the first , the second , and the third condition of oratory . He did not win the attention of the people by any form of dramatic art or artifice . John B. Gough portrayed in action and in dialect every character he described , and acted upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with unconscious skill , imitated every act which he used in illustration . We can be quite sure that this was not Christ 's method , because he habitually taught sitting down . He went into the synagogue at Nazareth to preach , the eyes of all who were in the synagogue were fastened on him , and he " sat down " to preach to them . He went into the mountain , the multitudes followed him to listen to his inaugural sermon , and " when he was set " he opened his mouth and taught them . He came into the temple , all the people came unto him , " and he sat down and taught them . " The people pressed upon him at the lake of Gennesaret , and he entered into a boat , thrust it out a little from the land , and " sat down and taught the people out of the boat . " Nor did he move them by the oratorical splendor of his addresses . They had none of the literary characteristics of great orations . They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were not made splendid by beautiful ornamentation ; they were without rich coloring . They were without striking introductions to attract attention , and without eloquent perorations to win applause ; indeed , one can hardly think of them as having ever been received with applause . With very few exceptions , they were not aflame with passion . They were simple in style as in substance , spontaneous , unartificial , practical and instruc/ tional rather than imaginative and emotional . No school-boy wishing to find a fit piece of literature for a declamation would think of looking among Christ 's discourses for a suitable oration for oratorical display . Christ 's discourses are not declamatory , they are not oratorical ; they neither surge with passion , nor scintillate with antithesis , nor sparkle with wit and humor . No teacher of rhetoric would go to them except for examples of lucidity and simplicity . They are simple , conversational , almost colloquial . Nor was the power of Jesus Christ , primarily , intellectual . The interest which he aroused was not dependent on skillful analysis and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game of chess , setting thought against thought with check and countercheck , while men looked on to see how the game would end . There is very little of the kind of intellectual interest in reading the discourses of Jesus Christ which the scholar finds in reading the dialogues of Plato . A profound philosophy of life underlies his teaching , but his teaching is not the exhibition or unfolding of a system of philosophy . There is little in common in the method of the teaching between Jesus Christ and Hegel or Kant or Calvin or Edwards . Most of his teaching was conversational ; some scholars think it was all conversational . Probably it was largely fragmentary ; certainly it comes to us in fragmentary reports . It is mainly colloquial talk with men , rather than addresses to men ; he receives their inquiries and gives his reply , or seeks their responses to his own inquiries . It is often dialogue in fact when it is not so in form ? an interchange of thought with thought , of life with life . On even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than five discourses that can properly be called sermons , of which we have any report in the Gospels . These are the sermon at Nazareth , the Sermon on the Mount , the parables at the seashore , the sermon on the Bread of Life , and the Discourse on the Last Day . The parables by the seashore I s Christ as a Preacher 701 believe to have been given on different occasions , though of the same period of his ministry ; the other sermons above referred to I believe to be real discourses , not merely collections of apothegmatic sayings ; but upon this point scholars are not agreed . And yet , while he taught in conversational forms and in apparently fragmentary utterances , he dealt with the greatest problems of human life . The questions which he discussed were such as these : What is the object of life ? That question he answers in the sermon at Nazareth . We are here to serve one another , to lift men up , to comfort , to console , to illumine , to instruct , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to minister . What is the secret of happiness ? That question he answers in the Sermon on the Mount . Character is the secret of happiness . Blessed are the poor in spirit , the meek , the merciful , the pure in heart , the peacemakers . Not what we have , but what we are , determines our happiness . What is the secret of character ? How shall I possess a holiness ( or wholeness , or healthfulness ) that will make me blessed ? That question he answers in the sermon on the Bread of Life . The secret is communion with God , fellowship with him , feeding upon him , making him the substance of our life , the nourishment of our soul . What is the destiny of man , the issue of life , the outcome of this great drama of history , of which we are a part ? That question he answers in his Discourse on the Last Day . It is the revelation of God ? such a revelation that the deaf will hear , the blind will see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discourses to his conversations . These also are on great themes . Nicodemus comes to him by night . " Rabbi , " he says , " we know that thou art a teacher come from God : for no man can do these miracles that thou doest , except God be with him . " Christ instantly turns the conversation into a new channel . " It is not , " he tells him , " a right opinion about miracles , nor a right opinion about myself , ' that you need ; you need a new life coming down from above . " He talks with the woman at the well , and from a simple request for a  |p702  drink of water turns the conversation into one of the profoundest discourses respecting the nature and source of spiritual life . Or , from the conversations , turn to his parables . They are never mere dramatic pictures to catch the attention and arouse the interest for the moment . They are the interpretations of great spiritual truths . In the parables of the Good Samaritan , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character ; in the parable of the Prodigal Son he exhibits the difference between the holiness that forgives sin and the holiness that only hates and resents it ; in the parable of the Publican and the Pharisee , the difference between the holiness that is satisfied with past achievement and that which aspires to a worthier future . Though in form fragmentary , in fact his teaching was systematic . It may be true that " Jesus , so far as we can conclude from our sources , has never aimed in any single discourse , or any group of connected discourses , at laying down his doctrine in systematic form ; " 1 certainly his teaching is in its form the farthest possible removed from the systematic theology of a Calvin , an Edwards , a Park , or a Hodge ; but underlying his teaching is a system . He does not formulate it , but it exists . He presents no isolated truths , half thought out ; every truth which he presents runs its roots down and finds connection with every other truth . For nineteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have gotten some doctrines out of his teachings which are not there , and they have failed to get some doctrines out of his teachings which are there ; but , despite their conflicting prepossessions and temperaments , they have agreed in finding certain great fundamental truths in his ministry . Roman Catholic and Protestant , Calvinist and Arminian , Episcopalian and Congregationalist , orthodox and heterodox , bitterly as they have fought one another on certain questions of doctrine , heartily agree with one another in certain fundamental faiths . They could not have thus agreed in discovering a system underlying the teachings of Jesus Christ if there were no system there . Imperfectly understood by his disciples , imperfectly reported by them , constantly misinterpreted since , used by combatants as an arsenal for weapons of offense or defense , sharply criticised by skeptics of every type in all ages of the world , the teaching of Jesus Christ is more universally honored , more profoundly reverenced , and , on the whole , more loyally followed than ever before in the world 's history . This could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but a series of disjecta membra could possess no such immortality . But it was not the object of Jesus Christ to exhibit or maintain a system . He did not teach for the purpose of inculcating a philosophy ; it was not his aim to found a school of thought ; still less did he seek to ' give rules for the regulation of conduct , to found a school of ethics . Both truth and rules of conduct were instrumental ; the end of all his teaching was the production of character . Thus , his preaching was not in form philosophical or ethical ; it was vital , and aimed at changing the sources ? that is , aimed at changing the character . not merely at the formation of opinion or the regulation of conduct . He therefore never measured men by their ecclesiastical practices , their intellectual opinions , or their emotional states . He never asked them whether they went to church . or what they believed , or how they felt . He never portrayed men as good because of their ecclesiastical practices , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their emotions . He never portrayed them as bad because they did not conform to ecclesiastical rules or orthodox standards , or did not possess prescribed emotions . His measurements of men were always real , practical , vital : character was the end of his teaching , conduct was his measure of character . His preaching , therefore , is concrete . His illustrations are never mere ornaments , introduced to relieve a wearied audience or lighten the strain upon their attention . They are concrete expressions of vital truth ; and the only truths with which he concerns himself are those capable of concrete interpretation . An abstract truth which exists only in the realm of pure intellect has apparently  |p703  for Jesus Christ no interest ; it certainly has no place in his teachings . The only Christianity which Jesus Christ inculcated was applied Christianity . Seeking thus to change the sources of character , he seeks to make men think for themselves , answer their own questions , or ask questions of themselves which they had not thought to ask before . A lawyer asks him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him the story of the good Samaritan , and then returns his question to him , " Which now of these three , thinkest thou , was neighbor unto him that fell among thieves ? " He tells the story of two sons , one of whom promised to work in his father 's vineyard but did no work , the other of whom refused to work in his father 's vineyard and repented and went to work , and then puts to his auditors the question , " Whether of them twain did the will of his father ? " A young man comes running in his eagerness , kneels to him reverently , and in words acknowledging his authority says , " Good master , what shall I do to inherit eternal life ? " Christ throws him back upon himself : What do you mean by " good master " ? Why do you call me good ? and the young man is still silent ; he has used the phrase without significance . This method is characteristic with Christ . He seeks by concrete statement , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the intellectual conception , behind the ethical rule , behind the ecclesiastical formulary , into the very springs and sources of man 's being . His combination of profundity of thought and concreteness of statement gives his sayings a hidden meaning . His thoughts are seed thoughts . His teaching abounds in epigrams . Whole systems of life lie concealed in them . I say unto you , " Love your enemies , " has in it the secret of the Christian system of penology . The function of society is not to punish but to redeem the enemies of society . " Say , Our Father " has in it a complete system of theology . What true fatherhood means to us on earth interprets the relationship of God to humanity . Take my yoke upon you . " contains the whole secret of human development . Yoke yourself to God and s Christ as a Preacher 703 your work is easy . This is the whole secret of civilization , that we have learned how in the natural realm to avail ourselves of the divine forces in nature and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Christian development , which we shall have learned when we have learnnd how to enter into spiritual companionship with God , and work in the spiritual realm co-operatively with him . This compacting of fundamental principles of life into brief and pregnant aphorisms gives great crispness of style to the teachings of Jesus . " With what measure ye mete it shall be measured unto you . " " Many that are first shall be last , and the last first . " " Many are called , but few are chosen . " " He that is greatest among you shall be your servant . " The Sabbath was made for man , and not man for the Sabbath . " The teachings of Jesus abound with aphorisms of this description . ' They constitute more than a characteristic of style , they are evidences of profoundness of thought and carefulness of preparation . Such coin as these are not minted without study of form as well as of substance , of expression as well as of truth . It is for the preacher to ponder these aphoristic sentences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contained in them , study the life that is about him , and by his combined study learn how to apply the truths concealed in these aphorisms to the circumstances and conditions of modern life . The methods of Jesus Christ are not as important as the substance of his teaching , and neither is as important as the spirit with which both were imbued . Nor must it be forgotten that his methods are to be studied rather as an inspiration and an encouragment than as a law , and never as a restriction . One may philosophize like Jonathan Edwards , or act like Mr. Beecher , or scintillate like Dr. Talmage , or glow with restrained emotion like Phillips Brooks ; but if he has not the philosophy of the first , nor the oratorical power of the second , nor the sensuous imagination of the third , . nor the cultivated and restrained passion
