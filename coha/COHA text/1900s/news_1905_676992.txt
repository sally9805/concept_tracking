Mr. Reid , in his speech , paid high tribute to Joseph H. Choate , whom he will succeed , and to Gen. Horace Porter , whom Mr. Reid preceded in Paris . The banqueting halls , in which every available seat was occupied , were lavishly decorated with dog-wood blossoms and American Beauty roses . The menu was of special design and etched on Japanesevellum . In the centre was a portrait of the guest of honor , surrounded by lotos flowers , and in the corners were vignettes representing the principal events in the career of Mr. Reid . One of these vignettes showed him as a war correspondent , another showed The Tribune tower . There also was a sketch of the house occupied by Mr. Reid while he was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France , I850 to 1892 . " The remaining sketch showed the Palace of St. James 's with the Inscription " Special Ambassador to the Victoria . Jubilee , 1897 ; Special Ambassador to the Coronation of King Edward VII. , 1902 . " Frank R. Lawrence presided , and with him at the guests ' table , besides Mr. Reid , were Clark Howell of The Atlanta Constitution , Michael H. De Young of The San Francisco Chronicle , Edmund Clarence Stedman . Senator Depew , Seth Low , the Rev. Dr. Ernest M. Stires , Dr. Nicholas Murray Butler , the Rev. Dr. Minot 3 .

Continuing , Mr. Lawrence said : " To-night we hail Whitelaw Reid as the Ambassador of the United States to the Court of St. James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by an American t .. zoad . The relations between the United States and Great Britain are so Important that they cannotabe-oxereas .. tlmated . In a. large sense these two great countries hold in their keeping the peace . the advancement , and the welfare of the civilized world . We may be assured that through no act of our distinguished guest Will that peace or welfare ever be endangered . " The respect in which Americans are held abroad has been greatly enhanced . and the American name has been infi. nitely dignified , by the presence in Lon. don to represent our people there of Mot . ley and Lowell and Phelps and John Hay , not to mention the illustrious Choate , who is now about returning home . The high level which these men have established can only be maintained by send .. i ha ; to succeed them such a mart as Whitelaw Reid . " Mr. Reid received a tremendous ovation when he got up to speak , and throughout his remarks were punctuated with applause . This was accentuated when he spoke on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then he remarked that he was preaching as usuaL ; and trying to reform the tough old world , like his old friends Clark Howell , Charles R. Miller , and ' Gen. Taylor . MR . REID 'S SPEECH . In beginning his speech , Mr. Reid recalled bygone days of the Lotos Club and referred to the many distinguished guests from abroad whom he had helped to welcome . He mentioned Canon Kingsley , James Anthony Froude , and Wilkie Collins . " But why , " he said , " should I prolong these reminiscences ? We could never re , count them all . Matthew Arnold , that rarest Greek in the later English world of letters ; Sir Edwin Arnold and Sir Henry M. Stanley , Edmund Yates and George Augustus Sala , and dear old Tom Hughes , whom you never could learn to call anything but Tom Brown , and Sir ' Henry Irving belong to the earlier days , William S. Gilbert and Sir Arthur Sulli. van came while " Pinafore " and the " Pirates of Penzance " were young . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your guests is - far too long for the briefest recital . " Increasing cares and duties have of late made me a. very unworthy member of the club . I am almost ashamed to recall the fact that the last time I stood before you was to thank you for the welcome you gave me on my return from a post whence my colleagues and myself had brought home peace , with national expansion . " May I add with reference to the new appointment whose duties ? I am now about to undertake that far the most gratifying thing about it is the way it has been received ? We have been living in a strenuous time . No man in this great metropolis and in my place could well escape an active part in the incessant controversies and turmoil of the last third of a century , and my critics , I believe , have generally agreed that I was apt to assume at any rate my full share of them . After such a life to have this appointment made by the President of my country without the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senate without a dissenting voice . and received by the press and the public with such apparently general cordiality , fills me with a sobering sense of responsibility beyond anything *I have ever felt before , and with earnest aspire : . lions that all this generous confidence may prove in the end not to have been wholly misplaced . THANKS THE EDITORS . . ? Let me take the opportunity before this club , so largely made up of members of the press and others of literary . and artistic pursuits , to say further that the thing that has touched me . most of all is the unbroken geed-Will expressed wit% such heartiness and : withOnt , diSfinnflen : Of party by my colleagues try the ' press of the Citx azd ? Eltata at alasg. : Xtarato. among- whom I , have - lived and worked ' and done my share of fighting for more ' than ' a generation . " May-I presume a little on this ? I ' would like to take the liberty of pointing Out that other work may now bring different duties . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me unmindful of the rights and the just claims of the profession I honor most in the world and am the proudest to have served . No man can have spent , ! his life in newspaper work without being led by all his habits and instincts to sympathy with newspaper workers and a readiness to facilitate their efforts . And Yet may I hint to the General Manager of our wonderful Associated Press service , whose wary eyd I see upon me , - and I to others , in less responsible places , who may have chanced to think of the matter hitherto with less scrupulous care than Mr. Stone himself and his repre-1 sentatives ? in the great capitals always I show , that there-may , in fact , there must come a time when it will be my duty to report first and exclusively to the Government instead of reporting to the news-papers ! " It is perfectly true that an open course is the best : that a free people wish to know from day to day what is being done in their name and by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secrecy and does not like to make mystery of its movements and its policy . " But the Japanese have been showing . on a great scale , that there is a duty in war which under any sagacious government must come before the duty of furnishing bulletins for the daily press . Diplomacy , if it is to be sagacious or successful , even the diplomacy of a republic , must be somewhat in the same class . Neither can always be advantageouslyconducted coram publico . " There is another phase of our newspaper activities that merits more serious consideration from all of us than we generally give it . The free press largely rules a free country . It may make peace or war ; it has done both . But it is quite capable of fomenting very grave difficulties which it never desired or intended or even thought of . In our great distances and isolation between two oceans , and general feeling cf remoteness and elbow-room and independence , it has sometimes been apt in moments of excitement to measure its words as little in dealing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town constable or the Board of Aldermen . Is it not time for . the press , when it exercises the power , to recognize also the obligations of rule ? consideration , moderation , and a scrupulous regard both for the rights and the susceptibilities of others ? COMMENT ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS . " We have ourselves resented at times with unwonted asperity the slightest foreign interference in our own domestic discussions . More than once those of us of maturer years have seen this country lashed into a fury almost beligerent merely by the critical or carping references in foreign newspapers . It might be ' , kit now , in some quiet hour , to consider the other side and reflect how they may feel over our free-spoken comment on their affairs . Have we not , in fact , taken side , , habitually , and even vehemently , on almost every foreign question that comes to our notice ? " But let us change the subject . Whoever looks back over the earlier records of this city will find that there were two New Yorkers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom you summoned again and again to your table , and whose sparkling ortaory was your constant delight . For many years they have been serving the Republic abroad with conspicuous ability and distinguished success . They will soon be on the ocean homeward bound , and it warms the heart to think of the greeting you will give them , When . then . by all Fame 's banners fanned . Our laureled wanderers come to land . " Meanwhile , Mr. President . and gentlemen . may I hope to see you from time to time in London ? You will know where to find me. and you will not need my assurance that I shall try to make you as welcome as you have made me . The great kindness you extend now , and the confidence you bestow are purely on credit . I shall have deserved it all only if while taking the greatest care for our own interests I can still help maintain in full force that good understanding between ourselves and Great Britain which has grown clearer and stronger at each step of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us every : : ear . and month since our peace with Spain . " E. C. STEDMAN 'S AMBITIONS . Mr. Lawrence then introduced Edmund Clarence Stedman as a former editor of The Tribune and a warm personal friend of Mr. Reid . Mr. Stedman said he expected to be summoned years ago to such an affair as the present one , and caused much laughter when he said that his first expectation was twenty-one years ago , when William Walter Phelps carried off the prize . Fate , he said , fixed matters better than mortals , for she preferred that Mr. Reid should be first Minister , then Special Ambassador , and then , in the ripeness of his years and the height of his powers . go abroad under the happiest circumstances . Mr. Stedman drew a graphic picture of his life as war correspondent in 1861 , and thereafter with Mr. Reid , Dean Howells , and John Hay . " When I think of the work we did at that time for $20 or S:30 a week . with S30 for expenses and an allowance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war correspondents at large salaries and with military escorts make me tired , " said Mr. Stedman . Mr. Stedman said he remembered when Mr. Reid at a dinner of millionaires in his house introduced him as " an amateur socialist . " ' and Dean Howells as " a parlor anarchist . " In conclusion he said , turning to the guest of the evening : " Go to your new post of honor , and God bless you . You have not arrived at ' the summit of your ambitions . and whatever they may be they will net be stayed . I would just like to be at the gates of heaven if Peter attempted to put any obstacle in the way of your entering when you-applied for admission . " SenatorDenee- was the next speaker . Speaking of the Diplomatic and Consular Service of this country as compared with others , he said : " Nothing more marks the difference between the United States and these older countries than our methods of diplomatic appointments . We have no trained diplomacy , and never had . We have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this service and in the minor positions of diplomacy throughout the world , we have suffered loss and mortification . Bishop Potter has said that in his voyage around the world he found in the East our Consular.and diplomatic representatives could , converse only on the inadequacy of their salary to meet their expenses , while they knew-nothing of the people or the country among whom they lived . " But he said this want was supplied by an American official who was equal to all requirements of the Consular and DiplomaticService. who possessed and could intelligently give his traveling countrymen : the information of the people , their habits , the country , its commerce , its places of interest , and its history . This weleinformed and enterprising American is invariably the representative of the Standard Oil Company . Though a Bishop of the Church . and notwithstanding the recent outcry against Standard Oil money for religious and missionary purposes , the Bishop accented with gratitude this taint . ed information . " When we come , however . to the higher walks of diplomacy , to our representatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the versatility of Americans and their experience have given us great diplomats without a school of diplomacy . " Addresses were made also by Seth Low , Da . Nicholas Murray Butler , William H. , and Clark Howell . Union League to Say Good-bye to Reid . One of the last of the farewell banquets tendered to Whitelaw Reid before his departure for the Court of St. James 's will be given at the Union League Club by a number of his warmest personal friends in the organization on the evening of Wednesday , May 24 . The gathering will be one of the most representative of professional , social , and financial circles ever held in the clubhouse.
