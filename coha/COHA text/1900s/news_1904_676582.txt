" The Equitable was prepared , and wag indeed willing to make a reasonable fixed deposit as an evidence of good faith , but was not willing to agree to invest and deposit the full reserves on the business for the special protection of policy holders in Japan , because we are not in favor of scattering the society 's assets in different parts of the world , it being in our judgment more advantageous and profitable for the policy holders of the society as a body to concentrate the custody of the assets of the society in one place as much as possible , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preference to policy holders elsewhere , as the entire assets of the society form the security and protection for all policy holders . The Equitable has therefore ceased new business in Japan , but will , of course , administer its out . standing busineso and , as always , live thoroughly up to its obligations to its poi , icy holders .
