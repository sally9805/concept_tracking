txt Ex-Superintendent of Police Thomas F. Byrnes spent more than two hours before the Committee of Nine at the City Club last evening outlining some radical plans of reform . He proposed the placing of the appointment of a Police Commissioner for this city in the hands of the Governor and State Senate . in his opinion the Police Commissioner should have a term of office of at least ten years . He would have the Commissioner removable only for malfeasance in office or neglect of duty . He favored absolute power of dismissal of subordinates on charges . On emerging from the committee room ex-Superintendent Byrnes said the committee had tried to place upon him the seal of secrecy in regard to his recommendations . but that he had declined to talk unless he could reserve for himself the right of letting the public know through the press what suggestions he had made . It is understood that the committee was much impressed and asked him to come before them again , which he promised to do . Mr. Byrnes said : " I told the committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public interest , and that I reserved to myself the right to talk if I chose . I was opposed to star chamber proceedings . I was told that that would be all right . " I recommended a single head for the Police Department  --  a Commissioner appointed by the Governor and confirmed by the Senate . He should be vested with absolute power of dismissal of all his subordinates on charges . He should hold office for ten years or during good behavior , and should be removable only upon charges for malfeasance or dereliction , tried by the Appellate Division . " PROVIDES FOR FIVE DEPUTIES . Mr. Byrnes recommended four or five deputies to be appointed by the Commissioner from within or without the department . The First Deputy should be the executive head of the department , from whom all orders should emanate . The Second Deputy should be in charge of the detective force of the entire city . The Third Deputy should be located in Brooklyn and have charge of that borough , with outlying districts . The Fourth Deputy should be the head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers of the uniformed force . A Fifth Deputy should be appointed by the Commissioner , if necessary in his judgment , to perform such duties as the Commissioner might deem proper to assign to him . Regarding the trial Commissioner Mr. Byrnes told the committee that he might be selected from outside the department , but should have police powers vested in him by law from the moment of appointment and be subject ; to removal just as a patrolman . His findings , except in cases of dismissal from the force , should be final . " Instead of holding all police trials at Police Headquarters , he should make a circuit of the five boroughs every week , so as to obviate the necessity of taking ' a large number of men away from their duties fur extended periods , " I believe it e  --  ential that the police force should be removed entirely from local influences . If this were done we would have a better character of men at the head . In some respects the old socalled metropolitan ' system was better . Under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approved by the Senate . I think we had better men on the New York police force then than now . POWER ENOUGH NOW , HE SAYS . " I believe the Police Commissioner today has all the power he should have , if he only knew how to utilize it . His power to create and destroy is ample , even considering that he is the head of an artily of over 7,000 men , and that the most rigid discipline is necessary . " " Do you believe that Commissioner Me . Adoo is not using his power properly ? " ex-Superintendent Byrnes was asked . " I am not saying that . I am not criticising anybody , and nothing of what I am saying should be taken as personal . But I believe that during the old bipartisan system discipline was tenfold better than it has ever since been . They had a uniformed Chief then who was familiar with the personnel of the department . Now there 's nobody but the Commissioner , and he acts the part of Superintendent and everything else , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the force . " If a competent man was placed at the head of the force , the character of the whole department as far as discipline is concerned would improve 100 per cent . in twenty-four hours . I have a man in mind now who could reorganize the whole force in twenty days if appointed Chief of Police . " There is plenty of detective material on the uniformed force if they only knew how to utilize it . Simplicity and less red tape are among the chief requisites of the bureau . TELLS HOW TO CLOSE SALOONS . " Then you need a good strong man at the head of the force  --  a man who is on the level with himself , and then he will be on the level with everybody else . Not the kind of a man who will stand behind a desk and give hell to subordinates who would know that he is not as good a man as trey . " I told the Committee of Nine that the excise situation was not up to the patrolmen . If they make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by their superiors the excise cast ' would never get tired , but they would Vat/ themselves transferred to the goats J ! l a week or two . There are men in New 11. *. k who could stop excise violations in a minute if they had a mind to , but they are not members of the uniformed force . "
