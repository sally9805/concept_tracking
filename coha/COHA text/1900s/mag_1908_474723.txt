IN the city of Nantes the morning of November 7 , 1832 , was a cold one . The two soldiers on guard in the attic room of the house of Pauline and Marie-Louise du Guiny , being chilled after their long night 's vigil , decided to make a fire . When they did so , the last hope that the line of Capet , Valois , and Bourbon would ever reign again in Franco disappeared . It was the end of the end . The cause , which had never been a sure one since Louis XVI . and Marie Antoinette laid their hear 's upon the block , was now beyond salvation . The soldiers ' names were Hocher and LavoIlee . For one half hour they emerge out of the obscurity in. which they were born and died , to become pivots in the revolution of great historical events . From behind the bIaze they kindled there issued the forlornest little figure in Europe ? her hair dishevelled , her hands blistered , and her brown woollen gown hanging in burnt rags about her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ title of Regent of France ? it was Marie Caroline Ferdinande Louise commonly called Madame ? widow of the Due de Berry ; mother of the Comte de Chambord ; daughter of Francis I. , King of the Two Sicilies ; daughter-in-law of Charles X. , King of France ; sister of Maria Christina , Queen of Spain ; cousin of Francis II. , Emperor of Austria ; cousin of Marie Louise , Napoleon 's second wife ; niece of Louis Philippe and Marie Am &; lie ; grandniece of Louis XVI . and Marie Antoinette , and the last of her race to raise the white flag with the golden lilies , which , for so many centuries , had been the foremost banner in the world . A lost cause quickly forfeits its hold on human attention ; and yet there was a year when the Duchesse de Berry threw over international politics the most potent of all spells ? that of a great mystery . From April 23 , 1832 , to November 7 , of the same year , she vanished from public sight as completely as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was excitement in every court , and uneasiness in every cabinet , from London to Vienna , and from Moscow to Madrid . Her disappearance might mean anything , from a frivolous escapade to a European war . She had been last seen in Italy , on the road to Florence . Since then neither her brother , the King of Naples , nor her sister , the Queen of Spain , nor any sovereign , or ambassador , or journalist , or spy , had been able to trace her footsteps . The story of those seven months is worth recalling from time to time , as one of the most romantic and futile bits of daring to be found in history . The restoration of the House of Bourbon to the throne of France , undertaken by the Allied Powers in 1515 , may now be considered as a mistaken effort to put back the clock of Time . The line of Henry IV . and Louis XIV . was not more likely than that of the Cassars to produce a race of constitutional kings . The two brothers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Charter granted by Louis XVIII . was no more , in his opinion , than a concession to a foolish , noisy populace . For the unrest of France at the end of the second decade of the nineteenth century , Charles X. could find no better remedy than the suspension of the Constitution and the abolition of the liberty of the press . The Ordinances to that effect were published on July 26 , 1830 . Five days later the King was retreating before enraged Paris in arms . On July 31 he fled from Saint-Cloud to the Grand Trianon . A few hours later he retired to Ramhoniffet . On August 1 he withdrew the Ordinances . On August 2 he abdicated in favor of his ten-year-old grandson , the Comte de Chambord . These measures came too late to save the crown , for Louis Philippe was already King in everything but name . On August 16 Charles X. , with his family and suite , embarked at Cherbourg on two American ships , the Great Britain and the Charles Carroll , to go permanently into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ William IV. , he was installed at Holyrood Palace , Edinburgh Never was a great revolution effected so rapidly , so easily , with so little effort on one side , and so faint a resistance on the other . Charles X. was literally frightened to his downfall . It was said that , throughout the eventful three weeks , there had been only one man in the Bourbon house ? the Do-cheese de Berry . She was in truth the one element of life in a family which seemed to feel itself foredoomed . Charles X. declared that he had but the choice between mounting a horse and mounting the tumbrel , like his brother . His elder son , the Due d'Angoill ' one , uncouth , ungainly , and unpopular , consented to be passed over in the Act of Abdication , regretting , as he went into exile , nothing but his dogs . The Duchesse d'Angoul ? me , daughter of Louis XVI . and Marie Antoinette , the most pathetic figure in the history of the nineteenth century , with all her memories of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to expect any other portion . The Duchesse de Berry alone ? young , active , popular , buoyant , and high-spirited ? rebelled , with all the fire of her Southern temperament , against the fatalistic resignation by which the hereditary throne was abandoned , and the cause of her son sacrificed . From the beginning of the troubles she had been " the one man in the family . " Before the retreat from SaintCloud she implored the King to let her ride into Paris and show herself at the head of the troops . On the day of the Abdication it required all the authority the old monarch had retained to keep her from fleeing to the Chamber of Deputies with her son , and throwing herself and him on the loyalty of the House . " What would have happened if I had done it ? " she asked of one of the commissioners appointed by Louis Philippe to convoy the fallen royal family towards exile . " In that case , Madame , " he answered , " we should probably not have been here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of France , was not allayed by this reply , and still less her eagerness to return . To return , as Regent of France , with her son secure on the throne , was already her determination , before the Great Britain had left the port of Cherbourg . In grim old Holyrood two influences reached her , which made such an event seem more than possible . They were those of Walter Scott and of the French Royalists . The former , with his tales of fair ladies in soldiers ' camps , gave to recklessness the saving touch of poetry ; while the latter , with their prayers that she come back , and take the place held in other centuries by Blanche of Castille and Anne of Austria , made daring seem a duty . In the spring of 1832 the Princess was given to understand that all was ready . Nothing was needed now , but her presence , as an . inspiring angel , to rouse the chivalry and loyalty of France . Madame was as eager to be in the midst of danger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . In spite of the fact that she was exiled by law , and surrounded by a veritable army of spies , she managed to land on the coast of Provence in the early morning of April 28 , 1832 . It was expected that the South and West would rise as one man , to be followed by the army and the rest of France . Madame , disguised as a sailor lad , made her way to a cabin hidden in a lonely wood . Here she was to wait , till the first important victory called her forth . Anxious and excited , but in no wise afraid , she passed the 29th . It was the afternoon of the 30th when news reached her . The Revolution had begun . in Marseilles that morning at eight o'clock , and was all over by noon ! The white flag had floated from one solitary steeple . One man had been arrested . That was all . It would have been comic , if it had not been pitiable . The only advice to give Madame was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the intrepid young lady would not do . If the South had failed , La Vendee and Brittany were sure . She would show to the faint-hearted and the easily dismayed what it was to come from a race of kings and soldiers . The doings of the month that followed would be worthy to rank among the heroic annals of the world , if one could eliminate from the story its elements of folly . It contains all the force of courage and danger , all the fascination of chivalry and honor , all the romance of picturesque disguises , thrilling adventures , hairbreadth escapes , devotion , self-sacrifice , and death ; and yet the effect never rises above that of an anticlimax to 1793 . We must pass briefly over the events which took place in May , in order to hasten to the moment when Destiny availed itself of the odd instrumentality of Hocher and Lavollee . Leaving the cabin in the wood during the night of April 30 , Madame , still disguised as a sailor lad , and accompanied by five male companions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a chance cart , to the house of a friend . The journey took nearly forty hours , and she slept in the open . At this house she resumed the dress of a lady , and went on by post chaise . Travelling night and day , she passed Nimes , Montpellier , and Toulouse , arriving on May 4 at another friendly ch ? teau . As she pushed further inland and northward the risks increased . The country was sown with soldiers . detectives , and spies , all on the watch for her . For nearly a fortnight she remained in the shelter she had found on May 4 . Here she issued orders to her adherents to take up arms on the 24th , signing her name , bravely , " Marie Caroline , Regent of France . " On the 16th , she pushed on to another ch ? teau , where she disguised herself as a peasant boy , and continued her journey on foot . The government was , by this time , thoroughly alarmed . There was scarcely a road , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West , which was not patrolled by its sentries ; and still Madame went on . Beating her way through woods , fording rivers , eating with peasants , sleeping in lonely huts , sometimes with a companion or two , often with no one but a guide , Madame reached at last the heart of loyal La Vendee . Here , at the supreme moment , she was confronted by divided counsels . Of the great Royalist chiefs , some were for an immediate rising , some for indefinite postponement , and some for a recourse to arms , not on May 24 , as had been commanded , but on the 1st of June . The last , and , as it proved , most disastrous , course was adopted . New orders were issued by the " Regent " to that effect . They were too late , however , to reach the districts remote from the centre of command , and the result was confusion . Some raised the white flag and proclaimed King Henry V. on May 24 ; others waited till June 1 . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detail , and what was planned as a revolution ended as a series of riots . In spite of a resistance such as only fanatics can make , noblemen and peasantry alike were hunted and shot down , till it seemed as if half the farm houses in La Vendee were turned into shambles . There was one combat ? that of Le Chene. on June 6 ? which might almost have been called a battle , and then all was over . Of Madame 's followers many were dead , many were prisoners , and the rest were in hiding . It remained only for her to find a refuge for herself . It was characteristic of her that she did this in the boldest and most open way , walking straight into the teeth of the enemy . The city of Nantes , the ancient capital of Brittany , was the headquarters of her foes . It was , moreover , the only city in the West whose populace had little sympathy with herself . Here , then , she decided to seek shelter , as being the spot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disaster of June 6 reached her at the village of HauteMenantie . At daylight on the morning of June 7 , dressed as a market girl , she set out on foot for Nantes . Mademoiselle de Kersabiec , the companion of her more recent wanderings , donned the same attire , while two real peasant girls of the countryside completed the little party . Trudging barefooted over the hot highway , walking in the dustiest places so as to conceal the whiteness of her feet , the " Regent of France " passed the octroi with her basket , under the eyes of both military and civil inspectors , and entered the town . Twice she stopped : once to help an old woman with her load , and once to read the decree putting La Vendee under martial law , with which the walls were placarded . In the end she found shelter in the house of Pauline and Marie-Louise du Guinytwo Royalist ladies , who , being young at that time , lived right down into our own day . This house was chosen for the reason that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it contained a peculiarly built hiding place . It had been constructed in 1789 , at the beginning of the French Revolution , and had often done good service for the hunted victims of the Terror . The back of the fireplace of an attic room , though seemingly fixed , was , in reality , movable by a spring , giving access to what was little more than a . hole , in which four persons could stand , one behind the other . As the rout sloped upwards from the entrance , it was necessary that the tallest person should enter first , and the shortest last . ThiS fact had an important bearing on what happened in the end . In the course of a few days the house of the two ladies du Guiny contained just four refugees . These were , in addition to Madame herself , Mademoiselle de Kersabiec , the Comte de Mesnard , and Monsieur Aehille Guibourg . The two latter , being among those most dangerously compromised in the rising , would , if captured , probably pay the penalty of death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room enough , and seemed to offer the last of those happy chances which , amid so many disasters , had favored Madame hitherto . From the early part of June to November 7 , the Duchesse de Berry , with her three proscribed companions , lay hidden in the modest house , still to be seen as No. 3 rue Haute-du-Chateau , Nantes . Though she conducted her affairs with startling boldness , not once was her retreat suspected . She received her friends , she issued manifestoes , she wrote to foreign courts , she maintained an active correspondence with all royalist France ; she even forwarded a letter , written with her own hand , to her aunt , Queen Marie Antelie , at the Tuileries . " I wish you happiness , madame , " this curious letter ended , " for I have too good an opinion of you to think that you have found it in your present situation . " Louis Philippe was frantic to find the writer of the lines ; the government redoubled its efforts in the search ; huge sums were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the scent . All the European courts joined discreetly in the hunt , either out of interest or anxiety . The hue and cry was such that Madame was advised to slip away by sea , and to begin her work all over again , from some safe place in Italy . At last , as summer passed and autumn waned , and the hope of any further movement of the Royalists waned with it , Madame consented to depart . Plans were made , and November 14 was fixed as the date of taking ship . It is probable that she would have effected her escape , with the same success that attended all her secret and more personal designs , had it not been that in her little band there was a Judas . In the early part of October , 1832 , Monsieur Thiers , Minister of the Interior under Louis Philippe , and forty years later President of the French Republic , received a mysterious , unsigned letter . It stated that the writer had information of great importance to the government , and begged the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a certain date , at the Rend Point of the Champs Ely-saes . The spot is not too safe at midnight even at the present day , and was still less so in 1831 Thiers , moved by curiosity , was punctual at the rendezvous , but had taken care to have assistance within call . No one appeared . A second letter reproached Thiers with not having come alone , and appointed another meeting . To this Thiers , with pistols in his pocket , went seemingly unattended . The information given by the personage who then revealed himself was to the effect that he was sufficiently sure of the presence of the Duehesse de Berry at Nantes to be able to find the very house in which she lived , if he were assured of the help of the authorities of that town . Thiers was not slow to give the pledge , with a promise of Ave hundred thousand francs for the capture . Thus it happened that , about the middle of October , a stranger appeared in Nantes , at the Convent of the Visitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ransacked by the authorities front top to bottom , in hope of discovering the Duchess . The young man , who was pleasing in address and regular at mass , informed the Mother Superior that , he brought important news for Madame . After long hesitation , the nun described him to the Princess . Madame recognized him as a friend who had served her faithfully during the previous year . He had been introduced to her by Pope Gregory XVI . himself , and had fulfilled missions for her in Spain and Portugal . In spite of the misgivings of those about her , she decided to receive the man , if he were truly , as she supposed , Hyacinthe de Gonzague . The test of that fact was easy . To the messenger she sent to fetch him she gave the half of a card , cut in a peculiar manner . The true Hyacinthe de Gonzague would have the corresponding part . He had it . Henceforth there was no more question . On the last evening of October he was conducted to the hate . du @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only within recent years that the true history of this individual has come to light . The son of a German Jewish rabbi , he was born at Cologne , but early domiciled in France . His real name was Deutz . Becoming a convert to Christianity in 1828 , he gained the favor of the Archbishop of Paris , by whom he was sent to study in Rome , with a special introduction to Cardinal Capellari , afterwards Pope Gregory XVI . The conduct of Deutz in Rome was so exemplary that , in 1830 , he was entrusted , by the College of the Propaganda , with a mission to the United States . This he carried out with so much zeal that the Pope was interested to present him to Madame , who was looking for trusty men to aid her in her great affairs . It is improbable that he would have betrayed her if the price set upon her head had not been put so high . His reception by Madame almost gave Deutz the information he was in search of ? and yet not quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea that she had come to that house to see him , but that she actually inhabited another . She had worn a bonnet and shawl in receiving him , and , at the end of the interview , she seemed to leave by the front door . A second meeting produced no more than the certainty that she lived either in that house or in one near by . There came a moment when this hesitation might have saved Madame , had not Flocher and LavolIee felt cold . At half past five on the afternoon of November 6 , Madame was about to dine . It was her fete day , and the demoiselles du Guiny had prepared a modest feast . Four of the guests , however , were destined not to partake of it ; for , at the very moment of going to table , Guibourg raised the cry , " Fly , Madame 1 the house is being surrounded by troops . " There was an immediate rush for the attic room with the hiding place . Mesnard , the tallest , entered first ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Madame , the shortest , last . Madame was , therefore , nearest the plaque which closed the fireplace . In a very few minutes all was still . Soon the expected loud knocking resounds on the street door , and soldiers enter . There is a tramp of many feet , while every room in the house is occupied . The ladies du Guiny maintain their self-control , and , looking from the window , see that not only their own house is surrounded , but every house in the street . No one is allowed to leave or enter . There is to be no corner of any dwelling left unvisited . Packed one against another , in darkness , and without air , the four proscribed persons listen to the cries , the oaths , the laughter , of those to whom the search is but a man-hunt . It is not long before they are in the attic room itself . Nearer and nearer the soldiers approach to the chimney , crashing and smashing as they come . Around the prisoners the loosely built walls are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soldiers and workmen are drunk with excitement and enraged at their lack of success . " When we find them now , we shall hack them in pieces , " is the threat quite plainly heard . " If they come nearer , we must yield , " Mesnard whispers to his companions . " If they make the slightest opening they will fire in on us . ' ' They do come nearer , striking the chimney itself . Madame is on the point of calling out , when , lo ! everything stops suddenly . To their unspeakable relief the captives hear the order given to cease work for the night . There was now a hope of getting out of the stifling cage , if it were only to rush back again . It was a hope of short duration ; fur it was soon evident that , though the main body of the troops withdrew , the attic room was not left empty . Hocher and f.avoll6e , now grumbling , now swearing , now joking , ate their supper , and made themselves comfortable for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the long , long hours of extreme discomfort , which were worse than the moments of thrilling danger . Hunger , thirst , cold , weariness , and asphyxiation afflicted them by turns , A word , a motion , a sound , a breath might be sufficient to betray them . The night was interminable in dragging itself away , and yet before dawn the soldiery was at work again . From the neighboring houses came the renewed uproar of destruction . In the house of the demoiselles du Gluiny the smashing was confined to the lower floors . It seemed as if , owing to the uncertainty regarding Madame 's abode , the atticroom might now be left alone . With this new hope , however , there came a new danger . The night was bitterly cold . Hoeher and Lavollee , chilled by sleep and inactivity , kindled the historic fire . To the four shivering prisoners the warmth was at first agreeable , but it soon passed beyond that stage . Madame , pressed closely against the iron back of the fireplace , felt her gown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hands , bearing the pain in silence . Again and again she did the same . It was impossible for the others to recede , or to allow her an inch more of space . The suffering grew intolerable . Once more they were on the point of surrender , when it was perceived that the fire , left untended , was beginning to die down . Again there ensued a brief respite . Sixteen hours had gone by , when , from the sounds within the house , the cap-tires guessed that it must be fully day Roused by the pounding of blows and the crashing of Limbers , Hocher and Lavollee , who had once more fallen asleep , awoke . Again they were conscious of the cold , while they remarked to one another that the fire was nearly out . It was the work of a second to renew it , adding fuel sufficient to make it burn more briskly than before . Madame was soon on fire again . Her poor hands and arms , blistered with the efforts of a few hours ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irun was red hot against her breast , and the pain , beyond all endurance , left her no more choice , that her courage failed her ; and she cried out . " Who is there 1 " came the immediate response from the men on guard . " We surrender , " cried Madame . Hastily the fire was raked away ; some one kicked down the plaque ; and , from behind the still smoking ashes , there stepped forth the most foolish and most heroic little woman of her generation . Hocher and Lavollee fell back , astonished and agape . Their expression of surprise was so blank that Madame could not forbear to smile . None the less , they had done the work for which destiny had chosen them ; they had wrought the end of the end of the longest and most splendid epoch in the history of the modern world ; and the white flag with the golden lilies was hauled down for ever .                   @ @
