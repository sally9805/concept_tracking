Ox a beautiful May day in 1774 the long reign of Louis XV was ended . Ancestors of his ? like Charles IX and Louis XIV ? had dealt more evident and direct blows at the well-being of France , but never since the foundation of the monarchy had any sovereign so debauched the whole national life ; and not only France , but the world at large , began to take account of the legacies he had left . First of these were his character and example , the worst since the most degraded of the Caesars ; next was his court , unmoral and immoral , from which corruption had long welled forth over and through the nation . In civil matters , there had prevailed the rule of the worst ; in military matters , defeat and dishonor ; in finance , constantly recurring deficits and an ever-nearing prospect of bankruptcy ; among the higher clergy , luxury and intolerance ; among the nobility , the sway of cynics and intriguers ; among the middle classes , unreasoning selfishness ; among the lower classes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of injustice , and a rapidly increasing hatred for those who had so long oppressed them . Imbedded in this enormous legacy of corruption , misrule , misery , and hate , were two sayings with which the late king and his most intimate adviser had been wont to repel pleas for reform , ? " This will last as long as I shall , " and " After me the deluge . " ' The deluge had come : a flood of resentments for old wrongs , of hatred for wrong-doers , of new thought boding evil to all that was established , of sentimentalism likely to become cruelty . ' To withstand this deluge had come Louis XVI , twenty years of age , kindly at heart , hating the old order of things , longing for something better , but weak , awkward , mistrusting himself and all about him ; and , at his side , ? destined to be more fatal to him and to France than all else , ? hisbeautif ul queen , Dade Antoinette , sometimes kindly , sometimes selfish , but always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , save against those who sought to shield her husband and herself from the approaching catastrophe , First of all there must be a prime minister . Reflecting upon this fact , and calling in the advice of those whom he thought his friends , Louis named ' Ilanrepas , ? a decayed fop , seventy-three years of age , whose life had been mainly devoted to cultivating useful acquaintances and scattering witticisms among courtiers , but who , on account of quarrels with some of the women about Louis XV , had several years before been banished to his country seat . Maureras promptly reappeared , and to him was entrusted the duty of selecting a new ministry . Ile would doubtless have preferred to call men of his own sort ; but , being shrewd enough to see that this was hardly possible , he began gradually replacing the old ministers with better . In this he had a s : stem :  - -  the selection of men who could make a reputation likely to give him pop-ularit V. but who were without any ambitions which might endanger him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elie story of his success in the intendancy of Limoges had spread far . Even amidst all the scoundrelism of the time there was a deep respect for his character . and an admiration for his services . Vet Ilaurepas , thinking it perhaps not best to trust him very far at first , made lint simply Minister of Naval Affairs , and this office Turgot held for just five weeks and three days . Even during this : the he showed his good qualities , by casting out various evils and suggesting many reforms ; but Maurepas , feeling it necessary to yield to the universal hatred against the Abbe Terray , ? everywhere recognized as a main centre of evil under the late king , ? removed him from the great oilier of Comptroller-General , ? at that I ime t he most important position un der the monarchy , ? and in his place set Turgot . This nomination gave universal satisfaction , and most of all to the new king . Ile received the new Comptroller with open arms ; and during their first interview ' Argot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase of taxation , no new debts ; economy and retrenchment . " At this the king was overjoyed , gave his heart to Turgot , and pledged his honor to support him . That this confidence was well placed was shown by Turgot 's first budget ; it was made with such genius that it ended the deficit , extinguished a great mass of debt , and set the nation on the road to prosperity . This practical financial policy was but part of a plan far deeper and wider . Turgot clearly saw that the old system was outworn , that its natural result must be a catastrophe , that in place of it must be developed a system to meet the needs of the new time , that whatever was to be done must be done promptly and thoroughly , and that the only question was , whether this new system should come by evolution or by revolution . Like heavy drops of rain before a shower came various suppressions of old abuses , including the monstrous draft d'aubnine , dismissals of incapables , abolitions of sinecures , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and freedom of the press in matters pertaining to financial and general administration . Everything began to tend away from the old rule of secrecy , in which all noxious growths flourished , and toward the throwing open of public business to the light of public opinion . All these things were contrary to the genius of Maurepas , and he gave as little help as possible ; but during the following year he strengthened Turgot by the appointment of a true statesman as Minister of the King 's Household . This statesman was Malesherbes , a man holding high judicial position , ? neither ambitious nor especially hopeful , but of great capacity and of noble character . His new office was of vast importance , for its occupant had large control of the court , of ecclesiastical affairs , Catholic and Protestant , of the city of Paris , and of various districts and institutions throughout the kingdom . Observing Turgot 's preliminary reforms and the appointment of Malesherbes , good men and true throughout the realm took heart . The king , Turgot , and Malesherbes stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encouraged by this success , gradually added other ministers ; some , like Vergennes , strengthening the effort toward a better era ; others , like Saint-Germain , holding back or going astray . ' Meanwhile came two things of ill omen . First was the recall of the Parliament of Paris , which had been suspended in 1771 , and which had been superseded . ' The Statesmanship 01 T urge ( as we have seen , by a new royal court . The parasites of the banished Parliament besought Louis to restore it the queen strongly seconded these efforts ; Maurepas , with the great mass of time-servers , took the same side ; and the mob liu for it . Opposing the recall of this old , selfish , tyrannical body were Turgot , Malesherbes , Vergennes , ? Minister of Foreign Affairs ,  - -  and two powers which it surprises its to find in such company , ? first , the king 's next brother , the Comte de Provence , and secondly , the clergy . This position of the Comte de Provence was doubtless due to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the position of the clergy was due to the only good thing in the recent record of the Parliament , namely , its opposition to the French prelates , and especially to the Jesuits , in their attempts to revive religious persecution . ' The second thing of ill omen was the coronation oath . The king must be crowned ; and , costly as this solemnity was , and empty though the treasury was , it seemed best to give the monarch the prestige of the old ceremony , ? the stately journey to Rheims , the largess of all sorts , the coronation by the archbishops and bishops of France in the most splendid of French cathedrals , the anointing with oil from the sacred ampulla brought from heaven by a dove more than a thousand years before , and first used by St. Remy in crowning the founder of the French monarchy . ' forgot had advised a coronation like that of Henry IV , and that of Napoleim afterward , before the high altar of Notre Dame , at Paris . This would have saved millions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of visitors whose e7xpenditures would have enured to the benefit of the country ; and all this , in the fearful condition of French finances , was much . But in Turgot 's mind this financial consideration was of comparatively small account . For , in the coronation oath , the French kings had been made to swear to exterminate all heretics , and thi , oath Turgot ? in the interest of justice , tWIlea and prosperity ? sought to modify . ffut the clergy were too strong for him . Thev insisted that the king must , above ail things , take the old oath , and Louis yielded to them ; yet amid all the pomp of coronation it was observed that , when hi , majesty arrived at the part of the oath which referred to heretics , his words were incoherent and nearly inaudible . Soon Caine a new trial of strength tween Turgot , representing what was best in the new epoch , and the recalled Paris Parliament , adhering to what was worst in the old . We have already seen what the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Its main result had been frequent fatu-ities , but even more evil had been its effects on the king , court , and high finan-ciers . For there had been developed a practice of deriving profit from famine and starvation ; and a leading feature in this was the sale of privileges to escape the protective duties . Out of these had grown an enormous system of monopoly and plunder , ? what , in modern days , would be called a " grain ring , " including not only petty intriguers throughout the nation , but very many of the highest per-sonages . Even King Louis XV had been besmirched by it . This monopoly had power to keep grain cheap in sundry parts of the nation , and there to buy it ; power to keep grain dear in other parts of the nation , and there to sell it . There was no unlimited field for intrigue and greed ; and for the tillage of this field was devel-oped a strong and shrewd monopoly . Efforts were made to expose this ; but to criticise a minister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate of Prevost the Beaumont . He had discov-ered sundry misdoings of the grain mo-nopolists and endeavored to expos " them ; no doubt with a bitterness which led lo exaggeration . As a result he was thrown into prison , where he remained over twen-ty years , until the outbreak of the Revo-lution and the destruction of the Bashi , . set him free . ' Against this whole system tut internal protection of agriculture , and ii , alinst all who profited by it , Turgot firmly . As far back as 1763 and 1764 roval decrees had been put in force abolishing it , but , with his invincible iiindencv toward cheatery , the Abbe Ter-ray . ' Fug ? Cs immediate predecessor in the unptrollership , had suspended these decrees , and the old system with all its evils had again settled down upon France . Now came a new struggle . Turgot in- the king to revive the old decrees giving internal free trade in grain , and , idthough protection of agriculture from foreign grain remained , the whole system of internal protection was abolished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from the grain ring and its satellit ? s . Unfortunately , bad harvests followed the new decree ; during the winter of 1774-75 came scarcity and even famine . and , as a result , bread riots and insurrections in various parts of France , notably beginning at Dijon near the eastern frontier , but steadily drawing near the centre of government , and finally . in April and May , 1775 , appearing in Versailles and in Paris . The result was much pillage of bakers ' shops in the towns . burning of barns in the country , and sinking of cargoes of grain in the rivers , with here and there wholesale plunder and occasional murder . At Versailles , tutor Louis tried to win the mobs by ha-r rigors. but these being unheeded , he thought it best , in the absence of Turgot , In louver arbitrarily the price of bread . Turgot saw in this a beginning of new evils . Clearly , if the king lowered the price of the loaf at Versailles , every other province , every other district , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right to demand a similar favor , and this meant a policy ending in bankruptcy and more helpless famine . Turgot 's policy was really more merciful . As preliminary to all else , he insisted on having full powers from the king , suppressed the insurrection , dispersed the mobs , and two of the leaders in plundering and murdering he hanged on a gibbet forty feet high . It was a healthful act . Weak , sentimental people , whose measures in such crises generally turn out the most cruel which can he devised , lamented this severity ; but the execution of these two malefactor doubtless prevented the deaths of scores , and perhaps hundreds , of innocent persons , which would have been unavoidable had the insurrection been allowed to rage and spread . What sentimental lenity to crime can do in enormously increasing murder we know but too well in the United States ; what manly , prompt , and decisive dealing with crime can do in reducing the number of murders to almost a negligible point We see , to-day , in the administration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Turgot struck boldly at the centre of the whole evil . The Parliament of Paris , in its general hatred of reforms , in its entanglements with monopolists , and in its dislike for Turgot , had done all in its power to thwart his policy by every sort of chicanery and pettifoggery . Thus they delayed the registration of the decree for re6stablishing freedom to the grain trade within the boundaries of France for three months ; but 110W , near the end of the year 1774 , Turgot availed himself of all the resources of French royal power , and forced them to yield . Unfortunately , Ire could not get at his worst enemies . The bread riots had been organized to discourage free trade in grain . Behind the mob were the monopolists ; the whole movement had a regularity which proved that its leaders were accustomed to command ; and in the pockets of insurgents . howling for relief from starvation , were found goodly sums of money . Various clues led back to the Prince de Conti , of royal blood , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not wishing to delay other projects for important reforms , or to increase popular feeling , was obliged to abstain from any attempt at punishing them . At the beginning of the year 1775 , he turned to a new series of great questions , and , most important of all , to a project for reforming the Mille , ? the great land tax , ? one of the abuses which weighed most heavily upon the lower orders of the people . It was the principal tax in the kingdom . The old theory was that the nobility upheld the monarchy with their swords , that the clergy upheld it with their prayers , and that the third estate upheld it with their money . This theory had borne a vast fruitage of injustice . The nobility escaped with such comparatively small taxes as the " capitations " and the twentieths ; " the clergy evaded the heavier burdens by so-called " gifts , " which they themselves voted from time to time ; the monied classes escaped the greater taxes by purchasing , a sort of half-caste nobility , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other burdens . Very many of the less wealthy , who could not attain to enrollment among the nobles , were able to buy privileges which exempted them from much taxation . Sundry privileged towns too , in one way or another , had secured immunities . As a result of all these exemptions , the burdens of the state fell with all the more crushing force upon the class of small peasant proprietors , farmers and laborers , numbering about one fourth of the entire population . They were the poorest inhabitants of France , but on them fell the whole burden of the taille , and to this were added multitudes of feudal and church dues , ? to such an extent that throughout large parts of the country men of this poorest class were taxed more than four fifths of their earnings . Here , too , it may be mentioned that taxes on articles of ordinary consumption fell upon them as heavily as upon the richest in the land , and in some respects even more heavily . The government duties on salt , which made the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the present day , were levied in a war especially cruel , while monopolies and trade regulations raised the price of every article of use . The most competent authorities tell us that the deaths of Frenchmen from famine in 1739-10 had been more numerous than those caused by all the wars of Louis XIV , that eight thousand persons ( lied of misery in one month , in one guar ter of Paris , that peasants died of want within the precincts of Versailles , that some villages were completely deserted , and that multitudes fled across the frontier . The Bishop of Chartres , being asked by the king how his flock fared , answered , " Sire , they eat grass like sheen and starve like flies . " Turgot found that more than half of France was cultivated by peasant farmers who were absolute paupers , and all this within the most fertile , the most healthful , and the best situated state in Europe . Arthur Young tells us that not less than forty million acres of French soil were wholly or nearly waste . Marty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this state of things , but among the causes especially prominent was the tuille , and therefore it was that Turgot , who had endeavored to ease the fearful burden at Limoges , now sought to adjust it fairly throughout France . The main difficulty dated from Louis XIV . A modern economist states it as follows : " Costly campaigns abroad , ruinous extravagance at home , left the kingdom at Iris death in 1715 with a debt of 3,460 millions of francs . . . . His murderous wars , reducing , the birth-rate , increased the mortality , and the expulsion of the Protestants had reduced the population by four millions , or twenty per cent , since 1660 . Agricultural products had fallen off by one third since he ascended the throne . Burdens increased , while they were diminished who bore them . A competent judge computed that nvire than half of the taxes themselves were eaten up by the cost of collection . " this condition of things had been made even worse by the Orleans regency and Louis XV . No less cruel than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ king in council having fixed the amount to be levied every year , an artier was issued naming some individual tare h community as collector , twirl making him personally responsible for the whole amount of the direct taxes in his district . In case this official failed under Iii , burden , the other leading taxpayers in his district were made responsible , ? all for each and each for all . This system Was known as the eontrainte solidaire , and it was substantially the same which done so much , nearly fifteen hundred years before , to dissolve the Roman Rini rites Even more cruel were the " indirect ! ' taxes levied upon all the main articles eon- , timed by the peasantry and collected by the agents of the Farmers General . Remembrances of indignities and extortions by these agents were among the leading incentives to the fearful pillage , destruction , and murder with which the Revolution began fifteen years later.3 I see the admirable little book of Higgs , TI . Phu siorrats .

For excellent short and clear statements regarding the taille , contrainte solitaire , and the " five great , fermes , " ? the latter being the taxes collected by t he Farmers Gen- , To meet these evils , Turgot prepared plans for an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its collection , and this , with a nerd titude of other capital reforms , he elaborated during 1775 , although during the first four months of the year he was confined to his bed by a most painful attack of gout . Ills physical condition did not daunt him : he worked on vigorously despite his suffering , and so far as the world knew he was as valiant in grappling with the enemies who beset him as he had been in the vigor of his early manhood . Steadily pressing on in his policy of breaking a way out of the mass of old abuses and developing a better order of things , Turgot , in January and February of 1776 , took up his most important work for France , ? the preparation of " the six great edicts . " Their main purpose was to loose the cans which were strangling French activities of every sort ; and , of these , two were by far the most important . First , was the edict for the suppression of the royal cm-rte . The character . of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hail learned during his administration at Limoges . As we have seen , the purpose of this burden was the making of the royal roads . and the transportation of military stores . Under the old system the peasantry were liable to be called from their farm work during seed time or harvest and made to give many days of hard and exhausting work to road construction or to military transportation , ? the main result being that the roads were among the worst in the world and the transportation of military stores anything but satisfactory . The cruelty and wastefulness of the system had then and there been remedied by Turgot , and for it he had substituted a moderate tax which , being applied to the roads , under proper engineers , and to transportation , under well guarded contracts , had given in tinit'ely better results , and had relieved the peasantry of these most galling inims . But to this system which succeeded so perfectly in the Limousin , and which ' Fur-got now proposed , by one of the six edicts , to extend throughout France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clergy , and the Parliament of Paris united to oppose it . Their ! nails tugunwnt was that Turgot purposed to degrade the upper classes : that , logically , if government could tax the nobility and the clergy equally with the peasantry for the improvement of the highways of the kingdom , it could tax them equally for any other purpose , and that this would obliterate the essential distinction between nobles and base-born . It is hard , in the France of these days , to understand the elitism of prejudice between the upper and lower classes which existed in those . There had been in French history before TurgoCs time striking exhibitions of this feeling . Significant of much was the protest and complaint solemnly made by the nobility to the king at the States-General of 1614 . They complained that the Third Estate , consisting of representatives of the vast body of the French people , not noble , had in one of their appeals presumed to speak of themselves as the " younger brothers- of the nobility ; and the noble delegates protested against this as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this same feeling are lobe seen throughout the plays of Moliime : in all of them the gentilholitine is everything , the robtrier nothing . ' More extended and hardly less bitter was the opposition to the other great edict , for the suppression of the ' Tummies and Hattrises , ? the corporations which represented the various trades and the wardenships which controlled them . In order to understand this particular complex of abuses which Turgot now endeavored to unravel , it must be remembered that under the old ideas of governmental interference there had grown up in France a system by which the various trades and industries had become close corporations , each having its rights , its laws , its restrictions , its exclusions , its definitions , its hierarchy of officials . No person could exercise such trades without going through a long series of formalities ; no person could nes ' in any of them without buying the right to rise . For some of these features then ; had doubtless once been a valid reason ; but the whole system had finally become one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Between 1666 and 1 083 Colbert had issued one hundred and forty-nine different decrees regarding variants trades ; from 1550 to 1776 , over two hundred and twenty-five years , there W. dragging through the courts and the cabinets of the ministry the great struggle between the tailors and the clothes menders , the Mill question being as to what constitutes a new and what an old coat , ? the tailors being allowed to work only upon new clothing and the menders upon old . From 1578 to 1767 , close upon two hundred years , the shoemakers and cobblers had been in perpetual lawsuits regarding the definition of an old boot , the regulation being in force that shoemakers were allowed to deal only with new boots and cobblers wills old . Similar disputes occurred among the roasters a ti ? I the cooks as to which should have the exclusive right to cook geese , and which to cook smaller fowls ; which the right to cook poultry , and which the right to cook game ; which the right to sell simply cooked meats , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these were endless squabbles between sellers of dry goods , clothiers , and hatters : wonderful were the arguments as to the number or gloves or hats which certain merchants might expose for sale at one time . In cloth snaking and selling there were minute restrictions , carefully enacted , as to the width , length , and color of pieces which ItuglIt. be sold . Workmen of one sort were allotted to do work generally done by ; tire her sort in the same trade , and upon all the trades were levied taxes and exact Pais Which they recovered , as best they might , from each other and from the pub-lic at large . Underlying and permeating all this tangled mass of evil was the idea of pa hatted government , ? the idea that the duty of a good government is to do I he thin king for its subjects in a vast nuissber of antlers and transactions on which I lie individuals concerned would far better think for themselves . As a legitimate consequence of this theory , one regulation required that tailors , grocers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a multitude of others engaged in various branches of business , carefully specified , should belong to the established church . ' This whole system ? a.s crippling trench industry and undermining French character ? Torgot sought to remedy . There was nothing of the Jack Cade spirit in his policy . Ile allowed just compensation in every case , but having done this , he insisted that the trade corporations should be extinguished and all warden-ships abolished , except in four industries : in printing , because the nation was not yet ready for the measures which he would doubtless have elaborated later ; its pharmacy and jewelry , because these trades need govermnental control under all governments , ? individuals being unable to exercise it ; and in the barbers ' and wigmakers ' trade , because , during financial emergencies under previous reigns , so many wardenships , inspectorships , comptrollerships , and minor positions of various sorts in this branch of business had been created and sold to produce revenue that Turgot felt unable to buy them in . Noteworthy is it that when the rights of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indemnity paid was over twenty millions of francs . Of course , ingenious and elaborate arguments were made by strong men in favor of that old system , as they Lace been always made in favor of every other old . system . In our days these arguments have been echoed by Alison . As a representative of English High Toryism he naturally declares against Turgot 's reforms ; and especially striking is the Tory historian 's defense of the old French trade corporations in comparison With the trade unions of Great Britain in the early part of the nineteenth century . lie exhibits the long series of wrongs and plundering , and eVen of unpunished murder , by these modern English organizations of labor , and attempts to present hens as the only alternative to the French organizations under the Bourbons . But this argument , striking as it was when Alison presented it over fifty years ago , has 110W lost its force . ' The main line of contemporary argument against Turgot was that las reforms " impugned the wisdom of our ancestors , " that they swept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they were Rae to destroy the Slifireillaey of French industry . There were long sessions of the Paris Parliament by day and night , with no end of sham patriotic speeches and impassioned debates . Prominent in these was D'EspremCnil , big , handsome , oratorical , adored by his party , ? ready at any moment to make eloquent harangues supporting abuses and denouncing reforms . Little did it occur to bins that his own life and the lives of his friends were at stake and that Turgot was doing his best to save them ; possibly this thought dawned upon lain when , a few years later , lie took his way to the guillotine . Regarding this edict , also , ' Forgot persevered . The Paris Parliament , making a pretense of fairness , did , indeed , register of its own accord one of the minor edicts , while rejecting the others . All in vain : the king , though reluctant and halting , summoned the Parliament to a bed of justice and compelled it to register this and all the . other edicts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with another vast evil . The system of farming the " indirect taxes " of the nation had long been fruitful of corruption among the higher classes and of misery among the lower . In general terms , the system was one in which , the amount of these taxes having been determined , the collection of them was let out to a great combination of contractors , and on terms enormously profitable to them . To secure this monopoly , and to prevent opposition to it , this syndicate kept the hands of the government tied by advancing to it large sums in times of its greatest need ; captured influential personages at court , from ministers and mistresses of the king down to the most contemptible of their parasites , by petty offices , pensions , and gifts ; secured the services or silence of rogues in all parts of the kingdom by threats or bribery . It assumed the character of what in America of these days would be called a " combine , " and at the head of it were the Farmers General , ? wealthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Their power pervaded the entire nation , ? from the king 's apartments at Versailles to the cottages of the lowliest village . Whenever it seas thought best to buy a man , he was bought ; whenever it was thought best to discredit him , he was discredited ; whenever it was thought best to crush him , he was crushed . ' To these men and their methods , Voltaire had made a reference which ran through France , and , indeed , through Europe . A party of Parisians were aunt ; ing each other by telling robber stories . Presently Voltaire , who had been listening quietly , said , " I can tell a robber story better than any of yours . " The whole room immediately became silent and listened to the greatest personage in the French literature of the eighteenth century . Voltaire , after clearing his throat , began as follows : " Once on a time there was a Farmer General . " Then he was silent . Presently all began to cry out : " Why do you stop ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have told the story , " silt Voltaire ; " do you not see that in no statement there is included the greatest robber story in history ? " The French came to understand the Farmers General perfectly , and twenty years later , a class of patriots and reformers , differing from ' l'urgot in their methods , sent all the Farmers General on whom they could lay hands to the guilt. - line . Against that phalanx of injustice ' fur-got stood forth undaunted . Ile could not , indeed , completely rout it , but he checked its worst abuses , cut down its illegal profits , and greatly diminished its power to corrupt the nation . In his own person he set a noble es - ample . For a long time it had been customary for the Farmers General to present to the comptroller an enormous gill whenever the government contract with them was renewed . This had become a well-known institution , and the so-called " gift " to the comptroller was regarded as one of his proper perquisites . In TutgoPs case it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power , very nearly , to the same number of dollars in our own land and time . Turgot utterly refused this gift ; he had determined to enter into his great struggle unhampered . While carrying out these fundamental measures he effected a long series of minor reforms . There was the abuse of the ortroi , under which taxes were collected on the produce of the peasants at the gates of cities . In this there had come various growths of injustice , notably one in levying high taxes on the sorts of products ettestinteil by the poorer inhabitants of tow es , and in levying low taxes on luxuries consumed by the higher classes . At I his he struck an effective blow . In sundry cities and districts , especially at Holten , were special monopolies in the grain trade , and in the business of bakers , which bore heavily upon the poorer ' lasses . These he planned to destroy . Al court and throughout the nation weer myriads of sinecures ; and these he extinguished whenever a chance offered . Throughout the country the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so few statesmen among the Latin governments have seen from that day to this ? the power of lotteries to undermine the financial morality of a pimple ; and he struck effectively at these also . But here it should be especially mentioned that at all times and in all places he was careful to provide compensation to all who had just claims for loss of place or privilege . In this he showed that same wisdom which Great Britain has shown in the history of her reforms . ' Turgot now realized that measures to ameliorate feudalism must come . But he : ale that the time had not yet arrived for developing them beyond what was absolutely necessary in preventing revolution . His main effort in this field was to prepare the public mind for gradual reforms , and therefore it was that , in 1775 , he suggested to Boncerf , whom he knew to have thoroughly studied the subject , the publication of a pamphlet on the evils of feudalism . As a respected officer in one of the highest grades of the financial administration , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in every way fitted to discuss the subject . Nothing could be more fair , just , and moderate than his book . Even its title was studiously mild . Instead of announcing it as an exhibition of the evils or cruelties or wrongs perpetrated by feudalism , he entitled it The Inconveniences of Feudal Rights ( Les Inconcthlients des Droits Rodaus ) . It was neither drastic nor vindictive . It simply defended , as an experiment , the abolition of feudal rights on the domains of the king , not merely as a matter of justice , but as a matter of policy . Hardly had it appeared , in January of 1776 , when the Parliament struck at it venomously . On ' notion of D'Esprilmenil the book was ordered burned by the hangman , and indictments were brought against Boncerf which hung over his head until the Revolution swept them away . It is a curious historical detail that Boncerf , after the Revolution had begun its course , was placed by the Constituent Assembly in a position which aided him in destroying the evils he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sealed up the cabinets which contained the indictments that had been brought against him . Significant also , perhaps , is the further detail that , later in his career , while D'Esprilmenil was brought to the guillotine , Boncerf escaped the Revolutionary jury by a majority of one . ' But it should not be understood that all of Turgot 's efforts were given to removing old abuses . He was no mere destroyer ; he was essentially a builder ; all his reform measures had as their object the clearing of a basis for better institutions . Though the shortness of his ministry ? only twenty-one limn tits ? prevented his putting all of these into definite form . there were several which have since rendered great services to his country . Re vastly bettered the postal system throughout France , not only improving the roads on the plan which hail done so much for the Limousin during his intendancy , but developing on these a service of fast coaches and diligences which greatly reduced the time between the most important points in France , and which became the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also prepared projects for a great network of internal water communications by the improvement of rivers , and the construction of canals ; and to study the problems connected with these , Ire called to his aid the men most eminent in applied science . He sought to create a scientific system of weights and measures to take the place of the chaos of systems which had come down from the Middle Ages . To aid industry he organized a better system of banking , not only in cities , but in rural centres , thus initiating the ideas which have done so much for French prosperity in these days . As to higher education , he virtually created the Academy of Medicine , which since his time has become the most famous and weighty its the world ; and in the College de France he established new professorships of lasv and literature . Best of all , as revealing his depth and breadth of thought , his insight into the character of the French people , his intuition as to their capacities , his foresight of their dangers , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future might be developed , was the Memorial on Muninipalities . Among the many evidencing of his power as a political thinker and statesman , this is the most striking as showing his ability to bring theory to bear on practice . He saw what the most thoughtful men in - France have only just begun clearly to see , ? that the greatest defect in that gifted nation has been its want of practical political education and its consequent centralization of political power . Therefore it was that amid all his pressing occupations in 1775 , he , with his friend Dupont de Nemours , sketched out a plan for the gradual education of the French people , not only in public schools . but in the practical management of public affairs , by a system beginning in local self-government , and ending in a constitutional government of the notion . Beginning at the little village communities , he proposed to establish in each a local council elected by peasants and other small taxpayers , to discuss and decide upon its own local matters , and also to elect delegates to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should them , the counties . The arrondissement councils , thus elected by the village munities , were to discuss and decide arrondissement matters , and to elect deputies to the assemblies of the provinces . The assemblies of the provinces were to discuss and decide provincial matters and to elect representatives to the assembly of the nation . Closely connected with this plan WI1S broad , graded system of public ins ! inelion for children and youth . Could he have been given a free hand in accomplishing this combination , he would have redeemed his promise that ten years of it would make a new France . In all this there was no rashness ; he expressly declared his wish to proceed with the utmost moderation , and that his main desire was to lay foundations . Could he have been allowed freedom to make practical beginning of his work , he would soon have produced an environment in which Bourbon autocracy and Jacobin mob rule would have been equally intpossible ' To a very large body of men ins his time the reforms of Turgot , and especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , seemed madness ; but those who best know France to-day . and who look brick upon her history without prejudice , will , as a rule , find in this twofold plan a proof that Turgot saw further than any other man of his time into the needs of his country . However we may dislike his restriction of the suffrage , mat:ter we may differ from him regarding details , there would seem to be no question that , had his plan been carried 1.01 ' , ' , 11 , I , the French nation would , within a generation , have attained what a century of alternating revolutions and despotisms is only now beginning to give . It should be borne in mind that for over a century and a half before Turgot 1litre had not been a meeting of any body of men representing the French nation , t hat there was not among the French people : my idea of The most ordinary public discussion of political matters , and that the holding of a political meeting in ac-CON lance with the simplest rules of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembered by those who think that Turgot should have given universal suffrage at the outset . Two things more should not be forgotten : first , that the number of peasant proprietors was large and increasing ; and secondly , that he went farther in giving them power than any other man of note in his time ; proposing a beginning from which a more extended suffrage would have been developed naturally and normally . This , too , should be said for his system . Ile clearly saw that ; natters involving taxation in municipalities should be passed upon by the taxpayers themselves , and in this respect he was beyond the point at which our own nation has arrived . No absurdity in modern government is greater than that seen in the American cities , winds permits great bodies of people , very many of - them recently from foreign climes , ignorant of American duties , devoid of American experience , and consciously paying no taxes at all , to confer franchises and to decide on the expenditures of moneys collected from taxpayers . On political questions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universal suffrage . In municipal matters , which are corporation matters , the rule should be that questions involv ing the granting of franchises , and the raising and expenditure of taxes , should be settled by taxpayers . Blindness to this fact has made our municipalities the most corrupt in the civilized world . A proper compromise would seem to be the election of mayor and aldermen by the whole body of tire people , and the election by taxpayers of a " board of control " or " board of finance , " without whose consent no franchise should be granted , and no tax levied . A natural effect of ' ' argot 's reforms was seen in the increasing number of his enemies and their growing bitterness towards him . First of them all was the queen . She persisted in making enormous pecuniary demands for worthless favorites , and in endeavoring to force into the most important places courtiers absolutely unfit . At the very beginning , Turgot had foreseen this , and there still exists the rough draft of a letter to the king , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he had begun a reference to the queen and had then erased itd No less virulent was the king 's brother , the Comte de Provence , ? a prince who made pretensions to wit and literary ability . He had sided with Turgot in opposing the recall of the Paris Parliament , but now there came from his pen attacks on the great minister , ? always contemptuous , and sometimes scurrilous . With the queen and the king 's brother stood the great body of the courtiers . To understand the reasons for their resentment , we have only to look into the " Red Book , " brought to light during the Revolution , and note the enormous sums which all these people drew from the impoverished treasury , and which Turgot endeavored to diminish .2 For the striking out of a reference to the queen , see Lon Say 's Life of Turgot , Anderson 's translation . 2 For an example of the impudent manner in which the Bourbon princes of the blood demanded that money should be ladled out to them from the treasury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Provence , in Levasseur , Ilistoire des Classes 011lirMY 8 , tome s , pp. 617 , Very bitter also were the prelates of the Church . Probably the humble rural clergy , who remembered what Turgot had done for their flocks in the Limousin , felt kindly toward him ; but the hierarchy , with the exception of two or three who bore him personal friendship , never relaxed their efforts to thwart him . At an earlier period it might have been otherwise . Various writings by FtMelon , in which he braved the hostility of Louis XIV , show that his great heart would certainly have beat in unison with that of ' Forgot . Nor is it difficult to believe that Belsunce , the noble archbishop who stood by his people at Marseilles during the plague of 1720-21 , religious persecutor though lie was , would also have sided with Turgot in a clear question between the peasantry and their debased masters . But the spirit of St. Carlo Borromco , of Fs:melon , and of Belsonce had given place to that of a very different class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teachers had been given in their panegyrics at the death of Louis XV , which , perhaps , slid more than all else to undermine their influence . ' The hierarchy was still determined to continue the old persecutions of the Huguenots , their hope being that , by an-milling Huguenot marriages , rendering Huguenot children illegitimate , and reviving the long series of other persecutions initiated in Louis XIV 's time , they might drive those who held the new faith from the kingdom . Most virulent of all , save the queen and bishops , in opposing Tnrgot 's measures , was the Parliament of Paris . In every way it sought to undermine then , To it are due some of the worst met hods of arousing public hate , which later brought the fury of the Revolution upon its /umbers themselves . To all these should be added the great mass of hangers-on of the court , and of people who profited by the general limou end corruption . Typical was the remark of a court lady : " Why these changes We are perfectly comfortable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great reformer more and snore , his only friends seeming to be the pintos. phers and a thinking minority among the people . Pressure and intrigue were steadily brought to bear upon the king , awl such machinations were as cunning as were similar plans to undermine Prince Bismarck in our own time ; but , unlike these , the efforts made against Turgot were not exposed until too late . More than once Louis declared that only he and Turgot cared for the people ; but about a year and a half after Turgol had become Comptroller-General , and the king had pledged to him hearty support , it was clear that this support was rapidly weakening . First came the resignation of Malesherbes . His services in improving the administration had been beyond price , but he at last lost all hope , both for Turgot 's reforms and for his own . Naturally pessimistic , Ise complained that Turgot 's desire for the public good was " not merely a passion , but a craze . " Now came the crucial test of the king . ' 1'lle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office which Malesherbes had held . urged as his successor Amelot de Clugny , a contemptible parasite of no ability , sure to thwart the reforms of Malesherbes and to restore the old order . On this Tut-got wrote letter after letter to the king , pleading most earnestly , not for himself , but for the reforms which had been accomplished tinder Malesherbes and which most be lost if Clogny came into power . But the king made no answer , save a cool and insulting demeanor whenever he met the great minister who was trying to save him , Turgot wrote a letter which has become famous and which still exists , a letter showing entire respect and deep devotion , but solemnly , heroically , with that power of prophecy which was perhaps his most marvelous gift , reminding the king that it was weakness which had brought Charles the First to the scaffold . As a reply to this letter came a dismissal . This was in 1776 . Turgot had held office twenty-one months , and more than tour of these months had been passed mainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best ; but in vain . No man in the whole history of France had labored with more heroism and foresight to save his country . His death took place in 1781 , five years after his retirement , and his life during this period was worthy of him . He never again appeared at court , but gave himself up mainly to scientific work and philosophical pursuits . Only once during that time did he make any appeal to the government , and this took shape in a suggestion that , for the honor of France , Captain Cook , then upon one of his voyages around the world , should be exempt from the disabilities of other Englishmen during the war then raging . To the credit of French chivalry , this advice was taken . No sooner had Turgot laid down his high office than a policy Of extreme reaction set in . His main reforms were joyfully and malignantly undone . Lampoons against him abounded . Queen , court , nobles , and high clergy devoted themselves with renewed vigor to restoring the old abuses . Thenceforward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very different from that proposed by Turgot , dealt with them and with those who had restored them . ' Various arguments have been made against Turgot . First of these is the reactionary charge , that he favored atheism , ? that he brought on the Revolution . Any one who has dispassionately viewed the history of that epoch knows these charges to be monstrously unjust ; that Turgot was not an atheist is shown abundantly by his writings and his conduct ; that he did not bring on revolution is shown by his myriad efforts to produce that environment which alone could prevent revolution . Next comes the flippant and cynical argument , ? one of those epigrams which for a time pass as truths : the charge that in reforming France he dealt as does an anatomist with a corpse , and not as a wise surgeon deals with a living organism . This has been widely repeated , but its falsity is evident to any one who will study Turgot 's work.at Limoges , and the statements to the French people which prefaced his most importantacts as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Richelieu and Sully , it becomes clear that no statesman ever realized more deeply than Turgot the needs of all classes of the people , and the necessity of dealing with them as moderately and gently as possible . Nor is there any evidence of any feeling toward the nobility and clergy save an earnest wish to make the changes , which would have been so beneficial to them , its satisfactory as possible . But some remedy to the evils which were destroying France he most administer , and it must be a real remedy . Within twelve years after his death the whole world saw with horror the results of its rejection . Again , there is the English Highs Tory argument , best stated by Alison . His main charge is that Turgot was a doctrinaire who wished to rebuild France " on strictly philosophic principles " and on no other . So far from Turgot being a doctrinaire , he was perhaps the most shrewd , practical , far-sighted observer of actual conditions in the entire kingdom . Typical were his long journeys through the rural districts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his discussions with the poorest and humblest of peasants who could throw light on the actual conditions of the country . His own reply to the charge that he unduly pressed doctrinaire measures may be found in one of his notes to a hostile keeper of the seals , in 1776 , which runs as follows : " I know as well as any one that it is not always advisable to do even the best thing possible , and that , though we should not tire of correcting little by little the defects of an ancient constitution , the work must go forward slowly , in proportion as public opinion and the course of events resider changes practicable . " Closely connected with this charge is the statement that his insuccess was due to his lack of finesse with the king , lack of suppleness with the queen and princes of the blood , lack of deference for the nobility and clergy . But the fact remains that in such desperate cases applications of rose water and burnings of incense can not be substituted for surgery and cautery . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found in the career of Turgot 's successor , Calonne , ? the great Calonne , who , while evidently believing in the fundamental ideas of Turgot , applied them tactfully , deferentially , and soothingly . He it was who said to the queen , " Madam , if what you ask is possible , it is done ; if impossible , it shall be done . " He petted and soothed king , queen , court , everybody ; delayed every effective operation or remedy , obligingly , ? until all found themselves , past help , in the abyss of revolution. = Still another charge has been made by sundry fanatics of the sort who purpose to bring in extreme democracy by decree rather than by education and praetiec , ? whether in France of the eighteenth century or in the Philippine Islands of the twentieth . They have dwelt upon the statement that he wished " to do everything for the people and nothing by them . " To this it may be answered that the founder of American democracy , Thomas Jefferson , in a letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their incapacity for governing themselves in the eighteenth century , virtually approved the ideas of ' forgot . Those ideas and methods purposed simply to obtain , under the existing constitution of France and through the monarchy as the only practical means , the reforms that were necessary to save the nation from ruin ; but , at the same time , by a wide and thorough system of education and by the steady development of political practice in the French bourgeoisie and peasantry , to initiate the entire nation . gradually , into self-government . Napoleon did , indeed , openly avow and act upon this doctrine imputed to Turgot ; but Napoleon 's purpose was not to uplift the French people into fitness for self-government , but to keep them permanently beneath his throne . The charge of too great haste has also been frequently made against Turgot 's measures , and most powerfully of all by M. Levasseur , Professor of Political Economy and Director at the College de France ; certainly one of the foremost , if not the foremost , authority on all questions relating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of France . While considering Turgot one of the greatest men whom France has produced , he compares him , to his disadvantage , with Richelieu and Colbert . But Richelieu dealt with problems far less complicated than those which fell to the lot of Turgot , and Colbert had twenty . two years in office , under a monarch who stood by him ; while Turgot had less than twenty.stwo months , under a monarch who deserted him . M. Levasseur thinks that Turgot ought to have sur- ominited the numerous obstacles in his pa t " lit tle by little and one by one ; " but the eminent economist seems to lose sight of the fact that the opposition to each and every one of his measures was practically as great as that to all combined , and that time was an element of more essential importance in Turgot 's work than it had been in the work of either of the other two great statesmen . Ear what Turgot 's friends have called the vigor , and what his critics have called the haste , with which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his discussions with friends , a pathetic personal reason , namely , that the Turgots always died in middle life , and that what was to be done he must do at once ; this saying proved to be sadly prophetic . But there was a greater , statesmanlike reason . Turgot ' s prophetic gift showed him that what he offered was the best chance for France and the last chance for the monarchy ; that promptness in decision and vigor in execution had become the only hope ; that reforms , to prevent a wild outburst of revolution , must be made then or never . ' Again , sundry good and true men , like Leonee de Lavergne , point out minor defects in Turgot 's manner and career which they think mistakes , and , as the ( awning mistake qualities , and all make mistakes ; hut the refusal to summon the States ( ieneral would probably be voted by the east majority of thinking men , not a mistake . but an evidence of Turgot 's wisdom and foresight . Eight years after Turgot 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at once into that series of revolutions which has now lasted more than a century . Turgot 's methods were not revolutionary , but evolutionary . He did not believe that a new heaven and a new earth could be brought in by an illiterate mob , whether let loose in a city or throughout a nation . As a historical scholar , he knew that every republic ruled by uneducated masses had ended in despotism . As a practical observer of human affairs , he believed that to have anything like a free government , the first requisite is popular moral and intellectual education , and , as we have seen , his system was shaped toward developing a people who might gradually be fully entrusted with political power . Here again we may cite Thomas Jefferson , whose faith in democracy will hardly be questioned . In those most interesting letters , written toward the end of his life , reviewing events which he had known intimately , he admits that the French were not in his time fit for unlimited democracy . ' Yet another objection is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final letter to the king , alluding to the fate of Charles 1 . The answer to this is simple . That final letter was written when Turgot saw that the end had come , that the king was giving himself into the hands of his enemies , that the only remedy must be heroic . Then it was that , like a great prophet of Israel , he firmly pointed to the past and told the king the truth . Looking across the abyss of revolution which separates the France of to-day from the Bourbon monarchy , the utterance seems divinely inspired . Rightly judged , it presents one of the greatest proofs of Turgot 's fitness for his high mission and of his claim upon universal humanity . And , finally , the objection is made that he failed . As to this , we may simply say that France had come to the parting of the ways . One way seemed hard . It led through reforms soberly planned and steadily developed , over a solid basis of institutions thoughtfully laid and adjusted , hedged in by ideas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education , ? towards constitutional liberty . This was the way plan ned by Turgo t . Theother way seemed easy . But it led first through the stagnant marsh of unreasoning conservatism ; then through dykes broken by unreasoning radicalism ; then , by a wild rush , through declamation and intrigue ; through festivals of fraternity and massacres ; through unlimited paper wealth and bottomless bankruptcy ; through mob rule and GCsarkra ; through sentimentalism and murder ; through atheism and fetichism ; through the Red Terror and the White Terror ; through thnFirst Empire and the Invasion ; through the Second Empire , the Invasion , and the Commune ; through proscription at home , wars of conquest abroad , and enormous indemnities to be paid for them ; through a whole century of revolutions , ? sometimes tragical , sometimes farcical , but always fruitful in new spawn of declaimers and intriguers . At the parting of these two ways stood Turgot , looking far down along them both ; marking with clearness of vision what lay in either path ; seeing and showing what king , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of French citizens realized only when brought to pauperism , prison , exile , and the guillotine . He wrought and strove like a Titan to mark out the better path , to fit the French people for it , to guide his genera . tion into it , ? and in this he failed ; but in his failure , he was one of the greatest men the modern world has known , For , across the revolutionary abyss : through the storms of demagogism and the conquests of imperialism ; above the noise of orations heralding new millenniums , ? and of drums and cannons dismissing them ; ? his calm , strong counsel , rejected by the eighteenth century , has been received and developed by the nineteenth and twentieth centuries . Every regime since that which perished with the king he tried to save ? and not only in France but in all other civilized countries ? has been made to twin and heed him . His statue , which looks down upon that great quadrangle in the heart of Paris , ? the scene of so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kings , emperors , presidents , have there been welcomed as saviors and dismissed as malefactors ; but Turgot , steadily breasting the tides of unreason , remains to point out those principles of liberty , justice , righteousness , tolerance , education , which alone can give to any nation lasting prosperity and true glory .
