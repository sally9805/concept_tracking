To THE EDITOR OF TEM NATION : Sin : In your number of the 12th of September last , there is a note concerning the collection from China which is about to find its way into a museum of your metropolis . In the note there is reference to the part of Bishop Favier in the history of the collection , and the conduct of that , wellknown and estimable missionary may perhaps be somewhat misrepresented , owing to the summary way in which the affair is recounted . Would you do him the Justice of publishing a brief account of it from his own pen , which , moreover , may have further interest for your readers than that of representing the writer 's conduct in its true light ? He writes under date of November 1 , 1901 : " Yan-li-chan French spelling , the letter is in French had a rather fine house near my residence , condemned to death , and executed by Prince Tuan , his house was pillaged by the Boxers , who burnt it and ran away , on the 16th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases containing some beautiful pieces of porcelain . I put them in my residence , where I had already a beautiful collection , got together during thirty years , as everybody knew . This collection , in which was to be seen , among other pieces , a superb vase given me by the Empress , had to be sacrificed to send a little money to the 15,000 or 20,000 Christians in the province , who were in the same state of indigence as those in the city . It was said that no one was left of Yan-li-chan 's family , but I noted apart all that came from what belonged to him , to deduct it from the indemnity , or to repay the amount to his heirs if any should turn up . Mr. Squiers chose what pleased him , from my collection or from among the objects of Yan-li-chan . He paid the price exactly , giving me a cheque for ? 1,000 sterling , which I distributed immediately among the unfortunate Christians of the province . This is the fact . " Upon my return to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I learned that a son of Yan-li-chan was still living . I had him looked up , and invited him to come to see me . He came a few days later , thanked me heartily for having protected some other houses which belonged to him , and for having repaired the breach in the wall surrounding the large house that was burned , in order that no one might appropriate the property . I asked him if there had been a treasure hidden in his father 's house . He answered that his father never kept money at home , and , indeed , I do not think any was found . I told him that I desired to return him the price of the objects saved by us from the fire and sold , and , in spite of his opposition , I obliged him to accept the exact value of the objects , giving him a cheque upon the Hong Kong Bank , and so paying him in full , as I had done to other individuals or shopkeepers . " The last clause refers to the individuals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with , for the support of those who depended upon him , during the panic which followed the taking of Peking . The Bishop goes on to say that he is on the best of terms with his pagan neighbors , and that since the siege they have baptized 1,100 adults , and received the names of 4,000 more , asking to become Christians . He then continues ; " I regret that the accusations against me should come from America , for I love and admire that country of true liberty for all . The United States ministers , generals , and admirals have been on the best relations with me ; some of them I have counted as real friends . I am also on good terms with American Protestant ministers . I am , therefore , persuaded that these accusations proceed only from the want of exact information . At all events , then , I shall retain my esteem for my accusers , for they have been deceived , not deceivers . " WILLIAM L.
