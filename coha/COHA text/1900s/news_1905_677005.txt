txt Following closely upon the purchase of the controlling stock of the Equitable Life Assurance Society by the syndicate of which Thomas F. Ryan is the head , it was learned yesterday that the new interests had determined to place the in-vestments of the society on practically a , savings bank basis . This move will mark an era in the insurance world . While the plans of the new regime in the Equitable have not yet been worked out in detail , the determination to raise the investment standard to a point where the securities of the society will always be above criticism is understood to have been one of the first reached in considering the case . There has been talk in financial circles that steps might be taken to force legis- , Lation at Albany next Winter to this end , and since the break between Tames H. Hyde and E. H. Harriman occurred the report has been common that the latter would use all the political influence he commands to accomplish this result . The voluntary action of the Equitable 's new management will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Savings Bank Basis Means . The investments of savings banks are limited by law to real estate mortgages of not more than a fixed percentage on the valuation , approved classes of bonds of States and municipalities , and approved classes of railroad bonds . The great change , therefore . to he accomplished by a life insurance company going on a savings bank basis would be the elimination of stocks of all kinds from its investment list . In addition , there would be a marked narrowing of its investments in railroad bonds if it tried to follow the provisions of the new statute passed by the last Legislature . In the matter of railroad bonds the present law provides that savings banks may invest , first , in the mortgage bonds of any railroad corporation incorporated under the laws of any of the United States which actually owns in fee not less than 500 miles of standard-gauge railway , exclusive of sidings , within the United States , if within the five years preceding the date of investment the road has made no default of matured principal and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the five years of at least 4 per cent . on all its stock , and has hat , gross earnings , including those of railroads or coal companies , leased or controlled , equal to at least five times the amount of all its interest requirements rand rentals on all leased lines . The bonds , however , must be a first mortgage on not less than 75 per cent . of the railroad owned in fee by the company on the date of issue , exclusive of sidings , or a refunding mortgage issued to retire all prior lien mortgage debts of the company at the time of the investment , and covering at least 75 per cent . of the railroad as before . Further , it is provided that no bond so secured shall be a legal investment in case the entire amount of the mortgage , together with all outstanding prior debts of the company  --  deducted , in the case of a refunding mortgage , the bonds reserved to retire prior debts at maturity  --  shall exceed three times the outstanding capital stock of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And no mortgage is to be regarded as a. refunding mortgage under the terms of the act unless the bonds it secures mature at a later date than any bond which it is given to refund , or unless it covers a mileage at least 25 per cent . greater than is covered by any one of the mortgages to be refunded . The law has further provisions for bonds of roads of less than 500 miles in length and of leased or controlled roads , but on the general standard here laid down . It provides , in addition , that not more than 25 per cent . of the assets of any savings bank shall be invested in railroad bonds , and that the bonds of street railroads shall not be considered within the interpretation of the act . Grover Cleveland 's acceptance of the trusteeship of the Equitable stock . which he was invited to exercise , was received by Thomas F. Ryan yesterday morning . It was contained in a telegram , and therefore was not made public , as Mr. Cleveland 's formal letter probably will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this reply . which he had telegraphed to the ex-President : Hon.

" Of course , it is impossible for me to make a definite statement of what is to be done until I have looked over the ground , but you may rely upon it that nothing will be left undone-in the effort to restore the confidence of the policy holders . " Brayton Ives Resigns . President James W. Alexander and the other exechtnie officers of the society declined to do any talking yesterday . Mr. Morton received in the morning the resignation of Brayton Ives as a Director . Mr. Ives was the only member of the Prick- investigating committee ' remaining in the board up to the time of Mr. Morton 's election and he voted against the new Chairman when the question was put on his nomination . In his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view of yesterday 's events it seems proper that I should make the following statement : " Previous to the taking of a vote for Chairman , I urged the postponement of such action until there should be a change in the ownership of the majority of the stock of the Equitable . Society . At that time I had no knowledge of the change of ownership that had already taken place . Had I known it , I should , undoubtedly , have voted for you , as I had not mentioned any other candidate and had none other in mind . I expressly stated that I had no personal opposition ' to you . " Inasmuch as I am not a stockholder in my own right , and as the stock under which I qualified has changed hands , and In order to give you a ' free hand ' which you desire and need , it is fitting that I should tender my resignation as a Director of the Equitable Life Assurance Society , and I hereby do so resign . " In taking this action I assure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new office , in which wishes I shall be joined , I am sure , by all public spirited citizens . " Yours very respectfully , " BRAYTON IVES . " To most people who have had an interest in the Equitable eoUtroversy Friday 's settlement was welcome , as ending a situation which had became intolerable . The names of the six members of the syndicate not announded on Friday night have been kept secret thus far , the explanation being that the men in question did not want their identity disclosed . Belmont BaOlcs Ryan . August Belmont gave out the following statement in ' regard to the election of Mr. Morton : " What has been done and the manner in which it was done has and had at the meeting my fullest indorsement . I was not aware until late last evening who composed the purchasing syndicate , and it was not material to me ; the principle was the right one , and I had been advo-cating practically what has been accomplished . It is not true , as has been stal1 ed , that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's decision ( we were all in ignorance of it ) I would have advocated reporting his nomination by the icommittee , but I did not know Mr. Morton well enough to assume the responI sibility of proposing him without the powers which he now possesses attached , and so the Question went to the full ' board . Mr. Ryan deserves the gratitude of every one , and the movement has my hearty ' indorsement and support " MR . RYAN 'S RAPID RISE . Equitable Settlement Latest of His Great Financial Enterprises . Thomas Fortune Ryan , who arranged the settlement by which the Hyde majority holdings of the stock of the Equitable Life Assurance Society were purchased and trusteed for the benefit of policy holders , has become , by easy stages , one of the foremost men in Wall Street . For many years the public have looked upon Mr. *yen essentially as a street railroad man because of his work in creating and controlling the Metropolitan Street Railway system . The Metropolitan has been only a part of Mr. Ryan 's business activities , and . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steam railroad field as more important than his operations in tractions and public utilities . According to his personal friends Mr. I Ryan regards the forming of the Richmond Terminal Company , in the early eighties , as one of the most important transactions of his career . By it all the southern railroad lines were brought into close working arrangements . Later they were separated and the bulk of the properties came under control of the Georgia Railway and Banking Company . which controls the Georgia Central Railroad . That was another big steam railroad deal in which Mr. Ryan figures , his other two most important financial transactions in the steam railroad line being the Hocking Valley litigation and the Pere Marquette. reorganization . It was while these transactions were under way that Mr. Ryan , in 1886 , became associated with the late William C. ' Whit.ney and brought about the consolidation of the surface traction lines into the Metropolitan system . Prior to that time Mr. Ryan had been associated with such men as Jay Gould , Samuel J. Tilden , Wiliam R. Travers , and John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Metropolitan Company , and since that enterprise was engineered he has gradually extended his operations until they give him large interests in almost all the gas , ' electric , and other public utility corporations of the city and of the northern section of New Jersey . The Consolidated Gas Company and its constituent corporations , as well as the New York Edison Company and the lighting companies in the other boroughs of Greater New York , all include Thomas F. Ryan among their most important stockholders . He also is a big stockholder in the American Tobacco Company . ? Mr. Ryan is the active head of the Morton Trust Company , into - which he Bane ; when the ; consolidation was effectedrekeithi.fie , State Trust n ci.441032 panies also are included in the list of Ryan properties . Mr. Ryan 's rise to his present affluence and influence came from the most humble beginning .

He became a member of the Stock Exchange in 1874 . This was a year after his marriage to Miss Ida M. Barry of Baltimore . From the time of Mr. Ryan 's entry to the Stock Exchange , when memberships were worth about $4,000 each , his rise was steady and rapid . Mr. Ryan has five sons . CLEVELAND IN RETIREMENT .
