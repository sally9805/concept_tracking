txt On the complaint of William Green , an insurance adjustor for the General Adjustment Bureau of the fire insurance companies , which has offices at 46 Cedar Street , Herman Vanderwall of 798 East 169th Street and Morris Newmark of 126 East Thirty-sixth Street were held in $5,000 ball each by Magistrate Herman in the Tombs Court yesterday on the charge of conspiracy in attempting to destroy by fire the Ampersand Hotel at Saranac Lake . The date for the examination of the two men was set for Friday , before which time the secret service of the General Adjustment Bureau and Inspector aloCafferty 's men of the Detective Headquarters here expect to make another arrest . The chief evidence against Vanderwall , a chiropodist employed at the Plaza Hotel by Car/ A. Zahn , who runs the barber 's shop of the hotel , and against Newmark , Vanderwall 's son-In-law , is in the form of sworn confessions by two men who allege that they were employed by the accused to set fire to the property . Barney Hoffman , alias Charlea Baker , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ East 108th Street , made the affidavits . Hoffman swears that he was introduced Ito a Dr. Prank by Newmark at Fifth Avenue and 106th Street on Sept. 21 last , and that Frank asked him Ii he did not want to make some money , then unfolding a plan to destroy the big hotel in the Adirondacks . He swears he met Dr. Frank the next day and was accompanied by Goldblatt . The plan of setting fire to the hotel was then discussed , Hoffman swears , and Dr. Frank drew a groundfloor plan for him on a prescription blank . He got instructions as to the work and took the blank and sketch with him . This blank contains the name and address of a physician who lives in Lexington Avenue , and the name is not Prank . Secona Confession . Goldblatt 's affidavit closely follows that of Hoffman . He describes the arrangement for setting fire to the hotel for the sum of $100 each and expenses , their false start for Saranac , their effort to get the money back for their tickets , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a suit against the railroad . This visit brought them In touch with the police , for they told the lawyer of the mission they had accepted money for and had turned down , and the lawyer informed the police an the insurance adjustors , and the investigation of the destruction of the Ampersand followed . A careful investigation of Vanderwall 's past career has been made by the police . It was learned yesterday that he had been employed by Zahn on good recommendations . He went to the Plaza from the St. Regis on the recommendation of Charles M. Eaton , a member of the Stock Exchange firm of Raymond . Pynchon &; Co. , which has offices in the Plaza . Eaton is also Treasurer and a Director of the Ampersand Hotel Company . Through his counsel , William B. Ellison , Eaton gave out the following explanatory statement last night : " I am the Charles M. Eaton who is Treasurer and principal stockholder of the Ampersand Hotel Company . I am also a broker , and . I assume , the person to whom the newspapers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the main hotel build . ' ing , with Its contents , was destroyed by fire . The house was not entirely closed , the last of the guests were leaving , and substantially all of the help were present . I was in New York . . " From what I have been able to learn , the fire started in the tower , and near the top of the building , where that day things like pillows and other bedding were being stored for the Winter . Whether some of the employes had been careless , whether the electric wiring became Imperfect , or what the immediate cause of the fire was , I have not the least idea .. 1 That it was entirely accidental I have not the least doubt . " The help in charge of the work going ' on In that part of the hotel where the fire started are beyond any suspicion , and ' , could gain absolutely nothing by a fire . On the contrary , they would and have lost employment . I have known them all for years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as it is intimated that some one was employed by me to set fire to the place , that is absurd . I am the greatest loser by the fire . There is no way that I could possibly gain by having the property destroyed . On the contrary , it means an inevitable loss to me . " The amount of property destroyed was of the value of $129,000 . This estimate is a low one . The total insurance was but , $99,000 . Two Heavy Mortgagee . " Upon the insurance money there were two claims , both prior in payment to the stockholders . There was a $85,000 mortgage held by the Mutual Life Insurance Company , and a second mortgage of $60 , - 000 , securing the bonds to a similar amount . It is thus clear that between the incumbrances , aggregating $95,000 , and the total insurance there was but $4,000 . These figures in themselves show the absurdity of a charge that any stockholder would prefer to have the property destroyed . " There is , however , another factor which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of gentlemen from Pittsburg , Philadelphia , and New York had begun the organization of a club , to consist of 200 members , each of whom was to contribute $1,000 . More than 100 subscribers had already been obtained . These gentlemen had offered to buy the property at $180,000 , which would have left about $40,000 over and above the incumbrances arid unsecured debts to the stockholders . " A meeting had been called at the Waldorf-Astoria of the subscribers to this club for the early part of October , and that meeting was actually held . The fire of the preceding September 23 , however , having destroyed the main building , naturally there was not there that for which the club , would care to pay the $180,000 before referred to . and the deal fell through . Every interest that I had in the world demanded the preservation of , the property until I could close this sale . The destruction of the property . aused me an actual loss of at least $30,00f " Now , so far as Herman Vanderwall is concerned , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hotel . He had not been there during the previous two years , nor , so far as I snow , had he been in the proximity of the property . He certainly was not there on any business of mine . " Just outside of the entrance to the Ampersand Park there is an old hotel , formerly known as the Del Monte . I now understand that Vanderwall secured a lease of this property and intends to reopen it this coming season . Other than his interest in this old place . I do not think he has had any concern whatever with the Ampersand Hotel property , since he terminated his connection with the hotel two years ago . The fire occurred on Sept. 23 . Notice of loss was immediately served on all of the forty insurance companies interested . Sixty days later , formal proofs of loss were served by the hotel company . Sixty days thereafter , or four months from the time of the fire , a demand was made upon , the companies for payment . " Hearing nothing from any of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after a demand for payment , actions were begun in the Supreme Court , Franklin County , against all of the companies hay .. 1 ing policies on the property . The cases were brought in Franklin County because that is the principal place of business of the hotel company . " Another reason for selecting Franklin County is that there will be a term of the court at which these actions can be tried in April , and it is my intention to have them pressed for trial at the earniest possible moment . Incidental to the commencement of these suits , I am. for the first time , confronted with the claim made by the companies that the hotel was , set afire . I will give them the earliest opportunity to prove their claim . If any delays occur in meeting this issue , they will be the delays sought by the companies and not by me . " The loss is an absolutely honest one , and the charge of incendiarism is but an excuse for non-payment . " The Ampersand was considered of the best class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the mountain resorts . The cost of its maintainance was regarded as unUsually high . C. D. Moulton , manager of the hotel before the last season , committed suicide in this city about a year ago , and was succeeded by W. K. Hill , formerly of the Hotel Majestic . Assistant District Attorney Krotel has taken charge of the prosecution of the case . In court yesterday he asked that bonds ' of $10,000 be required of Vanderwall and Newmark , but $5.000 was deemed sufficient by the court . Mr. Krotel says he is in possession of a confession by Newmark , which implicates others , and pleads that he and his father-in-law were hired to get men to apply the torch to the Ampersand . They were to get $500 each for getting the men who would burn the place , Newmark told the detectives . Acting Captain Price , at Detective Headquarters , said yesterday that sufficient evidence had been secured from the men now under charges of conspiracy to keep Headquarters busy trying to find the men " higher up .
