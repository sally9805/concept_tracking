txt // susceptible of being established in the race , after a sufficient persistence . If we take the best marked case , ? that of intellectual development , ? it seems to be unquestionable that there is a superior aptitude for mental combinations , independent of all culture , among highly civilized people ; or , what comes to the same thing , an inferior aptitude among nations that are less advanced , ? the average intellect of the members of those societies being taken for observation . The intellectual faculties are , it is true , more modified than the others by the social evolution ; but then they have the smallest relative effect in the individual human constitution , so that we are authorized to infer from their amelioration a proportionate improvement in aptitudes that are more marked and equally exercised . In regard to morals particularly , I think it indisputable that the gradual development of humanity favors a growing preponderance of the noblest tendencies of our nature , as I hope to prove further on . The lower instincts continue to manifest themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repressed exercise must tend to debilitate them by degrees , and their increasing regulation certainly brings them into involuntary concurrence in the maintenance of a good social economy , and especially in the case of the least marked organisms , which constitute a vast majority . These two aspects of social evolution , then , ? the development which brings after it the improvement , ? we may consider to be admitted as facts . Adhering to our relative in opposition to the absolute view , we must conclude the social state , regarded as a whole , to have been as perfect in each period as the coexisting condition of humanity and of its environment would allow . Without this view , history would be incomprehensible ; and the relative view is as indispensable in regard to progress as , in considering social statics , we saw it to be in regard to order . If , in a statical view , the various social elements can not but maintain a spontaneous harmony , which is the first principle of order , neither can any of them help being as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permits . In either case the harmony and the movement are the result of invariable natural laws which // produce all phenomena whatever , and are more obscure in social science merely on account of the greater complexity of the phenomena concerned . LIMITS OF POLITICAL ACTION And now occurs , as the last aspect of social dynamics , the question of the general limits of political action . No enlightened man can be blind to the necessary existence of such limits , which can be ignored only on the old theological supposition of the legislator being merely the organ of a direct and continuous providence , which admits of no limits . We need not stop to confute that hypothesis , which has no existence but in virtue of ancient habits of thought . In any case human action is very limited in spite of all aids from concurrence and ingenious methods ; and it is difficult to perceive why social action should be exempt from this restriction , which is an inevitable consequence of the existence of natural laws . Through all the selfassertions of human pride every statesman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to political action by the aggregate of social influences , to which he must attribute the failure of the greater number of the projects which he had secretly cherished ; and perhaps the conviction is most thorough , while most carefully hidden , in the mind of the most powerful of statesmen , because his inability to struggle against natural laws must be decisive in proportion to his implication with them . Seeing that social science would be impossible in the absence of this principle , we need not dwell further upon it , but may proceed to ascertain the fitness of the new political philosophy to determine , with all the precision that the subject admits , what is the nature of these limits , general or special , permanent or temporary . Two questions are concerned here : first , in what way the course of human development may be affected by the aggregate of causes of variation which may be applied to it ; and next , what share the voluntary and calculated action of our political combinations may have among these modifying influences . The // first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is a general principle , which the second is not , and because it is fully accessible , which again the second is not . SOCIAL PHENOMENA MODIFIABLE We must observe , in the first place , that social phenomena may , from their complexity , be more easily modified than any others , according to the law which was established to that effect in my first volume . Thus , the limits of variation are wider in regard to sociological than to any other laws . If , then , human intervention holds the same proportionate rank among modifying influences as it is natural at first to suppose , its influence must be more considerable in the first case than in any other , all appearances to the contrary notwithstanding . This is the first scientific foundation of all rational hopes of a systematic reformation of humanity ; and on this ground illusions of this sort certainly appear more excusable than on any other subject . But though modifications from all causes are greater in the case of political than of simpler phenomena , still they can never be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be in subjection to those fundamental laws , whether statical or dynamical , which regulate the harmony of the social elements and the filiation of their successive variations . There is no disturbing influence , exterior or human , which can make incompatible elements coexist in the political system , or change in any way the natural laws of the development of humanity . The inevitable gradual preponderance of continuous influences , however imperceptible their power may be at first , is now admitted with regard to all natural phenomena ; and it must be applied to social phenomena whenever the same method of philosophizing is extended to them . What , then , are the modifications of which the social organism and the social life are susceptible , if nothing can alter the laws either of harmony or of succession ? The answer is that modifications act upon the intensity and secondary operation of phenomena , but without affecting their nature or filiation . To suppose that they could , would be to exalt the disturbing above // the fundamental cause , and would destroy the whole economy of laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows that , in a statical view , any possible variations can affect only the intensity of the different tendencies belonging to each social situation , without in any way hindering or producing , or , in a word , changing the nature of those tendencies ; and in the same way , in a dynamical view , the progress of the race must be considered susceptible of modification only with regard to its speed , and without any reversal in the order of development , or any interval of any importance being overleaped . These variations are analogous to those in the animal organism , with the one difference that in sociology they are more complex ; and , as we saw that the limits of variation remain to be established in biology , it is not to be expected that sociology should be more advanced . Rut all we want here is to obtain a notion of the general spirit of the law in regard both to social statics and dynamics ; and looking at it from both points of view , it seems to me impossible to question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for instance , there is no accidental influence nor any individual superiority which can transfer to one period the discoveries reserved for a subsequent age , in the natural course of the human mind ; nor can there be the reverse case of postponement . The history of the sciences settles the question of t he close dependence of even the most eminent individual genius on the contemporary state of the human mind ; and this is above all remarkable in regard to the improvement of methods of invest igation , either in the way of reasoning or experiment . The same t ling happens in regard to the arts ; and especially in whatever depends on mechanical means in substitution for human action . And there is not , in reality , any more room for doubt in the case of moral development , the character of which is certainly determined in each period by the corresponding state of the social evolution , whatever may be the modifications caused by education or individual organization . Each of the leading modes of social existence determines for itself a certain system of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily recognized in all individuals , in the midst of their characteristic differences ; for instance , there // is a state of human life in which the best individual natures contract a habit of ferocity , from which very inferior natures easily emancipate themselves in a better state of society . The case is the same in a political view , as our historical analysis will hereafter show . And in fact , if we were to review all the facts and reflections which establish the existence of the limits of variation , whose principle I have just laid down , we should find ourselves reproducing in succession all the proofs of the subjection of social phenomena to invariable laws ; because the principle is neither more nor less than a strict application of the philosophical conception . ORDER OI ' MODIFYING INFLUENCES We can not enlarge upon the second head , ? that is , the classification of modifying influences according to their respective importance . If such a classification is not yet established in biology , it would be premature indeed to attempt it in social science . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear to me to result first , from race ; secondly , from climate ; thirdly , from political action in its whole scientific extent , it would answer none of our present purposes to inquire here whether this or some other is the real order of their importance . The political influences are the only ones really open to our intervention ; and to that head general attention must be directed , though with great care to avoid the conclusion that that class of influences must be the most important because it is the most immediately interesting to us . It is owing to such an illusion as this that observers who believe themselves emancipated from old prejudices can not obtain sociological knowledge , because they enormously exaggerate the power of political action . Because political operations , temporal or spiritual , can have no social efficacy but in as far as they are in accordance with the corresponding tendencies of the human mind , they are supposed to have produced what is in reality occasioned by a spontaneous evolution , which is less conspicuous and easily overlooked . Such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in history , in which the most // prodigious political authority has left no lasting traces of its wellsustained development , because it moved in a contrary direction to modern civilization , ? as in the instances of Julian , of Philip II , of Napoleon Bonaparte , etc . The inverse cases , unhappily too few , are still more decisive , ? those cases in which political action , sustained by an equally powerful authority , has nevertheless failed in the pursuit of ameliorations that were premature , though in accordance with the social movement of the time . Intellectual history , as well as political , furnishes examples of this kind in abundance . It has been sensibly remarked by Fergusson that even . the action of one nation upon another , whether by conquest or otherwise , though the most intense of all social forces , can effect merely such modifications as are in accordance with its existing tendencies ; so that , in fact , the action merely accelerates or extends a development which would have taken place without it . In politics , as in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great and durable influence , whatever may be the personal value of the superior man to whom the multitude attribute social action of which he is merely the fortunate organ . The power of the individual over the race is subject to these general limits , even when the effects , for good or for evil , are as easy as possible to produce . In revolutionary times , for instance , those who are proud of having aroused anarchical passions in their contemporaries do not see that their miserable triumph is due to a spontaneous disposition , determined by the aggregate of the corresponding social state , which has produced a provisional and partial relaxation of the general harmony . As for the rest , it being ascertained that there are limits of variation among social phenomena , and modifications dependent on systematic political action , and as the scientific principle which is to describe such modifications is now known , the influence and scope of that principle must be determined in each case by the direct development of social science applied to the appreciation of the corresponding state of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that men of genius have been guided in all great and profound action upon humanity in any way whatever ; and it is only thus that they have been able to rectify in a rough // way the illusory suggestions of the irrational doctrines in which they were educated . Everywhere , as I have so often said , foresight is the true source of action . The inaccurate intellectual habits which as yet prevail in political philosophy may induce an apprehension that , according to such considerations as those just presented , the new science of social physics may reduce us to mere observation of human events , excluding all continuous intervention . It is , however , certain that , while dissipating all ambitious illusions about the indefinite action of man on civilization , the principle of rational limits to political action establishes , in the most exact and unquestionable manner , the true point of contact between social theory and practice . It is by this principle only that political art can assume a systematic character , by its release from arbitrary principles mingled with empirical notions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upwards as medical art has clone , the two cases being strongly analogous . As political intervention can have no efficacy unless it rests on corresponding tendencies of the political organism or life , so as to aid its spontaneous development , it is absolutely necessary to understand the natural laws of harmony and succession which determine , in every period and under every social aspect , what the human evolution is prepared to produce , pointing out at the same time the chief obstacles which may be got rid of . It would be exaggerating the scope of such an art to suppose it capable of obviating in all cases the violent disturbances which are occasioned by impediments to the natural evolution . In the highly complex social organism maladies and crises are necessarily even more inevitable than in the individual organism . But though science is powerless for the moment amidst wild disorder and extravagance , it may palliate and abridge the crises by understanding their character and foreseeing their issue , and by more or less intervention , where any is possible . Here , as in other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office of science is not to govern but to modify phenomena , ? and to do this it is necessary to understand their laws . Thus , then , we see what is the function of social science . Without extolling or condemning political facts , science regards // them as subjects of observation ; it contemplates each phenomenon in its harmony with coexisting phenomena and in its connection with the foregoing and the following state of human development ; it endeavors to discover , from both points of view , the general relations which connect all social phenomena ; and each of them is explained , in the scientific sense of the word , when it has been connected with the whole of the existing situation and the whole of the preceding movement . Favoring the social sentiment in the highest degree , this science fulfills the famous suggestion of Pascal by representing the whole human race , past , present , and future , as constituting a vast and eternal social unit whose different organs , individual and national , concur , in their various modes and degrees , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like every other science , with as much exactness as the extreme complexity of its phenomena allows , to a systematic prevision of the events which must result from either a given situation or a given aggregate of antecedents , political science enlightens political art not only in regard to the tendencies which should be aided but also as to the chief means that should be employed , so as to avoid all useless or ephemeral ml therefore dangerous action ; in short , all waste of any kind of social force . MEANS OF INVESTIGATION This examination of the general spirit of political philosophy has been much more difficult than the same process in regard to any established science . The next step , now that this is accomplished , is to examine , according to my usual method , the means of investigation proper to social science . In virtue of a law before recognized , we may expect to find in sociology a more varied and developed system of resources than in any other science , in proportion to the complexity of the phenomena , while yet this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arising from the intricacy . The extension of the means is also more difficult to verify than in any prior case , from the novelty of the subject ; and I can scarcely hope that such a sketch as I must present here will command such confidence as // will arise when a complete survey of the science shall have confirmed what I now offer . As social physics assumes a place in the hierarchy of sciences after all the rest , and therefore dependent on them , its means of investigation must be of two kinds , ? those which are peculiar to itself , and which may be called direct , and those which arise from the connection of sociology with the other sciences ; and these last , though indirect , are as indispensable as the first . I shall review , first , the direct resources of the science . Here , as in all other cases , there are three methods of proceeding , ? by observation , experiment , and comparison . OBSERVATION Very imperfect and even vicious notions prevail at present as to what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The chaotic state of doctrine of the last century has extended to method , and amidst our intellectual disorganization difficulties have been magnified ; precautionary methods , experimental and rational , have been broken up ; and even the possibility of obtaining social knowledge by observation has been dogmatically denied ; but if the sophisms put forth on this subject were true , they would destroy the certainty not only of social science but of all the simpler and more perfect sciences that have gone before . The ground of doubt assigned is the uncertainty of human testimony ; but all the sciences , up to the most simple , require proofs of testimony , ? that is , in the elaboration of the most positive theories we have to admit observations which could not be directly made , nor even repeated , by those who use them , and the reality of which rests on the only faithful testimony of the original investigators , there being nothing in this to prevent the use of such proofs in concurrence with immediate observations . In astronomy such a method is obviously necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mathematics , and , of course , much more evidently so in the case of the more complex sciences . How could any science emerge from the nascent state , ? how could there be any organization of intellectual labor , // , ven if research were restricted to the utmost , if every one rejected all observations but his own ? The stoutest advocates ) f historical skepticism do not go so far as to advocate this . It is only in the case of social phenomena that the paradox is proposed ; and it is made use of there because it is one of the weapons of the philosophical arsenal which the revolutionary metaphysical doctrine constructed for the intellectual overthrow of the ancient political system . The next great hindrance to the use of observation is the empiricism which is introduced into it by those who , in the name of impartiality , would interdict the use of any theory whatever . No logical dogma could be more thoroughly irreconcilable with the spirit of positive philosophy , or with its special character in regard to the study of social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of phenomena is possible , except in as far as it is first directed and finally interpreted by some theory ; and it was this logical need which , in the infancy of human reason , occasioned the rise of theological philosophy , as we shall see in the course of our historical survey . The positive philosophy does not dissolve this obligation , but , on the contrary , extends and fulfills it more and more the further the relations of phenomena are multiplied and perfected by it . Hence it is clear that , scientifically speaking , all isolated , empirical observation is idle , and even radically uncertain ; that science can use only those observations which are connected , at least hypothetically with some law ; that it is such a connection which makes the chief difference between scientific and popular observation , embracing the same facts but contemplating them from different points of view ; and that observations empirically conducted can at most supply provisional materials , which must usually undergo an ulterior revision . The rational method of observation becomes more necessary in proportion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observer would not know what he ought to look at in the facts before his eyes , but for the guidance of a preparatory theory ; and thus it is that by the connection of foregoing facts we learn to see the facts that follow . This is undisputed with regard to astronomical , physical , and chemical research , and in every branch of biological study in which good // observation of its highly complex phenomena is still very rare , precisely because its positive theories are very imperfect . Carrying on the analogy , it is evident that in the corresponding divisions , statical and dynamical , of social science there is more need than anywhere else of theories which shall scientifically connect the facts that are happening with those that have happened ; and the more we reflect , the more distinctly we shall see that in proportion as known facts are mutually connected we shall be better able not only to estimate but to perceive those which are yet unexplored . I am not blind to the vast difficulty which this requisition imposes on the institution of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so to speak , observations and laws , placing us , on account of their indispensable connection , in a sort of vicious circle from which we can issue only by employing in the first instance materials which are badly elaborated and doctrines which are ill-conceived . How I may succeed in a task so difficult and delicate we shall see at its close ; but , however that may be , it is clear that it is the absence of any positive theory which . at present renders social observations so vague and incoherent . There can never be any lack of facts ; for in this case , even more than in others , it is the commonest sort of facts that are most important , whatever the collectors of secret anecdotes may think ; but , though we are steeped to the lips in them , we can make no use of them , nor even be aware of them , for want of speculative guidance in examining them . The statical observation of a crowd of phenomena can not take place without some notion , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dynamical facts could have no fixed direction if they were not attached , at least by a provisional hypothesis , to the laws of social development . The positive philosophy is very far from discouraging historical or any other erudition ; but the precious night watchings , now so lost in the laborious acquisition of a conscientious but barren learning , may be made available by it for the constitution of true social science and the increased honor of the earnest minds that are devoted to it . The new philosophy will supply fresh and nobler subjects , unhoped-for insight , -a loftier aim , and therefore a. higher scientific dignity . ( ' 11ARACTERISTICS OF THE POSITIVE METHOD 51 It will discard none but aimless labors , without principle and without character , as in physics there is no room for compilations of empirical observations ; and at the same time philosophy will render justice to the zeal of students of a past generation , who , destitute of the favorable guidance which we of this day viijoy , followed up their laborious historical researches with an instinctive perseverance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the time . No doubt the same danger : attends research here as elsewhere , ? the danger that , from the continuous use of scientific theories , the observer may sometimes porvert facts by erroneously supposing them to verify some ill ; rounded speculative prejudices of his own . But we have the same guard here as elsewhere , ? in the further extension of the science ; and the case would not be improved by a recurrence to empirical methods , which would be merely leaving theories that may be misapplied , but can always be rectified , for imaginary notions which can not be substantiated at all . Our feeble reason may often fail in the application of positive theories , but at least these transfer us from the domain of imagination to that of reality , and expose us infinitely less than any other kind of doctrine to the clanger of seeing in facts that which is not . It is now clear that social science requires , more than any other , the subordination of observation to the statical and dynamical laws of phenomena . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is connected with some other social fact , without which connection it remains a mere anecdote , involving no rational utility . This condition so far increases the immediate difficulty that good observers will be rare at first , though more abundant than ever as the science expands ; and here we meet with another confirmation of what I said at the outset of this volume , ? that the formation of social theories should be confided only to the best organized minds , prepared by the most rational training . Explored by such minds , according to rational views of coexistence and succession , social phenomena no doubt admit of much more varied and extensive means of investigation than phenomena of less complexity . In this view it is not only the immediate inspection or direct description of events that // affords useful means of positive exploration , but the consideration of apparently insignificant customs , the appreciation of various kinds of monuments , the analysis and comparison of languages , and a multitude of other resources . In short , a mind suitably trained becomes able by exercise to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sociological indications , when once the connection of all indications with the leading ideas of the science is understood . This is a facility afforded by the mutual relation of the various aspects of society , which may partly compensate for the difficulty caused by that mutual connection ; if it renders observation more difficult , it affords more means for its prosecution . EXPERIMENT It might be supposed beforehand that the second method of investigation , experiment , must be wholly inapplicable to social science ; but we shall find that the science is not entirely deprived of this resource , though it must be one of inferior value . We must remember ( what was before explained ) that there are two kinds of experimentation , ? the direct and the indirect ,  --  and that it is not necessary to the philosophical character of this method that the circumstances of the phenomenon in question should be , as is vulgarly supposed in the learned world , artificially instituted . Whether the case be natural or factitious , experimentation takes place whenever the regular course of the phenomenon is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the alteration has no effect on the scientific value of the case , if the elements are known . It is in this sense that experimentation is possible in sociology . If direct experimentation has become too difficult amidst the complexities of biology , it may well be considered impossible in social science . Any artificial disturbance of any social element must affect all the rest , according to the laws both of coexistence and succession ; and the experiment would therefore , if it could be instituted at all , be deprived of all scientific value , through the impossibility of isolating either the conditions or the results of the phenomenon . But we saw in our survey of biology that pathological cases are the true scientific // equivalent of pure experimentation , and why . The same reasons apply , with even more force , to sociological researches . In them pathological analysis consists in the examination of cases , unhappily too common , in which the natural laws , either of harmony or of succession , are disturbed by any causes , special or general , accidental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above all , in our own . These disturbances are , in the social body , exactly analogous to diseases in the individual organism ; and I have no doubt whatever that the analogy will be more evident ( allowance being made for the unequal complexity of the organisms ) the deeper the investigation goes . In both cases it is , as I said once before , a noble use to make of our reason , to disclose the real laws of our nature , individual or social , by the analysis of its sufferings . But if the method is imperfectly instituted in regard to biological questions , much more faulty must it be in regard to the phenomena of social science , for want even of the rational conceptions to which they arc to be referred . We see the most disastrous political experiments forever renewed , with only some insignificant and irrational modifications , though their first operation should have fully satisfied us of the uselessness t and danger of the expedients proposed . Without forgetting how much is ascribable to the influence of human passions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analysis is one of the main causes of the barrenness imputed to social experiments , the course of which would become much more instructive if it were better observed . The great natural laws exist and act in all conditions of the organism ; for , as we saw in the case of biology , it is an error to suppose that they are , violated or suspended in the case of disease ; and we are therefore justified in drawing our conclusions , with due caution , from the scientific analysis of disturbance to the positive theory of normal existence . This is the nature and character of the indirect experimentation which discloses the real economy of the social body in a more marked manner than simple observation could do . It is applicable to all orders of sociological research , whether relating to existence or to movement , and regarded under any aspect whatc-er , ? physical , intellectual , moral , or political ; and to all degrees // of the social evolution , from which , unhappily , disturbances have never been absent . As for its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statement of it , because it has never been duly applied in any investigation in political philosophy ; and it can become customary only by the institution of the new science which I am endeavoring to establish ; but I could not omit this notice of it as one of the means of investigation proper to social science . COMPARISON As for the third of those methods , comparison , the reader must bear in mind the explanations offered , in our survey of biological philosophy , of the reasons why the comparative method must prevail in all studies of which the living organism is the subject ; and the more remarkably , in proportion to the rank of the organism . The same considerations apply in the present case , in a more conspicuous degree ; and I may leave it to the reader to make the application , merely pointing out the chief differences which distinguish the use of the comparative method in sociological inquiries . Comparison with Inferior Animals It is a very irrational disdain which makes us object to all comparison between human society and the social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the protracted influence of the theologico-metaphysical philosophy ; and it will be corrected by the positive philosophy , when we better understand and can estimate the social state of the higher orders of mammifers , for instance . We have seen how important is the study of individual life in regard to intellectual and moral phenomena , of which social phenomena are the natural result and complement . There was once the same blindness to the importance of the procedure in this case as now exists in the other ; and , as it has given way in the one case , so it will in the other . The chief defect in the kind of sociological comparison that we want is that it is limited to statical considerations ; whereas the dynamical are , at the present time , the preponderant and direct // nuhject of science . The restriction results from the social state of animals being , though not so stationary as we are apt to suppose , yet susceptible only of extremely small variations , in no way comparable to the continued progression of humanity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the scientific utility of ouch a comparison , in the statical province , where it characterizes the elementary laws of social interconnection by exhibiting their action in the most imperfect state of society , so as even to suggest useful inductions in regard to human society . There can not be a stronger evidence of the natural character of the chief social relations , which some people fancy that they can transform at pleasure . Such sophists will cease to regard the great ties of the human family as factitious and arbitrary when they find them existing , with the same essential characteristics , among the animals , and more conspicuously the nearer the organisms approach to the human type . In brief , in all that part of sociology which is almost one with intellectual and moral biology , or with the natural history of man , in all that relates to the first germs of the social relations and the first institutions which were founded by the unity of the family or the tribe , there is not only great scientific advantage but real philosophical necessity for employing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps it might even be desirable not to confine the comparison to societies which present a character of voluntary cooperation in analogy to the human . They must always rank first in importance ; but the scientific spirit , extendjing the process to its final logical term , might find some advantage in examining those strange associations proper to the inferior animals , in which an involuntary cooperation results from an indissoluble organic union , either by simple adhesion or real continuity . If the science gained nothing by this extension , the method would . And there is nothing that can compare with such an habitual scientific comparison for the great service of casting out the absolute spirit which is the chief vice of political philosophy . It appears to me , moreover , that , in a practical view , the insolent pride which induces some ranks of society to suppose themselves as , in a manner , of another species than the rest // of mankind is in close affinity with the irrational disdain that repudiates all comparison between human and other animal nature . However all this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and special treatment of social philosophy . Here , where I can offer only the first conception of the science , in which dynamical considerations must prevail , it is evident that I can make little use of the kind of comparison ; and this makes it all the more necessary to point it out , lest its omission should occasion such scientific inconveniences as I have just indicated . The commonest logical procedures are generally so characterized by their very application that nothing more of a preliminary nature is needed than the simplest examination of their fundamental properties . Comparison of Coexisting States of Society To indicate the order of importance of the forms of society which are to be studied by the comparative method , I begin with the chief method , which consists in a comparison of the different coexisting states of human society on the various parts of the earth 's surface , ? those states being completely independent of each other . By this method the different stages of evolution may all be observed at once . Though the progression is single and uniform in regard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various populations have , from causes which are little understood , attained extremely unequal degrees of development , so that the former states of the most civilized nations are now to be seen , amidst some partial differences , among contemporary populations inhabiting different parts of the globe . In its relation to observation this kind of comparison offers the advantage of being applicable both to statical and dynamical inquiries , verifying the laws of both , and even furnishing occasionally valuable direct inductions in regard to both . In the second place , it exhibits all possible degrees of social evolution to our immediate observation . From the wretched inhabitants of Tierra del Fuego to the most advanced nations of western Europe , there is no social grade which is not extant in some points of the globe , and usually in localities which are // leanly apart . In the historical part of this volume we shall find al some interesting secondary phases of social development , of hick the history of civilization leaves no perceptible traces , can known only by this comparative method of study ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lowest degrees of evolution , hich every one admits can be investigated in no other way . nd between the great historical aspects there are numerous tcrinediate states which must be observed thus , if at all . This cond part of the comparative method verifies the indications ( forded by historical analysis , and fills up the gaps it leaves ; ii d nothing can be more rational than this method , as it rests upwn the established principle that the development of the human iind is uniform in the midst of all diversities of climate , and even of race , such diversities having no effect upon anything more than the rate of progress . But we must beware of the scientific singers attending the process of comparison by this method . or instance , it can give us no idea of the order of succession , as It presents all the states of development as coexisting ; so that , the order of development were not established by other methods , his one would infallibly mislead us . And again , if we were not misled as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discloses the filiation of the different systems of society , ? a matter In which the most distinguished . philosphers have been mistaken in various ways and degrees . Again , there is the danger of mistaking modifications for primary phases , as when social differences have been ascribed to the political influence of climate , instead of to that inequality of evolution which is the real cause . Sometimes , but more rarely , the mistake is the other way . Indeed , there is nothing in the matter that can show which of two cases presents the diversity that is observed . We are in danger of the same mistake in regard to races ; for , as the sociological comparison is instituted between peoples of different races , we are liable to confound the effects of race and of the social period . Again , climate comes in to offer a third source of interpretation of comparative phenomena , sometimes agreeing with and sometimes contradicting the two others , thus multiplying the chances of error and rendering the analysis which looked so promising 5S SOCIOLOGY AND SOCIAL PROGRESS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indispensable necessity of keeping in view the positive conception of human development as a whole . By this alone can we be preserved from such errors as I have referred to , and enriched by any genuine results of analysis . We see how absurd in theory and dangerous in practice are the notions and declamations of the empirical school , and of the enemies of all social speculation ; for it is precisely in proportion to their elevation and generality that the ideas of positive social philosophy become real and effective , ? all illusion and uselessness belonging to conceptions which are too narrow and too special , in the departments either of science or of reasoning . But it is a consequence from these last considerations that this first sketch of sociological science , with the means of investigation that belong to it , rests immediately upon the primary use of a new method of observation , which is so appropriate to the nature of the phenomena as to be exempt from the dangers inherent in the others . This last portion of the comparative method is the historical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only basis on which the system of political logic can rest . Comparison of Consecutive States The historical comparison of the consecutive states of humanity is not only the chief scientific device of the new political philosophy . Its rational development constitutes the substratum of the science , in whatever is essential to it . It is this which distinguishes it thoroughly from biological science , as we shall presently see . The positive principle of this separation results from the necessary influence of human generations upon the generations that follow , accumulating continuously till it constitutes the preponderating consideration in the direct study of social development . As long as this preponderance is not directly recognized , the positive study of humanity must appear a simple prolongation of the natural history of man ; but this scientific character , suitable enough to the earlier generations , disappears in the course of the social evolution , and assumes at length a wholly new aspect , proper to sociological science , in // which historical considerations are of immediate importance . And this preponderant use of the historical method gives its philosophical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scientific sense . By the creation of this new department of the comparative method sociology confers a benefit on the whole of natural philosophy , because the positive method is thus completed and perfected in a manner which , for scientific importance , is almost beyond our estimate . What we can now comprehend is that the historical method verifies and applies , in the largest way , that chief quality of sociological science , ? its proceeding from the whole to the parts . Without this permanent condition of social study all historical labor would degenerate into a mere compilation of provisional materials . As it is in their development especially that the various social elements : ire interconnected and inseparable , it is clear that any partial filiation must be essentially untrue . Where , for instance , is the use of any exclusive history of any one science or art , unless meaning is given to it by first connecting it with the study of human progress generally ? It is the same in every direction , and especially with regard to political history , as it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than political , more or less ! The prevailing tendency to speciality in study would reduce history to a mere accumulation of unconnected delineations , in which all idea of the true filiation of events would be lost amidst the mass of confused descriptions . If the historical comparisons of the different periods of civilization are to have any scientific character , they must be referred to the general social evolution ; and it is only thus that we can obtain the guiding ideas by which the special studies themselves must be directed . ' *In a practical view it is evident that the preponderance of the historical method tends to develop the social sentiment by giving us an immediate interest in even the earliest experiences of our race , through the influence which they exercised over the evolution of our own civilization . As Condorcet observed , no. enlightened man can think of the battles of Marathon and Salamis without perceiving the importance of their consequences to the race at large . This kind of feeling should , when we are 6o SOCIOLOGY AND SOCIAL . PROGRESS treating of science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awakened by all delineations of human life , in fiction as well as in history . The sentiment I refer to is deeper , because in some sort personal ; and more reflective , because it results from scientific conviction . It can not be excited by popular history in a descriptive form , but only by positive history , regarded as a true science , and exhibiting the events of human experience in coordinated series which manifest their own graduated connection . This new form of the social sentiment must at first be the privilege of the choice few ; but it will be extended , somewhat weakened in force , to the whole of society , in proportion as the general results of social physics become sufficiently popular . It will fulfill the most obvious and elementary idea of the habitual connection between individuals and contemporary nations , by showing that the successive generations of men concur in a final end , which requires the determinate participation of each and all . This rational disposition to regard men of all times as fellow-workers is as yet visible in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ philosophical preponderance of the historical method it will be extended to all the aspects of human life , so as to sustain , in a reflective temper , that respect for our ancestors which is indispensable to a sound state of society , and which is so deeply disturbed at present by the metaphysical philosophy . As for the course to be pursued by this method , it appears to me that its spirit consists in the rational use of social series ; that is , in a successive estimate of the different states of humanity which shall show the growth of each disposition , ? physical , intellectual , moral , or political , ? combined with the decline of the opposite disposition , whence we may obtain a scientific prevision of the final ascendency of the one and extinction of the other , care being taken to frame our conclusions according to the laws of human development . A considerable accuracy of prevision may thus be obtained for any determinate period and with any particular view , as historical analysis will indicate the direction of modifications even in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prevision will be nearest the truth in // proportion as the phenomena in question are more important and more general ; because then continuous causes are predominant in the social movement , and disturbances have less power . From these first general aspects the same rational certainty may extend to secondary and special aspects , through their statical relations with the first ; and thus we may obtain conclusions sufficiently accurate for the application of principles . If we desire to familiarize ourselves with this historical method , we must employ it first upon the past , by endeavoring to deduce every well-known historical situation from the whole series of its antecedents . In every science we must have learned to predict the past , so to speak , before we can predict the future ; because the first use of the observed relations among fulfilled facts is to teach us by the anterior succession what the future succession will be . No examination of facts can explain our existing state to us , if we have not ascertained , by historical study , the value of the elements at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insist on the necessity of political observation , while they look no further than the present , or a very recent past . The present is , by itself , purely misleading , because it is impossible to avoid confounding principal with secondary facts , exalting conspicuous transient manifestations over fundamental tendencies , which are generally very quiet , and above all , supposing those powers , institutions , and doctrines to be in the ascendant , which are , in fact , in their decline . It is clear that the only adequate corrective of all this is a philosophical understanding of the past , that the comparison can not be decisive unless it embraces the whole of the past , and that the sooner we stop , in traveling up the vista of time , the more serious will 1w our mistakes . We see statesmen going no further back than the last century to obtain an explanation of the confusion in which we are living ; the most abstract of politicians may take in the preceding century , but the philosophers themselves hardly venture beyond the sixteenth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the revolutionary period have actually no conoption of it as a whole , though that whole is itself only a transient phase of the general social movement . // The most perfect methods may , however , be rendered deceptive by misuse ; and this we must bear in mind . We have seen that mathematical analysis itself may betray us into substituting signs for ideas , and that it conceals inanity of conception under an imposing verbiage . The difficulty in the case of the historical method in sociology is in applying it , on account of the extreme complexity of the materials we have to deal with ; but for this the method would be entirely safe . The chief danger is of our supposing a continuous decrease to indicate a final extinction , or the reverse ; as in mathematics it is a common sophism to confound continuous variations , more or less , with unlimited variations . To take a strange and very marked example : if we consider that part of social development which relates to human food , we can not but observe that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If we compare savage with more civilized peoples , in the Homeric poems or in the narratives of travelers , or compare country to town life , or any generation with the one that went before , we shall find this curious result , the sociological law of which we shall examine hereafter . The laws of individual human nature aid in the result by making intellectual and moral action more preponderant as man becomes more civilized . The fact is thus established both by the experimental and the logical way ; yet nobody supposes that men will ultimately cease to eat . In this case the absurdity saves us from a false conclusion , but in other cases the complexity disguises much error in the experiment and the reasoning . In the above instance we must resort to the laws of our nature for that verification which , taken all together , they afford to our sociological analysis . As the social phenomenon , taken as a whole , is simply a development of humanity , without any real creation of faculties , all social manifestations must be found , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which biology constructed by anticipation for sociology . Thus every law of social succession disclosed by the historical method must be unquestionably connected , directly or indirectly , with the positive theory of human nature ; and all inductions which can not stand this test will prove to be illusory , through some sort of insufficiency in the observations on which // they are grounded . The main scientific strength of sociological demonstrations must ever lie in the accordance between the conclusions of historical analysis and the preparatory conceptions of the biological theory . And thus we find , look where we will , a confirmation of that chief intellectual character of the new science , ? the philosophical preponderance of the spirit of the whole over the spirit of detail . This method ranks , in sociological science , with that of zoological comparison in the study of individual life ; and we shall see , as we proceed , that the succession of social states exactly corresponds , in a scientific sense , with the gradation of organisms in biology ; and the social series , once clearly established @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animal series . PROMISE OF A FOURTH METHOD When the method has been used long enough to disclose its properties , I am disposed to think that it will be regarded as so very marked a modification of positive research as to deserve a separate place ; so that , in addition to observation properly so called , experiment , and comparison , we shall have the historical method as a fourth and final mode of the art of observing . It will be derived , according to the usual course , from the mode which immediately precedes it ; and it will be applied to the analysis of the most complex phenomena . I must be allowed to point out that the new political philosophy , sanctioning the old leadings of popular reason , restores to history all its scientific rights as a basis of wise social speculation , after the metaphysical philosophy had striven to induce us to discard all large considerations of the past . In the foregoing departments of natural philosophy we have seen that the positive spirit , instead of being disturbing in its tendencies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every science , the inestimable intuitions of popular good sense , of which indeed science is merely a systematic prolongation , and which a barren metaphysical philosophy alone could despise . In this case , so far from restricting the influence which human reason has ever attributed to history in // political combinations , the new social philosophy increases it radically and eminently . It asks from history something more than counsel and instruction to perfect conceptions which are derived from another source ; it seeks its own general direction through the whole system of historical conclusions . ) RELATION OF SOCIOLOGY TO THE OTHER DEPARTMENTS OF POSITIVE PHILOSOPHY ' RELATION TO BIOLOGY The subordination of social science to biology is so evident that nobody denies it in statement , however it may be neglected in practice . This contrariety between the statement and the practice is due to something else besides the faulty condition of social studies ; it results also from the imperfection of biological science , and especially from its most conspicuous imperfection of all , ? that of its highest part , relating to intellectual and moral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sociology are the most closely connected ; and cerebral physiology is too recent , and its scientific state too immature , to have admitted , as yet , of any proper organization of the relations of the two sciences . Whenever the time for that process arrives , the connection will be seen to bear two aspects . Under the first , biology will be seen to afford the starting point of all social speculation , in accordance with the analysis of the social faculties of man , and of the organic conditions which determine its character . But , moreover , as we can scarcely at all investigate the most elemen-tary terms of the social , series , we must construct them by applying the positive theory of human nature to the aggregate of corresponding circumstances , regarding the small materials that we are able to obtain as rather adapted to facilitate and improve this rational determination than to show us what society really was at so early a period . When the social condition has advanced so far as to exclude this kind of deduction , the second // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is implicated with the sociological in a less direct and special manner . The whole social evolution of the race must proceed in entire accordance with biological laws ; and social phenomena must always be founded on the necessary invariableness of the human organism , the characteristics of which ? physical , intellectual , and moral ? are always found to be essentially the same , and related in the same manner at every degree of the social scale , no development of them attendant upon the social condition ever altering their nature in the least , or , of course , creating or destroying any faculties whatever , or transposing their influence . No sociological view can therefore be admitted at any stage of the science , or under any appearance of historical induction , that is contradictory to the known laws of human nature . No view can be admitted , for instance , which supposes a very marked character of goodness or wickedness to exist in the majority of men , or which represents the sympathetic affections as prevailing over the personal ones , or the intellectual over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which are more common than the imperfection of the biological theory would lead us to expect , all sociological principles must be as carefully submitted to ulterior correction as if they supposed human life to be extravagantly long , or contravened in any other way the physical laws of humanity ; because the intellectual and moral conditions of human existence are as real and as imperative as its material conditions , though more difficult to estimate , and therefore less known . Thus , in a biological view , all existing political doctrines are radically vicious , because , in their . irrational estimate of political phenomena , they suppose qualities to exist among rulers and the ruled ? here an habitual perverseness or imbecility , and there a spirit of concert or calculation ? which are incompatible with positive ideas of human nature , and which would impute pathological monstrosity to whole classes , which is simply absurd . An example like this shows what valuable resources positive sociology must derive from its subordination to biology , and especially in regard to cerebral physiology , whenever it comes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biology have , however , the same tendency to exalt their own science at the expense of that which follows it , that physicists and chemists have shown in regard to biology . The biologists lose sight of historical observation altogether , and represent sociology as a mere corollary of the science of man , in the same way that physicists and chemists treat biology as a mere derivative from the inorganic philosophy . The injury to science is great in both cases . If we neglect historical comparison , we can understand nothing of the social evolution ; and the chief phenomenon in sociology ? the phenomenon which marks its scientific originality , that is , the gradual and continuous influence of generations upon each other ? would be disguised or unnoticed for want of the necessary key , historical analysis . From the time that the influence of former generations becomes the cause of any modification of the social movement the mode of investigation must accord with the nature of the phenomena ; and historical analysis therefore becomes preponderant , while biological considerations , which explained the earliest movements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ auxiliary and means of control . It is the same thing as when , in the study of inorganic science , men quit deduction for direct observation . It is the same thing as when , in biology , observers proceed from a contemplation of the organism and its medium to an analysis of he ages of the individual being , as a principal means of investigation . The only difference is that the change in the instrument is the more necessary the more complex are the phenomena to be studied . This would have been seen at once , and political philosophy would have been admitted to depend on this condition or its advance , but for the prevalence of the . vicious absolute spirit in social speculation , which , neglecting the facts of the case , forever strives to subject social considerations to the absolute conception of an immutable political type , no less adverse to he relative spirit of positive philosophy than theological and etaphysical types , though less indefinite . The consequence of his error is that social modifications proper to certain periods , nd passing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herent in human nature , and therefore indestructible . Even // Gall , attending only to imperfect physiological considerations , and neglecting the social , wandered off into a sort of scientific declamation on the subject of war , declaring the military tendencies of mankind to be immutable , notwithstanding the mass of historical testimony which shows that the warlike disposition diminishes as human development proceeds . A multitude of examples of this kind of mistake might be presented , the most striking of which are perhaps in connection with theories of education , which are usually formed on absolute principles , to the neglect of the corresponding state of civilization . The true nature of sociology is evident enough from what has been said . We see that it is not an appendix to biology , but a science by itself , founded upon a distinct basis , while closely connected , from first to last , with biology . Such is the scientific view of it . As to the method , the logical analogy of the two sciences is so clear as to leave no doubt that social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discipline in biological methods . This is necessary not only to put them in possession of the general spirit of investigation proper to organic science but yet more to familiarize them with the comparative method , which is the grand resource of investigation in both sciences . Moreover , there is a most valuable philosophical principle common to both sciences which remains to be fully developed before it can attain its final prevalence ; I mean the positive version of the dogma of final causes . This principle belongs eminently to the study of living bodies , in which that distinction is especially marked , and where alone the general idea of it can properly be acquired . But , great as is its direct use - in the study of individual life , it is applicable in a much more extensive and essential way in social science . It is by means of this principle that the new philosophy , uniting the two philosophical meanings of the word " necessary , " exhibits as inevitable that which first presents itself as indispensable ; and the converse . There must be something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are led up to it by the most opposite methods of approach , one evidence of which is De Maistre 's fine political aphorism , " Whatever is necessary exists . " // RELATION TO INORGANIC PHILOSOPHY If sociology is thus subordinated to biology , it must be scientifically related to the whole system of inorganic philosophy , because biology is so . But it is also connected with that system by immediate relations of its own . In the first place , it is only by the inorganic philosophy that we can duly analyze the entire system of exterior conditions , ? chemical , physical , and astronomical , ? amidst which the social evolution proceeds , and by which its rate of progress is determined . Social phenomena can no more be understood apart from their environment than those of individual life . All exterior disturbances which could affect the life of individual man must change his social existence ; and , conversely , his social existence could not be seriously disturbed by any modifications of the medium which should not derange his separate condition . I need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the influence of astronomical and other conditions on vital existence , for the same considerations bear on the case of social phenomena . It is plain that society , as well as individual beings , is affected by the circumstances of the earth 's daily rotation and annual movement ; and by states of heat , moisture , and electricity in the surrounding medium ; and by the chemical conditions of the atmosphere , the waters , the soil , etc . I need only observe that the effect of these influences is even more marked in sociology than in biology , not only because the organism is more complex , and its phenomena of a higher order , but because the social organism is regarded as susceptible of indefinite duration , so as to render sensible many gradual modifications which would be disguised from our notice by the brevity of individual life . Astronomical conditions , above all others , manifest their importance to living beings only by passing from the individual to the social case . Much smaller disturbances would visibly affect a social condition than would disturb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorable circumstances . For instance , the dimensions of the globe are scientifically more important in sociology than in biology , because they set bounds to the // ultimate extension of population , ? a circumstance worthy of grave consideration in any positive system of political speculation . And this is only one case of very many . If we consider , in regard to dynamical conditions , what would be the effect of any change in the degree of obliquity of the ecliptic , in the stability of the poles of rotation , and yet more in the eccentricity of the earth 's orbit , we shall see that vast changes in social life must be produced by causes which could not endanger individual existence . One of the first reflections that presents itself is that positive sociology was not possible till the inorganic philosophy had reached a certain degree of precision . The very conception of stability in human association could not be positively established till the discovery of gravitation had assured us of the permanence of the conditions of life ; and till physics and chemistry had taught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural condition too rare and too partial , apart from accidents , to affect our estimate ; or , at least , that the crust of the globe admits of only variations so limited and so gradual as not to interfere with the natural course of social development , ? a development which could not be hoped for under any liability to violent and frequent physico-chemical convulsions of any extent in the area of human life . There is thus more room to apprehend that inorganic philosophy is not advanced enough to supply the conditions of a positive polity , than to suppose that any real political philosophy can be framed in independence of inorganic science . We have seen before , however , that there is a perpetual accordance between the possible and the indispensable . What we must have we are able to obtain ; and if there are , as in the case of the mutual action of different starry systems , cosmical ideas which are inaccessible to us , we know in regard to sociology now , as to biology before , that they are of no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole field of science , we shall find that , amidst the great imperfection of inorganic philosophy , it is sufficiently advanced in all essential respects to contribute to the constitution of true social science , if we only have the prudence to postpone to a future time investigations which would now be premature . IV THE GENERAL DISTINCTION BETWEEN SOCIOL-OGY AND THE SPECIFIC SOCIAL SCIENCES ' Sociology as the science of society confines itself strictly to human association . It aims to show what is meant by associa-tion , how it is brought about , to what process of development it is subject , and what results it produces . Three questions respecting human society are supreme : What ? Why ? How ? Since human association itself is our aim , it is evident that the stress is not to be placed on any particular kind of association . The subject is so large that we shall be obliged to confine our-selves to the general principles of society and to their general application . In thus aiming at what marks human association as character-istic we also aim at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal forces are the constituent elements of asso-ciation , then these forces must constitute every kind of society formed . The forces may differ in kind , in number , in intensity , and in degree of development ; but no society can exist other-wise than by virtue of these forces . The personal forces exist only in individuals ; therefore the idea of society includes that of individuals as possessors of the social forces . In a society for physical culture , for mental culture , for political ends , and for any purpose imaginable , the prime question pertains to the character of the personal forces involved . Just as being includes all being , but only in the most general sense as being , so asso-ciation includes every society , but only in its most general sense . Here , then , is the broad difference between social science itself and the specific social sciences : the former discusses whatever 71 // belongs to society as society and applies the general ideas obtained to the different associations ; but each special social science confines itself to a particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principles or essences of associa-tion , and shows how they apply to all society , the specific social sciences specialize certain forms of association and give an account of their specific characteristics . More details are there-fore to be expected in the limited social sciences than in the general social science . Let us suppose that sociology gives a principiant account of the nature and working of the social forces ; that would be a general interpretation of society . Among them are found indus-trial forces , which are consigned to economics for special treat-ment ; there are also political forces , which are consigned to political science ; there are ethical forces , which are consigned to ethics ; and so with all the other social forces . Sociology is therefore the general social science of which the special social sciences are differentiations ; it is the genus of which they are the species , the trunk on which they are the branches . While each social science has its specific sphere ( the operation of speci-fic social forces ) , it is not within the province of any one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the various forms of society are related to it ; that is the mission of the more gen-eral science , sociology . After indicating the general relation of sociology to the special social disciplines , we now proceed to consider the rela-tion of some of the latter to our subject . // Various limited societies have tried to absorb society itself and put themselves in its place . In the gens or the tribe , as an enlarged family , it is the family which embodies the social idea . Perhaps the members knew no other association . In Judaism and the Middle Ages the theocracy , the kingdom of God , or the church , is viewed as the essence of society . We can understand // why Aristotle defines man as a political animal , when we remember how the individual was thought to exist for the state . A part is put for the whole . It is a common mistake to concentrate the attention on a dominant or specially prized feature and lose sight of the rest . Thus a fixed idea is made the sole idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the political sphere was the condition for a larger conception of society . For us the state is but an arc in the social circle . Such an exclusive prominence may , however , still be given to the state as to make it difficult for independent or voluntary associations to receive recognition , or to be deemed of sufficient importance to justify social science as distinct from politics . What is left for sociology in such cases when the state absorbs the church , regulates the family , and determines the limits of associative action ? By making the state everything , other societies become nothing . Governments have at times been disposed to suppress voluntary associations , for fear they might interfere with the prerogatives of the state , threaten its supremacy , or endanger its very existence . A governmental paternalism which aims so to control the affairs of the people that there may be no occasion for independent associative action hinders the organization of voluntary societies . Thus associations distinct from the state require a certain degree of prominence and importance in order to receive recognition and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of society a reason is found for those historians who have made history consist chiefly of the state , its monarchs and officials , its diplomacy and its wars . While we thus understand the exclusive attention to the state as the most perfect organization , yet throughout history , and particularly in modern times , we find numerous open and secret associations which are not included in political science . This is the more evident now since the conception of society has been enlarged to include all kinds of association , not merely formal organizations . Even in its largest sense the state can not embrace all societies as constituent parts of the body politic . From the political forces numerous other social energies must be differentiated . The action of some of these the state maysanction by // its laws ; the action of others may be left free , neither requiring nor receiving recognition . Society existed before the state was formed . In what sense would that society be included in political science ? Then we have not one state but many states , and the inclusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would such a comprehensive science include all nonpolitical associations and the whole of humanity ? Some organizations , as churches , masonic and other lodges , and industrial societies , extend beyond the limits of a state or even of all states , reaching out to individuals and tribes not in a state . How can these be made a part of political science ? The science of politics needs differentiation from sociology and the other social sciences , in order that its own peculiar sphere may be made more distinct . The function of the state is among the most momentous problems of the times , but this function can be distinctly brought out only when contrasted with the other social forces . In Russia the government aims to make society , in the United States society makes the government ; in Russia the progress of voluntary association is a menace to the government , in the United States independent organizations may ignore the very existence of the government . Neither theoretically nor practically is there agreement respecting the limits of the state and its relation to voluntary association . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explaining its structure and functions , marking the peculiarity of its organization as distinguished from other societies , treating of the relations of the citizens to one another and to the state , and of the government to the governed , the constitution and laws , and all that belongs to the domain of national life . Some have questioned , as intimated above , whether the state ought to be included in sociology or treated separately as outside of society . It is unquestionably a form of association , and therefore within the scope of sociology ; but it is only one of many social forms , and therefore political science can not take the place of the science of society . The distinctive elements in the state , the peculiar authority it exercises , and the vast importance of // subject mist receive full recognition . Its sphere is that of ' five authority and coercion ; the sphere of other societies at of cooperation . Owing to the importance and extent of ics it has become a special science ; it is , however , a social e @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to i the people is society in a truer sense than when the state treated as an abstraction , or as a power hovering over the ) k , to which unconditional submission is required . We can ed distinguish between social and political , referring the latter II that pertains to the state , and the former to society as dis-c from the state ; but reflection shows that political action is ial action as organized in the form of collective authority . e state , whatever its particular form and whoever exercises authority , is sovereignty . The functions and limits of the rereignty are among the most important questions of the day . // The effort to make a social science the social science has been pecially strong in political economy . So long as social science I not exist , but its need was deeply felt , it was not strange that social study deemed of supreme importance should be treated the missing discipline . Particularly is this exaltation of eco-omics natural at a time when material interests are absorbing . ' hen political economy is apt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social being but as also determining those Interests which pertain to social well-being . At such times agri-ailtural , industrial , and financial affairs are treated as the chief oncerns of the state , as if , when they are attended to , all other things will take care of themselves . It is hardly an exaggeration to affirm that during the nineteenth century political economy has been the gospel of the leading industrial nations , the deter-mining factor in individual and social life . Men have made wealth t heir divinity and its pursuit their religion . Political economy is to our age what politics was to Greece and Rome , and theology t o the Middle Ages . And when society passes from the dominant // political and theological to the economic stage , what wonder that political economy is made the social science ? Carl Marx , Friedrich Engels , and the social democracy give such an exclusive preeminence to political economy as to absorb in it the state and the whole of society . It is not strange that laborers whose existence is an unceasing struggle for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their entire social salvation . It must also be remembered that many students cone from political economy as their specialty to soci-ology , so that their sociological theories are naturally affected by their economics . Other factors have cooperated to reduce Aristotle 's " political animal " to an industrial animal , and to transform the science of economics into the science of society . The marvelous progress of natural science has given prominence to material interests and wonderfully stimulated invention ; this , together with the indus-trial development since the middle of the eighteenth century , has made ours the era of political economy . One reason for creating social science is found in the necessity of showing that man is more than a beast of burden and has other than material interests . The new science will relegate political economy to its proper place , that is , at the bottom , the founda-tion . Society in order to live and accomplish life 's purpose must have bread . We can not build without a foundation , yet the foundation is not the house ; but the importance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superstructure . Political economy is not degraded by putting it at the base instead of at the top of society . // It has been claimed that history covers essentially the same ground which sociology proposes to occupy . History , it is said , deals with all that is significant in society and has left its impress on the development of humanity , seeking to discover the social forces , following the process of social evolution , and describing the achievements of society , while the individual is considered // only so far as he leaves a permanent effect on human thought and life . History includes social action , the establishment and development of institutions , the course of politics , the theories of political economy prevalent at different times , and social phenomena in general . A specialty can be made of the organization and evolution of society among a particular people or in the world . But indispensable as history is for the student of sociology , it can not construct for him a social science . Some writers on sociology have devoted so much attention to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be made that there is little else in the subject . The student will htain the right point of view by discriminating between the aim of the historian and that of the sociologist . The former does not propose to construct but to describe systems . So long as no social Jcience exists , the historian can not determine the relation which ! vents sustain to it . He does not invent mathematics or science Dr philosophy ; only as they exist and exert an influence is it his province to give an account of them . But the sociologist does it merely describe society and seek the causes of its phenomena ; he wants to construct a social system such as has yet no historIra1 existence . His work is that of a scientist or philosopher ; from the material furnished by the historian and by observation he draws the principles of society and infers the social laws , 1 process entirely different from that whose end is historical nquiry . The historian may give an account of the philosophies f Plato , Aristotle , Kant , and Hegel ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ construct them as to become the founder sociology . As the science of society lies nowhere in history , c can not look to the historian to discover it there . That historic discipline which comes nearest covering the same ound as sociology is what the Germans call Kulturgeschichte , history of culture or of civilization . This has been developed dependently by German scholars and dates back farther than ? iology . It aims to give a history of social evolution , tracing e various stages of culture through which humanity passed ntil the present degree of civilization was attained . If by i , r ' method historic laws of development are discovered , much // that certain sociologists have particularly emphasized will be accomplished . Why can not this " culture history , " as some have claimed , take the place of sociology ? The reason given above , that sociology is not an historical discipline , furnishes the answer . The tendency to reduce it to that is , however , significant and reveals a dominant characteristic of our times . A large class of persons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in distinction from rational inquirers and philosophic thinkers . Facts are gathered and classified and statistics accumulated till we know not what to do with them ; this they regard as all that is required . Their work is essential , but only a beginning . Laws and principles and systems are not picked up from the surface of facts ; they are intellectual constructions , a philosophy of the facts . The student must be a thinker in order to become a sociologist . Those who can not distinguish between a history of culture and a system of culture , between a history and a science of society , are as rational as the empiric who takes a history of human conduct for a system of ethics . The sociologist is not merely intent on discovering what the social facts are ; he also insists on knowing what they imply ; he listens to what things say , and from this he tries to learn what they mean . Underlying the superficial trend , now so common , is the false supposition that the history of an object is its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but its history , and then imagine that they understand philosophy , a conceit which would vanish if they truly became philosophers . An intelligent study of the history of science , of theology , of law , and of other disciplines implies a knowledge of these subjects . This is true of disciplines which have a long history ; but sociology is yet to be constructed , and therefore can be still less completely studied in its history than the older disciplines . The difference between the genesis of a subject and its critical interpretation is important . Scarcely any discrimination is more essential than that between history and observation , on the one hand , and the philosophic effort which , on the other , constructs a rational system . This will become more evident in the discussion of method . Fortunately there are evidences that the day is // waning when sensation was taken for thinking , and when men feared that by an intellectual mastery of things they were in danger of losing the grip of their reality . The rational element in philosophy , science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , but interprets the fact , relates it , goes to its source and results , and thus , by its explanation , brings out the true reality in place of what only seems to be reality . It is the science of society which makes us truly the possessors of society , intellectually its masters . What has been said will not , there-fore , be taken as an indication . that we can evolve , speculatively , t rom our brains systems without facts . History receives its proper place , and this can not be the means of depreciating its importance . // Men are not , and can not be , literally united in society ; we say they are , but then we must define exactly what we mean . Their bodies are not united , their minds do not coalesce ; they remain distinct as personalities . The individual personality in the same man remains distinct from his social personality ; the strong man may at the same time grow in individuality and in sociality . In his private life ( in all that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personality of a man acts ; in society , the social personality . After what has been said , we shall not be misunderstood in stating that society consists of social person-alities as distinguished from individual or private personalities . This is only another way of saying what was said before , ? that society does not consist , strictly speaking , of individuals , but only of so much of them as is associated . " Social " we use here in the sense of all personal powers which act on others , whether cooperatively or antagonistically . In order to make clear the notion that society consists not of ( undiscriminated ) personalities but of social personalities , a new word is needed , a word to designate what men share , what asso-ciates them , what interacts as a social force . Association refers to the associative factor , and would designate what we aim to So SOCIOLOGY AND SOCIAL PROGRESS mark as distinct , were that word confined to the associative element as the essence of society . Association is , however , used for a union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are united . Rut we seek a term which rejects the old error , which gives the idea of association , but confines this association to what is actually associated . Now it happens that " sociate " is used in the same sense as " associate " ; but " sociation " is not in use . This noun we now form . We use it to designate those personal forces which interact between men ; to indicate what men share , what associates . It stands for all that makes society as distinguished from the sum of individuals . Sociation thus gives the essence of society ( that which makes society society ) , and differentiates it from all other objects . So far as the personality is concerned , this new term distinguishes between the private and the social factors in men . Sociation deals exclusively with the social personality . Regarding a man as social plus private , it has nothing to do with the latter but to eliminate it from the sphere of its inquiries . When we say that certain elements in men are extrasocial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but only that they do not belong to the social energies which constitute society . Sociation expresses the associative energies as distinct from what is not associative . In association men are conceived as the dominant factors , but in sociation the forces in men which become social arc dominant . The opposite of association is men in isolation ; the opposite of sociation is individual powers unassociated . Thus sociation always considers individuals only so far as they have associative interactive factors , leaving a large realm of the individual unconsidered . Suppose I have a dozen steel horseshoe magnets lying on my table , for the purpose of studying magnetism . How do I contemplate them ? Simply so far as they are magnets , ? so far as their poles have attractive and repulsive forces . The fact that the magnets are steel concerns me only so far as steel is related to the magnetic forces . I might consider the steel by itself , its composition , its origin , its quality , its weight , its relation to other metals , etc. ; but then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magnetism . The steel in one horseshoe does not SOCIOLOGY AND THE SOCIAL SCIENCES $ i a over to the steel in another horseshoe ; it is only the magtic force that interacts ; this I abstract from the steel itself d make the object of inquiry . I . et the twelve horseshoes represent twelve individuals . Socition does not consider them as individuals , but only that in hem which interacts between them ; it drops the individuals - individuals , for the purpose of concentrating the attention n the attractive and repulsive forces of their magnetism which constitute society . Sociation therefore deals with social energy and with individliials only as repositories of this energy . I n some cases the bond of union is so definite and simple as to be at once apparent . In a society for vocal culture or in a choir , in an art society or in a scientific association , in an economic combination or labor union , the specific and limited character of the aim and of the force exercised is unmistakable . In every Much instance , especially in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of individuals only as the possessors of the particular force used . By thus making society consist of what is actually social , really interactive , and of nothing else , we get the fundamental knowledge respecting the relation of individuals to society . Those who say that society consists of individuals , and mean what they say , can not discriminate between what is individual and what social in the same personality . If society is truly an organism of individuals , the totality of the individuals must be absorbed by the organism . Others , however , emphasize the individual to the neglect of the organism , as if he had no essential social relations . The conflict ceases so soon as society is discovered to consist only of so much of individuals as is socially interactive . Only that part of me which is literary belongs to the literary society which I help to form ; all in me that is not literary is not absorbed by the society , but belongs to another sphere . Since there is an individual ( private ) personality distinct from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an organ of society , because he is something besides such an organ ; he has elements which are not social . The individual is an organ of society in the // same sense that the Capitol in Washington is a senate chamber . It is a senate chamber , but also much more . Our view of sociation as distinct from association is proved correct by applying it to various social forms and controversies . Not only does it give new interpretations of what is otherwise obscure , but it also settles certain disputes otherwise interminable . Let us apply the explanation here given to the old dispute between individualism and socialism . The point is whether the individual or society shall be regarded as supreme . Special prominence is given to the subject in economics in connection with the laissez faire theory . So long as the individual is considered in his totality as a personality the controversy can not be settled , because as such he is independent of society and also dependent . But analyze the personality ; recognize certain elements in the man which he shares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other elements remain individual and private ; then the question is settled . It is at once seen that in that case individualism and socialism are no longer antagonistic , but each has a sphere in which it is supreme . There is a realm which belongs to a man as an individual , ? his intellect , his conscience , his feelings , his private affairs . This realm as the sphere of individual freedom and individual rights is to be guarded sacredly against intrusion and interference . Iie may be instructed and persuaded , but in these sacredly personal affairs he can not be coerced . This every just law recognizes . Here individualism reigns and must maintain its dominion . The same individual , however , has a definite relation to society , and the social elements in him are as distinctly marked as the private . As a social personality he moves in the realm where socialism reigns ; that is , social laws prevail here , just as personal or private laws in the other realm . If he wants to speak with his fellows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them or them to himself ( both processes are social ) , in order to associate with them . In other words , he must adapt himself to social laws in the social sphere . He may go as he pleases while alone , but in a crowd he must go with the crowd , or as it // secs fit to let him go . If he takes the left side of the bridge at Dresden to cross the Elbe , he is jostled by the crowd coming the other way . Every few steps he is greeted with " Rechts gehen , " and if he does not go to the right , ? on the other side of the bridge , ? a policeman may take him there , in order that he may move with and not against the multitude . This is but an illustration of the proverb that in Rome one must do as the Romans do . Since , therefore , individualism and socialism are both justified , having distinct spheres instead of being antagonistic , the old controversy as to which shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each in its specific sphere . As a principle , each becomes false and unjust only when it encroaches on the sphere of the other . The new problem which confronts us in place of the old controversy is this : How much in the personality is purely individual , a private matter and therefore a man 's own affair , which society may influence but can not control ? And how much is social , belongs to society , and therefore subject to social control ? We now have a law of universal application to the individual and to society . The individual ( so far as social ) acts on society and society acts on the individual , but the line between individual and social control is distinctly marked . Henceforth the aim should be to individualize all that is individual , and to socialize all that is social . Light is thus thrown likewise on education . The individual is to be developed to the utmost for his own sake ; education is to aim at the best personality . He has value in himself , and this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But he is also a member of society , and therefore to be educated for social ends . His individual perfection and his social perfection are to be organically united , so that his individual perfection makes him the more perfect socially , and that his social perfection exalts him as an individual . The law established applies to politics , to business , and to all social affairs . In every department we must distinguish between what is private and what social in the personality . It is one and the same personality , but viewed in different aspects ; now , ti , l U ( I ( I U ( ; : I ) ( . I , I'RU ( ; RI , ; Sself-centered , then going out into society . The demand is equally imperative that there be the greatest individuality and the most perfect sociality . Where the private and the social elements are properly harmonized the strongest individuality is likewise the strongest social power . Our analysis of the individual into private and social functions removes another common error . The statement is constantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his liberty . Only if society is false will it demand that personal liberty be sacrificed . If it is meant that in society an individual can not act as if he were isolated , the statement simply means that he can not act contrary to the nature of things . In society a man can not act as if he were out of society , for the reason that he is in it and not out of it . No true society interferes with the freedom inherent in man , but recognizes and encourages that freedom . By passing from isolation into social relations the individual changes his conditions but does not lose his freedom . Personally , in his private affairs , he is as free as ever he was ; but while he retains all the real freedom he had in isolation , his life is augmented by entering society . Besides the real freedom he retains , he now sustains social relations and enters upon social action . Indeed , we may well question whether freedom applies to men isolated . Freedom from what ? It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the face of false restraints , that freedom manifests itself . Another error has been promoted by the theory that the individual is absorbed by society . It has been claimed that individuality will disappear as socialization advances . Hardly a more serious objection could be urged against socialization . Some claim that to associate is to stoop ; but in many cases association means exaltation . Emerson says that in society " the virtue in most request is conformity " ; but by resisting foolish conformity independence is developed . Tauler said , " I never mingled with men but I came home less of a man than I went out . " All , however , are not Taulers ; his standard was that of a mystic and he naturally favored solitude ; and the society accessible may not have been of the best . // The objection that with socialization individuality vanishes is overthrown when the error on which it rests is exposed . The large sphere of individual freedom is also the sphere of individuality . To rob a man of his freedom by society would make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is enhanced by social forces backed by individuality , ? forces which prevent a dead monotony by promoting diversity in unity . The true society , which distinguishes between the private and the social elements in the personality , encourages individuality . The view.given of sociation throws important light on communism , socialism , and all forms of society . If society is composed of individuals , how can society absorb the individuals ? What is it , then , that absorbs the individuals ? There is nothing but individuals ; therefore they must absorb one another . The necessary limit of communism is what men have in common . Our explanation of society also interprets another phenomenon otherwise unaccountable . If society depends on individuals ( instead of the social factors of individuals ) , how does it happen that often persons of superior personal excellence and unusual development make but poor society ? They meet rarely , are little communicative when they do meet , further no great social interest , are perhaps indifferent even to their own community and state . The answer is that society is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elements , whose exercise may be sadly neglected . The excellent men under consideration have been developed individually but not socially ; each is imprisoned in his particular sphere and can not enter that of his fellows . Perhaps abstract scholarship so absorbs the attention that the social organism receives none . Even institutions of learning may aggregate rather than associate the professors . Thus personal superiority does not involve social superiority . What men are determines their individual character ; what they share determines their social character . The sociation of personal forces is not identical with the association of men . This distinction also throws light on history . The sociation of an era is not an absolute test of the character of that era . The men may personally be of a high grade , while the sociation // is very imperfect . Thus a generation may be rich in biography and have little history ; another generation may be rich in history and poor in biography . A thousand strong men isolated receive no attention in history , while much attention may be given to a thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a country may be passed without mention by the historian ; organized they may form the dominant historic current . In order to compare one generation with another we must inquire into the progress made by sociation in them . A thousand separate wires may be invisible at a short distance , or so scattered that only one is seen at a time ; but wrought into a single coil , it is distinctly visible and of immense power ; yet each wire taken by itself is no stronger than before . There are degrees of isolation and sociation in different ages , and they are important tests of the ages themselves . There is an age of Louis XIV , because sociation in general was so imperfect ; hence by a single name that age is characterized in France . Then the sociation of revolutionary forces took place , and the French Revolution stands not for a name but for the volcanic energies of an infuriated people . The view given of sociation shows why all attempts to apprehend society as an entity or a discrete object have failed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animal . It is something very real , but not an indissoluble unit . It consists of forces which change constantly . Individuals come and go , their social energies vary , and thus society itself is subject to change . Sometimes the social mechanism is so fixed that there is a certain continuity even amid great changes of individuals , as in certain churches , states , and institutions . When we speak of the Catholic Church we mean a system of theoretical and practical energies ( doctrines , institutions , practices ) ; and the millions who belong to that church we think of as Catholic only so far as they are the embodiment of these energies . Having now given an explanation of sociation and its relation to the ordinary sense of association , it will henceforth be understood what we mean when we use the old terms and speak of society as composed of individuals . When we have spoken thus // in preceding pages , the sense , after the explanation given , can-not he mistaken . Let association be used , but let it mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to treat society as a system of forces ; but practice will overcome the difficulty , and he will soon wonder how he could ever imagine that society con-sisted of individuals as totalities , instead of the social energies of individuals . PART II SOCIOLOGY AS A STUDY OF SOCIAL PROGRESS-THE DIRECTION OF SOCIAL PROGRESS V SOCIAL DYNAMICS ; OR THEORY OF THE NATURAL // THE ORDER OF EVOLUTION Though the elements of our social evolution are connected and always acting on each other , one must be preponderant , in order to give an impulse to the rest , though they may , in their turn , so act upon it as to cause its further expansion : We must find out this superior element , leaving the lower degrees of sub-ordination to disclose themselves as we proceed ; and we have not to search far for this clement , as we can not err in taking that which can be best conceived of apart from the rest , notwith-standing their necessary connection , while the consideration of it would enter into the study of the others . This double @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If the intellectual point of view was the chief in our statical study of the organism , much more must it be so in the dynamical case . If our reason required at the outset the awak-ening and stimulating influence of the appetites , the passions , and the sentiments , not the less has human progression gone for-ward under its direction . It is only through the more and more marked influence of the reason over the general conduct of man and of society that the gradual march of our race has attained that // regularity and persevering continuity which distinguishes it so radically from the desultory and barren expansion of even the highest of the animal orders , which share , and with enhanced strength , the appetites , the passions , and even the primary sentiments of man . If the statical analysis of our social organism shows it resting at length upon a certain system of fundamental opinions , the gradual changes of that system must affect the successive modifications 9f the life of humanity ; and this is why , since the birth of philosophy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the history of the human mind . As it is necessary , in a scientific sense , to refer our historical analysis to the preponderant evolution , whatever it may be , we must in this case choose , or rather preserve , the general history of the human mind as the natural guide to all historical study of humanity . One consequence of the same principle ? a consequence as rigorous but less understood ? is that we must choose for consideration in this intellectual history the most general and abstract conceptions , which require the exercise of our highest faculties . Thus it is the study of the fundamental system of human opinions with regard to the whole of phenomena ? in short , the history of philosophy , whatever may be its character , theological , metaphysical , or positive ? which must regulate our historical analysis . No other department of intellectual history , not even the history of the fine arts , including poetry , could , however important in itself , be employed for this object ; because the faculties of expression , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their palmiest days , been subordinated , in the economy of social progress , to the faculties of direct conception . The danger ( which is inherent in every choice , and which is least in the choice that I have made ) of losing sight of the interconnection of all the parts of human development may be partly guarded against by frequently comparing them , to see if the variations in any one corresponds with equivalent variations in the others . I believe we shall find that this confirmation is eminently obtainable by my method of historical analysis . This will be proved at once if we find that the development of the highest part of human interests is in accordance with that of the lowest , // ? the intellectual with the material . If there is an accordance between the two extremes , there must be also between all the intermediate terms . We have indicated the general direction of the human evolution , its rate of progress , and its necessary order . We may now proceed at once to investigate the natural laws by which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principle of the theory appears to me to consist in the great philosophical law of the succession of the three states , ? the primitive theological state , the transient metaphysical , and the final positive state , ? through which the human mind has to pass in every kind of speculation . This seems to be the place in which we should attempt the direct estimate of this fundamental law , taking it as the basis of my historical analysis , which must itself have for its chief object to explain and expand the general notion of this law by a more and more extended and exact application of it in the review of the entire past of human history . I hope that the frequent statement and application of this law throughout the preceding part of my work will enable me to condense my demonstration of it here , without impairing its distinctness or injuring its efficacy in such ulterior use as we shall have to make of it . LAW OF THE THREE PERIODS The reader is by this time abundantly familiar with the interpretation and destination of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its operation in individual development , from infancy to manhood , as I pointed out at the beginning of this work . We can test it , as we have tested other laws , by observation , experiment , and comparison . I have done so through many years of meditation , and I do not hesitate to say that all these methods of investigation will be found to concur in the complete establishment of this historical proposition , which I maintain to be as fully demonstrated as any other law admitted into any other department of natural philosophy . Since the discovery of this law of the three periods , all positive philosophers have agreed on its special adaptation to the particular science in // which each was interested , though all have not made the avowal with equal openness . The only objections that I have encountered have related merely to the universality of its application . I hold it to be now implicitly recognized with regard to all the sciences which are positive ; that is , the triple evolution is admitted in regard to all cases in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to social science that its application is supposed to be impossible ; and I believe the objection to signify nothing more than that the evolution is in this case incomplete . Social science has , with all its complexity , passed through the theological state , and has almost everywhere fully attained the metaphysical ; while it has nowhere yet risen to the positive , except in this book . I shall leave the assertion of the law in regard to sociology to the demonstration which my analysis will afford , for those who can not perceive in this volume , as a whole , the nascent realization of this last philosophical process could not be convinced by argument . Leaving the historical verification of the law , therefore , to the reader , I invite attention to its philosophical explanation . It is not enough that the succession of the three states is a general fact . Such generality would go for more in any other science than in sociology , because , as we have seen , our biological philosophy enables us to conceive of all the main relations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigation , and we need confirmation of our conceptions by direct knowledge of human nature and experience . An a priori conception of a law so important as this is of the deepest interest in the study of social dynamics ; and , to . confirm it , we must carefully mark the general grounds , derived from an exact knowledge , which have rendered indispensable on the one hand , and inevitable on the other , that succession of social phenomena which take their course under the operation of this law . The logical grounds have already been assigned at the outset of the work , and repeatedly since ; and it is with the moral and social that we now have to do , and we can review them without subjecting ourselves to the reproach of severing the parts of a philosophical demonstration , which are in their nature bound up together and therefore inseparable . // THE THEOLOGICAL PERIOD The necessity of the intellectual evolution I assert lies in the primary tendency of man to transfer the sense of his own nature into the radical explanation of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of knowing ourselves ; but this is a remark which could not have been made till human reason had achieved a considerable advance . The mind must have attained to a refined state of meditation before it could be astonished at its own acts , ? reflecting upon itself a speculative activity which must be at first incited by the external world . If , on the one hand , man must begin by supposing himself the center of all things , he must , on the other hand , next set himself up as a universal type . The only way that he can explain any phenomena is by likening them , as much as possible , to his own acts , ? the only ones whose mode of production he can suppose himself , by the accompanying sensations , to understand . We may therefore set up a converse statement and say that man knows nothing but himself ; and thus his philosophy , in his earliest stage , consists principally in transferring this spontaneous unity , more or less fortunately , into all subjects which may present themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his philosophical maturity when he can , at length , apply the study of external nature to his own . When I laid this down as the basis of biological philosophy I intimated the extreme rarity of such an attainment . At the outset , under the inverse process , the universe is always subordinated to man in speculative as well as in active respects . We shall not have attained a truly rational position till we can reconcile these two great philosophical views , at present antagonistic , but admitting of being made mutually complementary , and , in my opinion , prepared for being so from this time forward . Such a harmony is even now barely conceivable in the brightest insight of philosophical genius , and there could have been no choice between the two courses in the earliest days of human development . The starting point must have been that which alone was naturally possible . This was the spontaneous origin of the theological philosophy , the elementary // spirit of which consists in explaining the intimate nature of phenomena and their mode of production , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acts of human will , through our primary tendency to regard all beings as living a life analogous to our own , and often superior , from their greater habitual energy . This procedure is so eminently exclusive that men are , unable to emancipate themselves from it , even in the most advanced stages of evolution , except by abandoning altogether these inaccessible researches and restricting themselves to the study of the laws of phenomena , apart from their causes . Whenever , at this day , the human mind attempts to pass these inevitable limits , it involuntarily falls again into the primary errors , even in regard to the simplest phenomena , because it recurs to an aim and point of view essentially analogous , in attributing the production of phenomena to special volitions internal or more or less external . One case presents itself as an example , of the simplest scientific character , ? that of the memorable philosophical error of the illustrious Malebranche in regard to the explanation of the mathematical laws of the elementary collision of solid bodies . If such a mind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in no other way than by an express recurrence to the continuous activity of a direct and special providence , we can not doubt the tendency of our reason towards a radically theological philosophy whenever we attempt to penetrate , on any ground whatever , the intimate nature of phenomena . INTELLECTUAL INFLUENCE OF THE THEOLOGICAL PHILOSOPHY The inevitableness of the theological philosophy is its most radical property and the first cause of its long ascendency . We have seen before that it was necessary , as the only possible beginning of our intellectual evolution , for the facts which must form the basis of a positive theory could not be collected to any purpose without some preliminary theory which should guide their collection . Our understanding can not act without some doctrine , false or true , vague or precise , which may concentrate and stimulate its efforts and afford ground for enough speculative // continuity to sustain our mental activity . Our meteorological observations , as we call them , show us how useless may be vast compilations of facts , and how really unmeaning , while we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the theory will be suggested by the facts do not understand what is the course necessarily pursued by the human mind , which has achieved all real results by the only effectual method , ? of anticipating scientific observations by some conception ( hypothetical in the first instance ) of the corresponding phenomena . Such a necessity has already been shown to be especially marked in the case of social speculations , not only from their complexity but from the peculiarity that a long preparatory development of the human mind and of society constitutes the phenomena of the case , independently of all preparation of observers and all accumulation of observations . It may be worth observing that all the partial verifications of this fundamental proposition that we meet with in the different sciences confirm each other , on account of our tendency to unity of method and homogeneousness of doctrine , which would incline us to extend the theological philosophy from one class of speculations to another , even if we should not so treat each one of them separately . The original and indispensable office of the theological philosophy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vicious circle in which it was confined by the two necessities of observing first in order to form conceptions and of forming theories first in order to observe . The theological philosophy afforded an issue by likening all phenomena whatever to human acts , ? directly in the first instance , by supposing all bodies to have a life more or less like our own , and indirectly afterwards by means of the more durable and suggestive hypothesis which adds to the visible system of things an invisible world peopled by superhuman agents , who occasion all phenomena by their action on matter otherwise inert . The second stage is especially suitable to the human mind which begins to feel its difficulties and its needs ; for every new phenomenon is accounted for by the supposition of a fresh volition in the ideal agent concerned , or , at most , by the easy creation of a new agent . However futile these // speculations may now appear , we must remember that in all times and everywhere they have awakened human thought by offering to it the only material which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no choice , the infant reason can be interested by nothing but sublime solutions obtained without any deep and sustained conflict of thought . We at this day find ourselves able after suitable training to devote ourselves to the study of the laws of phenomena , without heed to their first and final causes ; but still we detect ourselves occasionally yielding to the infantine curiosity which pretends to a power of knowing the origin and the end of all things . But such severity of reason as we are capable of has become attainable only since the accumulation of our knowledge has yielded us a rational hope of finally discovering the natural laws that were altogether out of reach in the early states of the human mind ; and the only alternative from total inactivity was , in those days , in the pursuit of the inaccessible subjects which are represented by the theological philosophy . The moral and social grounds of this philosophy were as necessary as the intellectual . Its moral influence was to inspire man with confidence enough for action , by animating him with a sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the contrast between the actual powers of man in an infant state and the indefinite control which he aspires to exercise over external nature , just as there is in his expectation of understanding matters which are inaccessible to reason . The practical and the speculative expectation alike belong to the theological philosophy . Supposing all phenomena to be regulated by superhuman will , man may hope to modify the universe by his desires , ? not by his personal resources but by the access which he believes himself to have to the imaginary beings whose power is unlimited ; whereas , if he was aware from the beginning that the universe is subject to invariable laws , the certainty that he could no more influence than understand them would so discourage him that he would remain forever in his original apathy , intellectual and moral . We find ourselves able to dispense with supernatural aid in our difficulties and sufferings , in proportion as we obtain a gradual control over nature by a knowledge of her // laws- ; but the early races of men were in an opposite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , only from above , and through the illusion of an illimitable power residing there , which could on any occasion afford them irresistible aid . I am not referring now to any hope of a future life . We shall see presently that it was not till a much later period that that hope exercised any important social influence ; and even in more recent times we shall find that the effect of the religious spirit on the conduct of human life proceeds much more from belief in actual and special immediate aid than from the uniform perspective of a remote future existence . This seems to me the leading aspect of the remarkable state which is produced in the human brain by the important intellectual and moral phenomenon of prayer , the admirable properties of which , when it has attained its full physiological efficacy , are very manifest in the earliest stage of progress . After a long decline of the religious spirit the notion of miracle was naturally formed , to characterize the events which had become exceptional and were attributed to divine intervention ; but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had become familiar , and even preponderant , because the only sense of miracle was a transient suspension of natural laws . While the theological philosophy was all in all , there were no miracles , because everything was equally marvelous , as we see by the artless descriptions of ancient poetry , in which the commonest incidents are mixed up with the most monstrous prodigies , and undergo analogous explanations . Minerva intervenes to pick up the whip of a warrior in military games , as well as to protect him against a whole army ; and in our own time the devotee , is as importunate in praying for his smallest personal convenience as for the largest human interests . In all ages the priest has been more occupied with the solicitations of his flock about immediate favors of Providence than with their care for their eternal state . However this may be , we see that it is a radical property of the theological philosophy to be the sole support and stimulus of man 's moral courage , as well as the awakener and director of his intellectual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of man to this philosophy , that // the affective influence comes in to fortify the speculative . Feeble ss are the intellectual organs , relatively considered , the attractive oral perspective of an unbounded power of modifying the unirse by the aid of supernatural protectors must have been most Important in exciting mental action . In our advanced state of scientific progress we can conceive of the perpetual pursuit of knowledge for the sake of the satisfaction of intellectual activity , joined to the tranquil pleasure which arises from the discovery of truth ; yet it is doubtful whether such natural stimulus as this would always suffice without collateral instigations of glory , of ambition , or of lower and stronger passions , except in the case of a very few lofty minds , ? and with them only after training in the requisite habits . And nothing of this kind can be supposed possible in the early days , when the intellect is torpid and feeble and scarcely accessible to the strongest stimulus ; nor yet after-wards , when science is so far advanced as to have attained some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mental activity can be sustained by nothing short of the fictions of the theological philosophy about the supremacy of man and his unbounded empire over external nature , as we have seen in regard to astrology and alchemy . In our own time , when there are enlightened men who hold such delusions in regard to social speculations alone , we see how irrationally they expect to modify at will the whole course of political phenomena , in which they could not take any adequate scientific interest without such an expectation.l What we see of the influence of this view in main-taining the old polities may give us some faint idea of its power when it pervaded every part of the intellectual system and illu-sion beset the reason of man whichever way he turned . Such then was the moral operation of the theological philosophy , ? stimulating man 's active energy by the offer , in the midst of the troubles of his infantine state , of absolute empire over the exter-nal world , as the prize of his speculative efforts . // SOCIAL INFLUENCES OF THE THEOLOGICAL PHILOSOPHY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the following chapters , so that we may dismiss them now with a very short notice , important as they are , and the more easily because this class of evidences is the most indisputable of the three . There arc two views which must be considered in relation to the high social office of the theological philosophy : first , its function in organizing society ; and , next , its provision for the permanent existence of a speculative class . As to the first , we must perceive that the formation of any society , worthy to be so called , supposes a system of common opinions such as may restrain individual eccentricity ; and such an influence , if needful now , when men are bound together by such a concurrence of obligations as high civilization introduces , must be absolutely indispensable in the infancy of society , when families adhere to each other so feebly by means of relations as precarious as they are defective . No concurrence of interests , nor even sympathy in sentiment , can give durability to the smallest society , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such discordance as must inevitably arise . It has been shown that , indolent as our intellectual faculties are in comparison with the others , reason must rule not only domestic but also social and yet more political life ; for through it alone can there be any organization of that reaction of society on the individual which appoints the function of government and absolutely requires a system of common opinions about nature and man . Such a system , then , is a. political necessity , and especially in the infancy of society . But , on the other hand , we must admit that the human mind , having thus furnished a basis for social organization , must depend for its further development on society itself , whose expansion is really inseparable from that of human intelligence . Here we see that society is in a vicious circle in a political as well as a logical view , through the opposition of two equal necessities ; and here again the only possible issue is afforded by the theological philosophy . It directs the first social organization as it forms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by forming such a system . // cause we see it now in such a state of decomposition that its lvocates lose sight of the unity of opinions that it once secured , nd are themselves involved in intellectual discordance , we must not forget how , in those days of vigor by which it must be judged , it established an intellectual communion which constituted its most remarkable political function . The police consideration f a future life is wrongly attributed to this period of human society . It arose long after , and was of very inferior importance to the intellectual agreement which preceded it ; and its operation would not be so erroneously exaggerated but that religion has so far faded out of men 's minds as to leave no other strong habitual remembrance than of its grossest impressions . INSTITUTION OF A SPECULATIVE CLASS Another way in which the theological philosophy was politically indispensable to human progress was by instituting , in the midst of society , a special class regularly devoted to speculative activity . In this view the social supremacy of the theological philosophy has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t r us to form any but an indirect idea of the difficulty of establishing , in the earliest period of society , any permanent division I ) etween theory and practice , such as is effected by the existence of a class regularly occupied with speculation . Even now , amidst all the refinement of our mental habits , we find extreme difficulty in duly estimating any new operation which has no immediate practical bearing ; and by this we may imperfectly understand how impossible it was , in the remotest ages , to institute among populations of warriors and slaves a corporation that should be disengaged from military and industrial employments , and whose activity should be mainly of an intellectual kind . Such a class could , in those times , have been neither established nor tolerated if it had not been introduced in the natural course of social movement and invested with authority beforehand by the influence of the theological philosophy . Thus the political function of that philosophy was to establish a speculative body whose social existence not only admitted of no preparatory discussion but was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all other classes . Whatever might have been the confusion of intellectual labor and the inanity of the leading investigations of the sacerdotal orders , it is not the less true that the human mind owes to them the first effectual separation between theory and practice , which could take place in no other manner . Mental progress , by which all other progress is directed , would certainly have been destroyed at its birth , if society had continued to be composed of families engaged in the cares of material existence , or , as the only alternative , in the excitement of a brutal military activity . Any spiritual expansion supposes the existence of a privileged class , enjoying the leisure indispensable to intellectual culture , and at the same time urged , by its social position , to develop to the utmost the kind of speculative activity compatible with the primitive state of humanity ; and this description is answered by the sacerdotal institution established by the theological philosophy . Though , in the decrepitude of the old philosophy , we see the theological class sunk in mental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activity in the days of its prime , human society would have remained in a condition much like that of a company of superior monkeys . By forming this speculative class , then , the theological philosophy fulfilled the political conditions of a further progression of the human mind . Such are the qualities , intellectual , moral , and social , which secured the supremacy of the theological philosophy at the outset of human progress . This is the only part of my sociological demonstration which is at all open to dispute , and this is one reason why I have dwelt so long upon it , but it is not the only reason . Another and a greater is that this view contains the radical principle of the whole demonstration , the remainder of which will not detain us long . THE POSITIVE STAGE If this starting point of human development has been placed beyond dispute , the final or positive stage does not admit of it . We have seen enough of the establishment of the positive philosophy in other departments to be satisfied of its destined // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which explain and l i . t i ly the early supremacy of the theological philosophy we see t hat it must be a provisional state , for its supremacy was owing to its aptitude to meet the needs of a primitive state of humanity ; and those needs are not the same , nor requiring the same philosophy to satisfy them , as those which arise in a more advanced stage of human evolution . After having awakened human ' reason and superintended its progress ii the absence of a more real philosophy , theology began to repress the human mind from the first moment of its coming into direct antagonism with the positive philosophy . And in the same way , in its moral relations , it imparted at first a consolatory confidence and active energy , which have become transmuted , by too long a duration , into oppressive terror and a faint apathy which have been too common a spectacle , since it has been driven to struggle to retain its hold instead of extending its dominion . There is no more question of the moral than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ philosophy , capable as it is of developing in us an unshaken vigor and a deliberate steadfastness , directly derived from our own nature , without any external assistance or any imaginary hindrance . And again , in regard to its social bearings , though the ascendency of the theological philosophy lasted longer on this ground than on the other two , it is evident enough at present that instead of uniting men , which was its proper function at first , it now divides them , so that after having created speculative activity it has ended with radically hindering it . The function of reuniting , as of stimulating and directing , belongs more and more , as religious belief declines , to the conceptions of positive philosophy , which alone can establish that intellectual community all over the world on which the great future political organization is to be grounded . The intellectual destination of the two philosophies has been sufficiently established in our review of all the departments of natural philosophy . Their moral and social destination will be illustrated in succeeding chapters of this volume . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one and the corresponding rise of the other , from the earliest period of human progression . // It may appear paradoxical to regard the theological philosophy as in a steadily declining state intellectually , at the very time that it was fulfilling its most exalted mission ; but we shall find satisfactory scientific evidence that Catholicism , its noblest social work , must necessarily be its last effort , on account of the germs of disorganization which must thenceforth grow more and more rapidly . We need here , therefore , only assign the general principle of the inevitable tendency of the human mind toward an exclusive positive philosophy ttroughout the whole range of the intellectual system . ATTEMPTED UNION OF THE Two PHILOSOPHIES The general , like the individual , human mind is governed by imagination first , and then , after a sufficient exercise of the faculties at large , more and more by reason . The same grounds on which the process takes place in the individual case determine that of the whole species ; and with the more certainty and power on account of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the theological philosophy once was , it is certain that such a method of philosophizing was resorted to only because no other was possible . Wherever there has been a choice in regard to any subject whatever , man has always preferred the study of the laws of phenomena to that of their primary causes , though prior training , which there has been no rational education adapted to counteract , has often occasioned a lapse into his old illusions . Theological philosophy has , however , never been absolutely universal ; that is , the simplest and commonest facts in all classes of phenomena have always been supposed subject to natural laws , and not to the arbitrary will of supernatural agents . Adam Smith made the remark that there never was , in any age or country , a god of weight . In more complex cases , if only the relations of phenomena are seen to be invariable , the most superficial observer recognizes the presence of law . Even among moral and social phenomena , where the entrance of positive philosophy has been interdicted , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural laws , in // order to conduct the common affairs of life ; for all forecast would be impossible if we supposed every incident to be ascribable to supernatural agency , and no other resource therefore possible than prayer , for influencing ' the course of human actions . It is even noticeable that the principle of the theological philosophy itself lies in the transference of the first beginnings of the laws of human action to the phenomena of external nature ; and thus the germ of the positive philosophy is at least as primitive as that of the theological philosophy itself , though it could not expand till a much later time . This idea is very important to the perfect rationality of our sociological theory , because , as human life can never present any real creation , but only a gradual evolut ion , the final spread of the positive spirit would be scientifically incomprehensible , if we could not trace its rudiments from the very beginning . From that scarcely appreciable presence at the beginning , the rise of the positive spirit has been recognizable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the theological philosophy has been slowly but steadily driven back within the narrowing limits of phenomena whose natural laws were still unknown . Thus was the function of the old philosophy clearly a provisional one , ? to maintain our mental activity by the only exercise open to it till the positive philosophy should usher it into the wide field of universal knowledge made accessible to the whole race . This destination has only recently exhibited itself in an unquestionable way since the disclosure of natural laws in phenomena so numerous and so various as to suggest the necessary existence of analogous laws in all other departments , however remote their actual discovery may be . It does not follow , from anything that I have said , that the two philosophies were always visibly opposed to each other . On the contrary the physical study must have succumbed to the theological spirit if they had seemed at the outset to be incompatible . In fact , the study of the laws of phenomena appeared , for a long course of time , to agree very well with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became more connected , and disclosed important relations , that the radical opposition of the two doctrines began to be felt . Before the I04 SOCIOLOGY AND SOCIAL PROGRESS antagonism was avowed the positive spirit manifested its repugnance to the futile absolute explanations of the theological philosophy , and the theological spirit lavished its disdain on the circumspect march and modest investigations of the new school , while still there was no idea that the study of real laws was irreconcilable with that of the essential causes . When natural laws of considerable scope were at length discovered , the incompatibility became clear between the preponderance of imagination and that of reason , between the absolute spirit and the relative , and , above all , between the ancient hypothesis of the sovereign direction of events by an arbitrary will and the growing certainty that we can foresee and modify them by the rational access of human wisdom . It is only in our own time that the antagonism has been extended to all parts of the intellectual field ; and even up to the last moment the students of special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of natural laws , and paying no attention to the nature of beings and mode of production of phenomena , they might find physical researches compatible with the explanations of theology ; while theology made its own concessions in the form of a provisional notion of a universal providence , combined with special laws which it had imposed on itself . The conduct of Catholicism in interdicting the habitual use of miracle and prophecy , which prevailed so largely in ancient times , seems to me to present in religious affairs a transient situation analogous to that which is exhibited by what is called the institution of constitutional monarchy in the political world , each being in its own way an indisputable symptom of decline . However this may be , the insufficiency of the theological philosophy manifests itself to popular observation in that form of popular evidence which can alone reach the majority of mankind , ? in its comparison with its opponent in the application of means . The positive philosophy enables us to foresee and to modify natural events , and thus satisfies more and more , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while the ancient philosophy remains barren ; so that its fanciful explanations are more and more neglected , while the new philosophy obtains a perpetually // firmer hold on the public reason . Those who have remained faithful to their attachment to the theological philosophy make no practical use of it in their daily life and ground their predilection for it on its characteristic generality , so that when its antagonist shall have become systematized as fully as it is destined to be , the ancient philosophy will have lost the last attribute which has ever entitled it to social supremacy . THE METAPHYSICAL PERIOD We have now only to take a cursory survey of the intermediate state . I have pointed out more than once before , that any intermediate state can be judged of only after a precise analysis of the two extremes . The present case is a remarkable illustration of this necessity ; for , if it is once admitted that the human mind must set out from the theological state and arrive certainly at the positive , we may easily understand how it must pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to afford a transition from the one to the other . The bastard and mobile character of the metaphysical philosophy fits it for this office , as it reconciles , for a time , the radical opposition of the other two , adapting itself to the gradual decline of the one and the preparatory rise of the other , so as to spare our dislike of abrupt change and to afford us a transition almost imperceptible . The metaphysical philosophy takes possession of the speculative field after the theological has relinquished it and before the positive is ready for it ; so that in each particular case the dispute about the supremacy of any of the three philosophies is reduced to the mere question of opportuneness , judged by a rational examination of the development of the human mind . The method of modification consists in substituting gradually the entity for a deity when religious conceptions become so generalized as to diminish perpetually the number of supernatural agents as well as their active intervention , and at length arrive , professedly if not really , at rigorous unity . When supernatural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the phenomenon to a mysterious entity at first emanating io6 SOCIOLOGY AND SOCIAL PROGRESS from itself , but to which daily custom trains the human mind tu refer more and more exclusively the production of each event . This strange process has favored the withdrawal of supernatural causes and the exclusive consideration of phenomena , ? that is , the decline of the theological and the rise of the positive spirit . Beyond this the general character of this philosophy is that of the theological , of which it is only a modification , though the chief . It has an inferior intellectual consistency and a much less intense social power ; so that it is much better adapted for a critical function than for any real organization ; and it is those very qualities which disable it for resistance to the growth of the positive spirit . On the one hand , the increasing subtlety of metaphysical speculations is forever reducing their characteristic entities to mere abstract denominations of the corresponding phenomena , so as to render their own impotence ridiculous when they attempt explanations , ? a thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degree , with purely theological forms . On the other hand , its deficiency of organizing power , in consequence of its radical inconsistency , must prevent its maintaining any such political struggle as theology maintained against the spread of positive social philosophy . However , it obtains a respite by its own equivocal and mobile nature , which enables it to escape from rational discussion even more than the theological philosophy itself , while the positive spirit is as yet too imperfectly generalized to be able to attack the only substantial ground of their common authority , ? the universality which they can boast but , which it has not . However this may be , we must admit the aptitude of metaphysics to sustain provisionally our speculative activity on all subjects till it can receive more substantial aliment , at the same time carrying us over from the theological regime further and further in the direction of the positive . The same aptitude appears in its political action . Without overlooking the serious intellectual and moral dangers which distinguish the metaphysical philosophy , its transitional quality accounts to us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most advanced societies , which can not but have an instinctive sense of some indispensable office to be fulfilled by // such a philosophy in the evolution of humanity . The irresistible necessity of this temporary phase is thus on all grounds as uniuestionable as it could be prior to the direct analysis to which it will be subjected in the course of our historical review . COEXISTENCE OF THE THREE PERIODS During the whole of our survey of the sciences I have endeavored to keep in view the great fact that all the three states , theological , metaphysical , and positive , may and do exist at the same time in the same mind in regard to different sciences . I must once more recall this consideration and insist upon it , because in the forgetfulness of it lies the only real objection that can be brought against the grand law of the three states . It must be steadily kept in view that the same mind may be in the positive state with regard to the most simple and general sciences , in the metaphysical with regard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theological with regard to social science , which is so complex and special as to have hitherto taken no scientific form at all . Any apparent contradiction must certainly arise , even if it could be shown to exist from the imperfection of our hierarchical arrangement , and not from the law of evolution itself . This once fully understood , the law itself becomes our guide in further investigation , as every proved theory does , by showing us by anticipation what phenomena to look for and how to use those which arise ; and it supplies the place of direct exploration when we have not the necessary means of investigation . We shall find that by this law alone can the history of the human mind be rendered intelligible . Having convinced ourselves of its efficacy in regard to all other sciences , and in interpreting all that has yet come to pass in human history , we must adhere to it steadily in analyzing the present and in forming such anticipation of the future as sociology , being a real science , enables us to rely upon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have only now to show that material development as a whole must follow a course not only analogous but perfectly correspondent with that of intellectual development , which as we have seen governs every other . IO8 SOCIOLOGY AND SOCIAL PROGRESS CORRESPONDING MATERIAL DEVELOPMENT All political investigation of a rational kind proves the primitive tendency of mankind in a general way to a military life , and to its final issue in an industrial life . No enlightened mind disputes the continuous decline of the military spirit and the gradual ascendency of the industrial . We see now under various forms and more and more indisputably , even in the very heart of armies , the repugnance of modern society to a military life . We see that compulsory recruiting becomes more and more necessary , and that there is less and less voluntary persistence in that mode of life . Notwithstanding the immense exceptional development of military activity which was occasioned by anomalous circumstances at the beginning of the present century , our industrial and pacific instincts have returned to their regular course of expansion , so as to render @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though the peace of Europe must often appear to be endangered through the provisional deficiency of any systematic organization of international relations , ? a cause which though insufficient to produce war keeps us in a state of frequent uneasiness . We need not then go over again the proof of the first and last terms of the evolution , which will be abundantly illustrated by the historical analysis that I shall offer . We have only to refer the facts of human experience to the essential laws of human nature and the necessary conditions of social development , ? a scientific procedure which has never yet been attempted . PRIMITIVE MILITARY LIFE As long as primitive man was averse to all regular toil , the military life alone furnished a field for his sustained activity . Apart from cannibalism , it offered the simplest means of subsistence . However deplorable the necessity , its universal prevalence and continuous development , even after subsistence might have been obtained by other means , proves that the military seg-ime must have had some indispensable , though provisional , office to fulfill in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // only one under which human industry could make a beginning , ? in the same way that the scientific spirit could not have arisen without the protection of the religious . The industrial spirit supposed the existence of a considerable social development , such as could not have taken place till isolated families had been connected by the pursuits of war . The social and yet more the political properties of military activity are , in their early stages , perfectly clear and decisive , and , in short , fully appropriate to the high civilizing function which they had to fulfill . It was thus that habits of regularity and discipline were instituted and the families of men were brought into association for warlike expeditions or for their common defense . The objects of association could not possibly be more obvious or urgent , nor the elementary conditions of concurrence more irresistible . In no other school could a primitive society learn order , as we may see at this day in the case of those types of ancient humanity , ? the exceptional individuals who can not now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the military spirit was indispensable not only to the original consolidation of political society but yet more to its continuous extension , which could not otherwise have taken place but with excessive slowness ; and such extension was , to a certain degree , indispensable to the final development of human industry . Thus , then , we find humanity involved in the same kind of vicious circle with regard to its temporal as we saw it to be with regard to its spiritual progress ; and in both cases an issue was afforded by the fortunate expansion of a preliminary tendency . In fact , the necessary basis of the military regime has everywhere been the individual slavery of the producing class , by which warriors were allowed the full and free development of their activity . We shall see hereafter that the great social operation which was to be accomplished in due time by the continuous progression of a military system , powerfully instituted and wisely carried out , must have failed in its earliest stages . We shall also see how this ancient slavery was the necessary preparation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imposing on the majority of the race , irresistibly and exclusively , that toil to which man is constitutionally averse , though an ultimate condition of IIo SOCIOLOGY AND SOCIAL PROGRESS laborious perseverance was in store for all . To view the case without prejudice we must transport ourselves to those primitive times , and not regard the slavery of that age with the just horror with which we view that of modern times , ? the colonial slavery of our day , which is truly a social monstrosity , existing as it does in the heart of an industrial period , subjecting the laborer to the capitalist in a manner equally degrading to both . The ancient slavery was of the producer to the warrior , and it tended to develop their respective energies so as to occasion their final concurrence in the same social progression . THE MILITARY REGIME PROVISIONAL Necessary as this military regime was , it was not the less merely provisional . While industrial activity has the fine quality of bearing the most energetic extension among all individuals and nations without making the rise of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evident that the exaltation of the military life among any considerable portion of the race must occasion the restriction of all the rest ; this being , in fact , the proper function of the regime in regard to the whole field of civilization . Thus , while the industrial period comprehends the whole term of human progress under natural laws , ? that is , the whole future that we can conceive of , ? the military period could last no longer than the formation of those preparatory conditions which it was its function to create . This end was attained when the chief part of the civilized world was at length united under the same rule ; that is , in regard to Europe , when Rome had completed its conquests . From that time forward military activity had neither object nor aliment ; and from that time forward , therefore , it declined , so as no longer to disguise that gradual rise of the industrial spirit which had been preparing during the interval . But , notwithstanding this connection , the industrial state was so radically different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in the same way that , in the spiritual evolution , an intermediate term was required between the theological and the positive spirit . In both cases the middle phase SOCIAL DYNAMICS III was fluctuating and equivocal . We shall see hereafter that , in t he temporal case , it consisted , first , in a substitution of a defensive for an offensive military organization , and afterwards in an involuntary general subordination , more and more marked , of the military spirit to the instinct of production . This transitory phase being the one in which we live , its proper nature , vague as it is , can be estimated by direct intuition . Such is the temporal evolution briefly surveyed in its three periods . No philosophical mind can help being struck by , the analogy between this indisputable progression and our primary law of succession of the three states of the human mind . But our sociological demonstration requires that we should establish the connection between them by exhibiting the natural affinity which has always existed , first between the theological and the military spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequently , between the two transient functions of the metaphysicians and the legists . This elucidation will impart the last degree of precision and consistency to my demonstration , and will thus establish it as the rational basis of the entire historical analysis which will follow . AFFINITY BETWEEN THE THEOLOGICAL AND MILITARY REGIME The occasional rivalry between the theological power and the military , which history presents , has sometimes disguised their radical affinity , even in the eyes of philosophers . But , if we consider , there can be no real rivalry but among the different elements of the same political system , in consequence of that spontaneous emulation which , in all cases of human concurrence , must become more earnest and extensive as the end is more important and indirect , and therefore the means more distinct and independent , without the participation , voluntary or instinctive , being thereby prevented . When two powers equally energetic rise , increase , and decline together , notwithstanding the difference of their natures , we may be assured that they belong to the same regime , whatever may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it takes place between // two elements employed in analogous functions , and when the gradual growth of the one coincides with the continuous decline of the other . As to the present case , it is evident that in any political system there must be an incessant rivalry between the speculative and the active powers , which , through the imperfection of our nature , must often be inclined to ignore their necessary coordination and to disdain the general limits of their reciprocal attributes . Notwithstanding the social affinity between science and industry , we must look for similar conflict between them hereafter , in proportion to the political ascendency which they will obtain together . We see signs of it already in the intellectual and moral antipathy of science to the natural inferiority of these labors of industry which yet are the means of wealth , and in the instinctive repugnance of industry to the abstraction which characterizes science , and to the just pride by which it is animated . Having dispatched these objections , we may now contemplate the strong bond which unites the theological and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt and honored by all enlightened men who have borne a part in either , notwithstanding the passions of political rivalry . It is plain that no military system could arise and endure without the countenance of the theological spirit , which must secure for it the complete and permanent subordination essential to its existence . Each period imposes equal exigencies of this sort in its special manner . At the outset , when the narrowness and nearness of the aim required a less absolute submission of mind , social ties were so weak that nothing could have been done but for the religious authority with which military chiefs were naturally invested . In more advanced times the end became so vast and remote , and the participation so indirect , that even long habits of discipline would not have secured the necessary cooperation without the aid of theological convictions occasioning blind and involuntary confidence in military superiors . It was in very ancient times that the military spirit had its great social function to fulfill ; and it was in those ancient times that the two powers were usually found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it was not every spiritual // authority whatever that would have sufficiently suited the foundation and consolidation of military government , which , from its nature , required the concurrence of the theological philosophy , and no other ; for instance , though natural philosophy has rendered eminent service in modern times to the art of war , the scientific spirit , which encourages habits of rational discussion , is radically incompatible with the military spirit ; and we know that the subjection of their art to the principles of science has , always been bitterly deplored by the most distinguished soldiers , on the introduction of every change , as a token of the decline of the military system . On this ground , then , the affinity of temporal military powers for spiritual theological powers is sufficiently accounted for . At the first glance we might suppose the converse relation to be less indispensable , since purely theocratic societies have existed , while an exclusively military one has never been known . But a closer examination will always show the necessity of the military system to consolidate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developed in this way by a continual political application , as the sacerdotal instinct has always been well aware . We shall see again that the theological spirit is as hostile to the expansion of industry as the military . Thus the two elements of the primitive political system have not only a radical affinity but also common antipathies and sympathies , as well as general interests ; and it must be needless to enlarge further in this place on the sociological principle of the concurrence of these powers , which my historical analysis will present as constantly engaged in consolidating and correcting each other . AFFINITY BETWEEN THE POSITIVE AND INDUSTRIAL SPIRIT The latest case of political dualism is even more unquestionable than the earliest , and we are favorably circumstanced for observing it , the two elements not having yet attained their definite ascendency , though their social development is sufficiently marked . When the time arrives for their political rivalry it may be more difficult than now to exhibit that resemblance in I14 SOCIOLOGY AND SOCIAL PROGRESS origin and destination , and that conformity of principles and interests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their common struggle against the old political system acts as a restraint upon their divergencies . The most remarkable feature that we have to contemplate in their case is the aid which each renders to the political triumph of the other , by seconding its own efforts against its chief antagonist . I have already noticed , in another connection , the secret incompatibility between the scientific spirit and the military . There is the same hostility between the industrial spirit , when sufficiently developed , and the theological . The most zealous advocates of the old r/gime are very far removed from the old religious point of view ; but we can transport ourselves to it for a moment , and see how the voluntary modification of phenomena by the rules of human wisdom must thence appear as impious as the rational prevision of them , as both suppose invariable laws , finally irreconcilable with all arbitrary will . According to the rigorous though barbarous logic of the least civilized nations , all human intervention to improve the economy of nature is an injurious attack upon providential government . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preponderance of the religious spirit benumbs the industrial by the exaggerated feelings of a stupid optimism , as has been abundantly clear on many decisive occasions . That this disastrous effect has not been more fatal is owing to priestly sagacity , which has so managed this dangerous power as to educe its civilizing influence , while neutralizing its injurious action by constant and vigilant effort , in a way which I shall presently exhibit . We can not , then , overlook the political influence by which the gradual expansion of human industry must aid the progressive ascendency of the scientific spirit in its antagonism to the religious , to say nothing of the daily stimulus which industry and science impart to each other , when once strong enough for mutual action . Thus far their office has chiefly been to substitute themselves for the ancient political powers which are yielding up their social influence , and our attention is necessarily drawn chiefly to the aid they have afforded to each other in this operation . But it is easy to perceive what force and what // efficacy must reside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character , in which it is at present deficient , and shall proceed to the final reorganization of modern society INTERMEDIATE IZI:GIME Now that we have examined the two extreme states , the intermediate dualism requires little notice . The interconnection of the convergent powers , spiritual and temporal , which constitutes the transitory red imc , is a necessary consequence of all that we have been observing . Indeed , we need but look at the labors of metaphysicians and legists to see what their affinity is , amidst their rivalries , ? an affinity which bases the philosophical ascendency of the one class on the political preponderance of the other . We may , then , regard as now complete the necessary explanation required by our fundamental law of human evolution , in order to its direct application to the study of this great phenomenon . That study will be guided by the consideration of the three dualisms which I have established as the only basis of sound historical philosophy . It is worth noticing the conformity of this law of succession , at once intellectual and material , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason has instinctively established , by distinguishing the ancient and the modern world , separated and reunited by the Middle Ages . The sociological law which I have propounded may be found to have for its destination to take up a vague empirical notion , hitherto barren , and render it rational and prolific . I hail this spontaneous coincidence as giving a sanction to my speculative labors ; and I claim this confirmation in virtue of that great aphorism of positive philosophy which I have quoted so often , which enjoins upon all sound scientific theories to start from a point sufficiently accordant with the spontaneous indications of popular reason , of which true science is simply a special prolongation . The series of views of social dynamics sketched out in this chapter has established the fundamental law of human development , and therefore the bases of historical philosophy . It only remains to apply this great sociological principle . VI // When we reach the plane which man occupies in the animal world , these laws of adaptation , selection , and survival , while they are not altogether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower creatures , nevertheless become of comparatively small importance in consequence of the vastly more potent influences due to the development of the intellectual faculty which operates according to the indirect method . The progress which man has made , though from any absolute stand-ard it may appear slow and even secular , is nevertheless , as compared to that which is brought about either by cosmical alterations in the environment or by the law of adaptation , or direct and indirect equilibration , 2 extremely rapid ; as much more rapid than that which results from the biological laws just named as this is more rapid than that which results from the cosmical laws . This progress , too , is effected in spite of the frequent dis-astrous conflagrations which ignorance and error occasion by a perverse use of the Promethean fire . Biological progress , which consists in increase of structure , must , as before shown , result in increase of pleasure . Anthro-pological progress , too , which is the result of the conscious pur-suit of pleasure , must attain the object of pursuit . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motive of every particular action and the ultimate end of all action . It follows that there can be no improvement of man 's condition unless it tend to secure that end . Human progress may , therefore , be properly defined as that which secures the // increase of human happiness . Unless it do this , no matter how great a civilization may be , it is not progressive . If a nation rise , and extend its sway over a vast territory , astonishing the world with its power , its culture , and its wealth , this alone does not constitute progress . It must first be shown that its people are happier than they would otherwise have been . If a people be seized with a rage for art , and , in obedience to their impulses or to national decrees , the wealth of that people be laid out in the cultivation of the fine arts , the employment of master artists , ate decoration of temples , public and private buildings , and the embellishment of streets and grounds , no matter to what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not progress unless greater satisfaction be derived therefrom than was sacrificed in the deprivations which such a course must occasion . To be progressive in the true sense , it must work an increase in the sum total of human enjoyment . When we survey the history of civilization , we should keep this truth in view , and not allow ourselves to be dazzled by the splendor of pageantry , the glory of heraldry , or the beauty of art , literature , philosophy , or religion , but should assign to each its true place as measured by this standard . In considering man 's peculiar characteristic as a progressive being , and in how far he really is a progressive being in any other sense than all animals are progressive beings , it will not do to omit the important fact that it is only a part of the human race , and a comparatively small part , that contributes at all to this result . By far the larger part of the race , as it now exists , considered as nations and peoples , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have for ages been in a condition in this respect akin to that of animals ; while in those nations where civilization is advancing , the great majority contribute absolutely nothing to its advancement , simply performing the functions of animals , viz. , those of maintaining their own existence and perpetuating their kind ; a very few , the mental and material investigators of things , originate every progressive institution . It is to these few only that all artificial progress in society is due . // It is claimed by some that , if we accept this definition of prog-ress , viz. , the increase of human happiness , it will follow that there has never been any progress at all . For they say that civ-ilization , as it has existed among nations , has not had the effect to increase happiness , but rather to diminish it ; that the hap-piest condition in which mankind can exist is that primitive , unconventional state which precedes all efforts at civilization , and allows nature to take its course ; that the humblest peas-ant , dwelling in his Arcadian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scenes of a high and giddy civilization , is more happy than the nervous pursuer of fortune , fame , or knowledge.l It can not be denied that civilization , by the many false prac-tices which it has introduced , by the facilities which its very complexity affords to the concealment of crime , and by the mon-strous systems of corruption which fashion , caste , and conven-tionality are enabled to shelter , is the direct means of rendering many individuals miserable in the extreme ; but these are the necessary incidents to its struggles to advance under the dominion of natural forces alone . It would involve a great fallacy to deduce from this the con-clusion that civilization begets misery or reduces the happiness of mankind . Against this gross but popular mistake may be cited the principle before introduced , which is unanimously accepted by biologists , that an organism is perfect in proportion as its organs are numerous and varied . This is because the more organs there are the greater is the capacity for enjoyment . For this enjoy-ment is quantitative as well as qualitative , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the possible enjoyment deriv-able from their normal exercise . To say that primitive man is happier than enlightened man , is equivalent to saying that an oyster or a polyp enjoys more than an eagle or an antelope . // Phis could be true only on the ground that the latter , in con , equence of their sensitive organisms , suffer more than they enjoy ; but if to be happy is to escape from all feeling , then it were better to be stones or clods , and destitute of conscious sensibility . If this be the happiness which men should seek , then is the Buddhist in the highest degree consistent when he prays for the promised Nirvana , or annihilation . But this is not happiness ? it is only the absence of it . For happiness can only be increased by increasing the capacity for feeling , or emotion , and , when this is increased , the capacity for suffering is likewise necessarily increased , and suffering must be endured unless sufficient sagacity accompanies it to prevent this consequence . And that is the truest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facilities for enjoyment , furnishes at the same time the most effective means of preventing discomfort , and , as nearly all suffering is occasioned by the violation of natural laws through ignorance of or error respecting those laws , therefore that is the truest progress which succeeds in overcoming ignorance and error . Human progress is , therefore , perfectly analogous to that progress which is going on in the world of animal life , since both consist in a multiplication , variation , and refinement of the faculties of enjoyment , and any change in either which does not effect this is not progress . All happiness consists in the gratification of desire . Every faculty experiences a natural want to be exercised , and that want is a desire . The proper exercise of that faculty is the supply of that want and the gratification of that desire . There are two ways , therefore , by which the happiness of a being can be increased : first , by affording the opportunity for exercising existing faculties ; and , second , by the creation of new and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these also . By the law of development alluded to , and which is a sort of biological law of supply and demand , the mere presence of these oppor.tunities is all that is required to create the faculties themselves , for this renders the conditions for the existence of such faculties favorable ; and , where the conditions are favorable for // the development of a faculty , that faculty will arise ; when the opportunities for the exercise of a faculty cease , that faculty will itself cease to exist , although the organs through which it was exercised may long persist.l This law extends with full force to the social condition of man . Whatever affords an opportunity for the exercise of a new human faculty creates such a faculty , creates a desire for its exercise , and actually gratifies that desire , thus adding to the sum of human happiness . The creation of such opportunities is , then , the origin of progressive action , and it is these same oppor-tunities , increased and refined , that keep that desire in exist-ence , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principle that progress is in proportion to the opportunities or facilities for exercising the faculties and satisfying desire . VII THE EVOLUTION OF SOCIETY ' The prime factors in social progress are the Community and its Environment . The environment of a community com-prises all the circumstances , adjacent or remote , to which the community may be in any way obliged to conform its actions . It comprises not only the climate of the country , its soil , its flora and fauna , its perpendicular elevation , its relation to mountain chains , the length of its coast line , the character of its scenery , and its geographical position with reference to other countries ; but it includes also the ideas , feelings , customs , and observances of past times , so far as they are preserved by literature , tradi-tions , or monuments , as well as foreign contemporary manners and opinions , so far as they are known and regarded by the com-munity in question . Thus defined , the environment may be very limited or very extensive . The environment of an Eskimo tribe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tribes , of a few traders or travelers , and of the sum total of the traditions received from ancestral Eskimos . These make up the sum of the conditions affecting the social existence of the Eskimos . The environment of the United States , on the other hand , while it comprises the physical conditions of the North American continent , comprises also all contemporary nations with whom we have intercourse , and all the organized tradition political and ethical , scientific and religious ? which we possess in common with all the other communities whose civilization origi-nated in the Roman Empire . The significance of this increase of size and diversity in the environment will be explained presently . I22 SOCIOLOGY AND SOCIAL PROGRESS Bearing in mind this definition of a social environment , which I believe carries with it its own justification , let us briefly notice the error committed by those writers who would fain interpret all the most important social phenomena as due , solely or chiefly , to physical causes . This is an error frequently committed by physiologists who try their hand at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sociology as if it were a mere branch of biology . But this is not the case . As we have seen psychology to be an offshoot from biology , specialized by the introduction of inquiries concerning the relations of the percipient mind to its environment , we must similarly regard sociology as an offshoot from psychology , specialized by the introduction of inquiries concerning the relations of many percipient and emotionally incited minds to each other and to their common environment . As in biogeny , all attempts to discover the law of organic development failed utterly so long as the relations of the organism to physical environing agencies were alone studied , and succeeded only when Mr. Darwin took into account the relations of organisms to each other ; so still more inevitably in sociogeny must all our efforts fail so long as we consider merely the physiologic relations of a community to the country in which it dwells , and refuse to recognize the extent to which communities influence each other by means that are purely intellectual or moral . Doubtless the character of the physical environment is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier stages of civilization . No doubt civilization will first arise , other things equal , in a locality where food and shelter can be obtained with a medium amount of exertion ; where nature is neither too niggard nor too lavish in the bestowal of her favors . No doubt there is a physical significance in the fact that civilization began , not in barren Siberia , or in luxuriant Brazil , but in countries like Egypt and Mesopotamia , which were neither so barren as to starve , nor so luxuriant as to spoil , the laborer . No doubt the Greeks owed much to the extent of their coast line . No doubt ? above all ? the Mediterranean is justly sacred to the student of history as partly the civilizer of the peoples who upon its waves first courted adventure , and conducted commerce , and imparted // to each other cosmopolitan sympathies which could never have been evoked but for some such intercourse . All this may be granted . But as civilization advances , the organized experience of past generations becomes to a greater and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expresses it , in one of his profoundest aphorisms , the empire of the dead over the living increases from age to age . If we contemplate , from a lofty historical point of view , the relative importance of the factors in the environment of our United States , I believe we shall be forced to conclude that the victory of the Greeks at Marathon , the conquest of Gaul by Cmsar , the founding of Christianity , the drfeat of Attila at Chalons and of the Arabs at Tours , the advent of the Normans in England , the ecclesiastic reforms of Hildebrnd , the Crusades , the revolt of Luther , the overthrow of the Spanish Armada , and the achievements of scientific inquirers ( torn Archimedes to Faraday have influen.ed and are influencing our social condition to a far greater extent than the direction of the Rocky Mountains , or the position of the Great Lakes , or the course of the Gulf Stream . Or if we inquire why the Spaniards are still so superstitious and bigoted , I believe we shall find little enlightenment in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but much enlightenment in the fact that for eight centuries Spain was the arena of a life-and-death struggle between orthodox Christians and Moorish unbelievers . The environment in our problem must , therefore , not only include psychical as well as physical factors , but the former are immeasurably the more important factors , and as civilization advances their relative importance steadily increases . Bearing . in mind these preliminary explanations , let us now address ourselves to the problem of social evolution , applying to the solution of it sundry biological principles established in previous chapters . We have first to observe that it is a corollary from the law of use and disuse , and the kindred biologic laws which sum up the processes of direct and indirect equilibration , that the fundamental characteristic of social progress is the continuous weakening of selfishness and the continuous strengthening of sympathy . Or ? to use a more convenient and somewhat // more accurate expression suggested by Comte ? it is a gradual supplanting of egoism by altruism . . . . In the first place , the evolution of society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that universal law of evolution dis-covered by Mr. Spencer , and illustrated at length in earlier chap-ters . The brief survey just taken shows us that social progress consists primarily in the integration of small and simple com-munities into larger communities that are of higher and higher orders of composition , and in the more and more complete sub-ordination of the psychical forces which tend to maintain isola-tion to the psychical forces which tend to maintain aggregation . In these respects the prime features of social progress are the prime features of evolution in general . In the second place , the progress of society exhibits those secondary features of differentiation and integration which evolu-tion universally exhibits . The advance from indefinite homoge-neity to definite heterogeneity in structure and function is a leading characteristic of social progress . On considering primi-tive societies we find them affected by no causes of heterogeneity except those resulting from the establishment of the various family relationships . As Sir Henry Maine has shown , in early times the family and not the individual was the social unit . In the absence of anything like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a monarch in miniature , uniting in his own person the functions of king , priest , judge , and parliament ; yet he was scarcely less a digger and hewer than his subject chil-dren , wives , and brethren . Commercially , it is needless to say , all primitive communities are homogeneous . In any barbarous tribe the number of different employments is very limited , and such as there are may be undertaken indiscriminately by every one . Every man is his own butcher and baker , his own tailor and carpenter , his own smith , and his own weapon maker . Now the progress of such a society toward a civilized condition begins with the differentiation and integration of productive occupations . That each specialization of labor entails increased efficiency of // production , which reacting brings out still greater specialization , is known to every tyro in political economy Nor is it less obvious that , with the advance of civilization , labor has been steadily increasing in coherent heterogeneity , not only with regard to its division among different sets of mutually dependent laborers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instruments . The distinguishing characteristic of modern machinery , as compared with the rude tools of the Middle Ages or the clumsy apparatus of the ancients , is its definite heterogeneity . The contrast between the steam engine of to-day and the pulleys , screws , and levers of a thousand years ago assures us that the growing complexity of the objects which labor aims at is paralleled by the growing complexity of the modes of attaining them . Turning to government , we see that by differentiation in the primeval community some families acquired supreme power , while others sank , though in different degrees , to the rank of subjects . The integration of allied ' families into tribes , and of adjacent tribes into nations , as well as that kind of integration exhibited at a later date in the closely knit diplomatic interrelations of different countries , are marked steps in social progress . Next may be mentioned the differentiation of the governing power into the civil and the ecclesiastical , while by the side of these ceremonial government grows up insensibly as a third power , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potently because not embodied in statutes and edicts . Comparing the priests and augurs of antiquity with the dignitaries of the mediaeval Church , the much greater heterogeneity of the latter system becomes manifest . Civil government likewise h2 s become differentiated into executive , legislative , and judicial . Executive government has been divided into many branches , and diversely in different nations . A comparison of the Athenian popular government with the representative systems of the present day shows that the legislative function has no more than any of the others preserved its original homogeneity ; while the contrast between the Aula Regis of the Norman kings and the courts of common law , equity , and admiralty , ? county courts , queen 's courts , state courts , and federal courts , ? which are // lineally descended from it , tells us the same story concerning the judicial power . Nor should it be forgotten that the steady expan-sion of legal systems , to meet the exigencies which civilization renders daily more complex , is an advance from relatively indefi-nite homogeneity to relatively definite heterogeneity. . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were led a moment ago , while inquiring into the progress of moral feelings , showed us that , in this respect also , the evolution of society agrees with the evolution of life in general . The progress of a community , as of an organism , is a process of adaptation , ? a continuous establishment of inner relations in conformity to outer relations . If we contemplate material civilization under its widest aspect , we discover its legitimate aim to be the attainment and main-tenance of an equilibrium between the wants of men and the out-ward means of satisfying them . And while approaching this goal society is ever acquiring in its economic structure both greater heterogeneity and greater specialization . It is not only that agriculture , manufactures , commerce , legislation , the acts of the ruler , the judge , and the physician , have since ancient times grown immeasurably multiform , both in their processes and in their appliances ; but it is also that this specialization has resulted in the greatly increased ability of society to adapt itself to the emergencies by which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in like manner the history of an advance from a less complete toward a more complete correspondence between the order of our conceptions and the order of phenomena . Truth  - -  the end of all honest and successful research ? is attained when subjective relations are adjusted to objective relations . And what is the consummation of moral progress but the thorough adaptation of the desires of each individual to the requirements arising from the coexistent desires of all neighboring individuals ? Thus the phenomena of social and of organic progress are seen to correspond to a degree not contemplated by those thinkers who , from Plato to Hobbes , have instituted a comparison between them . The dominant characteristics of all life are those in which social and individual life agree . VIII THE TRANSITION FROM A PAIN ECONOMY TO A // Before proceeding further in the discussion of the social forces the distinction between a pain and a pleasure economy must again be emphasized . Beings in a pain economy have vigorous motor powers but a low development of the sensory powers . As they pass from one environment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemies and pains to be avoided . Food and pleasure are of course necessary , but they are not the main objects of conscious thought . When such beings have developed their sensory powers far enough so that forms of thought and ideals are created which aid them in their activities , there is f rmed for them a pain society , the end of which is protection from enemies . There is a pain morality , the purpose of which is to keep persons from committing acts and putting themselves in situations which lead to destruction . There is also a pain religion , the purpose of which is to invoke the aid of higher beings in the ever-recurring contests with enemies and pain . In describing the leading features of a pain economy , I do not mean to imply that men in such an economy are constantly think-ing of pain and never of pleasure , but that all their institutions have as their basis the fear of enemies and pain . The primitive state is formed , as Hobbes tells us , to secure protection from enemies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemies abound the conscious pursuit of pleasure exposes a being to the attacks of these enemies and the consequent evils . The choosing of smaller instead of greater pleasures and the postponement of pleasures until the ends demanded for I28 SOCIOLOGY AND SOCIAL PROGRESS protection and security are obtained become the best means of prolonging existence . By the aid of these social forces in a pain economy many of the highest ideals of men have been formed . Connected with these ideals is a series of impulses which prompts individuals to activities in harmony with the conditions under which they have grown up . The most fundamental characteristics of the human race belong in this realm , and to the average individual they seem to be the only bulwarks by which society , morality , and religion can be defended . Yet we are now in the transition stage from this pain economy to a pleasure economy , and it is necessary to see what changes will ensue and in what way ideals , forms of thought , and impulses must be modified to meet the new conditions . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vigorous enemies deal out death and destruction so freely that the thought of isolated individuals is concentrated on the causes and remedies for pain . The development of human society has gradually eliminated from the environment the sources of pain . The civilized world has been freed from dangerous beasts and reptiles , and the growth of large nations has cut off the danger of invasion by barbarous and warlike human foes . The objective environment is now merely the crust of the earth and its stock of materials and goods . The sensory powers have free play in analyzing this material into its elements , and in reorganizing these elements into valuable goods . These changes make a pleasure economy possible and destroy the conditions which made the subjective environment of the old pain economy a necessity . It is not , however , to be assumed that the transition to a pleasure economy is an easy one . On the contrary , it is a most difficult process and one fraught with many evils and dangers . So many of the fundamental ideas , ideals , and impulses of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems almost without a rudder to guide it through its new difficulties . Historical evidence would seem to prove that a pure pleasure economy is an impossibility . Nation after nation has gone down when utilities instead of pains have become the supreme object of interest . Individuals as well as nations show the deteriorating // influence of pleasure as soon as they are freed from the restraints of a pain economy . This tendency to deterioration , however , is an evil that belongs only to the period of transition . A nation , after undergoing the severe discipline of an unfavorable environment , suddenly finds itself transferred to a new environment where there is an abundance of utilities and no fear of enemies . The old safeguards to character are now inadequate , and it takes a long time to construct a new series of safeguards suited to the new conditions . In the meanwhile individuals sink into a state of lethargy or of vice , and the nation is so weakened that some new people , coming from a region where a pain economy still prevails , find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pleasure economy is possible nation after nation has risen and fallen , without ever developing sufficient strength to resist the encroachments of enemies disciplined by a pain economy . A pleasure economy can not be formed by any kind of a revolutionary process . There must be a long period of transition in which the leading elements of the old economy are gradually lost , and in their places the ideas , ideals , and impulses of a pleasure economy are substituted . The development of modern nations has been along this path . Without a conscious departure from the old ideals of state , morality , and religion , there has been a gradual substitution of certain ideals and impulses of a pleasure economy , until now all of our leading concepts are held in a dual form . One group of ideals and impulses is the conservator of past conditions , while blended with them is another group of ideals and impulses which is the outcome of the new conditions . Such a state of affairs can not hut be the cause of much confusion and distress . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present aggregate of forces into their elements and in finding to which group each ideal and impulse really belongs . The present situation can , perhaps , be better described by returning to an elementary distinction . It has been shown that progress is due to the passing from one environment to another , each having certain requisites for survival . The purpose of individuals in passing from environment to environment is not // progress , but an escape from competition . The easiest way out of present difficulties is taken even though some other path in the long run would better serve the ends of the race . The line of least resistance often forces progress to take a circuitous route , as when a river cutting its way to the sea often makes long curves to traverse a short distance because of some obstacle in the direct route . When the race entered a pain economy it was forced out of the direct line of social progress into a series of environments where the requisites for survival warded off pain instead of promoting welfare . The early instincts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were at bottom safeguards from enemies and pains . In time , however , the conditions of a pain economy became less severe and some of the requisites for survival came from a pleasure economy . The line of progress then tended to come back to its normal trend , and now after a long detour the race finds itself at a point on the normal line somewhat in advance of the point of departure . The environment no longer demands a pain economy , yet the instincts , habits , and ideals of the race have been acquired during this long period of abnormal progress , and there are no proper guides for activity in the new pleasure economy into which the race is admitted . To put itself into a normal condition , the race must construct an artificial channel from the point where it left the normal line of progress to the point where it now is . It must create with design the same impulses , habits , and ideals which it would have had if the normal line of progress had not been abandoned . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discarded or reconstructed on a new basis . This necessity involves an enormous undertaking , for the abnormal course of events reaches back far beyond the organization of men into societies . It is often assumed that this reorganization is an easy one to beings who have the faculty of reason to guide them . If reason were that independent source of authority which many metaphysicians hold it to be , something might be hoped for from it . But reason acts only on the impulses that lie back of it , and they are the slow accumulations of many ages . Doubtless a conscious // progress can save the race from many evils and economize much t ime , but it can not alter the order of development nor eliminate any of its steps . Nations can not become fitted for the conditions of a pleasure economy without passing through a stage of progress where the elementary ideas and impulses are adjusted to one another by the crudest form of evolution . We are repeating this early process at present with a great loss of life and happiness . Individuals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their environment , yield to temptation , and sink into vice . The new impulses and ideals appear but slowly , yet perhaps we are far enough along to see something of their character and influence . As I have said , they are already a part of our present stock of ideas . The new , however , is so blended with the old that it is hard to isolate them . Perhaps our religious ideals show the effect of the transition from a pain to a pleasure economy more plainly than any others . The concept of God possessed by primitive races is but little separated from their concept of earthly rulers . They serve him as they serve their rulers , from fear of the consequences of disobedience . It is a rule of fear tempered with a hope of protection from enemies . With a clearer perception of spatial relations their concept of God removes him farther from the sphere of earthly rulers , but he is still thought of as a God of war and an avenger of evil deeds . When the development of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of natural law and of the universe , God is thought of as the creator of men and is supposed to use his power and foresight to ward off the evils which come from natural forces . When men advance far enough to see that a natural retribution does not follow evil deeds in this life , God becomes the final judge of the deeds of men . So far there has been a development of the ideas of a pain economy due to changes in the sensory powers of men . Force , power , and omniscience are the leading characteristics of the ideal of God . At length , however , a new thought appears in the form of the Christ ideal . Christ is not the God of war and hate , but the God of peace and love . He comes not as the ruler of men but as their servant . He has so little power that a corporal 's guard can // crucify him . With the appearance of Christ there was brought into the world a new group of religious ideas quite foreign to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men whose foes were- external and from which they needed a protector . A God of power who was an avenger of evil deeds was a fitting ideal for men in such a condition . But when men are transferred to a pleasure world their evils are internal . They are their own foes . They want relief not from persecution but from temptation . The concepts of a powerful God and of a future retribution are of little help to men in such a situation . They want rather a model for imitation , one who remains pure even though subject to the passions and temptations of men . The likeness to man is emphasized in the Christ ideal more than the likeness to God . He is a better ideal because he is powerless and helpless . IX WAR AND ECONOMICS IN HISTORY AND IN // Each generation must write its own history of past events , in order to interpret them in terms corresponding to its needs . New conditions give rise to new problems , and these to new conceptions ; and when we turn again to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before asked . Since the middle of the century , when the victory of parliamentary government in western Europe was finally assured , ? without , however , accom-plishing the marvelous results expected of it , ? the question as to the best form of government has come to have mainly an academic interest , while the contests of actual politics have more and more turned upon questions of social and economic policy . This shifting of the center of interest has been followed by a corresponding change in the character of historical writing , cul-minating in the rise of the new school 2 in which political con-stitutions are considered as results rather than causes , and attention is devoted chiefly to the economic factor in history . Such a change in the point of view must necessarily alter the perspective of history , giving more prominence to such phe-nomena as have an important bearing on economic development . That war belongs to this category seems altogether beyond dispute . If it be true that all great events are due in large part to economic causes , and react in turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer suffice to dismiss this subject witIi the customary lamentations about the horrors and waste of war , nor even with some more or less probable estimates of the cost of particular wars . The time has certainly come when an investigation is needed , to show , if possible , the relation of war as an institution to the economic conditions prevailing in the several stages of civilization . I Among tribes subsisting on the products furnished spontaneously by nature , war is the normal condition . The reason is , in the main , economic . The scarcity and precariousness of the food supply render much land necessary to support each family . Unless climatic conditions absolutely prevent an increase of population , the hunting grounds of the several tribes are of necessity extended until they overlap ; and so arises a war of extermination , whose issue is the destruction of the least efficient social organization and the restoration of the equilibrium between population and food supply . At this stage of economic development war is not only a business enterprise but the only conceivable business enterprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may procure for itself an increased food supply . Nevertheless , a victorious tribe can not expand without breaking up into smaller tribes , for the economic condition forbids men to dwell in large groups . This state of things thus tends to perpetuate itself . Individual tribes may rise or fall , but the old way of life goes on unchanged . Ilow , then , does civilization ever emerge from this vicious circle ? This is a question not yet satisfactorily answered , though M. Tarde 's imitation theory , and the culture myths of all races which have learned the secret of an artificial food supply , would indicate that individual initiative played a leading part in the great transformation . But the most brilliant genius could do no more than apply to the satisfaction of an existing need something contained in or suggested by his environment . And it is characteristic of human nature not to try a new plan until the old one has utterly failed . What , then , were the circumstances which resulted in the creation of an artificial food supply ? // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural food supply must have proved insufficient , and the usual remedy in such a . es , war , must have failed to bring relief . At first glance both these conditions would appear to exist among tribes worsted in battle , and one is tempted to think he has discovered another of the uses of adversity . But in savage warfare the defeated party is seldom left with any surplus population ; and , even when their numbers again increase or the tribe is forced back into a less productive country , the creation of an artificial food supply is effectually hindered by their inability to defend themselves or their possessions . Instead of seeking to increase their resources , they set about limiting the increase of population by a systematic extension of the practices of infanticide and " senicide , " which exist among all savages but reach their fullest development among tribes unable to make head against their neighbors . It is not , therefore , among the conquered that the origin of the new industrial system must be sought ; nor yet among the conquerors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their needs . It is rather among tribes whose equality of strength or inaccessible location prevents a decisive victory that the creation of an artificial food supply becomes a necessity and hence a fact ; and the same rule holds good concerning most of the subsequent steps in economic progress . In other words , industrial development is the result of strenuous competition , of which war is the most acute form . Whether the next stage shall be pastoral or agricultural depends on the environment . In an open country , where there are animals suitable for domestication , the tribe will become pastoral ; without such animals , or in a broken forest land , it becomes agricultural . Other things being equal , the change to pastoral life is the more easy and natural . The food supply obtainable from a given area being greatly increased , the population is multiplied in like proportion . And whereas the hunting existence scatters the population , the pastoral life tends to greater concentration through the need of mutual protection for the herds , and to social and political consolidation through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while // hunting tribes are limited to guerrilla warfare , the numbers , discipline , mobility , and readily transported food supply of pastoral peoples enable them to undertake distant expeditions and to make conquests on a grand scale . These things are , moreover , forced upon them by the economic limitations inherent in their mode of life . War is eventually as much an economic necessity for pastoral as for hunting tribes . Population depends upon herds , and herds upon accessible pasturage . But , owing to the rapid increase of population due to the greater regularity and comfort of their life as compared with hunting tribes , the limit of safety is soon passed . In this condition the least failure of pasturage , from drought or other cause , drives them forth into distant lands with the suddenness and violence of a tidal wave . This is the explanation of the periodically recurring VoIkerwanderungen which have swept over the earth , destroying and founding empires .

They were so fenced about by mountains and deserts that the inhabitants were thrown back on their own resources to maintain the increasing population . Moreover , for the same reason , they were largely protected against hostile raids during the early period of agricultural development , when the people , scattered upon the land , fall an easy prey to every marauder . Inaccessibility would thus appear to be as advantageous for the origin of a civilization based on agriculture as accessibility is for its continued development . Nevertheless , even in the most sheltered lands , the necessity of self-defense finally leads to division of labor and to social differentiation . A temporary form of this division was the arrangement found among the Suevi , by which the men alternately tilled the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step is the development of a permanent military class . The system of castes is an economic necessity at the stage of development when the family is the only possible school of prac-tical arts . It is equally " an inevitable incident accompanying a certain stage of military expansion . " And it is likewise the result of conquest which produces slaves and subjects to be exploited for the benefit of the ruling race , ? a result whereof Sparta is the classical example . All three causes were operative in antiquity , especially in the Oriental world . The great empires which flourished there all rested on a more or less clearly defined system of castes ; and in all of them conquest was not only the origin but also the chief end of the state . Under the circum-stances no other object was possible ; for the lack of scientific knowledge and the rigidity of the social system narrowly limited the division of labor and rendered not only agriculture but even manufacturing relatively unproductive . It was inevitable , there-fore , that the natural increase of population should cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where should relief be sought if not in conquest , ? in the booty and tribute of subject peoples ? To this all nations instinctively turned . It is not less true , therefore , of agricultural than of shepherd nations , that war ultimately becomes an economic necessity . For the time comes when foreign lands must be drawn upon to feed the people , and , in the absence of international division of labor , the only possible means to this end is war . The develop-ment of commerce on a grand scale and the use of a money economy do not remove all the causes tending to war ; but they open up the possibility ? barring commercial rivalries ? of a peaceful expansion . And this was neither possible nor conceiv-able in a natural economy such as characterized the Orient . This fact alone explains the predominant role of conquest in the ancient world . ' II In passing from the Oriental nations to Greece we obtain a glimpse into a condition of things infinitely more primitive . // Here we find in its beginnings the economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Africa had reached maturity when history opens . The Greek states reproduce in miniature before our very eyes the process of development and decay which underlay the great movements of ancient history . For this reason they reveal with the greatest clearness the fundamental relations of industry and war . The early Greeks , like the . /Etolians of a later day , were a rude race ? half pastoral , half agricultural , and still partially nomadic ? who waged war ceaselessly for herds , slaves , and fertile lands . War was for them strictly a business enterprise ; or , as Goethe puts it : Krieg , Handel and Piraterei Dreieinig sind sic , nicht zu trennen . War existed , as it were , by nature ; while peace required to be established by special treaty . This is seen in the avvX ( a , ? that is , exemption from spoliation , ? which was granted only as a special favor . It is seen even more strikingly in the fact that in Homer piracy is a distinctly honorable calling , ? the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow . The wrath of Achilles grows out of a question of booty . Agamemnon con-stantly prays that he may " plunder the well-built city of Priam . " And the Trojan war as a whole is evidently a piratical expedi-tion of Greek vikings . Moreover , through all the changes of ad-vancing civilization , war , and even private war , continued in the eyes of the people to constitute an honorable mode of acquisition . Innumerable phrases and proverbs scattered through Greek lit-erature show that war was conceived not only as the natural condition between all men but also as the source of wealth and honor , and even as the creative principle in the universes These facts , which usually furnish the text of a sermon on Greek morality , are , in a broad sense , as much facts of nature , // and as little suited to be the subject of ethical judgment , as a tornado or an earthquake . The task of science is to understand , not to judge . And it is precisely such facts as these which furbish the indispensable clew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it is dominated almost exclusively by a single . Cause . The Greek states , in their brilliance , their turbulence , and their swift decay , reveal with surprising clearness the characterbitics of limited political areas , in which the question of land or space is necessarily fundamental . From the beginning to the end of their history every important economic , military , and political movement originated in the effort to find support for a redundant population . The Dorian conquest was the work of a xr and hardy tribe whose native mountains no longer afforded sustenance , and which therefore went forth to seek with the sword its fortune in distant lands . The Greek colonies arose from the same motives , partly through plundering raids which ended , like those of the Northmen , in conquest and settlement , partly through peaceful emigration . The later wars , both foreign and domestic , were due to the same cause , namely , the struggle for land and food . Even the growth of commerce and the introduction of a money economy , while altering the superficial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather intensified , this incessant and deadly competition . It divided Greece into two parties , the one continental , agricultural , military , which clung to the natural economy and followed the lead of Sparta ; the other maritime , commercial , naval , which speedily adopted a money economy and fell largely under the control of Athens after her transformation from a continental to a maritime state . That Sparta remained aristocratic , while Athens became democratic , was a result rather than a cause . The contrast and the hostility between the two states and the interests which they represented lay deeper than forms of government ; it was rooted in their very mode of life . It was the irrepressible conflict between a natural and a money economy , ? the old struggle for existence in a new form . The abiding hostility of the subject cities toward Athens , and of the social parties at Athens toward each other , bears witness to the same irreconcilable conflict of interests .                 @ @ @ @
