 |p1105  AMIDST desolate rocks , under the burning rays of the sun , in the gloomy recesses of dark caverns , amidst blue ocean waves , everywhere life is developed ; that beneficent spark which causes protoplasm to vibrate with hitherto unfelt palpitations infuses energy into organisms and fits them for the sad struggle for existence . What infinitesimal cares , what unknown sufferings , agitate the delicate bodies of millions of creatures scarcely discernible by our eyes ! What impassioned scenes pass before us entirely without our knowledge ! For many consecutive years I pursued researches into these things , seeing the necessity of an instrument which should promise the best means of solving many difficult problems , and after a series of experiments I reached the goal with the invention of the bioscope . The bioscope is a microscope with a very long focus . While the different optical instruments hitherto constructed give a maximum focal distance of ten centimeters , the bioscope increases it to seventy centimeters , with a larger field  |p1106  and not less precision . The instrument offers the greatest facility for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural environment and without preparation of any kind . In ordinary cases the magnifying power used is in the proportion of twelve diameters , equal to one hundred and forty-four times the surface . Continued practice in these researches during six years has shown me the utility of this magnifying , seeing that the motions of these minute creatures are for the most part performed with lightning rapidity , denoting enormous muscular power . When it is required to plunge the instrument into the sea or a lake it must first be placed in a tube closed below by a thin lamina of crystal with parallel surfaces , and then it will be easy to study the diverse animal species in their element , and to elucidate the varied development of life in its most recondite forms . The bioscope may also render service to the clinical study of the human organism , of the eye , the larynx , and the nasal cavity , facilitating examinations of extreme delicacy and often of undeniable diagnostic value . Its use may be extended to all observations where magnifying is needful because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electric discharges or radiation of heat , which might be dangerous with a short focus . By means of this instrument one is enabled with the greatest facility to study the habits of minute arthropoda and other creatures , to observe their movements and measure them without any consciousness on their part . By it , too , we may observe the methods of fructification of the various flowers ; in a word , we may watch the development of life in all its phases in a way undreamed of hitherto . It opens to the naturalist regions of research yet unexplored ? marvelous pictures yet unseen by human eye , of which no pencil has yet reproduced the  |p1107  brilliant coloring , refulgent with light and life . No pen can describe the scenes of beauty and of horror which now transport the fancy into fairyland and the golden region of dreams , and now to the fauna of vanished continents ? to the titanic conflicts of monsters encased in triple armor . Tufts of mosses and hepaticas , graceful and delicate ; lichens of many forms and colors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or green and pink on the bark of trees , almost invisible to the naked eye , are revealed by the bioscope as minute forests , as little meadows of orange or emerald hue , as strange plants . Among these rove animals strange in form , some glittering in the sun , sheathed in cuirasses bestudded with rubies , diamonds and sapphires ; others fierce of aspect , covered over with dusky hair . All these move and whirl together with the rapidity of lightning , displaying with their every movement their immense muscular power . They love , they combat , without respite , without pause . Rage , fury , joy and pleasure are expressed in their multiform actions . We watch them and learn to understand them , and the secrets of the recondite laws of life , blind , yet fixed , are unveiled to our gaze in their countless manifestations . A new world full of marvels is revealed to our astonished eyes ; a series of cinematographic scenes is thrown on the eternal " films " of nature , ever changing , ever palpitating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of joy and love . The bioscope shows what the microscope , perfectly adapted as it may be for its special uses , can never show ? viz. , life in its manifold appearances . Let us observe more closely some of the scenes presented by the most frequently occurring organisms . Let us place a common fly ( Sarcophaga ) on the window sill and turn the bioscope upon it . Its great visual organs , composed of hundreds of little ruby-colored eyes , staring at us ; its enormous body covered with rough hair , and its long , shaggy legs terminating in great claws form a startling revelation . From time to time it protrudes its great proboscis , damp and dripping with saliva , and with this highly sensitive organ , smooth as satin , it is continually proving and tasting the objects that come in its way .  |p1108  page deleted  |p1109  Now we shall examine one of the little hunter spiders of our windows ( Salticus ) . His hairy body appears enormous and his anterior eyes , very large and motionless , emit strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with great bunches of white hair , have a convulsive motion and hide his immense , sharp , poison-bearing claws ; his strong , hairy legs move slowly and regularly . Every now and then he raises his cephalo-thorax , rough with long hair , and looks around for a prey . When one comes within the scope of his vision , a scope from which there is no escape , he perceives it afar off , his eyes flash lightnings , his feelers are agitated , his whole being is excited . He begins slowly to advance cautiously and noiselessly , so as not to arouse suspicion in the victim . Then with a sudden spring he pounces upon him , holds him fast and strikes his poisonous claws into the body . Then he raises the creature quivering in death , an opaline liquid dripping from the wounds . This scene greatly impressed me , the contraction of the victim 's body showing the excessive anguish of this terrible death ; then the slow paralysis of the limbs while the monster sucked in or absorbed his victim . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here we see , as it were , a yawning cavern , its sides clothed with vegetation , recalling the fantastic ideas of the artists of the Celestial Empire . Here are enormous orange-colored cups , drinking glasses , urns bristling at the mouth with jagged teeth , leaves of the most delicate green , and in the heart of the cave a gigantic ant intent on the performance of her toilet . Her body is covered with smooth , reddish-brown leather , shining in the sunlight which filters through the foliage . She stands upright on her slender hind legs , hard and tempered as steel , then bends forward by an abdominal contraction and with her front feet , used alternately , smooths the hair of her head and her long antennae soiled with dust . With what grace her long tongue licks her legs , stroking them down between her opened mandibles ! Nothing but a mirror is wanting to transform the scene into that of the boudoir of an elegant woman . In another part a ferocious combat is raging between two warrior ants . They bend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the mortal duel ; in their blind fury the iron jaws of the one seek the vital parts of the other ; then locked in a tremendous embrace , their antenna crushed in the struggle , they roll together on the ground . Then they rise , obtaining a foothold by planting their claws in the gravel which had been scattered about
