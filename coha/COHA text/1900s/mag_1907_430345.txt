 | IT would be hard to find , in the history of American municipalities , a more striking and instructive illustration of the ruinous influence of dishonest government than that recently furnished by the city of Other American cities have elected or supported dishonest officials , and in other cities people have lived , for years , under what may be called graft conditions ; but in no other municipality has the corruption of the administration exercised so direct an influence on the life of the private citizen or made itself so generally felt by every member of the community . The provisions of the San Francisco municipal charter and the election of 1905 gave the boss and the mayor of the city practically unlimited power , and enabled them not only to control the Board of Supervisors , but to put venal and subservient men into the Board of Public Works , the Board of Health , the Board of Education , the Police Commission , and every other important branch of the municipal administration. * The entire government of the city , therefore , fell into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the corruption affected the whole body of citizens simply because the whole body of citizens was brought directly into contact with it . Under the rule of Schmitz and Ruef , men were forced to pay for protection and privileges which they ought to have had without payment ; the work of the city was badly done or wholly neglected ; and professional law-breakers could buy the right to commit almost any crime short of burglary , highway robbery , and murder . In consequence of this exercise of unlimited power for selfish purposes by an unscrupulous municipal bureaucracy , the credit of the city was impaired ; vice and crime , in their most dangerous forms , were encouraged or protected ; thousands of boys and girls were tempted into evil courses ; life and property became insecure ; and the moral standards of the whole community were gradually lowered and debased . Ruef , Schmitz , and their confederates not only robbed San Francisco : they debauched it as well , because they made graft , bribery , and vice so common and so familiar that they seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In order to support these statements , and to show the influence of graft conditions at their worst , I purpose to consider the municipal dishonesty of San Francisco in its relation , first , to commercial morality ; second , to administrative economy and efficiency ; and , third , to the prevalence of vice and crime . The Business of Corrupt Government In the field of business , nothing , perhaps , is more obstructive , and in its results mole demoralizing , than the form of official robbery colloquially known in America as " hold-up " and in China as " squeeze . " Under the provisions of the municipal charter of San Francisco , thousands of corporations , firms , and individual business men are required to have franchises , licenses , or permits . In the granting of these privileges the city officials have more or less discretionary power ; and if the mayor and the municipal boards are thieves , they can easily find reasons for throwing obstacles in the way of an applicant when he asks for permission to do business . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many words , " We wo n't give you a franchise , or a license , unless you bribe us . " All that they have to do is to postpone action , from time to time , on an application , or to deny it  | altogether upon the alleged ground that the applicant has failed to comply with certain rules , regulations , or conditions which they themselves have adopted or prescribed . The man who wishes to do business then understands that he is being " held up , " and he soon learns ? if he does not already know ? that the quickest and easiest way of extricating himself from such a situation is to bribe the officials who are subjecting him to pressure . Under the provisions of the municipal charter of San Francisco , twenty-seven different kinds of business require licenses or permits . Among them are auctioneering , banking , assaying , stock-broking , insurance-adjusting , warehousing , debt-collecting , dyeing , carpet-cleaning , dealing in real estate , fortune-telling , and the keeping of bath-houses , billiard-rooms , bowling alleys , cycleries , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and saloons . The number of corporations , firms , and individuals engaged in these occupations is approximately five thousand four hundred . Not all of these men , of course , were held up for money ; but hundreds of them were , and hundreds more gave political aid and support to the administration in lieu of license fees which they were not required to pay . The Andrews Grand Jury , in searching the tiles of the tax-collector , found hundreds of license notices bearing such indorsements as " O. K. Many thanks " ; " Let go " ; " Do n't press " ; " This is my friend " ; " O. K. " ; " Do n't bother " ; and many of the instructions so indorsed were signed by the mayor 's secretary . More than thirteen hundred corporations , firms , and business men were exempted from payment of license fees altogether , and through such improper and illegal exemptions the city lost $200,000 a year . This sum must be regarded , of course , as a part of the corruption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mayor acquired control of the administrative boards , in the early part of 1904 , they were able , by means of the hold-up system , to extort money from contractors who wished to do paving or street-cleaning ; from butchers , milkmen , and produce-dealers whose merchandise was liable to inspection ; from managers of athletic associations who desired arrange boxing contests ; from purveyors of amusement who wanted to open theaters or music-halls ; from manufacturers and warehousemen who needed spur tracks ; from public-utility corporations that sought to obtain franchises or to increase their rates ; from business men of all classes who desired to erect alter buildings ; and from more than three thousand liquor-dealers who had to have licenses for their saloons or bars . In many important lines of business it was practically impossible to succeed , or even to exist , without paying money to some official . Bribery , however , made everything safe and easy . Men who employed Mr. Ruef as counsel , and divided profits with the administration , were allowed , not only to carry on their business in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulations of the boards , the ordinances of the supervisors , and the clearest and most mandatory provisions of the municipal charter . In many cases , apparently , the executive boards adopted vexatious , harassing , or impossible regulations for the sole purpose of bringing pressure to bear upon business men who refused or neglected to pay . The Board of Health , for example , held up milk-dealers by insisting upon the observance of wholly impracticable and almost fantastic rules with regard to cleanliness ; but when the milkmen formed an association , engaged E. F. Moran , a lawyer of Mr. Ruef 's selection , as their counsel , and began to pay regular tribute , they were allowed to conduct their business as they chose , without reference to the rules of the board or the health of the public . A similar policy was pursued in dealing with owners of theaters and proprietors of musichalls , except that , in this case , the hold-up was made by means of building regulations and fire ordinances . Men who gave Mr. Ruef thirtythree per cent . of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stock , were permitted to disregard all the regulations for the safeguarding of morals and all the laws for the protection of life ; but men who refused or neglected to pay such tribute soon got into trouble with the Police Commissioner or the Board of Public Works . All the theaters and music-halls in the city , except one , violated the fire ordinances , and more than half of them either paid blackmail or shared their profits with the officials who gave them protection . Mr. Ruef , for example , received one third of the profits of the disreputable music-hall on O'Farrell Street known as the " Belvedere , " and he and the mayor owned forty-five per cent . of the stock of the Baldwin Theater , which they held in the names of office messengers and clerks . They or their confederates also had an interest in the music-hall known as the " Haymarket , " on Mason Street ; in Leonhardt 's " Oriental Grotto , " a notorious dance-hall on the corner of Market Street and Golden Gate Avenue ; and in many other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these places of amusement were allowed to disregard the fire ordinances and the building laws , and most of  | them violated the regulations of the Police Commission as well . The Deneen Building Company The administrative board which was most profitable , perhaps , to the extortioners and thieves who controlled it was the Board of Public Works . Through its power to let contracts , to approve or disapprove the bills of contractors , to grant or withhold building permits , and to supervise all city work , it was able to " squeeze " business men by the thousand ; and in the hands of Schmitz and Ruef it became a most potent instrument of discrimination , oppression , and fraud . When the mayor obtained control of this board , in the early part of I904 , he immediately appointed his brother , Herbert L. Schmitz , president of it . He then entered into a secret-partnership agreement with the Deneen Building Company , and proceeded to throw business into its hands by directing the Board of Works to hold up the plans of other contractors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not in conformity with the fire ordinances or the building regulations . In 1904 Charles Weston , a theatrical manager , employed an attorney named Nagle to assist him in getting permission to erect and open a theater on Market Street . Nagle went to see the mayor about it , and was assured that there would be no trouble in obtaining the necessary permit . Weston thereupon took a lease of a desirable site for five years , engaged a contractor , and submitted his plans to the Board of Public Works . The board objected to them on the alleged ground that they did not conform to the fire ordinances . When Weston appealed to the mayor , the latter said that the burning of the Iroquois Theater in Chicago had made the board extremely cautious in granting permits for places of amusement , and suggested that Weston consult the Deneen Building Company , which was familiar with the requirements of the law and had had much experience in the kind of work that Weston wanted to have done . Acting upon this suggestion , Weston went to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that his plans would require a good deal of modification , and that the necessary changes would largely increase the estimates of his contractor . Having a five-year lease of a building - site on his hands , and finding that he could not obtain a permit without employing the mayor 's company , he finally accepted the terms of the latter , and paid six or eight thousand dollars more for his theater than he would have paid had he been allowed to give the work to his own contractor . The Deneen Company then divided the profits of the transaction with the mayor , who , by " squeezing " the builder , had thrown the job into its hands . A similar attempt was made to extort money from E. A. Fischer , another theatrical manager , who applied for a permit to erect a theater on the corner of Geary and Webster streets . Fischer , however , would not yield to official pressure , and , finding it impossible to do business in San Francisco without bribery , he finally went to Los Angeles . In another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stories to the building that he occupied was held up by the Board of Public Works in the same way , and was led , by official suggestion , to open negotiations with the mayor 's company . " Jerry " Deneen offered to get the necessary permit and to do the work for a certain specified sum . " But , " objected the owner , " that 's a lot more than other contractors ask , and if you can get the permit , why ca n't I ? " " If you think that you can , " replied " Jerry , " " all right ; go ahead . " The owner , however , found the Board of Works intractable , and , after wasting a good deal of time in fruitless negotiations , he finally gave up the struggle and allowed himself to be robbed of three or four thousand dollars , which the mayor and the Deneen Company shared . Sometimes a builder who wanted a permit went directly to the political boss . A wellknown business man of San Francisco , whose name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , and was informed that Mr. Ruef 's fee for acting as his counsel would be one thousand dollars . " If I give you this thousand dollars , " said the builder , " what assurance have I that you 'll deliver the goods ? " " My dear sir , " replied the boss suavely , " I have no goods to deliver ; I merely act as your counsel . " " How do I know , then , that you 'll succeed in my case ? " inquired the builder . " If I do n't succeed , " said Mr. Ruef , " I 'll return your thousand dollars . " The builder paid the money ; the lawyer made the necessary suggestion in the proper quarter ; and the permit was forthcoming . Through its force of inspectors , the Board of Public Works kept close watch of all buildings in course of erection , and made every technical error or accidental violation of law a pretext for a hold-up . In constructing the Luxor apartment-house on Sutter Street , after the fire , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set the front wall eight inches too far forward . An inspector soon dis-  | covered this encroachment upon the street , and , when the house was more than half done , the owner and contractor were notified that the wall must be taken down and set back . In order to avoid the expense and delay that would be involved in correction of the error , the owner went to Mr. Ruef , engaged him as counsel , and paid him five thousand dollars to exert his " influence " with the Board of Public Works . The bribe had the desired effect . The board at once reversed its action , and the wall was allowed to stand , eight inches outside the building-line , on ground belonging to the city . The Business Maws Excuse The worst result of this organized system of robbery was not the direct pecuniary loss of the persons robbed , but , rather , the indirect and incidental undermining of commercial morality . The payment of money under compulsion , by men who were " squeezed , " gradually led to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the excuse of such pressure . Everybody soon became aware that , to use an expressive colloquialism , the municipal authorities were not in office " for their health , " and every business man who wanted to evade a legal obligation , to violate a city ordinance , or to get an unfair advantage over his competitors , resorted to bribery . At first the number of voluntary bribers was small ; but , as it gradually became apparent that bribery was not only profitable but safe , thousands of men were tempted into it . Many if not most of them quieted their consciences by saying : " All of our competitors are paying money for what they want , and if we do n't do it we shall be at a great disadvantage . It would be wrong , of course , to corrupt honest officials , but these men are highwaymen who are holding up the whole community , and it is n't a crime to make a compromise with a footpad when he covers you with a pistol . We ca n't put these bandits out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them , we must do the same . " There was a certain amount of plausibility in this reasoning , and it satisfied hundreds of business men who , under other conditions and in other circumstances , would probably have remained honest . But from bribery with excuse to bribery without excuse there is only a short step ; and as the payment of money to officials became more and more common , men began to buy protection or sanction for schemes and activities that were distinctly prejudicial to the public welfare . After the earthquake of 1906 , for example , a reputable merchant of San Francisco obtained a permit for the erection of a " Class C " wooden building , which he intended to use as a storehouse . The fire ordinances required that the interior of this structure should be plastered throughout ; but , as the owner did not care to have his walls protected in that way , and did not want to pay the thirty-five hundred dollars which such protection would cost , he offered E. A. Aigeltinger , of the Board of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plaster requirement . A bargain was made , and the wooden walls were left uncovered . Unfortunately for the builder , the mayor suspected that Aigeltinger was taking bribes that he did not divide , and , a few days later , an inspector came to make an examination of the building and asked the owner why it had not been plastered in accordance with law . As the owner could not explain without confessing that he had bribed a member of the Board of Public Works , he was forced to shuffle and equivocate and to put the inspector off as best he could . However , he went at once to Aigeltinger and said : " How 's this ? You promised that I should n't have to do that plastering , and now around comes an inspector and makes a kick . " " Do n't you worry , " replied Aigeltinger ; " I 'll fix it . " Aigeltinger , however , was not able to " fix it " without admitting to the mayor that he had taken a bribe which he had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , the owner was finally compelled to plaster his walls , at an expense of thirty-five hundred dollars , after he had paid six hundred dollars for exemption . It is obvious , of course , that bribery of this kind is not only corrupting to business morality on account of the bad example which it sets , but it is highly injurious to the material interests of the city on account of the increased risk of fire which it causes ; and yet , hundreds of business men in San Francisco paid in this way for the privilege of erecting dangerous buildings , and then excused themselves by saying that the practice was common , and that , under the circumstances , violation of the fire ordinances was necessary , if not inevitable . A large share of the responsibility for the undermining of commercial morality in San Francisco may justly be laid upon the officers , directors , and stock-holders of the publicutility corporations . A comparatively obscure and socially insignificant trader or saloonkeeper may pay blackmail to a city official without affecting materially the moral standards of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and high social position buy the services of a political boss , or purchase the votes of corrupt supervisors , they not only give direct encouragement to dishonesty , but make  | it seem almost respectable by lending to it the support of their great personal and social influence . The Franchise Market When it became known that the supervisors elected in 1905 were purchasable , and that Ruef and the mayor could control them , the great corporations of the city began to negotiate for franchises or competitive advantages . The street-car company known as the United Railroads paid Ruef $20o,000 for the right to use the comparatively cheap overhead-trolley system ; the San Francisco Gas and Electric Company paid $20,00o for an ordinance authorizing it to charge eighty-five instead of seventy-tive cents a thousand feet for gas ; the Parkside Realty Company paid $30,000 for the right to construct a street railway to its suburban property ; the Home Telephone Company paid $120,000 for a franchise which would enable it to compete with the Pacific States Telephone Company ; and the Pacific States Telephone Company gave the supervisors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any rival to the San Francisco field . In some cases the money  | was paid to Mr. Ruef as special " counsel , " and was shared by him with the mayor and the supervisors . while in others the bribes were given directly ' to the supervisors . The officers , directors , and attorneys of the bribing corporations were among the wealthiest and best-known residents of the city . Patrick Calhoun , the president of the United Railroads , is a son of John C. Calhoun and a great-grandnephew of Patrick Henry ; Tirey L. Ford , the chief legal adviser-of the same corporation , was formerly attorney-general of California ; Judge Walter Cope , who began the negotiations with Ruef in behalf of the Parkside Realty Company , is president of the San Francisco Bar Association ; and among the managers , attorneys , or prominent stock-holders of the various companies were such men as Thornwell Mullaly , A. K. Detweiler , Louis Glass , T. V. Halsey , Eugene de Sabla , William M. Abbott , Frank G. Drum , William H. Crocker , William @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these men are millionaires or multimillionaires , and all are prominent and influential in the business or social life of the Pacific coast . Such men , through their connections and business relations , fix or control , to a great extent , the moral standards of the city in which they live ; and when they resort to bribery , or even fail to expose and prevent bribery of which they have knowledge , they tempt or encourage thousands of other men to follow their example ; and gradually create a public opinion which will tolerate almost any corrupt practice that seems to be profitable and safe . Willing ' Victims of Hold-ups Friends of the bribing corporations now attempt to excuse the latter by saying that they were " held up " ; but this plea will not bear a moment 's consideration . There was nothing to prevent the United Railroads from entrapping Ruef , Schmitz , and the supervisors by giving them marked money in the presence of concealed witnesses ; and if this course had been pursued , Mr. Calhoun , Mr. Ford , and Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up " the city government . The fact that no attempt was ever made to do this shows that the company resorted to corruption , not because it was forced to bribe in self-defense , but because bribery was more profitable than prosecution . This , however , is not the only bar to the weak plea of compulsion . When a man who has been d up and robbed by a highwayman gets an portunity to lay his case before a police officer , he does not hesitate to make complaint , and to aid the officer , as far as possible , in capturing and punishing the criminal . None of the corporations said to have been " held up " by Schmitz and Ruef showed a disposition to do this . Spreckels , Heney , and Burns , in the fall of 1906 , begged for information which would enable them to indict , convict , and punish the corrupt officials of the city government ; but not a single business man would then admit that he had been " held up , " or that he knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the bribery . Some of the alleged victims of the compulsion refused to testify , even when they were dragged before the Oliver Grand jury by means of subpoenas . They had been " held up " and robbed , but they were not willing to give evidence that would convict the robbers . This , in itself , is sufficient to show that the alleged " hold-up " was not real . The bribing corporations pursued the course dictated by selfish expediency , and in sacrificing principle to profit they set an example which thousands of business men followed , and which finally made graft , bribery , and petty dishonesty so common and familiar that strict integrity , rather than moral delinquency , attracted attention and excited comment . In an editorial entitled , " Is the Average Man a Thief ? " the San Francisco Bulletin , a few months ago , called attention to the fact that , after the earthquake and fire of 1906 , the Germania National Bank , which had lost all its books , asked its customers to state the amounts which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew precisely the amount that they owed in the aggregate , but they did not know exactly how the indebtedness was distributed . The sums specified by the depositors exceeded the known deposits of the bank by more than $75,000 . The discrepancy showed , of course , that hundreds of depositors were taking advantage of the situation by overstating the amounts due them ; but , rather than question the honesty of its customers , the bank charged the $75,000 to profit and loss and paid all demands in full . In the light of all the facts that have thus far been ascertained , it seems to be fairly clear that the dishonest administration which was elected and supported by the Labor-Union party in San Francisco gradually weakened commercial morality , and created an atmosphere of selfishness and greed in which bribery and graft flourished while all the civic virtues faded . The newspapers of the city always stood for honesty , and in their efforts to overthrow the corrupt Ruef-Schmitz administration they had the support and cooperation of many brave , earnest ,  | and upright men ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to resist the temptations offered by a municipal government which aimed only to enrich itself , and which was ready to sell anything and everything that it possessed or controlled . The fire which followed the earthquake of 1906 was a great calamity , but it may well be doubted whether San Francisco suffered more from the sudden loss of half its capital than from the gradual loss of half its integrity and more than half of its capacity for honest , united , and public-spirited action . Government by Thieves and Incompetents Now , concerning graft conditions in their relation to governmental economy and efficiency : In a municipal government , as in a railway corporation , economy and efficiency can be secured only by putting able , honest , and experienced men into executive positions ; and , when the charter of San Francisco was adopted . it was expected , of course , that the mayor , who was invested with the appointing power , would select such men for the municipal boards . Under the Labor-Union regime , however , the mayor and the political boss with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , instead of picking out subordinates who were qualified by character and experience to render economical and efficient service , they packed the boards with men who had no fitness whatever for their positions , but who were willing to cooperate in the work of robbing and blackmailing the people . Such was conspicuously the case in one of the most important departments of the municipal administration , namely , the Board of Public Works . It was made up wholly of disreputable ward politicians , and the Andrews Grand Jury reported , in 19o5 , that it did not contain a single man who had even so much as a smattering of the technical knowledge absolutely essential to the proper performance of his duties . But the members of this board were not supposed to perform their duties : they were expected only to hold up builders and contractors while Schmitz and Ruef extorted money from them . I have already shown how they " squeezed " business men by refusing , on one pretext or another , to issue permits ; but this was not the only way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : they found a still more productive field of illegal gain in contracts for city work . By attaching difficult or impossible conditions to proposals for such work , they could shut out honest competition , and throw all the most profitable jobs into the hands of preferred bidders who had agreed to divide the spoils . When they had thus given contracts to their own partners , they would not only release the latter from observance of the conditions of the awards , but would even approve bills for work that had not been done. * For example , a man who wished to get a contract for paving or sweeping streets would go to Mr. Ruef for " legal advice , " and receive a verbal assurance that the Board of Works would allow him to do half the specified amount of work and then put in a bill for the whole of it . Relying upon this secret understanding , he would underbid all honest competitors , and then rob the city by taking full pay for partial performance . By methods and " deals " of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were able to pocket , every year , tens of thousands of dollars for which the city received no equivalent. * Some Ingenious Grafting Schemes Great ingenuity was sometimes shown by the administration in disguising the real nature of its fraudulent transactions . In one case that came to my knowledge , Mr. D , the representative of a well-known asphalt street-paving company , went to Mr. Ruef to see if he could not get a share of a large amount of paving that the city was about to have done . Mr. Ruef said that it might possibly be arranged if Mr. D ' s company would agree to buy , at a very high price , the business of a rival concern . The plan of the boss , in this case , was to get company No. t to purchase the plant of company No. 2 at twice its real value , and then to hold up company No. 2 for a share of the proceeds . He would doubtless have given company No. i an opportunity to get its money back by robbing the city , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risky , and declined to go into it . After the election of 1905 Ruef and the mayor organized a municipal bureau which they called the " Commissary Department , " and gave it authority to purchase supplies for hospitals , almshouses , and jails . This bureau consisted of six persons , three of whom were brothers of supervisors , and it cost the city , in salaries alone , nearly $I0,000 a year . It was created without any warrant or sanction of law , and its only purpose was to give places to friends of the administration and to facilitate graft in  | the making of purchases . About the same time there was established another buying and selling agency known as the " City Commercial Company . " It had no place of business , kept no Gooks , and owned no stock of merchandise ; but it billed to the city , at exorbitant prices , from two to ten thousand dollars ' worth of sundries every month . The municipal charter provides that whenever it becomes necessary to purchase goods to the value of one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposals and shall buy from the lowest bidder . This legal requirement was evaded by making large purchases in small , nominally separate lots . If twelve hundred dollars ' worth of stationery were needed , the total quantity was divided into halves or thirds , and then these fractional parts were bought from the City Commercial Company , Snook &; Company , or some other fictitious or fraudulent concern which shared its profits with the administration . Profiting Bu a City 's Misfortune After the earthquake and fire of 1906 a new and profitable field of exploitation was opened to Ruef , Schmitz , and the Board of Public Works in the rental of rooms and houses for municipal offices and the courts . No attempt was made to repair the city 's public buildings , many of which might easily have been put in condition for occupancy ; but rooms and houses were rented , here and there , in the western part of the city , at rates which would have paid five per cent . interest on an investment of $2,000,000 . Much of this money went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were willing to Share profits . Fire Commissioner Wreden ? the same man whose beer the saloons of the city had been forced to take on penalty of losing their licenses ? let the basement of his house to the city for three times its rental value ; Morris L. Asher got $7,200 a year in rent for a building on Sacramento Street that might have been bought outright for $12,000 ; and Morris Levy , a friend of Ruef , leased a wooden building for $100 a month and then sublet it to the city for $500 a month . At the end of the first year after the earthquake and fire most of the private buildings of the city , including the Merchants ' Exchange , the Flood Building , the offices of the Call and the Chronicle , the Mutual Savings Bank , the Fairmount Hotel , and dozens of other important structures , had been partially or completely repaired or rebuilt , and many of them were occupied ; but not a stroke of work had been done on any of the public buildings , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private houses , wooden shacks , Jewish synagogues , and Salvation Army halls . In the winter of 1906 Mayor Schmitz , personally , decided to erect a temporary wooden building for the accommodation of the Board of Supervisors . He might have had this building put up on ground belonging to the city , or he might have accepted a very desirable site , near the corner of Eighth and Market streets , which was offered to him , without rent , by a wealthy and public-spirited citizen named Andrew McCreary ; but there would have been no opportunity to make money out of a buildingsite that cost nothing , so he leased a vacant lot near the corner of Mason and Eddy streets , belonging to Mrs. Ernestine Krelling , for a term of two years , at an annual rental of $24,000 . Police Commissioner Leahy acted as Mrs. Krelling 's agent in the transaction , while the mayor looked after the interests of the city . Having thus paid $48,000 for two years ' occupancy of a bare , unimproved site , the mayor engaged the Deneen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on it , and then allowed George F. Duffey , president of the Board of Public Works , to put in the plumbing . How much graft there was in this so-called " Hall of Justice " it is impossible , as yet , to determine ; but , with a police commissioner to make the deal for the land , the mayor 's company to erect the building , and the president of the Board of Works to do the plumbing , it is not likely that any profitable opportunities were overlooked . Lost ? A Great City 's Opportunity If the municipal authorities of San Francisco had managed the business of the city with reasonable efficiency , their failure to govern with economy might , perhaps , be tolerated ; but the Ruef-Schmitz administration was as weak and incapable as it was wasteful and corrupt . When the business quarter was totally destroyed by fire , in April , 1906 , hundreds of men said hopefully : " We will make good use of the calamity . We 'll widen our old streets , open new ones , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earthquake-proof water system . " But these visions of hope were never realized . The public buildings were not reconstructed ; the streets were not widened ; the water-supply was not increased ; the new buildings were not made fire-proof ; and the plans of D. H. Burnham for the improvement of the city were not acted upon . No serious attempt was made to clean up the streets in the " burned district , " or even to put them in such condition that they might safely be used . In January , 1907 , nine months after the fire ,  | George Renner , president of the Draymen 's Association , said to the members of that body : " Unless immediate steps are taken to repair the streets of San Francisco , the transportation of freight will come to a stop . The city has set apart 862l,000 a year for street improvement . President George F. Duffey , of the Board of Public Works , tells me that the fund is exhausted ; but I am willing that any man of the administration should take me anywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been spent in repairs . There is not a street north , south , east , or west of East Street , in the burned district , that is passable . Our horses are dying fast , and , if something is not done , it will soon be impossible for us to work our teams . " Matthew McCurrie , secretary of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals , reported that the horses of the city were dying at the rate of three hundred a month , as the result of overwork , due , chiefly , to the bad condition of the streets . Citizens Turn Out to Clean flee Streets The state of affairs , in this respect , finally became so intolerable that the Merchants ' Association undertook , at its own expense , to repair Montgomery Street ; the business men south of Market took in hand the cleaning and lighting of Mission Street from Twentieth to Army ; the produce and commission dealers formed an association for the repair and improvement of Sacramento , Clay , Jackson , and Washington streets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firms in the city organized a general " Street Repair Association . " These attempts of public-spirited citizens to do the work which the municipal authorities neglected were resented , at once , by the thieves of the Ruef-Schmitz administration , and at a meeting of the Board of Supervisors held on January 21 , 1907 , the grafter Boxton said : " I do n't believe that the merchants should be allowed to interfere in the work of repairing the streets of San Francisco at all . This board is able to do the work . " * On March 3 , 1907 , twenty thousand citizen volunteers , under the direction of the Street Repair Association , turned out , en masse , to clean up the long-neglected city ; and this body of volunteer workers accomplished more in ten hours than had been accomplished by the city government in ten months . The Risk of Another Conflagration One of the most serious difficulties that confronted San Francisco after the earthquake and fire of 1906 was that of obtaining an adequate water-supply . The large increase in the number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the water furnished by the Spring Valley Company was not sufficient in quantity to afford the city proper protection . It was manifestly the duty of the Board of Supervisors to give this problem immediate consideration , and to increase the supply of water by the best and quickest means available . Instead of doing this , they agreed to accept a bribe of $1,000,000 from the Bay Cities Water Company , and then passed an ordinance authorizing the issue of bonds , to the amount of $10,500,000 , for the purchase of certain water rights which the Bay Cities Company owned and for which it had paid about $400,000 . In other words , Ruef , Schmitz , and the supervisors , in consideration of a bribe of $1,000,000 , agreed to saddle the city with a debt of $10,500,000 for a water-supply which had cost its owners less than one tenth of that sum . Fortunately , the proposed issue of bonds had to be submitted to the voters of the municipality at a special election , and before this election could be held , Spreckels , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the scheme was defeated . The supervisors then refused or neglected to give the question of water-supply any further attention , and on January 16 , 1907 , the Board of Fire Underwriters gave notice of an increase of thirty-three and one third per cent . in the rates of insurance on all except " Class A " buildings within the limits of the " burned district . " They assigned , as their reasons for such action , the inadequate supply of water and the difficulty of taking fireengines through the almost impassable streets . In December , 1906 , it was estimated that the property-owners of the city had paid for fireinsurance , in the preceding eight months , $3,500,000 more than they paid in the last eight months before the earthquake . And this was only a part of the cost of corrupt and inefficient government . In commenting on the situation , the Examiner said : " It is nearly eight months since the great fire , and not one project for the improvement of the city has been placed before the voters . None @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even has a single step been taken to get water for fire-fighting out of the inexhaustible supplies in the bay and ocean . Three fourths of the value of the city has been burned up for the want of such a supply . The  | new business section is paying from five to ten per cent . for insurance , and over a great part of the Western Addition not another dollar of insurance can be placed at any price . Yet the city government has not made the slightest preparation to guard against another conflagration . Whatever any one may think about the charge that the men who are running the city are thieves , nobody can doubt that they are wholly incompetent . " At a later date the Chronicle said : " Are not our insurance rates high enough now ? Does any one wish to see his rate doubled , or , possibly , his policies canceled ? Do not our people know that without a reliable water-supply , at a good pressure , insurance will be impossible at any price ? Are they willing to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Are we all clean gone daft ? Can there not be effective action even to protect our homes and our business from destruction ? What sort of a city is San Francisco ? " To the last of these questions an answer may easily be made . San Francisco is a city existing under graft conditions , and the people responsible for such conditions are the tens of thousands of selfish business men and working-men who , with their eyes wide open , deliberately voted , in 1905 , for a mayor who was known to be a grafter . The Capitalization of Sin And now , last but far from least , concerning craft conditions in their relation to vice and crime : In every large city , the enterprises that yield the largest returns for the money invested are those that minister to the weaknesses and vices of the population . Most of these enterprises are illegal , and , for that reason , their promoters are always ready to divide profits with any one who is willing and able to give them protection . Ruef and Schmitz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ San Francisco , and , as soon as they obtained control of the Police Commission , they proceeded to capitalize the sin of the city such a way that it would pay dividends to its protectors as well as to its promoters . They turned their attention first to houses of ill fame . in 1904 Joseph Michel , Joseph Alexander , and George Maxwell ( at one time secretary of the Fire Department ) conceived the idea of opening a big house of prostitution in Chinatown and running it under the secret protection , if not under the auspices , of the municipal administration . After making a partnership arrangement with Schmitz and Ruef , they purchased an old three-story Chinese opium-joint on Jackson Street which was known to frequenters of the Barbary Coast as the " Palace Hotel . " As the building was not adapted to their purposes , and as it would cost a good deal to tear it down , they had it condemned by the Board of Health as " unsanitary , " and then got the Board of Public Works to demolish and remove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus obtained they erected , at a cost of Sioo , 000 , a large brick building containing one hundred and forty-four two-room apartments colloquially known as " cribs . " They then filled these cribs with dissolute women ; provided the establishment with a restaurant and bar forthe entertainment of prospective patrons ; and opened a house of prostitution which eventually became known as the " Municipal Crib " ? a name given to it on account of the interest taken in it and the protection given to it by the municipal authorities . While the building was in course of construction , P. Fitzsimons , an honest inspector of the Board of Public Works , made an examination of it , and reported that it was clearly intended for illegal purposes , and that it violated the building regulations and the fire ordinances ; but Herbert L. Schmitz , the mayor 's brother , who was then president of the Board of Works , reprimanded the inspector for his officious zeal , and pigeonholed or destroyed his report . The Police Commission shortly afterward allowed the house to open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for its bar . The place was largely patronized from the very first . On one occasion , when the place was watched , six hundred and fifty-eight men were seen to enter the front door in a single hour . The women who occupied the cribs paid rent at the rate of thirty-five dollars a week for each apartment , and the gross receipts of the house , including the earnings of its inmates , were probably not less than $500,000 a year . This gigantic brothel was protected by direct order of the mayor , and he and Ruef had a share of its profits . The Andrews Grand Jury made a determined effort to close it by arresting more than a hundred of its inmates , and by posting constables outside its doors to prevent any one from going in ; but Judge Hebbard of the Superior Court issued an injunction forbidding the Grand Jury , the police , or the sheriff to interfere with it in any way whatever . An attempt was then made to close , by similar methods , eight houses of prostitution on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protection . The administration again came to the relief of the sufferers , and Judge Hebbard granted another injunction , on the alleged ground that the places attacked by the Grand Jury were innocent lodging-houses.  | The Chief Executive 's Peculiar Right In some cases the mayor gave vicious resorts his direct and personal protection . He guaranteed the lease of a Mrs. Berlin , who kept a brothel at 554 Geary Street , and when the Andrews Grand Jury asked him for an explanation of this transaction , he assumed an air of virtuous indignation and said : " For God 's sake , gentlemen , do n't begin throwing mud in this way . That lady is as pure a woman as my wife , or any one of your wives . I guaranteed her lease simply because she was an old friend . " Some of the members of the jury were really persuaded that they had done the mayor an injustice by even suspecting him of improper motives in this transaction ; but , a few nights later , Mr. Andrews sent a man to Mrs. Berlin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character . Mrs. Berlin herself was subsequently arrested in a women 's pool-room , where she was betting on the races ; but as soon as she made it clear to the police that she was a personal friend of the mayor , she was allowed to escape . The charge that Schmitz protected houses of prostitution and shared in their profits was directly made in an open letter written to him by Thomas Reagan , a police commissioner with whom he had had a quarrel . In this letter Mr. Reagan said : " The number of houses of ill fame in this city is in your possession . The list is a formidable one . Knowing that it is a part of your duty to make regulations for the same , I do not blame you for being angry if any person or clique should attempt to rob the chief executive of his peculiar right to regulate the Magdalens of this city . I have not now , nor in the past , nor will 1 in the future , covet , take , or carry one dollar belonging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your Honor . " To this letter Schmitz made no reply . The " Lawyers ' Fund " But it was not only social vice that received aid , encouragement , and protection from the mayor and his subordinates . In all parts of the city , proprietors of faro-banks , crap- games , poolrooms , and lotteries divided their profits with the administration , and were guaranteed immunity from prosecution or interference . The managers of pool-rooms were assessed from fifteen to seventy-five dollars a week , and the money thus raised went into what was known as the " lawyers ' fund . " During the racing season the contributions to this fund amounted , in the aggregate , to more than $20,000 a month . Gambling-houses paid all sorts of sums , from seventy-five dollars a week to one third of their gross receipts . One well-known gambler abandoned San Francisco as a place of business altogether because , as he afterward said to a friend in Los Angeles , the city authorities " wanted it all . " The friend repeated this statement to another gambler in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be exaggerated . " Exaggerated ! " exclaimed the latter . " They made me give them one third of my receipts and pay a doorkeeper of their selection five dollars a night . Would n't that make you sit up ? " The Andrews Grand Jury , in summing up its investigations in this field , said : " We find that faro-bank , craps , pool-rooms , and other gambling games are operating openly and notoriously in various parts of the city ; that the managers of the games are the political friends of the administration ; that they boast of their ability to fix things ' for others who desire to engage in similar lines of unlawful business and are willing to pay for such protection as they receive ; and the fact that they are permitted to operate , and are aided and protected by the officials charged with the enforcement of law and order and the preservation of public morals , convinces us that they speak understandingly and act advisedly . Such places are not only permitted by the municipal authorities to exist , but are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can devise . " Nurseries of Vice The result of the protection thus given gamblers , pool-sellers , brothel-keepers , and prostitutes was an extraordinary growth and development of vice ; and if half the population of San Francisco did not go to ruin in the last two years of Mayor Schmitz ' administration , it was not for lack of temptations and facilities . Protection and encouragement were given even to agencies for the corruption of boys and girls . On Fillmore Street , and in various other parts of the city , there were established cheap places of amusement known as " nickelodeons " and " penny arcades . " These wide-open resorts were filled with automatic machines which ground out music or exhibited moving pictures when a nickel or a penny was dropped into the slot . It would be impossible to describe the pictures in words that are printable ; the sale of such photographs constitutes a criminal offense . If these places were intended only for such grown men as frequent the Tenderloin , the Red Light District , and the Barbary Coast , they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children ; and as admittance is free , and it costs only a penny to see a picture , thousands of boys and girls patronize them . Probation officers of the Juvenile Court , who have watched these resorts ,  | say that young people of both sexes make assignations there , with the assistance of the attendants , and that they have often seen boys going directly from the picture slot-machines to houses of- ill fame . Attempts were made , last year . to close some of these places ; but it was found that , like the gambling-dens and the brothels , they were protected by the municipal administration . It is worth while , perhaps , to call particular attention to the fact that this Ruef-SchmitzDinan administration , which collected blackmail from thieves , gamblers , and prostitutes ; which went into partnership with looters and dealers in stolen junk ; which issued liquor licenses to houses of assignation ; which allowed hundreds of saloons to maintain illegal side entrances for women ; which protected brothels by means of injunctions ; which shared the earnings of courtezans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nickelodeons to corrupt young boys and girls by showing them suggestive and indecent pictures ? this administration , which was stained with almost every crime and soaked in almost every loathsome vice , excluded ninety-three Japanese scholars from the white public schools on the alleged ground that their standard of morality was lower than ours , and then appealed to the country for sympathy and support in its effort to protect the people ? and especially the children  --  of San Francisco from the contaminating influence of the Orient ! The Height of a City 's Demoralization The demoralization of the city reached its height , perhaps , just before the earthquake and fire of 1906 . At that time , according to Police Captain Mooney , * the area of the Tenderloin had greatly increased ; the saloons , generally , had thrown off all restraints of law ; brothels , gambling-dens , and assignation-houses multiplied and flourished under administrative protection ; women lured men to " dives " and " deadfalls " and assisted in the work of drugging and robbing them ; charges brought against law-breakers were dismissed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the police-courts ; honest officers who tried to enforce the laws were transferred to quiet and unimportant residence districts ; nickelodeons , disreputable theaters , and penny arcades corrupted the young ; street-walking prostitutes intercepted even men who were on their way to church and gave them cards ; drunkenness , immorality , and dissipation in every form became common ; all-night drug-stores sold opium , morphine , and chloral without regulation or restraint ; and the number of " drug fiends " in the city increased to about eight thousand . With the increase in vice which was the direct result of administrative encouragement and protection , there came , naturally , a great increase in the number of crimes , and especially crimes of violence . In the last year of Mayor Schmitz ' administration there were fifty-one murders ; three hundred and seventy-three murderous assaults ; four hundred and fortysix burglaries and robberies ; twenty-eight hundred and forty-nine disturbances of the peace ; and twenty-seven thousand and thirteen arrests . This aggregate of crime was due partly to wideopen conditions in saloons and vicious resorts , and partly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other cities and States by reports of administrative laxity and opportunities for making " easy money . " In this imperfect attempt to show the influence of graft conditions upon commercial morality , governmental efficiency , and the prevalence of vice and crime , there is no intention of proving , or attempting to prove , that San Francisco is worse than New York , Philadelphia , Chicago , Minneapolis , or St. Louis . Human nature is everywhere the same , and corrupt government produces everywhere the same demoralizing results . There is particular need , however , for setting forth and emphasizing these results in the case of San Francisco , because many of its citizens show a disposition to extenuate the evils of dishonesty ; to apologize for violations of law ; to excuse bribers whose energy and business capacity have helped to make the city great ; and to lay stress upon material achievement and business prosperity rather than upon civic virtue and moral integrity . But what shall it profit a city if it gain the whole world and lose its own soul ? San Francisco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graft , immorality , earthquake , and fire ; but has it preserved its soul alive ? Will it be able to burn its abundant harvest of wild oats , eradicate the weeds and tares from its fertile soil , and plant afresh the seeds of honesty , decency , and civic righteousness ?
