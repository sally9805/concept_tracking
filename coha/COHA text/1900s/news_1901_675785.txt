txt The trial of Robert Stewart Fosburgh for the leged killing 01 his sister . May , in August , 1900. was abrupt'y closed to-day when the jury , under instructions from the Court , returned a verdict of not guilty . When the court convened the chamber was cross Lied and a large number of members 01 the Berkshire Bar occupied seats which had been reserved for them . Many women who had attended the trial at every session , carrying their luncheons with them , were there this morning with their lunch baskets . The Fosburgh family , with the exception of the defendant 's wife . who was ill , occupied their accustomed seats -. was just 9:15 o'clock when Judge Stevens entered , and immediately upon the opening of court , his Honor arose . faced the jury . and directed them that a verdict of acquittal be given for the defendant . Judge Stevens said : " Mr. Foreman and Gentlemen : During six days we have listened to a painful recital of one of the saddest tragedies ever presented to a jury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down and her brother has been accused of ' he crime . The Government has , , in accusing the brother of the crime , been called upon to establish three things : First , that May Fosburgh was not killed by burglars : second , the Government must exclude every one else in that house from the charge except the defendant , and , third , that the act was a criminal one . THE TRIAL AN INQUEST . " " The trial has proceeded somewhat in the form of an inquest , and has been tried with great pains on the part of the Government and the defense . There has peen a desire to obtain proof , and so a great deal of evidence has been Introduced and admitted without objection which might have been excluded under the strkt rule of the law . I think I ought also to say to you that It is due to the Chief of Police , who has stood behind this prosecution , that in the view of the Court he has tried to do his duty with a single eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Foreman and gentlemen , a motion has been made that this case be taken from the jury , and it becomes my duty to say to you that , in the opinion of the Court , the Government has not furnished proof sufficient to sustain averdict of guilty against the defendant , and therefore , under the direction of the Court . in the indictment of Robert S. Fpsburgh for killing his sister , you will return a verdict of not guilty . " As the Judge concluded his remarks ' the spectators began clapping their hands , but the Judge immediately ordered that the applause be suppressed , and this was done by the court officers . The defendant stood while the foreman of the Jury replied to the question , " What is your verdict ? " The reply was , " Not guilty . " The de/ fendant was then formally discharged , and Judge Stevens dismissed the jury , after thanking them . Opportunity was given the Fosburgh family to leave the courtroom in advance of the spectators , and they at once proceeded to the Wendell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later hundreds of persons shook hands with young Robert Fosburgh . The man just vindicated by Judge and jury Went directly to his wife 's room . She was ill in bed , but the news of her husband 's acquittal so strengthened her that she arose and , throwing her arms about him , exclaimed : " Thank God ! thank God ! " JURY WOULD HAVE ACQUITTED . As soon as the jury was dismissed , Vue foreman called them together in his private room , and for the first time there was a conference as to what the jurors believed . Witt/Out exception they declared that they would have returned a verdict of not Aunty within fifteen minutes , even had they notl been instructed by the Court . Their general impression was that the trial was a very fair one , but that the Government hadlacquitted the defendant with itS own testimony . They acknowledged that they would have paid no attention to the exhibits in the case . This afternoon the Fosburgh family gave out this statement , signed Robert L. Fosburgh and family : We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment 's doubt of the result . We knew we had told the exact truth as to the death of our dear May . Her death at the hands of a burglar was a crushing blow to us all , but greater still was our anguish when one , of our members was accused of lulling her . But throt* it all God 's infinite love and power has Sustained us . To that portion of the public press and the kind friends who have so nobly stood by us we extend our sincere thanks . Mrs. Robert L. Fosburgh personally thanked the reporters , from whom , she said , she had received the kindest Consideration . " When I was on the witness stand , " said Mrs. Fosburgh , " I did not look at the jury . I only knew that I had to tell what happened that dreadful night , and I did It . I was very glad ' that the Judge ruled in favor of the I Government , and allowed almost everything to go in. wanted the jury to know the truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy . " Seneca M. Taylor of St. Louis . an intimate friend of the Fosburgh family , who has been with them during the trial $ made the fo/lovilng statement : The Fosburgh family is one of the kindliest and most lovable I ever knew . The killing of their daughter by burglars paralyzed them . They were desirous that the murderer should be arrested and punished , and to this end they furnished all the information they possessed to Chief Nicholson . They employed private detectives to assist-him In ferreting out the murderers . They never supposed for a moment that he doubted that burglars had ? entered their home and killed Miss Fosburgh. and . from the overwhelming evidence that was placed before Chief Nicholson as to the circumstances attending the . death of Miss Fosburgh , I can not believe he had any ground for doubting statements of the family as to how Miss Fosburgh was killed . Four members of the family saw the masked burglars mid three of them were seriously hurt by the burglars . CRITICISM OF THE POLICE . Neighbors heard the shots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . and rushed to their assistance , finding the family in their night clothes . Other neighbors saw the fleeing burglars . Now . these facts had been placed ? before Chief Nicholson . and Yet , tailing to arrest the invaders of the Fosburgh home , he caused the eldest son to be indicted on the charge of manslaughter . Every person who was present at the trial expressed the conviction that the evidence produced by the Commqnwealth was not such as would warrant any Grand Jury in finds ing an indictment , and the question arises In my mind how the Chief succeeded in obtaining an indictment and what were his motives for doing so . It looked as if at the bottom of this prosecution there was malice against the Fosburgh family , coupled with a desire to stay criticism against the Chief because of his failure to find the burglars . District Attorney Hammond said the court was fully justified in taking the case from the jury . He thought , however , that Chief of Police Nicholson was fully war : ranted in making the investigation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tion had expected to show by - the teat= mony of , Beatrice at tht , inquest that - the defendant had the exclusiveiopportun4tyto get his revolver . At the inquest , he said , her testimony was that her brother Robert was in the back hall when the shot was fired , but her action in changing her testimony prevented the State from bringing ' out that noint to the jury . Ex-District Attorney Hibbard , one of the counsel for the defense , said he believed that the Judge would have ordered a verdict if the defense had not put in any testimony . Chief of Police Nicholson said that as the State was- satisfied he supposed he would have to be . He took no stock in the story that came from New York to the effect that affidavits had been secured tending to show that evidence might be procured in New York to show that May Fosburgh had been shot by burglars .
