txt In taking advantage of what appears to have been a technical defect in the complaint on which the Board of Health prosecuted the General Superintendent of the Long Island Railroad for operating its locomotive engines with a wholly unnecessary amount of smoke , the management of that company was undoubtedly quite within its rights . Those who draft complaints and take them to court must be careful to " speak by the card . " However , a wrong is not made right , nor is its penalty escaped , by a clever expedient of counsel in getting a complaint dismissed when others in correct form may and should follow .

Its engines belch vast cumuli of black , suffocating smoke . This makes it unpopular along its entire line , and involves great discomfort to passengers , who can not possibly enjoy travel under such conditions . Besides showing a proper regard for the public interest in this matter , would it not be good business policy to reduce its smoke nuisance to the least expression ? Its present consumption of coal 10 wasteful and will continue to be so long as it distributes carbon over a good part of Long Island . To substitute anthracite coal for bituminous would not be burdensome for a road with its principal terminal at tidewater at New York . That it has no competition in reaching the popular resorts of Long Island does not excuse the business mistake of neglecting or refusing to do anything which will bring it business and hold through twelve months a steadily increasing proportion of that which now uses it reluctantly during the three or four months of Summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
