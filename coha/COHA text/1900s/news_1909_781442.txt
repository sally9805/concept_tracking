txt The testimony of Norman H , Price , an employe of the dry goods firm which appraised the interior furnishings of the home of Mrs. Caroline Webster Astor at 842 Fifth Avenue , has been filed in the Surrogates ' Court in connection with the report of Tax Appraiser James Yereance . The testimony showed that Mrs. Astor 's pearls were not the only imitations among her possessions . It also shows that Mrs. Astor , although her husband left a fortune estimated to be between $60,000,000 and $70,000,000 , and she owned several ' million altars ' ' worth of property herself , allowed her Fifth Avenue mansion to become " dilapidated " as to its interior , so that she passed the last years of her life in the midst of tarnished splendor . According to the appraiser , the furniture , carpets , and rugs were in a worn and sailed conditon when he made his valuation of the interior last Spring , anti the richness and beauty of the Astor home had become a thing of ? by-gone days . The testimony was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of George A.

Crulkshank .. Mr. Price said that he had been making estimates of house furnishings for his employers for the last ten years , When asked if the furniture in the Fifth Avenue home was new he replied that most of it was yew old  --  that it had come from the old Astor home at Thirty-third Street and Fifth ; , Avenue . " Mrs. Astor 's husband died many years ago , and the furniture was the household furniture and effects in use during his lifetime ? " asked the Appraiser . " Yes , it was , " answered Mr , Price . " What was the character of the dining room furniture ? " was the next question , " It was very old-fashioned ; old tables Painted black with gold rims . " " What about the hangings in the dining room ? " " They are practically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the in- ' terior of the Astor home had appraised ' the room of Mrs. Charlotte A. Haig on the third floor at $430 . He told the appraiser that Mrs. Haig was sick at the time he went to the house . " You certainly did not personally examine the things in Mrs. Haig 's room given in your schedule ? " asked Mr. Yereance . " No , Sir , " " How did you come to put the value of the articles there ? " " I got them from a man who showed me a bed like that or a cabinet like that , and in this way I got the value of the furniture . " " You did not see the furniture yourself ? " the Appraiser pursued . No , Sir , not in that room . " " Why do you say that this was all old furniture ? " " I did not say it was all old furniture . I say a large part of it . " " What do you understand by new fur-niture ? " ' " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Do your employers handle second-hand furniture ? " " Yes ; antique stuff . " Mr. Yereance then turned his inquiry to various articles of furniture which had been valued at low figures in the expert 's report . Describe the hangings in the reception room , valued at $10 , he said . " They r re very old , " returned Price . " You can not make any use of them . They are badly faded and very soiled , but they are not worn or torn . " " What about the hangings in the draw-ing room ? " " They are soiled and worn . It is not possible to get $75 for them . " " I see in your schedule , " said Mr. Yereance , " ninety gilt chairs in the ballroom , valued at $135. practically $1.50 each , Describe these chairs . " ' They cost $2.75 when new , " was the answer . " They have gilt paint on them , Forth new about $3.75 . " What was the condition of these chairs ? " asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' You could take the back of them and shake them and find them very loose . " " In the entrance hall were six sets of hangings valued by you at $100 . What about these hangings ? " " One of these was embroidered and it is not worth anything , and ? " The rest of Mr. Price 's answer was cut short by the Appraiser , who did not seem anxious to have him finish his description . " What do you mean by a carpet on the stairs valued at $21 ? " he asked hurriedly , " That is a carpet every thread of which was worn on the edge . ' " Did you examine the Chickering piano in the sitting room , valued at $75 ? " " Yes , did . The frame is in bad condition . " " What do you mean by that ? " " It is full of dents and scratches . I sold one for $100 which was a. better piano than that . " " You say you are an expert on paintings ; " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What about four paintings after Boucher valued by you at $40 ? " " They are not paintings at all , " returned Mr. Price . " They were simply painted by some amateur . " The Appraiser then returned to the subject of Mrs. Astor 's furniture . " I understand you to say that the chairs in the ballroom were rickety and in a dilapitated condition ? " " Yes , Sir . " " Describe the clock in the entrance hall . " " It was a type of grandfather 's clock , seven feet high , with a good set of works I in it . It was about the newest thing they had about there .

" At this point the Appraiser seemed to think that he had learned all he cared to know about the cdndition. of Mrs. As ? tor 's home . He put this final question ; " You want to be understood that ' ail ' the furniture , carpets , and rugs in the house were in a somewhat ' dilapidated ' condition ? " " Well , " returned Mr , Price , " in a somewhat worn condition . The rug on the second floor bedroom , for instance , was full of holes , fully six to twelve inches long and tacked to the floor to hold it in place . Seili a rug is not worth anything . " I This concluded Mr. Price 's testimony before Appraiser Yereance.                @ @ @ @ @
