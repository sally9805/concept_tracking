BY ROBERT SHACKLETON Ostensibly because of a dispute regarding the custody of the holy places in Palestine , war began between Russia and Turkey in 11353 . Oddly enough , considering the ostensible cause , Eng-land and France joined with Turkey early in 1854 , and later Sardinia also joined . Still later Sweden became one of the league , but not in time , like the others , to send an army . The real desire of the allies was to check Russian power . In September , 1854 , an allied army landed in the Crimea The battles of Alma and Balaklava were fought and the siege of Sebastopol was begun . On November 5 a Russian army of some 50.000 men attacked the British at Inkcrman , but were completely repulsed . It was the fiercest battle of the war . Including reinforcements , the English and French who took part in the battle numbered only about 15,000 . The Russians lost 15,000 men ? as many as the total of the force they engaged ! The allied loss was over 4000 . More than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noted for its displays of individual bravery , its desperate personal encounters , its hand-to-hand fighting . It was practically a battle without manoeuvring on either side . The war continued till after the capture of Sebastopol. in September , 1855 . By the treaty of peace , Russia agreed to terms which for a time checked her encroachments upon Turkey . " T was a battle of many hours in the mist and the rain . " It was a battle of close fighting , of much hand-to-hand fighting , of man to man . It was a rage , a madness , with cannon and rifles , with the bayonet , with clubbed muskets , with swords , with stones , with fists . " It was the fiercest of all the fights of the Crimea , and I was in every battle of that war . " Thus Charles Patrick Conway , sergeant of artillery in the army of her Majesty the Queen , but now lying bedridden within the picturesque walls of pinky brick of the great pile at Chelsea , nobly founded by Charles II. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care of old and war-worn veterans . " I enlisted in 1848 . It was in Ireland . I am a north-of-Ireland man , and it was a famine year , and I wanted to he a soldier , and there did n't seem to be anything else to do , and I told the recruiting sergeant that I was eighteen , so that he would take me . I was only sixteen , but I was tall and strong , and if the recruiting sergeant suspected anything , he did n't say so , and he enlisted me , and off I went . And I took naturally to soldiering , and when the war began with Russia , in 1354 , I was a sergeant . And 1 was sent to the Crimea and I was in every battle of the Crimean war . " As to this , his official record is explicit . Even on that day of scattered engagements known collectively as BaIaklava he was busied with the artillery , and from a hillside saw the Six Hundred go on their immortal charge . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their horses were in poor condition and could n't gallop well . " A curious sidelight , this , from a practical and keen-eyed soldier ; en artilleryman , accustomed to judging horses . " That - whole war in the Crimea was pretty bad , because our army was poorly taken care of . We were hungry . It got so that we did n't have clothes . For a long time T wore sacking for an overcoat . We had green coffee and no way to roast it . If it had n't been for the French , we should have starved . The French commissary work was good , and they were comfortable , and they were good fighters and good comrades . They gave us bisquee and they gave us cognac . Without them we could n't have lived . When the cold came we often had no water to drink except melted snow . Often we were so thirsty we wished it would snow . We had so little wood that if we built huts to keep out the snow we could n't build fires to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could spit through them . " It was the most neglected British army , " he summed up , quaintly ; " the most neglected British army since the birth of Christ . " But we kept at it . We did n't give up and we did n't let go . The Russians used to say that their best general was General Frost , but we fought even him and won , just as we won the battles with the Russian soldiers . " And of all the battles of the Crimea , that of Inkerman was the hardest . " It was on Sunday , the 5th of November ? Gunpowder Plot day ? and the Russians certainly made it a gunpowder day for us . " And we did n't have any kind of church service that Sunday , either Protestant or Catholic ! They did say afterwards that a priest or a minister was on his way to the ridge where we were camped , but that the battle was on long before he got to us . " I was in Turner 's Battery of field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sebastopol had begun after the first battles , and our battery was on what we called Home Ridge , near the village of Inkerman ? a little village with old and crumbly-looking houses , and with caves in the rode near by where they said people used to live thousands of years ago . " During the battle of Inkerman , so we learned afterwards , our ridge was the most important part of the whole position . And ? well , we held it ; and as there was n't any place to retreat to except into the Black Sea , if we started to go , it was well we did n't start . " The morning of November 5 was cold and raw , with a heavy mist and a cold and drizzling rain . Long before the time of daylight the church bells were ringMg in the city of Sebastopol , and there was a rumbling for a long time , but nobody could tell what it all meant . Of course it seemed " clear enough that if the church bells of Sebastopol were ringing at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sunday , there was something up , but it was all a guess as to what it was . We knew afterwards that they opened the churches to bless the soldiers who were going to attack us , and make them eager to drive us into the sea ; and the rumbling , it was from the movement of artillery for the attack . " There was n't much to do in the darkness but watch for what was to come . If the sounds meant an attack , nobody knew what place the Russians would choose . " And when the attack came , suddenly and before daylight ? right out of the darkness and mist ? it was a surprise . There was just a handful of us when the Russians struck us : perhaps three thousand in all . Rot of course reinforcements soon began coming in . " It began with a furious shooting from our pickets , who held their ground stubbornly , but of course fell back . Then our men who were out on the morning 's detail for wood and water came running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast marching of a big force . But still it was too dark to sec anything . " An order came to Captain Turner to fire one gun into where the enemy seemed to be ; our battery had six ; and so the gun was fired into the mist , and there were shouts and yells and a great firing from the Russians , and they broke out of the mist and ran at us ? a swarm of big hairy men in gray topcoats and muffin hats , and they charged with their bayonets . " Queer-looking men they were , and they always had their months open when they charged , and their big teeth showed in a Sort of snarl . Good soldiers , those Russians . " And so the battle was on . We had n't had any chance for breakfast . But you do n't think of breakfast at such a time . You get so busy loading and firing and hacking and clubbing that you do n't think of anything but just knocking over the enemy . " From the first it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the rain and the roughness of the ground made it all close fighting . " Our battery fired ease-shot ? six hundred and twelve small balls in a ease ? arid when we blazed away at close range it was a sight to see those Russians just go down in squads and lines . They would just go pitching every way some head first , some sidewise , some over backwards , with their arms thrown up ? and T suppose it was awful , but when you 're fighting vou do n't think of it as awful . You get excited , and you do n't think of anything but knocking over the enemy . And why not ? For if you did n't they 'd be knocking y o over and putting a bayonet through you . And we yelled with joy when whole lines would go over and the others would hesitate and retreat . We did n't think any more of it , in the way of caring , than if they 'd been ninepins we were knocking over . " And always our infantry was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We could n't see much of it , what with the mist and the powder smoke ; but when we did see , they were bayoneting and shooting as hard as they could go , and we heard firing for a long distance on both sides of us , and so we knew that it was a general engagement . " On the Russians would come again ? months open , teeth showing , bayonets held ready to stick into us , and we loading and firing like mad , and sending six hundred and twelve bullets at each shot . But they would come swarming right up to us , and then it was cut and stab and hack , hand to hand , with our infantry helping with rifle and bayonet . Var .. CXVT11. ? Nn. 702. - 104 " A close grapple , over and over again . For no matter how often the Russians were forced back , they would come on again As if they did n't care for their lives and as if there was no end to their men . Down they would go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew we saw them lying dead and writhing , for all we saw was the men who were still on their feet and facing us . " There were hand - to - band fights all over the field . It was n't just at our battery . It was everywhere . And there was such a melly that officers and men , British and Russians , were often all mixed in together , with the officers cutting and slashing just like the men . And everybody w a s fierce , like the two who , fighting with the bayonet , stabbed each other so strong in the breast at the same moment that each fell back dead with the other 's weapon sticking in him . " It was all a swirl . Once in a while the mist would clear a little and the smoke would blow away , and then we could see that everywhere was the same ( ' lose fighting . " And once , when the mist let up , it showed a larger force than ever of Russians coming right at us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guns was filled with mixed-up parts of our regiments , and they were going to fight the Russians right there ? they never thought of retreat ? but they did n't know that Captain Turner wanted them out of the way so that he could give the Russians case . " And the captain was mad . ' If those damned infantry would lie down , ' he shouted , I 'd take care of those Russians ! ' He did n't mean to abuse the infantry , you understand , but just wanted space to shoot . He was almost ready to fire at British mid Russians together . For he knew that the charge must be stopped , and there were so many Russians he was afraid the infantry could n't do it . " But the infantry would n't lie down or fall behind the guns , but stood there with rifles loaded and bayonets fixed . It all happened quick , you understand , and Captain Turner , his eyes were flashing and he quivered like a big dog that wants to leap , and he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he sent Sergeant West out to tell their officers to make them lie down . And there was a little space that he had to run across , and some Russian artillery had just got the range on it , and we saw him blown to bits . " Newton ! ' the captain called , sharp and quick , and Sergeant Newton ran out , and he too dropped dead . " ? Conway ! ' " And out I ran , and I think that for the only time that day I thought of being hit . You do n't often think of such things . If you did , you could n't fight . But there were my two senior sergeants shot dead there on the same errand I was following them on . And for a moment I thought of it . But it was only a moment . The whole thing was like a flash , you understand . I ran out , and I did n't bother about the shells that were falling , for all my mind was on those infantry standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wild to pour his shot into the charging Russians . And I knew that every second counted . " I did n't see any officer in particular . for it was parts of different regiments mixed together . I just thought I must get those men down . And I did n't stop to think T was n't an officer and ought n't to give any orders , but I just shouted : Lie down ! Lie down ! Lie down ! ' And many heard me and dropped , and others saw them and dropped , and I dropped too ? I did n't forget that !  - -  and over us came the shot , singing and shrieking through the air right over us ; and the Russians stopped . kind o dazed , for so many of them were hit , and up jumped our infantry and rushed at them , and o-Ff they went once more . " His voice rings out , strong and resonant , as he calls : " Lie down ! Lie down I " for it is very real to him , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and his gnarled fingers twitch , and he is quivering , and his eyes of hazel gray flash with eager fire . A helpless invalid now , this white-haired man , but his eyes still have their fearless look . He was never wounded in all of his fighting . but rheumatism has now seized him , and he lies on what he calmly says is his death-bed . A great act , that of getting infantry down in the very heat of the battle , and it put him by name into the formal histories of the war . " And when I got back , Captain Turner just called out , happy , Well , by God ! they did n't get my guns ! ' " He won that battle , did Captain Turner . Tf it had n't been for him we 'd ' a ' lost . And afterwards they made general of him . " The leader of our division was General De Lacy Evans . He was a man ! He was sick , and had gone to one of the ships for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under fire he got right out of his sick-bed and hurried to us ; but he did n't take the command away from General Pen/whither , who had charge in his absence , but just helped him . General Raglan came near , too ? the commander-in-chief , you know ? hut it was all so dark and misty that he could n't see what needed to be done , and so he , too , left General Pennefather in command , for he knew that General Pennefather knew the ground there . " What did the army think of their commander-in-chief ? Well , not very much . Sort of an old woman , they thought . But he was brave enough , and I do n't doubt he did his best . " The army had no confidence in Raglan as a commander , and their distrust was justified . But one thing he did , which Conway himself does not tell , and that was to name the brave . sergeant , in commendation , in one of his despatches . " It was hours and hours of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and infantry on both sides ? no cavalry . This was largely because of the uneven ground . all slopes and rocks and gullies , with close and scraggy underbrush . " Everywhere there were little groups of British fighting by themselves and mixed up with Russians . Everywhere hand-to-hand fighting and stabbing and shooting , and smoke and mist , and dead and wounded piling up in heaps . " And if you chanced to look down at a dead man , if you stumbled over him , like as not he 'd be grinning fierce just as if he was alive . But you did n't often look down at your feet except when some man who had acted dead was trying to stab you . " ' here was a good many Russians did worse than that . Wherever they were waiting for a little for another charge they would look for our wounded , lying there , and bayonet them . Yes ; many of our soldiers were killed that day while lying wounded . " The close fighting kept on for hours and hours . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our line , and our reinforcements kept coming up , and somewhere about noon the French began to come up beside us and help . " It was hot work at those guns . Our men just dropped and dropped . And as to wheels and spokes , there was n't much of them that was n't shot away . And the elevating screw of one gun was broke , and many a time that day I held the gun in position with a handspike while it was fired , and for weeks afterwards I could n't lift my arm as high as my shoulder , thOugh I did n't think anything about it on the day of battle . " We ran out of ammunition and went hack to the Windmill , about a mile away , for more . " We went back , and it was a wild , wild road . Fur shells were dropping there and bullets whistling around us , but all we thought of was to get that ammunition . And now that the men could n't fight , but could only hurry along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and some were laughing or crying or shouting ; but all of us pressed on , and we got the ammunition and hurried back , and were in the thick of the fight again . " Once , after that , when the Russians came at us , they were almost up to us before we knew they were n't our men . A terrible bad day for seeing , what withthe mist and the smoke . Right up near us they were , and we blazed away , and they did n't seem to mind that they fell in whole lines , hot ran right at us , leaping , with their Iong bayonets ready ( they were longer than the . British bayonets ) , and with snarling shouts , like growls . " We struck . We hewed . We threw stones . We used swords . We used our fists . We used anything . We stabbed and clubbed and wrestled . And all about us was our infantry firing and stabbing and clubbing . " His voice took on a raucous rasp , for he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight and fierce . Then he paused , and added quietly : " Often I 've waked in the night with those hairy faces and long bayonets crowding around me . " There was no quarter on either side in those hottest moments of man to man . It was just kill or be killed . It was just which could hit and kill the quickest . And after a while they went off again . " On both sides men terribly wounded fought right on , and men who had dropped with death wounds pulled themselves together for a while and went back into the fight . " Often our men and the Russians were so mixed up with each other that you could n't tell which were advancing and which were retreating . All was in a whirl , with men fighting chest against chest so close they could hardly strike . At such times the artillery could n't fire , but there was always something we could do ; and when the sides fell apart , gasping and tired , we would pour in our shot . Sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close . " They captured Sergeant Henry of our batlery . He had desperately held his gun and they drew away , but he had a bright new jacket on , and I think they took him for an officer . Even if they had told you so you would n't know what they meant ; for though we could easily learn to talk with the French , and even a little with the Italians , who came to fight with Ira in the Crimea , we could never make head or tail of the Russian lingo . " Well , it seemed as if they took Henry for an officer , for they dragged him off with them as they retreated , and he was still struggling , and they were jabbing at him with their bayonets . " And Captain Turner ? we had a breathing-spell as the Russians fell away ? Captain Turner called out : There goes poor Henry ! Who 'll volunteer to get him back ? ' " There were just three gunners with me at my gun ? Cooke and Steve Hunt and Jim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was a dash of fifty yards to come up with him , and before we got there Hunt and Cooke were shot dead , but McGraw kept right close along with me , and we came up with Henry just as he fell down under a juniper-tree , where he was still fighting with the men who were holding and stabbing him . " He saw me as I went to him on the jump . Hello , Pat ! ' he called out ; always a cool sort of a chap he was , even when excited ? ' hello , Pat ! Are you a prisoner too ? ' " There was n't any time for answering questions . A Russian lunged at me ? I remember noticing that ho was a noncoin. ? and I hit him savage with my sword . I was n't a weakling , and I weighed all of fourteen stone and a half , and I was mad , and my sword smashed his arm , and it looked as if it cut it off . " That Russian went down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little while it was just hit and smash . " I wish I could tell you just how it went , but I 've tried to think of it , and I just ca n't remember , except that McGraw and I were striking and parrying , mad and fierce , with Henry lying there , and that , some of the Russians went down , and that all at once there was smoke and bullets again , and the Russians melted away , and there we were with Henry . " I picked him up , and McGraw helped me to get him on my back , and we all started for the battery . " ' Leave inc where I am , Pat : said Henry . Save yourselves . ' " But we got him back to the battery and laid him down . Eleven bayonet wounds he had , about his face and neck . Rut he did n't die . And he got the V. C. " Sergeant Henry not only got the V. C. for the defence of his battery , but became captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not tell this , one of his first acts was to send to his superiors a high commendation of theheroic bravery of Sergeant Conway at Inkerman . The major in command made a similar commendatory report , but Conway did not get the V. C. For his gallant rescue of Henry , however , the French did him honor , and the Emperor sent him the gold medal , Pour valeur el discipline .. " A gold eagle medal , " said Conway , " for bravery in the field . My son wanted it , and I let him take it ; he 's in Australia ; and the order , as they call it , is as old as Napoleon the Great ? yes , it 's as old as Charlemagne . " I have a long line of medals and clasps . See ! And here 's one that the Turks gave me . They were with us. too , against the Russians , and far a while ( but not at Inkerman , you understand ) I had charge of one of their batteries ; for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know how to handle them , and while I was in charge of their battery I wore a red cap , just like , the Turks ! And their Sultan gave me this medal . " Many was the officer lost at hiker-man , for they were right in the mix-up , and fought with their own hands just like the men . And it was the same with the Russians , of course . " It got well past noon and we still fought , for it seemed as if the Russians would never get tired of charging us , and for our own part we would n't give way . " Many was the soldier who , when the chamber of his rifle got wet and he could n't fire it . gave up snapping it , and with a yell rushed at the Russians again with his bayonet . " It was a queer battle ; not much of order or regularity , but always a jumble , and yet always with us and the French holding fast . to our line . And it was good to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . Good comrades , the French . " The fight went on till about the middle of the afternoon , and then the Russians drew of and would n't come back at us again . " And we threw ourselves down by our guns , and we gasped and laughed and cheered , and all around us lay the dead and wounded in great heaps , and the cold rain fell on us , and the heavy mist blew slowly across the ridge . "
