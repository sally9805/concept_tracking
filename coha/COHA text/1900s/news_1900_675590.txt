txt In giving his instructions to the Grand Jury before the members were sworn in to-day , Judge Gibbons told the venire men that the officials of the City of Chicago were responsible for the iepidemic of crime which has prevailed for the past two months . He followed up this statement by telling the jury to probe the cases thoroughly , and bring to justice , if possible , those who permit such- evil to exist without taking the proper steps to stamp it out . He especially condemned the Police Department , but mentioned no names . The statements of the Judge caused a slight sensation in the courtroom . Some declarations of that nature were expected , but it was not thought the members of the jury would be told in plain words that the officials are responsible . Judge Gibbons led up to the sensational part by giving the jurors some sound advice concerning their powers , and also what he thought of the Grand Jury . Some reforms ought to be made at once , " he declared , " or it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in considering the various complaint cases which will he brought to your attention you must not permit yourselves to be carried away by the sensational statements which have been made throughout the city during the lases lew weeas . ' These were made simply to feed the morbid tastes of the members of the community . In your considerations such feelings should be cast aside . I also wish to say to you that you have no right to divide yourselves into committees to investigate the condition of cne community . I regard the Grand Jury as one of the greatest bodies in the world . You can indict , if he commit a crime , the highest or the lowest man in the country . You can hold any official or public servant whc is an offender of the community . " Now , gentlemen , . not one of you can Close your eyes to the conditions which have prevailed in this city . You carneit. say that crime is not rampant nese . Evidently there must be something wrong . That wrong must be with the officials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so many hold-ups , burglaries , robberies , &c.,; as are being perpetrated in this city nightly and daily , " Unless there is something inherently wrong , we have the best police force in the world . The blame can not be placed upon the policemen , so the wrong must be in the distribution of the force by the officials . But whatever is the cause , it is your solemn duty to indict such persons as are guilty of a criminal offense . Unless you do you can not bring them to trial . If you do this we may be able to stamp out the crime which is common in this community . " Judge Gibbons also referred to the recommendations of the November Grand Jury concerning the dives and basement saloons and the loan shark investigation . Concerning the charge of policeman Carey that Chief Ripley tried to extort $200 irr ' ; ' - donntotion . with a robbery , State 's Attorney Deneen is quoted as saying : " The developments arising out of it will he pmsented to the present Grand Jury . Nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me in the discharge of my duty as State 's Attorney from doing this . I think these matters will be presented Friday next , in accordance with the instructions of Judge Gibbons . " Crime in the city has become so open and prevalent that the citizens are aroused to such a degree that they are ready to take matters into their own hands . The Methodist ministers ' meeting this morning appointed the Revs . M. M. Parkhurst , J. P. Brushingharn , C. S. Dudley . M. E. Cady , and M. W. Patton as a committee to confer with a similar committee appointed by the Congregationalists , the conferring committees to appoint a body of laymen which shall constitute a vigilance committee . The first business to come before the Methodist ministers was the motion of Dr. J. P. Brushingham , who said : " Inasmuch as my church , the First Methodist Episcopal , is in the centre of the infected region . 1 believe it my duty to make these suggestions . I believe the time has come when we must stamp out of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well model our acts after the crusade now being made in New York . I believe it to be the duty of a minister to attend to his church , and that it is somewhat out of his line to execute the moves which will become necessary for those who would take the active part in closing the dives . Therefore , I move that the Chair appoint a committee of five ministers from this meeting to confer with a similar committee which will be appointed by the Congregationalists , who have taken the lead in this matter . " Chairman Tilroe then appointed the five ministers named . The Methodists and Congregationalists met at 1:30 o'clock in the rooms of the Young Men 's Christian Association . their object being to name a committee of citizens , laymen , who would pick up the work at the point where the ministers have brought it and push it on until the dens of iniquity shall have been closed . The ministers were at some variance in their views as to how large this Citizens ' Committee should be and as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all denominations and in sufficient numbers to assure the success of the undertaking .
