 | ROYALTY suggests wealth , and kings and emperors are usually supposed to be rolling in riches , since the very fact that they make their homes in magnificent palaces implies affluence , just as a workingman 's cottage indicates straitened circumstances . Yet many of the monarchs of the Old World in modern times have known the pinch of poverty . The debts of nations are often supplemented by infinitely more pressing liabilities of a personal character , in connection with which princes and kings are compelled to submit to all sorts of humiliations . Among the least bitter of these is the recourse to the pawnshop , and long is the list of the anointed of the Lord who have at one time or another been forced to seek the costly assistance of that avuncular relative who has adopted for his heraldic device the old Lombard banking-emblem of the three gilded balls . Thus , the last king of Naples on several occasions pawned all his silver plate in London . King Milan , while still on the throne of Servia , repeatedly deposited the various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Vienna , in order to obtain the money necessary for the settlement of his " debts of honor " ? that is to say , his losses at cards in the Austrian capital , and on two occasions they were , for political reasons , quietly redeemed by Emperor Francis Joseph . The Sultan of Morocco has within the last few months sent his crown jewels to London to serve as security for an urgently needed loan ; and the late Queen Isabella of Spain was wont to @#  | pledge not only her diamonds , but also a couple of superb ancestral portraits by Velasquez ( on which she was always able to raise a sum of twenty thousand dollars ) , whenever she had exceeded her liberal allowance from the Spanish treasury , and was short of funds . In fact , one was always able to gage the state of the extravagant old queen 's finances by observing whether or not the paintings in question were hanging at their accustomed places on the walls of her Parisian home , the so-called Palace of Castile . She used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the monarchs which they portrayed were kings of great worth , since they had so often " come to the rescue of Castile . " Probably no sovereign h as suffered more acutely from the lack of funds than King Edward VII , and it may therefore be of interest to know that , for the first time since his marriage , more than two score years ago , he is now entirely free from debt of every kind . It is this that accounts for the phenomenal and altogether unexpected improvement in his spirits and in his general health , as well as for the retirement of Lord Farquhar from the post of Master of the Royal Household . I have said that the king is now out of debt . I mean this only in a financial sense . For he owes a deep debt of gratitude to Lord Farquhar , Lord Esher , and Sir Ernest Cassel for his liberation from all monetary embarrass- ments . The story of his rescue by this trio of devoted friends and able business men is an interesting one , and worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under many disadvantages . In the first place he had been brought up with such extreme strictness that when he first tained his freedom he was naturally disposed to extravagance of conduct , speech and expenditure ? in a word , he had to his wild oats ; and when prince of the blood , and particularly the heir to a great throne , engages in agricultural pursuits of this kind there are always plenty of men and women eager to propitiate the rising sun by abetting his follies . Then , too , the prince was , thanks to a piece of disgraceful jobbery on the part of those concerned , saddled with the estate of Sandringham , the purchase of which had absorbed most of the accumulations of the revenues of his duchy of Cornwall , which he would otherwise have had at his disposal on attaining his majority ? an estate that was not only productive of no income whatsoever , but which has involved the expenditure of vast sums for maintenance , and in order to render it habitable and comfortable . Moreover , the recent death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widowed queen from public and social life , led to the Prince and Princess of Wales being saddled at the time of their marriage with all those  | representative duties of royalty which ordinarily fall to the share of the sovereign . Upon them fell the burden of entertaining members of foreign reigning houses who visited England , and of dispensing hospitality to the aristocracy , the dignitaries of state , and those people of light and leading who from motives of policy must he kept in touch with the dynasty . Finally , they were required , by reason of the queen 's retirement , to surround themselves with a far larger court of lords and ladies and gentlemen in waiting than would have been necessary under other circumstances . In fact , the obligations of which they relieved the queen involved the expenditure of an income almost as large as the three million dollars which she received from the civil list for the purpose , whereas their revenues at the time were less than four hundred thousand dollars a year ; that is to say , inferior to those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dukes of Devonshire , Bedford , Westminster , Sutherland , Buccleuch , and Northumberland , the Earls of Derby , Dudley , etc . The result of this condition of affairs was that the Prince of Wales soon got heavily in debt , and the time came when even the Rothschilds , whose position in English society he had firmly established , intimated to him that it was impossible for them to make any further advances . It is reported that on one or two occasions the queen , prompted by her ministers , @#  | and confronted by them with the alternative of their appealing to Parliament for a grant in behalf of the prince , reluctantly came to his rescue , and relieved him of some of his most pressing liabilities . But inasmuch as no means was devised for the liquidation of all his debts , and for the prevention of their recurrence , it was not long before his troubles became once more acute . It was then that the so-called " benefactors " appeared upon the scene . " Benefactors " are persons of great wealth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , esteem it a privilege to be permitted to place their well-stocked purses at the disposal of royalty . Such a one was Sir James Mackenzie . He had made the greater part of his money in India , originally as a hatter and afterward as an indigo-planter , and was a kindhearted , withal somewhat vulgar , man , whose main occupation during the latter part of his existence was to find means of helping along his future king in a financial way . Among other things , he was in the habit of leasing each year one of the most costly and magnificent country seats in the neighborhood of Windsor , solely for the purpose of being able to place it at the disposal of his illustrious friend for Ascot week , Queen Victoria having saddled so many restrictions upon the use of Windsor Castle during the races by her eldest son , that he was unable to make use of that magnificent and historic palace . When Sir James , who purchased one of the finest  | estates in the neighborhood of Balmoral , died very suddenly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loans to the extent of considerably over one million dollars ; and as they were compelled by their legal obligations to take steps to secure the recovery of the money , they would probably have been obliged in self-defense to institute legal proceedings against the heir apparent , had not Baron Hirsch come to his assistance . If court gossip in England and on the Continent is to be believed , it was not the first time that the great Jewish philanthropist had shown himself a friend in need to the future king of England . The latter , in 1888 , had found himself involved in such terrible financial embarrassments that he appealed to his favorite brother - in - law , Emperor Frederick , who had just succeeded to the throne . Frederick , who had always been very fond of the prince , despite the dissimilarity of their tastes , and who during his long wait for the crown had been subjected to very much the same pecuniary disadvantages as Queen Victoria 's first-born , readily acceded to his request , and is understood to have loaned him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This kindly act met with so much disapproval on the part of the leading dignitaries at the imperial court at Berlin that Prince Stolberg actually insisted upon resigning then and there his post as minister and Grand faster of the Royal House , rather than participate in any such transaction as the loaning of money belonging to the Hohenzollern family to a foreign prince . On  | Emperor Frederick 's death , not long afterward , and the accession of Emperor William , steps were taken to recover the money , and the unpleasantness in connection therewith was the cause of much of the bitterness which marked the relations of the Kaiser and his English uncle during the early years of the former 's reign . It is said that King Edward was enabled to liquidate his debt to the treasury of the Hohenzollern family by means of the timely help of Baron Hirsch , but that he has never wholly forgotten or forgiven the treatment to which he was subjected in the matter by his nephew and the authorities at Berlin . Baron Hirsch , it may be remembered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrangement about the liabilities of the prince toward his estate ; and it was then that Cecil Rhodes and his friends are reported to have appeared upon t h e scene as benefactors , and rendered possible the publication of a solemn yet significant assurance that England 's future king was not in any way indebted to the estate of Baron Hirsch . To what extent the prince benefited by fortunate investments suggested by the South African colossus and his business associates , who included the Duke of Fife , who is the king 's son-in-law , and the Duke of Abercorn , who was the Chief of his Household , it is impossible to say . But the fact remains that when Edward VII succeeded to the throne he found himself still burdened with such a heavy load of debt that everyone was prepared for an application to Parliament by the crown for the settlement of the liabilities which he had incurred as heir apparent . While a demand of this kind might have given rise to some discussion , there is no doubt that it would have been granted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the approval of the people at large , since a very general impression existed to the effect that the king had not been altogether fairly treated in a financial sense while Prince of Wales . Realizing however that such an appeal would weaken his position both at home and abroad , and would always be cast in his teeth by the foes of the dynasty , he took counsel of his most trusted advisers , and placed himself unreservedly in their hands . These adyisers consisted of the great AngloGerman financier , Sir Ernest Cassel , of Nile I ) am fame , Lord Farquhar , for many years the managing director of one of the leading banks in London , and Lord Esher , who is generally understood to be interested in the firm of Cassel . The king undertook to turn over to them the management of his household and the administration of the civil list , whereupon they assumed all his liabilities ; and by means of economies in various directions , by insurance policies , by the sale of useless things and duplicates , by clever investments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have so skilfully managed matters that King Edward has since last summer and for the first time since his marriage been entirely out of debt , and his civil list free from mortgage . It was this action by Sir Ernest , Lord Farquhar , and Lord Esher in taking upon themselves all the personal obligations of the king at the time of the accession , which enabled the govern-@#  | ment to announce in Parliament that he would be satisfied with the same civil list as his predecessor on the throne , that he would make no application to the nation for an additional grant of money , and that he had no debts with which it was necessary for the  | treasury t o concern itself , an an-nouncement which , while it was received with the utmost satisfaction , at the same time created much surprise , as it was generally understood that the king had not benefited to any extent under the ill of the late queen , the major part of whose fortune had gone to her younger children . It may be well to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is not a vestige of truth in the malicious stories , widely circulated , and which have even found their way into print , according to which an arrangement has existed with some of the greatest art-dealers in London , whereby art treasures of one kind and another were placed on view from time to time in Windsor of the royal collections . entourage of the king would have lent himself to any such trick , so dear to the sharper grade of auctioneers on both sides of the Atlantic ; and if there had been any attempt to resort to such practices it would scarcely have escaped the attention of Edward VII , who has developed into an exceedingly shrewd and wide-awake man of business in his mature age . The reports probably had their origin in the fact that on the death of the late queen @#  | a careful investigation of the contents of her numerous palaces disclosed a vast quantity of things for which the king could find no possible use , and which he was in consequence advised to sell . The huge cellars at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowded with ports , sherries , and other wines which had gone out of fashion , which did not commend themselves to Edward VII 's taste , and which had been accumulating there throughout the sixty years of his mother 's reign , and even in the time of her two uncles , George IV and William IV . These were sold at a high price , in order to make way for his favorite vintages . Then , too , there was much furniture of an artistic character , for which there was no longer any room , and which had to be sold off ; while the art collections ( that is to say , the paintings , the statuary , the collections of rare porcelain and ivories , the buhl cabinets , and brica-brac of every description ) had to be subjected to a very extensive weeding process , everything being sold for which the king and the queen ( lid not care , or of which there were a superfluous number of examples . The king himself had been collecting during the forty years of his social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secure a place for his own treasures . That is why so much of the contents of the royal palaces , as they were in the days of Queen  | Victoria , came into the market during the four or five years following her demise as to cause malicious people to start the wholly false rumor to the effect that either the king , or else some of the most trusted and influential members of his household , had gone into business with several of the great art- and wine-dealers , additional color being lent to these tales by the fact that Guy Laking , the member of the king 's household who is in charge of all the royal armor and of most of the art collections , is admittedly a partner in a celebrated firm of auctioneers in London , and that the king 's cellar-master , Thomas A. Kingscote , is a member of a great wine firm . By means of these sales a far larger sum of money was realized by Lord Farquhar , Lord Esher , and Sir Ernest Cassel than the public would ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radical reorganization of the entire royal household , and by the reformation of the almost incredible abuses and extravagances that had gradually developed at court during the nearly forty years of widowhood of Queen Victoria , and which were of a nature to cause her thrifty and level-headed husband ? a clever business man if ever there was one ? to turn in his grave . It is no exaggeration to assert that Lord Farquhar and Lord Esher , by doing away with waste , perquisites , pilfering , and with useless yet costly sinecures , were able to cut down the expenditures of the royal household nearly one-half , without in the slightest degree impairing the brilliancy or the splendor of King Edward 's court , which , indeed , is vastly superior in that respect to that of his august mother . And so perfect has been the reorganization , now happily completed , that Lord Farquhar , who undertook the matter purely from motives of patriotism and of affection for the sovereign who had been his lifelong and intimate friend , has been able to abandon his office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Col. Sir Charles Frederick , with a knowledge that everything will continue to work smoothly , efficiently . and economically . It may safely be asserted that to-day there is no royal court in the world where so much in the way of luxury and splendor is obtained for the money as in that of King Edward . No monarch ir . modern times hasuffered more from financial embarrassments than the late King of Portugal . who was subjected : to every conceivable indignity in connection with his liabilities , the advances made to him by the Exchequer resulting , in his being denounced in t h e Cortes , and also in the press at Lisbon , as a " robber of the national treasury , " as a " thief of public money , " and as " far more worthy of death than King Louis XVI of France . " Indeed , these advances played so important a role in the legislative deadlock , and in the constitutional crisis of the last year in Portugal , which culminated in the murder of the king last February , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the queen yielded to the entreaties of their most trusted advisers , and resolved upon extensive sacrifices in order to liquidate the liability . ! Thus , although Carlos was devoted ' to the sea and passionately fond of yachting , he surrendered his beautiful steam-yacht , the Amelie , to the nation , for conversion into a cruiser ; and he likewise abandoned to the state a quantity of real estate forming part of his private property . This was not the first sacrifice of the kind @#  | which King Carlos had been called upon to make . For , some years ago , it was found necessary to sell the whole of the crown jewels of Portugal , some of which are now in America . The money thus obtained was converted into Portuguese government bonds , the interest of which was assigned to the liquidation of the then-existing debts of the reigning house . It is only fair to the late king to point out that his financial circumstances were not wholly due to extravagance , but to the organization of his civil list . This was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , moreover , was saddled with all sorts of charges in the way of the maintenance of national museums and the subvention of national theaters , from which , however , it is henceforth to be relieved . True , Queen Amalie has some money of her own , probably about seventy-five thousand dollars a year , inherited from her father , the late Count of Paris . But while this would be a comfortable income for a woman in private life , it does not go very far with the queen , being swallowed up almost entirely by her dress , seeing that her rank does not permit @# her to appear more than once in the same toilet . King Leopold is now rolling in wealth ; but there have been times , especially during the early stages of his Congo enterprise , when he was terribly embarrassed , financially speaking , and ready to turn to almost any quarter for assistance . For many years the late Sir William McKinnon was Leopold 's particular benefactor , and the king showed his appreciation by receiving him with almost royal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over to England , and even to Scotland , for the purpose of seeking his advice and pecuniary advances , and by using his influence with the English government to secure for McKinnon the title of baronet . After the death of Sir William , his place as benefactor to Leopold was taken by " Colonel " North , popularly known as the Nitrate King . Colonel North was a self-made man who did not include among his very sterling qualities either high breeding or refinement . Indeed , even his best friends were compelled to admit that he was dreadfully vulgar and extremely loud both in manner and ap-  | pearance . Yet the king overlooked all these defects , associated in the most intimate manner with the colonel , and frequently entertained him at Ostend and at Brussels ; and on one occasion he actually went to the length of placing his favorite palace in the Ardennes at the disposal of North , in order to enable North to entertain there , at his expense , a party of friends from London , to shoot over the royal preserves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throne is generally understood to have been his friend Count Douglas . The Kaiser , prior to his accession , was kept on an exceedingly small allowance , partly because his parents , the then crown prince a n d crown princess , could not afford to do anything for him , owing to their own limited resources , a n d partly because the old emperor , who determined t h e amount of the allowance to be paid to each of the princes of his house from the Hohenzollern family fortune and from the civil list , was of an extremely economical turn of mind . The regiments to which Prince William was attached were among the most expensive corps in the service , his fellow officers being all men of great wealth , and the consequence was that he found it very difficult to make both ends meet . It is generally understood that Count Douglas , who was one of his closest friends , and who derives the major portion of his great wealth from practically inexhaustible mines that he possesses in the Hartz Mountains , frequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was of course repaid after his accession . But his financial difficulties were a matter of common talk , and led to a certain amount of popular belief being accorded to the mendacious stories subsequently told by exCapt . Sidney O'Danne when tried and convicted of fraud at Berlin . O'Danne , who during the boyhood of William had been one of his military instructors , insisted that after his royal pupil had attained manhood he had been on two occasions despatched by him on a secret mission to St. Petersburg , for the purpose of obtaining loans from the late Czar . Of course there was not a shadow of truth in the assertion , which nevertheless found credence among certain people who were disposed to believe that the extraordinary animosity which undoubtedly prevailed between the late Alexander III and the present Kaiser was of a pecuniary origin . The late King Victor Emmanuel was forever in financial difficulties , and at his death left his affairs in a terribly embarrassed condition . Indeed , h i s son , King Humbert , had just finished the liquidation of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Monza . Khedive Ismail was among the old king 's largest creditors , and no one is ever likely to know , even approximately , the amount of money which the extravagant Egyptian ruler advanced with an unstinted hand to Il Re Galant ' Como . The Khedive lent it , not only from motives of generosity , but also policy , deeming it judicious for a potentate in his semiindependent position to have one of the most influential monarchs in Europe so heavily in his debt . Humbert did not show himself ungrateful for Ismail 's kindness to his father , for when the Khedive was deposed in 1879 , and wandered all over Europe , finding the doors of royal and imperial courts closed in his face , that of Italy was the only one where he was welcomed with every manifestation of regard , and received  | with altogether royal honors . It was in consequence of this that he made his home at Rome and at Naples , in palaces placed at his disposal by the king , until in 1888 he unfortunately permitted himself to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Sultan in a sort of gilded captivity until his death , in 1895 . Nicholas , ruler of the Black Mountains , father-in-law of the present King of Italy , of King Peter of Servia , and of a couple of Russian grand dukes , has never been out of debt for the last thirty years or more , his liabilities arising partly from his anxiety to maintain a royal court on a scale similar to that of other European sovereigns without having the means to do so , and partly from his mania for gambling . King Victor Emmanuel , the late Czar , Nicholas II , and Francis Joseph of Austria , have all enjoyed in turn the privilege of paying his most pressing liabilities , not once but several times , until he has exhausted their patience and their generosity , and among the many extraordinary devices to which he has had recourse in order to raise the financial wind , has been that of sending large money-orders to various points in Austria and Hungary , where they were cashed through his agents by the Austrian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the funds from the Montenegrin postal department . It was not until the prince had obtained a very large sum of money in this fashion that the Austrian postal authorities discovered the trick , which his absolute control of every branch of the government at Cettinje had enabled him to play at their expense , and thereupon a suspension of all intercourse by mail with Montenegro was decreed from Vienna , which lasted until the prince made a personal appeal to the emperor , who paid the amount due to the Austrian and Hungarian post-offices out of his own pocket . King Milan 's mysteriously sudden abdication in 1889 is said to have been brought about by the discovery on the part of the late Czar of a particularly dishonorable fraud in connection with a personal loan which the Servian ruler had obtained from him , by giving him as collateral mortgages on several pieces of real estate that did not belong to him , and upon a couple of houses which were his property , but which had been represented as free from any charge , whereas they were already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his restoration to the throne of Spain was deeply in the debt of the late Duke of Santona , who had started life as a hatter in Madrid , and subsequently made an immense fortune in Cuba . Indeed , his financial assistance contributed in no small measure to King Alfonso 's recovery of the throne of his mother . The late King Louis of Bavaria was so deeply involved in debt at the time of his dramatic death in the waters of Lake Starnberg that although more than twenty years have elapsed since the tragedy , his uncle , the aged regent , has only just terminated the payment of his liabilities . In fact the discovery of the extraordinary devices to which he was resorting in order to obtain money contributed in no small measure to his being placed under restraint . Many of the titles of nobility granted within the last hundred years have been bestowed in recognition and perhaps as part repayment of personal loans to the anointed of the Lord . There are few of them who have not at one time or another been in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same spirit of independence that was manifested by the late Prince of SchaumburgLippe at the Congress of German sovereigns at Frankfort , in 1863 . At one of the great entertainments given by the Senate of the then Free City of Frankfort , all the rulers present were assembled in a reserved salon , engaged in animated conversation . Suddenly they all , with one exception , rose to their feet , and advanced to meet a small and insignificant-looking man who had just entered the room . The prince who had remained seated was Adolph of Schaumburg-Lippe . " Who is the fellow about whom you are making all this fuss ? " he growled to the sovereign Elector of Hesse . " Why , do n't you know him ? " replied the latter . " It is Baron Rothschild . Let me make you acquainted with him . Surely you do not want to be the only one here who does not extend a gracious welcome to him ? " " And why not ? " retorted Prince Adolph . " What do I care about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adolph was the only one of all the kings , grand dukes , and sovereign electors and princes present , who could afford thus to show his independence , every one of the others having been at one time or another indebted to the house of Rothschild .
