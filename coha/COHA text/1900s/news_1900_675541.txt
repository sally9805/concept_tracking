txt Bicycle sults are barred in the Supreme Court of the United States . This discovery was made by the correspondent of a Western paper yesterday who was refused admittance to the court until he had gone home and changed his clothes . He was new to Washington newspaper work , and happened to ride his wheel up to the Capitol , expecting to report a particular case in which his paper was interested . He was held up at the door of the Marshal 's office , and told kindly , but firmly , that he would be obliged to adopt more conventional attire before he could get into the press seats , and , incidentally , while he was putting on a walking costume he had better choose a black suit , as that was more in keeping with the dignity of the court . Inquiry of ' Mr , , the clerk of the court , developed the fact that while there is no written law on the subject , Chief Justice Fuller and the Associate Justices adhere strongly to tradition in the matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the fact that the Attorney General , Assistant Attorney General Maury , Solicitor General Richards , Marshal Wright , and even the clerks and criers of the court all appear habitually in suits of solemn black , with black satin ascot ties and white pearl scarf-Dins . Attire as a Rule Is Solemn . The attorneys practicing before the court find it to their advantage to follow the same general rule , and it is a matter of record that on seivral occasions , even in recent sessions , attorneys who were being admitted to practice have been sent back to the clerk 's office to make a change of costume before they were brought to the bar of this august body . . At the opening of the court last fall there was one candidate for admission from one of the back districts of Indiana , a lawyer of some repute in his own section , too , who appeared in an old wool hat , a rough frieze ulster , and a genuine butternut suit . When Chief Justice Fuller appeared on the bench and took in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white cotton umbrella between his knees and a red bandana handkerchief reposing in his upturned hat on the floor beside him . There was a hurried conference between the Marshal and the Chief Justice , and the old man was led back to the clerk 's room , where he was made to deposit his hat , umbrella and ulster , and since then there has been a rule against overcoats inside the attorney 's railing .. St. Louis Attorney 's Experience . On another occasion during the last session of the court a young St. Louis attorney , who was applying for temporary admission to appear in one particular case , appeared in court with a blue cross-barred shirt , a red necktie , and a light but loud check suit . The clerk of the court saw the Chief Justice shoot one look in the direction of the applicant . That was enough . The offender was hurried out into the clerk 's room , where one of the attendants hurriedly slipped into an office jacket and loaned him a solemn , black frock coat that buttoned up so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violent necktie . With his light check legs twinkling beneath this solemn superstructure he was led back into court and duly admitted . Incidentally the Justices had a quiet laugh afterward over this rapid change of attire .
