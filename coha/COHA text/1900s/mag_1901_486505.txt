Continued gratulation is heard , and with reason , on the fresh hope for universal suffrage in great cities which the New York election inspires . It was not simply that Tammany was beaten , but that it was flung out of its own fortresses below Fourteenth Street . This is the great fact , the great good cheer , which has most impressed the country . Upon this , intelligent foreign observers have commented . It was a demonstration that the ignorant voter , the foreign-born voter , the democrat wielding a weapon of suffrage to which his hands were untrained , could yet be approached with argument and persuasion and example , and made to see as straight and vote as true as his more delicately clad and comfortably fed fellow-citizen of the West Side . This revelation was no surprise to those who best knew the people who made it . What we saw in the election returns of Tuesday week was only what Capt . Goddard and Jacob Buis and Mr. Reynolds have all along maintained that we should see when the occasion arrived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been hidden from the wise and prudent on Fifth Avenue , that the residents of Stanton Street and Mulberry Bend had a due share of human nature ; had minds to perceive what was truly for the city 's welfare , and hearts to respond when appeals were made to protect the helpless and save the innocent . The change was not in the men and women of the East Side , but in the tactics of those who set about securing their aid in the fight against municipal corruption . The great difficulty with the working of universal suffrage in our large cities was pointed out by Mr. Bryce . There was , on the one hand , " an ignorant multitude , largely composed of recent immigrants , untrained in self-government . " Then there was the great body of " able citizens absorbed in their private businesses , cultivated citizens unusually sensitive to the vulgarities of practical politics , and both sets therefore specially unwilling to sacri/ice their time and tastes and comfort in the struggle with sordid wirepullers and noisy demagogues . " The great triumph of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an end , with a result that astonished and gratified the city , the country , and , we may say , the whole world . In a single phrase , it was a led democracy at work that gave us the victory . That was the sort of democracy which the great leaders of liberty and enfranchisement in the nineteenth century always had in mind . The Liberals in England , the emancipators in America , who strove mightily for the extension of the suffrage to whole new classes and entire races , never imagined that a magical virtue resided in the ballot . They thought of it as a great educator for the poor and ignorant , as well as a weapon of defence against oppression ; but they also thought that the natural leaders of society would find new motive and purpose in going to the masses to train and guide them . Universal suffrage is , indeed , a nuisance to the superior citizen who desires to lounge at home and do the whole duty of political man in drawing a check But to men who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that society must educate its masters or perish , must lift up the lowly or sink lower than they , and who know also that the humblest of God 's creatures , white or brown or black , has a spark of the divine reason in. him , and can be shown the good and taught to admire the beautiful and honor the worthy  --  why , to them , the freeman 's ballot is the instrument of political progress and social improvement . A rightly led democracy , however swarming , however tumultuous , is a source of strength and pride , not the threat that some men see in it . And the matter is of wider scope than city elections . The principle vindicated by the repudiation of Tammany in its favored haunts is good for the South , with its problem of negro suffrage ; good also for Cuba and Porto Rico and the Philippines , where our rulers are so timorous about self-government . After the great awakening in New York city , we ought to be ready to assert in firmer tones what Lowell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we now feel it to be  --  namely : " The democratic theory is that those Constitutions are likely to prove steadiest which have the broadest base , that the right to vote makes a safety-valve of every voter , and that the best way of teaching a man how to vote is to give him the chance of practice . For the question is no longer the academic one , ' Is it wise to give every man the ballot ? ' but rather the practical one , ' Is it prudent to deprive whole classes of it any longer ? ' " Turn an army officer loose on the East Side , with its mixture of races and creeds , its struggling life , its poverty , its ignorance , and would he not be certain to report that self-government by such people was out of the question ? Yet we believe him when he gravely tells us that of Manila , of Havana , of San Juan ! And the South is going deliberately to work to disfranchise the negro , instead of teaching him , as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No such shrinking love of ease and dread of combat was in the mind of Sumner when he rejoiced in negro suffrage as one of the levers to lift a race . He wished , too , to see fit negroes in Federal office , as both " a testimony and a symbol " ? a testimony to the fairness of white men , a symbol of hope for black . And what he and the Republicans of an elder day would have thought of our modern dread of men with ballots in their hands in Cuba and the Philippines , it is easy to surmise . But the fresh caur age we are taking from the example of New York can not fail to go with us to the South and to the Orient . There , as here , men can be taught and led . There , as here , a broad-based democracy , with leaders not afraid nor slothful , may become the securest and happiest of governments . ELECTION EXPENSES . The filing by candidates of the statements required by law regarding their expenditures during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expenditures . It is worth noting that this year  --  owing , doubtless , to the fact that the public conscience was known to be aroused  --  the sums paid by candidates as a rule were relatively lower than in former years , though there are some exceptions , as , for instance , in the Sixth Judicial District , where the Fusion candidate for Magistrate expended $2,360 to secure his election . But the sums contributed or expended by candidates do not , of course , make up any considerable portion of the money used during the election canvass . The law ought to be so amended as to call for itemized statements from leaders and chairmen also , and then some real idea could be formed by the general public of the uses to which campaign contributions are put . It is , of course , understood that the perfectly legitimate expenses of a canvass are extremely heavy . Printing and postage  --  items which , like charity , frequently cover a multitude of sins  --  really require the use of very large sums . It costs about $20,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to each of the voters of Greater New York , and each voter is probably served with half a dozen such circulars , general and local , during a fairly lively canvass . In the campaign just closed so successfully , at least three anti-Tammany organizations maintained for three months headquarters in each of the sixty-five Astelably districts of the greater city , at an aggregate cost of perhaps $50,000 . At an average it costs , all told , about $50 to hold a well-ordered indoor district campaign meeting of the kind of which five or six an evening are held in each Assembly district . This includes music ; a campaign meeting without music is like champagne without fizz . Meetings like these are continued for at least three weeks , at an aggregate expenditure of probably more than $150,000 , to say nothing of the cost of the less numerous but larger and individually more expensive general meetings . A truck-meeting , with music , costs about $20 . The Fusionists probably kept as many as four trucks to an Assembly district going during the last ten days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost of more than $50,000 . The sums which may properly and beneficially be expended in the distribution of campaign literature , the posting of " campaign slogans , " and the raising of banners are practically limitless . All these expenditures are perfectly legitimate , as well as many others not specifically mentioned . They give some idea of the necessary cost of a campaign , and it would undoubtedly be of great interest if they could be officially declared , as the direct expenditures of the candidates are . There are other expenditures of a less certain nature which it would be interesting to learn more about . The law does not permit a candidate to purchase tickets to balls , outings , etc. , but he may " contribute to the success " of such enterprises , or his campaign managers may buy tickets . Numerous clubs spring up during each campaign , willing , even eager , to give balls and outings . Kegs and half-barrels of beer take on astonishing qualities during a campaign . If bestowed , they transform reluctant and coldly deliberating electors into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have bloomed with surprising swiftness in the warm sunshine of expectation . The election expenditures which are most open to question , however , are those of election day . The Monday before the Tuesday of election is known to all party workers as " dough day . " A certain sum is given by each party on this occasion to the captain of each election district . This varies widely , running anywhere from $10 to $200 for an election district . There are nearly 900 election districts in Manhattan and the Bronx , and a corresponding number in the other boroughs . Just what becomes of this money the public does not know , but ought to know . Probably the larger part of it is simply wasted . Few votes are bought outright in these days of secret ballots . It is undoubtedly possible for a voter to identify his vote , but the risk , both of failure to vote a valid ballot and of exposure , is too great , and the process necessarily too elaborate , to constitute a serious danger . Much of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party badges and are called " workers , " probably because they do no work . They are engaged to " get out the vote , " but when , as on Tuesday week , two-thirds of the voters come to the polls before noon , their chief exertion is to stand , or lean , near the polling-place a considerable portion of the day , and to receive the five dollars apiece for less than which no true-blooded party " worker " will consent to wear a badge . This dumping of large sums upon the election districts on election morning is perhaps the worst feature of our present election machinery . The central committees are largely responsible for it , and the responsibility rests also heav ily upon the campaign contributor who sends in his check only a few days before the election . A hundred dollars contributed to a proper committee three , or better four , weeks before the election is pretty sure of a good and legitimate use . The same amount sent in under stress of the last week 's excitement is equally likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , needed on election day for real watchers , and challengers must in most cases be paid for their labor , but one-tenth of the election-day output would suffice for all this . This is one of the lessons which ought to be learned , and which , when citizens are permanently aroused to the performance of their civic duties , will soon be mastered . - THE FUTURE OF MUNICIPAL FRAN-CHISES . The issue of a pamphlet by the Chicago Committee on Local Transportation , in which the probable recommendations on street-railway policy are announced , recalls attention to what is in some respects the greatest problem confronting American municipalities to-day . The question of franchises not merely for street-railways , but for all kinds of municipal monopolies , was never more vital than now . Though it was overshadowed by the greater moral issues at stake in the city campaign which has just closed , it was freely discussed by candidates . In Indianapolis the terms of a franchise grant are now under discussion . In Chicago the fact that existing street-railway charters begin to expire less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the part of that city imperative , in view of the failure of last year 's Street-Railway Commission to obtain from the Legislature a general act for the control of municipal franchises . The public interest which has practically compelled the appointment of the present Committee , furnishes most encouraging evidence that the American public is awaking to the real importance of the problem . This interest is in striking contrast with the apathy of Philadelphia and some other cities , and lends unusual weight to the leading suggestions of the Committee 's special report . The whole recent discussion of the franchise question has practically turned upon the conditions under which franchises may actually be granted with the greatest advantage to the grantor . We say this , knowing that there are many stock and bond holders who fondly cling to the old System of long-term grants , and many Utopists who would advocate the abolition of franchises and the ownership and operation of public-service enterprises by the municipality . We believe , however , that both these classes of- extremists are so far in the minority that their opinions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be taken for granted that private ownership and operation under suitable conditions and for appropriate short terms , with proper payment to the grantors of such privileges , is the preferable policy . That such is the consensus of opinion among those best qualified to pass upon the question may be seen from the practical unanimity of expression at all the recent meetings of municipal experts , and from the substantial harmony manifested in the statements of policy put forward by high-minded candidates for office , irrespective of political party . But when these two broad principles of municipal policy have been accepted , there yet remains a great field for debate , and this debate has chiefly been concentrated upon two controverted points  --  the length of the franchise term , and the mode in which compensation is to be made . There are many who maintain that the proper policy to pursue is one of short-term grants , renewable from time to time , while a less strong body of opinion favors an indeterminate franchise , revocable at the pleasure of the City Council . The advocates of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least , franchises should run for a term equal to the life of the fixed capital employed , which , in the case of electric installations , is said by engineers to be about ten years . If this period be not allowed for the recovery of the first investment , they say , investors can not be induced to undertake the work . The reply made by those who believe in the indeterminate grant is to cite the experience of Boston and Washington , where excellent traction systems are in use under revocable franchises . The whole question has an important bearing on good municipal government . Corporations could not afford to be blackmailed annually by threats of revocation , and it might therefore be confidently expected that their powerful influence would , under a revocable franchise system , be turned to the support of honest legislators , who would not adopt low methods for personal profit . It is interesting , in view of this discussion , to find the Chicago Committee favoring what seems likely to be the franchise policy of the future  --  a short-term grant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the City Council , upon proper compensation for the fixed capital taken . The problem of compensation for the grant of franchises is far more troublesome , and no satisfactory solution has so far been agreed upon . How the question is being attacked may be seen from the agitation in Iowa for the heavier taxation of railways on the basis of franchise values , from the recent effort in Cleveland to secure an increase in the assessment of franchises , and from the attempt to assess New York franchises on the same principles as real estate . The main difficulties encountered are , of course , rather those of practical application than of theory . Few would doubt that taxation should ultimately be proportioned to net income . The difficulty is to ascertain the amount of this income with precision , and to discriminate net from apparent earnings . Obstacles in the way of this endeavor have led to the search for some other basis of assessment . The Chicago Committee discard the net-earnings principle , and propose that compensation be secured from a percentage of gross receipts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fare take the place of the money payment . The question is , however , not merely a choice between reduction of fares and an annual cash bonus . The extent of the reduction , or the amount of the bonus , as the case may be , has to be determined . It is just at this point that the real complexity of the street-railway problem shows itself . Earnings must not be so reduced that it will be impossible to provide a depreciation fund sufficient to cover the deterioration of the plant within the time for which the franchise is first granted , and this should be borne in mind when fixing both the life of the franchise and the amount of the compensation , whether the latter be in cash or in lower fares . The investor must be allowed a good return upon his capital if he is to give good service . He must be able to provide a depreciation fund , or he will never consent to a revocable franchise which would permit a City Council to sweep away his chance of recovering his investment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left large liberty to deal with employees and to regulate the running of cars . The Chicago Committee err chiefly in their effort to legislate too minutely on the latter points . Something must be trusted to the wisdom and the business sense of the corporations themselves ; and where a proper reservation of power has been made , such trust will not be in vain . The franchise policy of the immediate future , as regards not merely traction but all other public-service corporations , must be simple and conservative . Short-term grants , with subsequent power to revoke , adequate compensation to the municipality  --  probably in the form partly of lower fares and partly of limitation of profits , with prescribed bookkeeping  --  these are the fundamentals of franchise reform . With the great principles established and an ultimate power of control reserved , minute interference with business details will be neither wise nor necessary . ' SALISBURY AND THE WAR . Lord Salisbury 's Guildhall speech on Saturday seems to have disappointed some of his followers by its sombre tone . Apparently they expected him to indulge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not one to call for a display of his old Saturday-Review manner . In view of the recent disaster to Col. Benson 's column in South Africa , of the distinct revival of the war and its spread into Cape Colony , and of the calamitous death-rate among the Boer children in the concentration camps , at which humane England is appalled , pleasantries or sarcasms on the part of the Prime Minister would have been most ill-timed . They would have been too much like gibes from Yorick 's skull . Others among the supporters of the Government reproach Lord Salisbury for not having taken the country more into his confidence . But we do not see the force of this complaint . The ugly facts are as well known to the man in the street as to the Premier . The list of casualties , the great force still required in the field , the $7,500,000 a week which the war is costing , the income tax  --  these are the features of the situation which stand out before every eye . While not minimizing them , Lord Salisbury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the war which it would be a breach of public duty for him to reveal . This attitude is entirely correct . Salisbury is too serious a statesman to affirm that new measures are afoot unless such were the case ; and none knows better than he that to publish his plans would be the best way of inviting their defeat . Former projects have gone so sadly astray that there will be natural skepticism about these latest ones , whatever they may be . They may be connected with Gen. Ian Hamilton 's return to South Africa , or the proposal to raise a sort of Landwar in Cape Colony ; but the Prime Minister is quite right in declining to take the country into his confidence as regards these military plans . If the country does not want to turn out the Government , it must let it carry on the war and conduct its diplomacy with the reserve which is necessary to the success of either . To judge by the cabled reports of Salisbury 's speech , he had nothing to say about that aspect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people in England . There can be no doubt that the horrors of the concentration camps have been a source of shame and humiliation to Englishmen , irrespective of party . For this it will be most difficult to forgive the Government , when all is over . A death-rate among the detained Dutch children of nearly 400 per thousand per year  --  this , as that old Conservative , Mr. Courtney , has bitterly observed , this is " the pitiless fact which ' crushes all hypotheses . " Admit that the policy of concentrating the Boer women and children in camps was humane in intention , grant that it was a military mistake , as it may be plausibly argued that it was , and that the innocent victims of the was would have perished even more miserably on the veldt , or would have led the men to surrender sooner if they had not been brought in ; allow , as no doubt in fairness it must be allowed , that Gen. Kitchener and the War Office have done everything within their power to feed and care for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been as humiliating to the British management of the war as it will always appear simply frightful . It is not only foreigners or " pro-Boer " Englishmen who are saying these things , and whose cheeks burn with-indignation as they read of these unintended but unrelieved miseries . Philanthropists and clergymen have begun to cry shame upon the Government on the score of this massacre of the innocents . Only a few days ago , Canon Gore , the distinguished Churchman , published a letter in which he said : " Hitherto the conscience of the country has been , actively or passively , as a whole supporting the war , but , unless I am very much mistaken , it must peremptorily require that immediate steps , however costly  - -  whether by the speedy introduction of suitable nourishment into the camps in sufficient abundance or by the removal of the camps to the sea  --  be taken to obviate this unexampled and horrible death-rate among the children for whose protection we have , by a policy which may have been mistaken , but is , at any rate , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe , the honor of our country will contract a stain which we shall not be able to obliterate , and the whole Christian conscience of the country will be outraged and alienated . " The Canon was , of course , yelped at by the Chamberlain pack as guilty of " treason . " A furious controversy was , in fact , raging about his utterance when what should Lord Salisbury do but appoint him Bishop of Worcester ? It was one of those cool things which Salisbury so often has done in defiance of mob feeling . Canon Gore undoubtedly deserved the promotion , on the score of piety and scholarship ; but to have got it just at this time ! One of its amusing results will be to place the new Bishop in spiritual authority over Canon Knox-Little , a furibund clergyman who has been dealing out death to the Boers , and who had broken out violently against Canon Gore himself just before the latter was made his reverend father in God ! - So far as Salisbury 's speech breathed dogged determination to " see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the vast majority of Englishmen . There is no political combination in sight or possible which could stop the war , so long as the Boers elect to go on fighting . Even Campbell-Bannerman , even Mr. Bryce , even John Morley , admit that the war , haying been once begun in an unhappy hour , must be fought to the bitter end . The most militent Liberals simply hope to accumulate against the Tories enough evidence of mismanagement of the war , both in its inception and in its conduct , to beat them when the war is over ; they are under no illusions about the possibility of taking office before the war as somehow brought to an end . Yet , at the same time , they think that generous terms of settlement might , even now , hasten the close of hostilities . They will , therefore , find some encouragement in what Lord Salisbury said upon this point . He receded openly from his old defiant talk about not leaving the Boers " a shred of independence , " and spoke of his strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and civil rights , " and , as soon as time would permit , " the other blessings of self-government . " But there is no evidence that the Boers are yet minded to leave off scorning such terms or despising English proclamations ; and the best prospect is that this ignoble war , undertaken in an evil hour for England , and waged with such unexampled losses and humiliations , will go grinding on its pitiless way for many weary months more , if not years . MORLEY ON GLADSTONE . Mr. John Morley was orator of the day at the recent unveiling of a statue of Gladstone in Manchester , and his address was a fine estimate of the personal and public qualities of his old chief . Speaking in what is now a Tory stronghold ? Mr. Balfour represents a Manchester constituency ? Mr. Morley naturally avoided controverted political topics . He discussed , not the particular measures with which Mr Gladstone 's name was associated , but the spirit in which he lived and worked . And no one who knows Mr. Morley 's gift for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and universal lesson in the separate detail , would need to be assured that he made his tribute to the departed Liberal leader a vehicle for conveying his own ideals of public service and statesmanlike worth . His praise of Gladstone 's oratory must necessarily seem a little high-pitched to one out from under the spell of voice and eye , which all agree to have exerted an extraordinary fascination in the case of the great Parliamentarian and popular speaker . Gladstone 's speeches were , no doubt , " saturated in matter . " No one ever steeped himself beforehand more thoroughly in his material ; no orator , apparently- , ever trusted more to the moment 's flow of words . They flowed , in fact , in too rushing and too little limpid a flood to entitle him to a place among the greatest orators . His extraordinary turn for refining and qualifying ? " Gladstonese , " we have heard it called  --  is like a mist upon the page of his orations when read ; and , when heard , laid him somewhat open to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which he explains as due to Gladstone 's dread of loose statement , so that " what passed for sophistry or subtlety was in truth a scruple of conscience . " This is an utterance of loyalty , but we think that Walter Bagehot , in his wonderfully discriminating and prophetic article on Gladstone forty years ago , came nearer the fact when he said that this tendency to over-nice distinctions was inherent in Mr. Gladstone 's mind , of which the natural and favored method was that of a scholastic theologian . Another limitation which Mr. Morley recognizes in his hero is the lack of an open mind for what science was doing in his world . " I remember , " he says , " going out with him one Sunday afternoon to pay a visit to Mr Darwin . It was in the seventies . As I came away , I felt that no impression had reached him : that that intellectual , modest , single-minded , low-browed lover of truth , that searcher of the secrets of nature , had made no impression on Mr. Gladstone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his Kentish hilltop was shaking the world . " But of all these minor aspects of a great character we may say , as Henry IV . said to the Spanish Ambassador , " What ' has not your master virtues enough to have some defects ? " Mr. Gladstone 's nobility of soul was the thing in him which most impressed observers . A grateful correspondent once wrote to him , " You have so lived and wrought that you have kept the soul alive in England " Countless testimonies to the same effect might be cited . One of the latest we find in a letter of the historian , John Richard Green . Writing of an evening passed in a distinguished company where Gladstone was present , he said , " I felt so proud of my leader , because , wise or unwise as he might seem in this or that , he was always noble of soul . " This higher plane on which Gladstone moved , this purer air which he breathed , together with his ardor for liberty , his belief in progress , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him the great public figure he was . The tradition of his oratory will die away , and his speeches , like most speeches , will lie unread ; but the memory of his lofty bearing , his flashing chivalry , his spontaneous and burning indignation against oppression of any man in any land  --  this is the fine and lasting legacy he bequeathed to his country and the world . Mr. Morley eloquently combatted the notion that Mr. Gladstone was ever a mere time-server . The fame of a great public teacher was , rather , that which he would place upon his head as a laurel crown . Gladstone knew , of course , that , as is the case with any leader in a democracy , he must work in and through public opinion ; but it was ever his aim to create and giiide that opinion , never slavishly-to follow it The fact that he set himself to the immense and , as it turned out , impossible task of persuading England to grant home rule to Ireland , should be proof enough that he was as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Morley adduces a more conclusive , because a less debated , instance . It is the case of Glad-stone 's revolutionary Budget of 1853 . Of this he says : " Well , gentlemen , what did Mr. Gladstone do on this occasion ' , Did he run about feeling the pulse of popular opinion ? No . He grappled with the facts with infinite , genius and labor  --  and , recollect , with Mr. Gladstone half his genius was labor . He built up a vast plan . He carried that plan to the Cabinet . The Cabinet were against him almost to a man . They warned bun that the House of Commons would be against him The officials of the Treasury told him the Bank would be against him , that a great press of interests would be against him . But , like an intrepid and sinewy athlete that he always was , he stood to his guns He converted the Cabinet . He persuaded the House of Commons . He vanquished the Bank and the hostile interests , and , in the words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things , and he changed and turned for many years to come the current of public opinion with that force which was too powerful for any mind to resist Do n't let it be said , then , that Mr. Gladstone was a man who always followed the flowing tide " It can not be denied that Mr. Glad-stone 's political fame has suffered something of an eclipse in England . He was out of sympathy with the movement for expansion and empire which has been sweeping everything before it in the last decade . When that cloud passes , Glad-stone 's sun will shine out again . His bitterest revilers are doing at this moment what his friends could not do to revive his glory . Chamberlain and Salisbury in South Africa are making Glad-stone 's policy there seem a monument of wisdom . The process of " wiping out " the shame of Majuba Hill has brought too many new shames to be very damaging to Gladstone 's memory . But , all these matters aside , he was a man of such a mould and fibre , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since arisen to take the place which he unquestionably held at his death  --  that of " the world 's greatest citizen . " ' IRELAND AND THE EMPIRE . ' DUBLIN , October 30 , 1901 . For the past seventy years , a solid conservative minority of Irish members , sent from the north to Parliament , has been able to delay or , forestall measures of Irish reform . There now appears every probability of that minority being broken up , mainly through the exertions of one man ? Thomas Wallis Russell His career has been so interesting , and he has now written such a remarkable book , that a notice of him and it appears opportune . It is illustrative of the enduring depressing effects of the penal laws and misgovernment upon the Irish people , in their own country , that while they themselves , in a steady stream of emigration , have had to seek careers abroad , a considerable number of English and Scotch immigrants have all along found openings for themselves in Ireland Mr Russell , a Scotchman , was one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and from one employment and another passed into that of an Irish temperance association . To a ready pen , untiring energy , and singular organizing powers , he added ability as a platform orator . He made the temperance movement in Ireland his own . It was mainly through his exertions that the Sunday Closing Act , such as it is , was passed Of blameless character , beloved in his social relations , he could be a bitter opponent . No man ever had greater power of establishing and keeping up a " raw . " The liquor-dealers would gladly have lynched him . In those early days he was a Liberal  --  favoring the disestablishment of the Irish Church and a reform in the land laws . He never had any sympathy with national aspirations . The excesses , as he conceived them to be , of the Land League gradually inclined him towards the Conservative ranks . Mr. Gladstone 's Home Rule proposals completed the process . He came to believe that the liquor interest was less of a danger to the country than Home Rule would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ablest Liberal-Unionist workers and speakers , and upon that platform was returned to Parliament . The position he , the proprietor of a . temperance hotel in Dublin , came to occupy in Parliament and in Conservative circles in England is striking proof of the spirit of equality , irrespective of worldly possessions , that dominates English political life . Mr. Russell , in a book published a few days ago , * says that if Mr. Gladstone had been twenty years younger , and if Mr. Parnell had not gone astray , Home Rule would now probably be the law of the land . Many believe that the same change would have been effected but for Mr. Chamberlain 's astuteness and Mr. Russell 's oratory in and out of Parliament . Nothing could exceed the bitterness of his denunciation of the character and doings of Mr. Parnell and his following . This Was repaid in kind . It used to be humorously - suggested that if there were but one door - into heaven and Mr. Russell held the key , none of the Irish members would seek admission . Yet in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Land League had " practically converted the tenants from serfs into freemen . " ( This conversion surely justified much , where for half a century appeals and reasoning had proved ineffectual . ) Mr. Russell amply earned reward at the hands of the Ministry , and received it in being appointed Under-Secretary to the English Local Government Board . He displayed administrative abilities ; and the highest appointments in the state capable of being filled by a layman , one without legal training , were open to him . By a second marriage he became still further connected with Irish ascendancy circles . However it happened , in the quieter years of official life , after the defeat of the Home Rule Bill and the decease of Mr. Parnell and Mr. Gladstone , a complete change of feeling was worked in him regarding the necessity for further and drastic land legislation , and his attitude towards the Irish representatives . He stands almost alone en the history of Irish politics as having once taken his place in the comfortable ' fold of Conservative officialdom , and then , from conscientious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Empire : A Review . 1800-1900 .

Refusing the proffer of a lucrative Government post out of Parliament , he was returned for an Ulster constituency committed to the principle of peasant proprietary , while opposed to Home Rule in the Gladstonian sense , and prepared to support the Government regarding the Transvaal war . Mr. Russell , in the work whose title is appended , gives to the world his mature convictions regarding the Irish question as a whole . The honest avowal of such wide alteration in point of view of a great question is highly honorable , though it necessarily exposes him to the charge of former want of judgment and of insight into the political necessities of Ireland . The language is so vigorous , the style so lucid , the facts of the situation in Ireland are so carefully marshalled , that the pages read more like those of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opens with a statement of the present aspect of the Irish question in Parliament . " Practically the Irishmen say to England , ' You destroyed our Parliament in 1800 .

You govern us , not by love and affection , but by force and fraud . Forty thousand armed men are necessary to maintain your supremacy Ours is a forced and unwilling allegiance . We come to this assembly  --  but are not of it . We desire to be at home governing our own land  --  the land of our affections , and for which alone we care You can retain us here by force , but in that case you must pay the price . We shall interfere in every nook and cranny of British affairs  --  at home and abroad . If we can not govern our own country , we shall see whether we can not make parliamentary institutions and the Government of England a laughmg-stock before the whole world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the situation . " Again : " Why is it that the distant colonies rise as one man in defence of the Empire and , as I think , of a just cause , and the Irish race at home and abroad stand out and oppose ? That is the pregnant question . " Concerning England 's delinquency : " England had , unasked and unbidden , taken over the government of Ireland Where the duty was not shamefully neglected , it was exercised in the interests of a class alone . Until Mr. Gladstone arose , no subject people had ever been more basely treated or neglected by a conqueror . " Mr. Russell proceeds to point out that through agitation and violence alone has every great reform for Ireland had to be wrung from the British Parliament : " But for the murder and outrage which disgraced the years 1880 and 1881 , the great charter of the Irish farmers , weakened and injured as it has been by shameless maladministration , could never have been passed . . . . Similarly , the Local Government Act of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Union , owes its existence on the statute-book entirely to the Home-Rule agitation " Up to the disestablishment of the Irish Church , Mr. Russell has " no hesitation in saying that rebellion was morally justifiable in Ireland " Upon his own part , he acknowledges two great mistakes . He believed in the patriotic feeling and .. intentions of thelrish landlords , and he misjudged the Irish national representatives . " If a comparison has to be made between the British and Irish representatives in Parliament , I am not sure that the Irishmen would lose by it In any case , there these men are . . . What is to be done ? Whatever fault may be found with them , they are absolutely unpurehasable . They forego for their country 's sake all the rewards that service in the English ranks would give them . Not a man in the party can be bought They are able , even brilliant They have discovered and developed a new method of making war upon England Their fathers fought with pike and musket , and were worsted . These men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the privileges of Parliament , have done more in twenty years for their country than has been done by pikes and muskets for centuries " As to the Irish people at large : " Already one hundred years have passed since , by our flagitious conduct , the Union was established . Can any one say that to-day we are one bit nearer the heart of the Irish people ? . . . What is there to make us believe the patience of a whole race can be worn down ? They have suffered and endured in the past . Why , if it be necessary , should they not suffer and endure in the future ? " In successive chapters are treated " The Union to Emancipation , " " Emancipation to the Famine , " " Famine to the Fenian , " " Gladstone : The Great Awakening , " " The Great Surrender , " " Balfourian Amelioration , " " Land Question , " " The Education Controversy , " " Financial Relations , " " Ireland at Westminster , " " The Ulster Problem , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russell 's argument for the necessity of further land reform might have been made stronger if he had devoted a chapter to giving specific instances of the manner in which the plain intentions of the Act of 1881 ( that tenants should not be rented on their improvements ) have been set at naught by officials and a judiciary imbued with landlord and ascendancy prejudices . He has spoken of the present Land Court as " an Augean stable . " Nothing is truer than that , in these days , " it requires no little courage for an Irish Protestant to stand out and be counted on the side of the people . " Mr. Russell 's substitute for Home Rule is that Irish affairs in Parliament should be left to a- grand committee of Irish members  --  a plan suggested by Jonathan Pim thirty years , ago . This scheme is not likely to find much favor with standard Home-Rulers who believe in the radical incapacity of Englishmen to understand and legislate for Ireland , and in the necessity of the task being committed to themselves upon their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Ireland should be spoken of ' as " separation " from England , while parliaments in the United States , Germany , Canada , Australia , even the Channel Islands , enjoying ampler powers than those contemplated by Mr. Gladstone 's bill , are esteemed consistent with union in a republic , a monarchy , and commonwealths . In detail , Mr. Russell reproduces some popular errors . " There was nothing like the increase of population which took place in Ireland anywhere else in Europe " The figures given in Whittaker 's Almanack are 1801-1841 , Ireland 53 per cent . increase , England SO per cent . Census figures : 1821-1831 , Ireland 14.19 per cent . increase , England 15.80 per cent. , 1831-1841 , Ireland 5 25 per cent. , England 14.48 per cent . , , The common statement , at pages 50 , 51 , that , the new pur -- chasers in Landed Estates Court were the chief rent-raisers , and so caused discontent , etc , is not borne out by facts . It was not the famine that made landlords as a rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their estates instead of the incomes from them . That foodstuffs in abundance were exported in the famine years is well known , and that numbers of farmers paid their rents and died of starvation . Mr. Russell 's is altogether a remarkable book , and can not but have its influence upon British politics He opines " The two races that inhabit Ireland will not for ever remain apart , scowling at each other across years of bitter memories . The Protestant will not for ever stand shivering on the banks of the Boyne , the Roman Catholic will not always recall the Penal Laws . " Let us hope the volume before us will help to this end It is , as it stands , in truth a vade-mecum of facts and argument for Home-Rulers . D. B. TUSCAN TOWN AND COUNTRY . FLORENCE , October 15 , 1901 . In a back number of the Nation , I read an interesting letter on the late developments , of Socialism in Italy , and was glad to see that the writer is not one of the timid crew who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a few strikes , where the masters and workmen are allowed to settle things between themselves without any interference on the part of the Government . Had this system been adopted in 1880 , when strikes became fashionable in Italy , very possibly , in this new century , we should not have heard of any more . As it is , we are now in the thick of the epidemic , which , being left to nature , is proving mild on the whole . For the last forty years , although the right to strike is proclaimed by the law of the land , as a matter of fact the Government , the provincial and communal authorities have always intervened on behalf of the masters , either by arresting the workmen , or , in case of agricultural strikes , by sending soldiers to do the work of the men on strike . Hence perpetual conflicts , and the terrible class hatred , which has always existed , embittered to the death . After the shameful arrests of 1898 and the necessary liberation of all the arrested , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the House they organized resistance to the arbitrary acts of the Government . Within the House , assisted by the Republicans , the Radicals , and by a certain number of the old Left , they brought obstruction to such a point as it never was brought by the Irish in Parliament , because they gained all their demands and prevented the passage of new regulations . Onlookers who do not know Italians . molested , and moaned that the end of representative government was at hand , and called on the Government and on the new King  --  especially because of his accession and its cause  --  to proclaim martial law , to gag the Parliament , and return almost to the state of things before the Statuto granted in 1848 . Fortunately , at the helm was an old Liberal , who has never- denied his faith , and who only in one instance acted in opposition to it . He knew that it was useless to attempt to combat anarchy by anarchy , violence by violence ; and made it clear to the young ruler that the ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We must suppose that Victor Emanuel III . is satisfied with Zanardelli , as he has just awarded him the collar of the Annunciate ( withheld from him hitherto , in a most unaccountable fashion , seeing that he was in the first Ministry of the Left in 1876 , by both King Victor II . and Humbert ) . Be that as it may , while apparently Italy is a land convulsed with strikes and rent with civil war , there never was a time when she has been so orderly and peaceful  --  this because the haves and have-nots are left severely alone to settle their quarrels between themselves without let or hindrance . Hence the discussion within the Socialistic party . Fighting the Government for fighting 's sake is still preached by the least intelligent portion of the party , supported , of course , by the Republicans , who do not want a monarchical government to initiate reforms or allow of their initiation , because they need to prove that no good can come out of monarchical institutions . Turati , who , for breadth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conscience , is the loftiest leader of the party , has demonstrated the abmirdity , the puerility of these methods . He has not denied the foundation of Marx 's system  --  collectivism and class struggle  --  but replaces his catastrophic theory with that of gradual reforms , which can be obtained only by alliance with one or more fractions of the middle classes ( borgliesea ) . Throughout the year there has been agitation on the part of the bread-makers and bakers for the abolition of night work , and for certain alterations in the method and time of payment . The owners of bread-making and baking establishments refused the proposals , and the men threatened a strike . Then a trial of fifteen days was agreed upon , but the " fancy-bread " establishments saw their way to make a good thing out of opposition , and continued night work . This consumption of fancy bread naturally lessened that of the common loaf , and the body of proprietors declared that they could not keep to day labor any longer . On this , on the eve of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bread struck . The surrounding cities , Prato , Pisa , Pistoia , whose special bread is patronized by some , merely sent their usual quota . The military bake-houses have enough to do for the garrison , the prisons and the military hospitals ; and the municipality has non-cooperative resources . Hence , for the first day there was no bread for the elementary schools , where breakfast is given to the children , no bread for the charitable institution called the " Daily Bread . " Here tickets for the economical kitchens were substituted , and people in general made out with stale bread , fancy bread ; and the surrounding towns sent in an evening ration . But mark ! so thoroughly convinced were the Florentines of the perfect organization of the workmen and of their right to day instead of night work that no outcry was raised . On the contrary , the proprietors were given to understand that they must give way . Some tried to hold out , but Gughelmo Dolfi , son of the famous old tribune , made himself heard in the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the consequences of leaving Florence another day without bread , ' Or ' allow the surrounding cities to take away our trade altogether ? Let us give the day work a fair trial for a month There are many obstacles to its complete success The fancy-bread makers will be damaged to a large extent if they ca n't supply the hotels with French rolls , scowls , Weis , etc. ; also , it remains to be seen whether the night workers reduced to day workers will be content with day instead of night wages . So it was all settled . There was a truce of a month , and at the end of that period the problem will have solved itself . Throughout Tuscany leagues are being formed for abolishing night labor . In Milan , the bakers are still on strike . But the public peace has not been disturbed . Now suppose that the police had been allowed to arrest the strikers , and the soldiers called in to make and bake the bread ; Florence would have been plunged into disorder . The surrounding cities would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reluctance to turn " blacklegs . " Now , however the matter be settled , the public will say to the defeated party , " You have had a fair trial and must put up with defeat . " In agricultural disputes , affairs are much more difficult to arrange because of the vast numbers and the extreme poverty of the laborers , but in some cases the league of laborers have succeeded in settling disputes amicably . In the Ferrarese districts , however , where a wealthy company has " redeemed waste lands " and transformed them into wheat-growing plains , . the shareholders clamor and the directors are pitiless At the present moment they have ordered 300 evictions , have commenced selling the cattle , and resolved to revert to pasture . But the lcague leaders on the one hand and Government agents on the other are trying to bring both aides to reason , and possibly may succeed . In Sicily and the south of the Neapolitan continent scarcely any sort of organization has yet prevailed . The misery of certain districts is beyond belief or even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bitter winter stave off insurrection from year to year . Proprietors there seem not only heartless , but headless , and the peasant 's only solace is to take sudden and violent vengeance . It would be well if the Socialists of upper Italy , in this halcyon period of liberty , were to bring forward measures for pacifying the starving , half-savage peasants of the Puglie and the Sicilian latifundia.
