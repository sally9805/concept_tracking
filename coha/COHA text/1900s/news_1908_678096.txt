Hitchcock looked a trifle pale , but was calm when he rose to face the jury as they filed in court . His wife , Flora Zabelle , who was seated near the front of the courtroom , leaned forward tensely in her chair , almost gasping with excitement .

His wife , with her friend , Mrs. Buckminster , and a number of theatrical friends , was preseht also . " This is a communication asking me to define a reasonable doubt , " said Justice Goff , when ' the jury were in their places .

" ruled the Justice , " when you can not establish to your own satisfaction on just which side the balance of evidence weighs , it is your duty to give the benefit of any doubt to the defendant . " When the jury filed back to the jury room Justice Goff remained seated on the bench , and it was some time before he went to his chambers .

Mrs. Hitchcock seemed hardly able to control herself while the Judge was charging ; . her eyes constantly filled with tears , and as the jury filed out she raised them beseechingly to each one as he passed . Justice Goff 's charge was felt to be decidedly against the defendant . He /mod In part : " A defendant can not be convicted on this charge , on the unsupported testimony of the chief witness ; but that does not necessarily mean a witness to the act itself .
