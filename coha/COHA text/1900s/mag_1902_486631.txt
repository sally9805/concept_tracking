The Journal of Comparative Literature , to be edited by Profs . George E. Woodberry and J B. Fletcher and Mr. J. E. Spingarn , and published quarterly by McClure , Phillips &; Co , will make its first appearance on January 1 , 1903 . Its contents will relate to international literature , past and present , and its articles will be printed , as a rule , in the language in which they were written Leading articles will be followed by signed reviews , and these by abstracts of periodicals . France , Belgium , Denmark , Holland , Switzerland , Germany , Italy , Austria promise collaboration ( the new French Ambassador at Washington is on the list of names already published ) . British and American universities are also counted on for support . Columbia University is the Journal 's editorial headquarters . The Complete Works of John Lyly , now for the first time collected , are about to issue from the Oxford University Press under the editorship of R. Warwick Bond , MA. , who furnishes a Life of the author and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pott &; Co. announce ' The Builders of the Republic , ' by Margherita A. Hamm ; ' The Life and Works of R. B Sheridan , ' in two volumes ; ' The Inner and Middle Temple , ' historical associations , by H. H. Leigh Ballot ; ' Five Great Painters of the Victorian Era , ' by Sir Wyke Bayliss ; and ' The Mediterranean : Its Storied Cities and Venerable Ruins , ' by J. T Bonney . The indefatigable veteran , Professor Mommsen , will add to the Corpus of Latin Inscriptions published by the Berlin Academy a new volume of considerable size , devoted entirely to theLatininscriptions found in the Orient . It was in 1873 that he pub-. lished the first volume of these inscriptions , but meanwhile there has been such an accumulation of new material that a further volume has become a necessity . His co-laborers are his pupils , Hirschfeld and Domaszewski . From Herbert B Turner &; Co. of Boston comes a new series of standard classics represented at the outset by Swift 's ' Tale of a Tub ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a size for the pocket , though a little heavy for that conveyance , are clearly printed in large type , . and , if one may judge by the clever reproduction of an eighteenth-century ruled page which the ' Tale ' presents , are to be individualized typographically . The Stevenson booklet , with its top-heavy headlines , shows the dangers that attend such experiments . The " Century Classics " of the Century Company , with their all-round excellence of manufacture , proceed with Lamb 's ' Essays of Elia ' and Sterne 's ' Sentimental Journey , ' the latter eked out with Mackeray 's damnatory character of Sterne , from the ' English Humorists , ' by way of preface Whether this is likely to prove an antidote or an appetizer for the Young Person , the student of human nature will decide . But this handsome series is not for youth especially . Whatever one may think of Kenneth Grahame 's ' Dream Days ' as a book for children , there can be no question of the delightful quality of Mr. Maxfield Parrish 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lane . Imagination , grace , and humor are appropriately mixed in them , and the draughtsman 's hand is always firm . Whatever he borrows he makes his own . The unindexed tailpieces , as well as the full-page designs , will not escape notice and commendation . The cover is hardly up to the general level . Two papers , ascribed with certainty to Thackeray , in Fraser 's Magazine ( 1837-39 ) , viz , " A Word on the Annuals " and " Our Annual Execution , " have been tastefully reprinted in Philadelphia by H. W. Fisher &; Co. , under the title of the second paper , which contains the original form of Thackeray'a ballads " The Knightly Guerdon " and " The Almacks ' Adieu " It also includes , as a favorable selection from the Annual under review , Monckton Milnes 's " I wandered by the brookside " The reprint is verbatim from Fraser ; and the edition is limited . Mr. J. P Mowbray 's ' A Journey to Nature , ' having given pleasure to the readers of the Evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , into book form , and now reappears with illustrations by Henry Troth ( Doubleday , Page &; Co ) These are of two sorts , pen-drawn vignettes and full-page photographic views , each to be praised in their way . In his chapter on Indian Summer , Mr Mowbray recognizes only the " laggard days in November . . left behind in the autumnal procession . " Either we have already had our " spell , " beginning in October and overlapping the third week in November , or the sufferers from the coal famine have yet a respite in store for them . Canon Rawnsley has well earned his reputation as the most diligent and devout exponent of the cult of the English Lakes and the Lake School ' A Rambler 's Notebook at the English Lakes ' ( Glasgow . James MacLehose &; Sons ) , is the fifth volume of his impressions of Lake scenery and the life of the dalesmen from the point of view of one for whom every path that Wordsworth may have trodden is hallowed , every stone on which Southey may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limited circle of readers , the remotest connections , the most trivial reminiscences of the " Lakers " possess an interest which to outsiders appears almost miraculously inexhaustible ; and to the mere Philistine , positively morbid There are those , lit though few , who will read , in the proper spirit , of the habits and last years of Wordsworth 's " cousin once removed , " and of the Canon 's pilgrimage , each year piously renewed , to the " jocund company " of the Duddon daffodils . We confess to a preference for the essay on otter-hunting or the description of the November glories of Derwentwater Canon Rawnsley has a pretty gift for describing the various phases of outdoor life in the north country , it is the more to be regretted that his enthusiasm too often borders on the mawkish , too often illustrates the fact that , to a certain form of Wordsworthian " pietas , " it is impossible to walk safely within the narrow limits of the sublime . The Essay on , the " Diamond Jubilee Bonfires " is a collection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a permanent form . The volume is adorned with reproductions from photographs of the Lake district , and has the usual accompaniment of the author 's original verse . Mr. W S. Crockett 's ' Scott Country ' ( London Adam &; Charles Black , New York . Macmillan ) is a rambling book , full of borders-1de lore thrown into simple form Those to whom it is a delight in itself to linger over the names of Eildon , Yarrow , Traquair , Teviot , for whom not only Scott but Hogg and Leyden have charms as binding as those in the book of Sir Michael and as straight from faerie as the rhymes of True Thomas  --  they will turn these pages and pass back for a while among the border hills , under the gray sky , by the dark streams . To all such the book can be commended . To others it will be a thing of naught . Mr. Crockett 's literary powers are trifling , his naivet ? is astonishing . Yet his love of the border goes far to save him . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its wealth of illustrations , often very good , and the numberless ballad notes , of which it is full . The only link in ' The Holy Land , Painted by John Fullylove , Described by John Kelman ' ( Macmillan ) , between the illustrations and the text is that both are impressionistic , full of color , and lacking in detail . Otherwise , they appear to have no relation of origin or plan . Mr Fullylove 's water colors haie been most skilfully reproduced . They undoubtedly render the land with accuracy , but are lacking in artistic charm There is little feeling for distance , but some bits of water are very prettily caught , and the more architectural scenes have often a gorgeous reality . Mr. Kelman , on his side , is a close follower of Prof. George Adam Smith He has not Dr. Smith 's luminous power of interpreting geography , but he has picturesqueness and vocabulary , and can turn ideas into sharp-cut concrete facts , or what may pass for such . Fortunately for his method , his first rapture of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have impressions here , and not studies . These are always vigorous , and may sometimes be correct , but the six months ' tourist who ventures a hundred pages on " The Spirit of Syria " has more even than the courage of his kind , and must be read with caution . Yet  --  or perhaps therefore  --  the book is most readable , and fairly fits its illustrations . Prof. William MacDonald , now of Brown University , but recently of Bowdoin College , treats of ' The Government of Maine ' in Macmillan 's series of Handbooks of American Government . This series is intended for the use of students in high schools and academies , but we doubt if they can profitably spend their time in acquiring information which is , except to specialists , of the driest character . The work before us certainly gives a clear and accurate account of the governmental ma= chinery of the State , and to a considerable extent summarizes its laws , but the severe compression which is unavoidable with such an abundance of material is not favorable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is of interest to the rest of the world chiefly because of its liquor law ; but , for obvious reasons , no frank discussion of this subject is here prudent , and it is dismissed with a few lines . Our strictures , however , must be taken as applying to the plan of the series , and not to the manner in which the author has performed his task , which is altogether praiseworthy . Dr. George Willis Botsford , formerly of Harvard , but now connected with Columbia University , has issued an ' Ancient History for Beginners ' ( Macmillan ) , intended to comply with recent action of the American Historical Association , encouraging the schools to give a year to ancient history , " with special reference to Greek and Roman history , but including also a short introductory study of the more ancient nations . " This volume follows Dr. Botsford 's other books in its bright , readable presentation , and in its copious use of maps and illustrations . Brightness of statement occasionally shows signs of degeneration , and the illustrations sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , devoted to the Orient , is too brief ( forty pages ) to be of much value , but it could hardly be otherwise in a book predetermined to treat Greece and Rome in detail , down to the time of Charlemagne , and occupy but one year with classes of beginners . The 400 pages given to Greece and Rome suffer in many ways from the same hard-and-fast conditions . The various lines of development over so long a period can not be kept fairly in hand and compressed into so few pages without a rigid exclusion of detail , unless it be of the very highest importance But in the details which would thus be excluded are naturally to be found just the things best adapted to hold the attention of boys and girls in beginners ' classes . Dr Botsford has not solved the insoluble problem thus presented . Pericles , Demosthenes , Alexander , Scipio , Sulla , Cicero , Tiberius , Trajan , and the rest crowd one another across the stage so rapidly that the mind neither gets an adequate impression of their character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significance in the development of human history The sixteenth volume of Mr Slater 's ' Book-Prices Current ' ( London Elliot Stock ) makes its pick from auction sales in 1901- ' 02 of 51,000 lots , aggregating ? 163 , - 207 in amount realized ( much the largest in ten years , though the average falls below last year 's ) . The steady increase in the proportion of miscellaneous works is noted by the editor , along with the demand for books having colored plates As usual , apart from the Bible , the Shakspere competition leads all others More of Shelley 's works are recorded than of Byron 's or Tennyson 's ; Browning , in spite of Browning Societies , hardly cuts a figure ' Romola ' alone represents George Eliot , and brought ? 19 , partly , if not wholly , because of the author 's inscription . Dickens slightly outstripped Thackeray , and both ranged substantially with Scott . Boccaccio was more to the fore than Dante ; of Petrarch only six copies , all told , were put up . Voltaire overshadowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed up well . His Kelmscott Press publications under the hammer numbered nine ; those of the Vale Press , four . The excellent little ' American Jewish Year-Book ' is now so regular a publication that it calls only for mere mention . Its interest lies in its chronicle of the year , of the Rumanian question and anti-Semitism generally , of Jewish societies , charitable and otherwise , including the Baron de Hirsch fund ; and of the Zionist movement . In all , there is much sociological material . As usual , the book is weighted with the report of the Jewish Publication Society , and its seventy-odd pages of members ' names . The last volume of Dr. Rodkinson 's translation of the Babylonian Talmud , giving the tract ' Sanhedrin , ' is even likes than its predecessors , in respect to its fine mixed feeding , to the proverbial sheepshead . From lawyers to sociologists and folklorists , even to the pursuers of the jests of the marketplace , all will find their quarry here There have been , for example , accusations against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggestions to criminals . But here we read how Rabbi Jose lectured once on Job xxiv. 16 , and treated the subject so luminously that next night there were three hundred burglaries in the town , all according to his method Naturally , " the town-men troubled him " He replied ; " How could I know that all of you were thieves ? " ? which is a fairly valid criticism on many theories of the prevention and propagation of crime . In a short preface , Dr Rodkinson , if we understand him rightly , indicates his adhesion to a most extraordinary theory of the origin of the Sanhedrin , pushing it back to Moses , and even to Noah . This can not but suggest a doubt as to the scholarship of his translation , which is evidently a free one . It would be well , too , if he could secure some revision of his English style . There are amaeolontila and some curious verbal usages . A translation like this is worth sub-editing The compiler of the Century Company 's ' Bible for Children , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the taste , courage , and discretion which she has showed The Authorized Version has been used , and there has been no finical cutting except of absolutely impossible passages , and no additions or changes . The result is wonderfully readable and infinitely better than the " Bible Stories " of our childhood . Children with these cadences in their ears will surely  --  not to speak of graver matters ? . hold fast their heritage of pure English . But it is a blunder with ethical elements in it that on the title-page there is no mention of the compiler . Instead are given the names of Dr. Francis Brown of Union Seminary and Bishop Potter , the one of whom is responsible for four pages of preface and the other for two of introduction These , unfortunately , are addressed to the parent and not to the child , and , if they come to be read by a child of even ordinary intelligence , may do much mischief . He can not be helped by learning that we think it well for his advantage to cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apology appease him that " care for childhood prompts this , and not blame for the Bible . " Still worse is it for him to learn that " many are indifferent to the Bible . " All this explain ing , apologizing , and protesting may be excellent in its place , but that place was not here , in a book to go into a child 's hands . Its place , at the most , would have been on a few leaves , separate and removable , or on one of those slips , suggestive to the indolent reviewer , which prudent publishers now send out in their books . Added are twenty-four illustrations , all from great paintings , but not all from " the old masters , " as stands on the same unhappy title-page . There is a schoolgirl in anecdote who assures a friend that she has an uncle in Rome , " one of the old masters . " It is only less startling to find Rubens , Murillo , Rembrandt , Van Dyck , and Sir Joshua Reynolds figuring under that rubric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is very good ; the compiler has done her task well . Johns Hopkins University preserves the record of its anniversary celebration ( the twenty-fifth ) in a neat volume printed at the University Press , Baltimore , Md This book contains the addresses in full , a list of delegates from other institutions , a register of alumni attending the celebration , and an account of the presentation of a jubilee volume to Prof. Gildersleeve by his former students , in all , a record which all Hop-km sians and others who attended the ceremonies of last February will wish to possess . The proceedings at the celebration of the two-hundredth anniversary of the founding of Yale College , a year ago , are recorded in a sumptuous volume now published by the University . The number of functions crowded into four memorable days has made it difficult to do them all justice within reasonable compass , and there is little attempt to describe the spectacular effects that constituted so marked a feature of the occasion Much space is necessarily given to programmes and lists which are of course unreadable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are given Professor Fisher 's admirable account of the relation of Yale College to theology and missions , however , well deserved to be republished without abbreviation , and it occupies fifty of the 600 pages of the record . The book seems to be in all respects a fit memorial of a celebration which may well be called glorious . The Bibliographical Contributions of the Library of Harvard University have just been resumed , after a pause of four years . No. 54 fitly consists of a bibliography of Justin Winsor , by William F. Yust . Mr. W C Lane , Mr. Winsor 's successor , calls attention to the remarkable chronological exhibit thus made of Mr. Winsor 's insatiable and varied activity . On pp. 29 , 30 , Mr. Winsor 's contributions to the Nation 1880-1896 , are listed by themselves . A blank book labelled " Poems of Art and Nature , " original and translated , was found among his effects , arranged as if for publication . German topics , including regulations for insurance companies , the Slaby-Arco system of wireless telegraphy , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for November . Other subjects treated are the American plough and the Russian farmer , and the Lyons congress for protection against hail . The testimony as to the efficiency of the " grelifuge cannon " was conflicting , but it was unanimously voted " to continue the war against hail , on condition that it should be done systematically . " The Department of the Rhone " claims to have established the first cloud-firing post . It now has 834 cannon , covering 45,000 acres of vineyards . " Our Consul-General at Yokohama reports an increase of the foreign trade of Japan , but a decrease in value of more than 31. per cent of goods purchased from this country . The falling off has been chiefly in materials for bridges and buildings , telephones and wire . The Quarterly Statement for October of the Palestine Exploration Fund is largely given up to Mr. Macalister 's report of the excavations at Gezer . The principal results have been " the discovery of sections of a great city wall , of a most important burial-cave , the examination of which has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and pottery of some of the earliest races of Palestine ; of a small temenos or high place , containing a stone circle ; and of a considerable variety of objects belonging to the later stone age and the bronze age of culture . " Some of these antiquities are similar to those found in corresponding strata at Tell el-Hesy , but not in other tells . This suggests the possibility of a close racial connection between the two places , a supposition which is strengthened by the fact that , when Joshua besieged Lachish , " Ho-ram , king of Gezer , came up to help Lachish " ( Josh. x. 33 ) . The report is very fully illustrated . Gen Sir C. W. Wilson discusses the question as to the authenticity of the traditional sites of Golgotha and the Holy Sepulchre . The German Orientgesellschaft , with headquarters in Berlin , is enlarging its field of operations , and has begun researches in Egypt . Hitherto the diggings have been confined to Babylon , where Dr. Koldewey has made splendid progress ; although the number of inscriptions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unearthed in satisfactory amounts . The Gesellschaft , as is openly stated , has far-reaching schemes , the purpose being to establish in Berlin collections of materials for the study of Orientalia that will , if not rival that of the British Museum , yet to a certain degree make it unnecessary for German and other savants from the Continent to go to London for their materials . Complaints have been repeatedly made that the authorities of the British Museum do not welcome scholars from abroad , as was the ease in former years . The German society , under the direction of Professor Delitzsch , who has been in the Orient for some five months , has begun its Egyptian work near Cairo , with rich results . Dr. Ludwig Bornhardt is in charge of these researches , and has already published a preliminary account of the undertaking . The famous Barberini library , containing more than 60,000 volumes , has been purchased by the Vatican authorities . The Italian Government learned of the sale too late to make an offer , and could only satisfy itself that the law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violated in the transaction , as the sale included only books and manuscripts , but not the picture gallery or statues , or even the family archives . Leo XIII . has expressed his purpose to erect a special building for the reception of these new treasures , and proposes to give scholars free access to the collection . From Lemcke &; Buechner we receive the first calendars for 1903 , viz. , the seventh " Meyer 's **25;106;TOOLONG Kalender " and the " Munchener Kalender , " the latter with its customary series of colored arms of German princes and counts , begun in 1895 Meyer , with its illustrations , leaf by leaf , covers the whole globe impartially . Its anniversary department has been enlarged , and a planetary table is now given for the first of each month . ? A new edition of William Ellery Channing 's ' Thoreau , the Poet-Naturalist ' ( Boston : Charles E. Goodspeed ) will be welcome to all lovers of Thoreau except those who delight in having what others can not buy . The first edition was exhausted some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thoreau 's growing reputation came to the assistance of the book 's inherent quality , which did not tend to popular appreciation . It is no enemy , but Mr. Sanborn , who describes it as obscure and enigmatical , and , though rich in recondite learning , without much method , or with a method of its own baffling to most people . Mr. Sanborn , in his introduction to the new edition , tells us with what perversity the first was made . As early as 1853 , Charming planned a series of imaginary conversations , in which Thoreau , Emerson , and Alcott , with himself , were to be the interlocutors . Much work was done upon this line , but none of it utilized until 1863 , when a part of Channing 's ' Thoreau ' was sent to Mr Sanborn , then editing the Boston Commonwea , lth , for publication in that paper . A break in the publication excited Channing 's ire , and he recalled the unprinted portion of his manuscript . When ' Thoreau , the Poet-Naturalist ' appeared in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years before . Its main peculiarity was the introduction of sixty-seven pages , taken from the projected ' Walks ' of 1853 , in response to the publisher 's desire for matter to enlarge the book . One remembers that , similarly , - Goethe added to ' Wilhelm Meister ' " The Confessions of a Fair Saint , " and , here as there , the addition is extremely good . But it is made up of conversations the participants in which were at first left to the reader 's guesswork In the new edition Mr. Sanborn has prefixed , or affixed , their names in most cases , eking out Channing 's manuscript hints with his own judgment . As it now stands , no part of the book is more interesting and important than this . But every part of it is treasure-trove for those who care much for Thoreau and his Concord friends Mr. Channing 's self-revelation is not the least valuable part of it . His thought and style are often wilfully eccentric and obscure , but there is more than enough of excellent matter , original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written about Thoreau comes so close to his life and mind as this delightful and exasperating incoherency . Mr. Goodspeed maintains his reputation for beautiful bookmaking , both in this simple and inexpensive and in the larger and more costly style in which the book is published ? The ' History of the English Churen , ' which is being edited by Dr , Stephens , the Dean of Winchester , will eventually comprise seven volumes . Of these , four have already appeared , if we include the instalment just published by Mr. James Gamdnee ( Macmillan ) . Indeed , we have before us , as y et unnoticed , the last two volumes of this learned and important series The Rev. W. W. Capes , in the third volume , covers the whole of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries , while Mr. Gairdner , in the fourth , continues the narrative through the Reformation period as far as the reign of Mary . In glancing over Canon Capes 's table of contents we observe that Wyclif is the only religious leader who receives a chapter to himself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separate titles , but we must count them among ecclesiastics rather than among guides of the nation in matters of personal religion . Courtenay does not give his name to a chapter , nor does Wykeham We may resume by stating that Canon Capes finds much more to say about general subjects like " The Medimval Bishop and his Officials , " " The Cathedral Chapters and their Staffs , " " The Clergy and Parish Life , " " The Monastic Life , " " Friars and Pilgrims , " " Schools and Universities , " than he does about distinguished individuals  --  if we except Wyclif . In one respect which we may name , this volume is particularly successful Canon Capes 's predecessors have tended to give Lollardy such prominence as to dwarf everything else in the church history of England during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries That this is the most prominent and important subject , if one only be selected , we should be the last to deny Still , there is a large literature already upon Wyclif and his movement , while the state of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been unduly neglected by students trained in modern methods of research . Canon Capes 's little books on ' The Early Empire ' and ' The Age of the Antonines ' are so good that his attempt in another and far different field is sure to awaken interest Certainly no one will feel a sense of disappointment in reading the present sketch . It is strong and graphic , learned and thoughtful . The narrative part is good , not to say unexceptionable in a book of this scope , but the performance reaches an unusually high quality when chronicle is left behind and the discussion of broad ecclesiastical topics begins . As filling a gap in accessible literature , we should think that no volume of the series is likely to prove so useful . ? To Mr. James Gairdner has fallen the difficult and delicate task of writing that part of this consecutive history which deals with the revolt from Rome . Not only is it a great labor to master the available sources of information , but time has not yet adjusted the point of view A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is furnished by Mr Gairdner 's preliminary remarks on the word " heresy . " Now that the Christian world is divided into so many bodies , " heresy " and " schism " have almost lost their meaning . In the age of the Reformation , on the contrary , " the unity of the Church was not only the generally received doctrine , but was also a doctrine which the state felt bound to uphold . The rulers of the state might seek to put the Church under new conditions , they might even seek to discredit some old doctrines . Both these things they did attempt ; and , whatever we may think of their conduct , . they succeeded largely in their aims . But this did not affect the old belief , held even by reformers , in one true Catholic and Apostolic Church . " The test case is that afforded by the period which Mr. Gairdner terms " the Edwardine anarchy " ; but even at this time of radical innovation the leaders of revolt were seeking to find " the essential principles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and herein lies an initial difficulty , must throughout be used in a sense which is unlike its ordinary sense Mr Gairdner , when he speaks of heresy , does not refer in any way to the truth or falsehood of particular doctrines . He alludes simply to " an arrogant and - pertinacious denial of doctrines laid down by authority , and where no competent authority had as yet declared bid beliefs superstitious , it was really heresy to dispute them . " Thus we encounter a difficulty on the threshold  --  a difficulty of phrase which is grave enough to demand a whole preface for its explanation . The disputed points involved in any history of the English Reformation are so numerous that they could barely be touched on in a long article Here we shall only commend Mr Gairdner 's book as a model of learning and fairness , unless , perhaps , we quote one contention which is made on the concluding page " In the ' Thirty-nine Articles and in the English Prayer-book itself , the final results of the Reformation were embodied , so far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult to overestimate their value . No formularies were ever drawn that give so much liberty to the human mind Truth had been well tested by martyrdoms on either side before they were finally adopted ; and while they repudiated the exclusiveness of Rome , they raised no barrier to the freest thinking consistent with belief in revelation . They constitute a more real catholicism than that of the Council of Trent . " Such a statement must , naturally , have an ex-parte sound , but Mr. Gairdner can not for a moment be accused of writing his history to support this view ? Dr Alexander Schmidt 's ' Shakespeare Lexicon ' ( Berlin ? G. Reimer ; New York . G. E Stechert ; Leracke &; Bucchner ) needs no introduction either to scholars or to the public at large . It has often been characterized as the most useful work ever composed in elucidation of Shakspere , and this description can hardly be rated as unduly enthusiastic . The plan of the book and its execution are alike admirable , and no one is likely to echo the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utter when it first appeared , some thirty years ago The question is not whether " Schmidt is an authority " : Schmidt is indispensable , and never ought to get out of print . Nor should the text of the lexicon be altered What is wanted is an occasional reimpression , and additions or corrections should be confined to an appendix . Fortunately , the publisher is wise , and , the book being stereotyped , his interests coincide with his judgment . The third edition , now before us , is practically unchanged , so far as the body of the book is concerned . The sensible remark of the author , in the preface to the second edition , appeals to every purchaser 's heart . " Nobody is so rich as not to repine at being obliged to buy the same book three or four times . " The present edition , however , has a valuable supplement of about thirty pages , prepared by Professor Sarrazin , well known for his studies in the literary history of " Hamlet . " This consists of " new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part , from English commentators , who , Dr. Sarrazin thinks , are the " most legitimate " interpreters . We note , with amusement , that he makes a sharp distinction between Englishmen and Americans , associating the latter , presumably as aliens , with " Dutch and German scholars . " But no harm is clone and our feelings are not hurt . By the doctor 's leave , we shall still do our best to speak and read our mother tongue , - which Alexander Schmidt understood so well  --  rather better , we see , than his editor , who speaks of " commentators of the great poet " where the idiom requires on .
