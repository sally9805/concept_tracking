 | A CAREFUL scrutiny of the outlook for the present dramatic season ( if it be judged by the comparatively few events which have , thus far , afforded grounds for conclusions ) will be found to reveal no unusual conditions ; nor will it , on the other hand , show reasons to hope , even such general prosperity as has been seen herto . In other words , it may be said that those improved new conditions which might be hoped for , do not exist , and that the public is tiring of the old . It is already manifest that the general run of theatrical managers still cling to their custom of going abroad for their attractions . Summer after summer ( and the summer of 1905 was no exception ) they go to London and Paris , and even search the other capitals of Europe , for players and pieces that have caught the popular fancy there . They enter into keen competition  | for the American rights of these productions , and announce their success with trumpet-flourishes when they outbid their rivals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquisitions . It is an old and familiar story . Next , these managers , with that fatuous hope that " springs eternal , " produce the pieces thus acquired , expecting , or seeming to expect , that the American public will patronize and enjoy them . It may be too much to say that they think the reason why our public will enjoy them is because London or Paris has done so , but it is evident that the managers expect success here because of the success abroad . This distinction may seem subtle , but it will repaya little study . One need not look far to find how fallacious this hope is , or why it is so . In the first place , the pieces are foreign . They are written and presented abroad to suit the fancy of people of different habits , different education and different tastes from the habits , education and tastes of Americans . Of course , so far as a playwright applies himself to the fundamental questions of life , and grapples with the fundamental passions , he puts himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " real human interest , " and if he be a master of his art , he is likely to give us a play of such a character that all people will understand it . If it be good , all people are likely to enjoy it . But it must be remembered that even in regard to the fundamental questions and passions of mankind there are wide differences of taste and custom among the nations of the earth . Africa and France do not differ more radically than do London and New York in some of the more subtle considerations which go to the making of a successful drama . When , therefore , a great London success is brought to New York and presented a New York public in the hope that it will strike the same responsive chord here that it did in the British metropolis , then would be a strong chance of disappoint ment even if the play should be presented here precisely as it has been at home . The music falls on earattuned to a differ ent order of melody ; the wit appeals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the story is told to auditorwhose own liveare differently ordered and whose interests and ambitions are in other directions . There is every probability that the very finest points , the strongest climaxes that have helped to a London success , will appear platitudinous or antipathetic to New York auditors . But this is not all . What has been said would apply without reservation even if the London play were presented here with fidelity to the original production in all details . The appetite for caviar in Moscow , and for bird's-nest pudding in Canton , may be strong , but those delicacies appeal to only a limited class , say in Chicago . If we suppose , however , that a restaurateur is attempting to introduce them to Chicago epicures , he will at least take pains to present them as nearly as possible in the same condition of excellence in which the native consumer enjoys them . This , I insist , is precisely  | what our theatrical managers do not attempt , or , if they attempt it , they fail lamentably . A play is brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ localize " it by rewriting it in spots , much as if a little buckwheat flour should be mixed with the caviar to give it a flavor which the American palate will recognize . More often , however , it is play is , however , entrusted to a cast of actors who , no matter how clever or how sympathetic they may be , are yet American , and so keyed in a different pitch from the home cast . It needs no explanation to show how this decreases the chance of success which the manager is fondly dwelling on . Last , and worst of all , the foreign plays that are brought to America are , for the most part , execrably staged in the American theaters . It is in the matter of staging plays , more , perhaps , than in any other particular , that the managers of New York have failed to keep pace with the demands of the theatergoing public . It may be freely conceded that this is by no means a result of parsimony . Money is spent freely , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so far toward determining the success or  | failure of a dramatic production . There is no reason why it should not be . The public , keen as it is in its demands for the best , is also liberal in its payment , and the prices demanded and obtained for seats at the best theaters sufficiently cver the expense of adequate production . The manager , therefore , who is catering to a New York audience has no necessity for stinting himself in the matter of expenditure . If he has a good production , parsimony will needlessly imperil its chances , and if the production is of doubtful value , it will be inevitably fatal to all prospects to put it forth in niggardly fashion . Consequently , he is not niggardly . There is far more than the expenditure of money , however , involved in staging a play , and while it might be supposed that the manager who is willing to spend money without stint would be able to secure whatever is necessary for the proper staging of a play , experience shows that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He may obtain gorgeous splendor of the stage sort , and riotous luxuriance in deco- rative effects , and possibly may be thoroughly satisfied in his own mind that he has secured the very acme of excellence in the staging of his work . Moreover , he may be , as is often the case , utterly unable to see why the public , missing that indefinable something in the ensemble which meets the requirements of truly critical taste , turns from the theater in disappointment , or tires quickly of a spectacle that dazzles without satisfying . We have then , in the last analysis , to consider the case of an enterprising man of business who believes that he can obtain profits from the entrance-fees to his theater ; who has gone to Europe at no small expense to secure such attractions as he believes will draw crowded houses ; who has purchased the American rights to plays that have been successes in the capitals of Europe ; who has brought them over , together with some of the leading actors , it may be ; who has put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be , but as London or Paris attractions ; who has staged them without regard to expense , to conform to the ideas of the stage manager whom he considers the best in the business , or who , perhaps , is the best he has been able to engage ; and who sits down after it is all over , and wonders why the public did not enjoy and patronize the entertainment he has given them . When he is convinced of his failure . takes his choice between two explanations ( I ) The public is fickle . ( 2 ) It is impossible to foretell what the public will like or dislike . Neither of these propositions is true , and no man who knows his business as it should be known will take refuge in either onof them as an explanation of what is , after all , his own failure . A little discussion of some popular phrase - making may possibly make this last point clear . There has been , of late . a strong tendency on the part of phrasemakers and their would-he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for art 's sake . " Even so conspicuous a person as Mr. George Bernard Shaw has not considered it beneath his dignity to repeat the sneer . Let us see what it amounts to . We , who are of the stage , and who love it ? who give our lives to its service ? may surely be pardoned if we consider the dramatic art the highest of all arts . Seeing the question of theatrical business as we do , we are able to define for ourselves the various gradations of theatrical management somewhat as follows . Art for art 's sake is unquestionably the high aim of the manager who presents the drama to his patrons in such shape as satisfies his own ideals , without regard to the commercial results . Apparently this  | is utopian , and a mode of procedure to be justified only in the case of a man of limitless means , who carries on his business solely for his own gratification . In reality it is no more utopian than is the work of the painter or sculptor who refuses to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever the public may demand . If he have the courage of his own art , he will stand or fall by his ideal . It does not follow that he will not get high prices for his picture or statue . Art for business ' sake may he good art . It is entirely conceivable that a respectable artist in dramatic work , or in any other , may devote himself to the making of money as his ultimate purpose . It is not conceivable , if he be a true artist , that he will sacrifice his ideals to what he believes to be the public demand . The moment he should do this would be the moment when he would cease to be an artist , and his work would cease to be art ? for art 's sake , for business ' sake , or for any other . Business in the guise of art , for the sake of money , is the particular prostitution of the drama against which the true artist protests with all the passionate force of his nature . If the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success and presents it here in the fashion just described , be considered carefully , the reader will perceive what I have in mind . In all the protest against commercialism in our  | theaters ? and there has been much and vigorous protest , without , perhaps , a sufficiently clear explanation ? there has been no word against " art for business ' sake . " This last may not be lofty enough to satisfy the dreamer , but it is at least honest and respectable . Moreover , it may be high art . But when the forms of art are borrowed by men who have no conception in themselves of what art is ? when those whose creative ability makes the drama possible are directed , dominated , even enslaved , by men who have no sympathy with their work , but who use them as beasts of burden to fetch dollars to the boxoffice , and compel them to sacrifice ideals for the grub of daily life , then the protest of the artist becomes passionate indeed . To revert ? The outlook for the opening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business in the guise of art , for the sake of money , " is what the theaters of the country are used for , with honorable exceptions . A prominent manager said over his own signature , the other day , that plays of familiar human interest are not plentiful . He and others like him find it @# difficult to secure attractions , so , as was said , they go to Europe to look for them . I went over myself last spring to see if I could find any . I could not find one that I would produce here , but there has been the usual importation , and it may be added , somewhat more than the usual proportion of failures . The imported plays have been handicapped by their staging , and it is hardly likely that they would have succeeded anyhow , since the public is tired of foreign stuff . Yet the managers , generally , are clinging to the outworn customs of other days . Happily there is a reverse side . That combination of capitalists who by their association together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years past to monopolize the theaters of the United States almost absolutely , so that they have stifled competition , and retained the entire field for their own productions and those which they could control , is no longer allpowerful . Beginning last month , for the first time in all these years , there is in all the principal cities of the country from Boston to  | Kansas City , with the single exception of Cincinnati , a clear field in which independent managers may compete with the syndicate . The enormous significance of this to the managers of the country and to the theater-going public is not easily realized by those who are not thoroughly familiar with the theatrical business , but has a significance far greater than appears on the surface . It means , for one thing , that the American author no longer has to kowtow to an association of managers who are in business in the guise of art , for money 's sake . It means , also , that the public in all these cities may now see the plays and the actors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not allow it . In this one respect the prospect of the coming season is bright beyond precedent , but as the bulk of the business still remains with the syndicate , and as the syndicate clings to its accustomed methods , there is small hope of general theatrical prosperity .
