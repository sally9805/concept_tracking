txt Fifty feet under ground , in a chamber of earth and rock , the only exit blocked , by a lake of water formed by a bursting main end sewer pipes , and able to breathe only such air as may reach them through a drill pipe , two men are imprisoned in the Long Island City end of the Pennsylvania tunneL The men are Antonio Frogga. axed Franco Francisco , night watchmen in the tunnel . Since 3 o'clock yesterday morning . when : he tunnel caved in , they have been cut off from the world , except for signals which have been constantly exchanged between them and the men who are working like mad to rescue them . These signals are exchanged through the drilipipe , which is tapped every fifteen minutes . The answering taps are heard quite distinctly . Some of the Italians who are working to save their countrymen declared last night that they occasionally heard calls , but the tapping on the pipe was the only sure sign that the men below were still alive . All day yesterday and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work kept a force of fifteen men digging a new shaft into the tunnel below , while the pumps , sucking up twenty-five gallons a minute , were tolling to keep down the water which had formed in a cul de sac . At midnight the new shaft had been sunk twenty-five feet , end there was still twenty-five feet to be dug before the men could be reached . The contractors said they did not hope to accomplish the work before 6 or 7 o'clock tins morning . Not until the shaft is sunk will it be , certain that the men have fresh air . The drill pipe along which signals are passed is said to sink right into the bottom of . the tunnel , but the hope was entertained late last night , when the signals from below were in no way abated , that the men had had an instrument heavy enough to break the pipe , when they found them-1 selves shut in . The two Italians were made prisoners by the collapsing of a portion of the Long Island Railroad freight yards , between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Long Island Ferry , caused by the sinking of the tunnel it- i self . It is believed that a large sewer under the tunnel had been leaking , and that the water had gradually weakened the shoring . The men were stationed in a section of the tunnel 1,500 feet tram East Avenue and almost at tiled /auk of the river . Their ; position was such that it is not believed possible they could have heard the noise of the cave-in . They were in the upper section of an ' uncompleted air lock at . the very extremity of the tunnel . The contour of the tunnel there takes the shape of -a letter " U , " resting- on one of its sides instead of on the curve . Frogga and Francisco were on the upper side of the " U. " This side is seven feet in height , about thirty feet long , and ends in a dead wall of earth and rock . The place was accessible from the lower side of the " by a ladder placed in the curve . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and extends hack to the tunnel shaft at East Avenue . The space between the two sides of the le is occupied by a " bunch " of solid rock , nine feet in thickness . Such was the trap in which Fragga and Francisca , supplied with a dim lantern and a little lunch , were on duty when the cave in , nearly a quarter of a mile , away , occurred . Two other watchmen , in another section of the tunnel . heard the roar of falling earth and stone as it slid into the tunnel and escaped , but there was nu one to warn Fragga and Francisca For some reason : Amt . Johnston of Pearson &; Sons , the contractors , was not notified of the collapse of the tunnel until two hours after it occurred . Neither was it suspected that the two watchmen had been imprieoned until they failed to quit work at o'clock . Messengers were at once sent to their homes in Long Island City . Relatives of the men returning with the messengers said they had not reached their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although at first the operations were seriously hampered by the frantic relatives , of the two men , supplemented by scores ; of other Italian women whose husbands , for other reasons , had not returned home. ; To this was added a growing crowd which had heard of the tunnel cave-in , but ' was unaware until later that there were two men imprisoned . Powerful air pumps were at once rigged and put under way at 8:30 o'clock . At that time the men had been imprisoned five hours , and as no the thought of testing the air drill pipe as a means of signaling , it was tnought for part of the day that the men were dead . The contractors preserved a discreet silence . Several steam pumps were rigged to pump out the water . The first thing that was learned when the pumps began to work was that the water in the tunnel did not decrease . It was then discovered that the sewer mains were pouring into the cul de sac in full force . Word was immediately sent to have them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when gas pipes , which had been torn apart and were pouring out noxious fumes , were also attended to . it was then expected that twelve hours ' work at the pumps would clear the tunnel of its flood . One thing was forgotten . however . The big sewer main emptied into Newtown Creek and the tide was rising . Shortly before 12 o'clock the waters of the creek began to back up into the main and sown new flood was pouring into the tunnel . it was simply impossible to check it , and the flood continued until long after 2 o'clock , when the tide was high . It , was when the futility of the pumps was realized that W. B. Converse , engineer and Inspector ; Walter Burden , master mechanic , and Charles Alareano , the foreman of the tunnel men , volunteered to go to the rescue in a boat . It was a dangerous thing to do , as there was no telling when some other part of the tunnel undermined by the flowing waters might cave in upon them . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tunnel .

There seemed nothing to do hut to turn back , when Mareano. stripping off his clothes , plunged into the water , dived under the sill of the door , and came up in the darkness on the other side He swam on for twenty feet , yelling the , names of the two men beyond as he swam . He got no response , and . believing that the men would have answered him if they had been alive , turned to come back . It was then that he found that he had reckoned beyond his strength .

The pumps fought the flood while the tide was at this point . The moment the tide turned the tight was waged in deadly earnest . The hope was entertained early in the evening that the rescue might be effected before high tide at 2 o'clock this morning . At midnight it was said that this was well-nigh impossible , and in order to have everything in readiness when the shaft reached the tunnel to offer effectual succor to the men the Merritt-Chapman Wrecking Company was communicated with and asked to send two divers fully equipped . They will be on hand at 6 o'clock this morning . It was estimated at midnight that the water remaining in the tunnel was from 15 to 16 feet deep .
