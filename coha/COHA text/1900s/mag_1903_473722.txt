0F the many sites in Palestine whose excavation has been recommended by the distinguished engineer officers who have made the survey of that land , one of the most important is the hill which rises beside the village of Ahu-Shusheh , Tel-el-Jezair . It is one of the first landmarks which attract the attention of the traveller from Jaffa to Jerusalem , and is a prominent object in his view even before he reaches Lydda , continuing in sight until the train has entered the wild pass of the Warly-elSurar , the valley of Sorek of the Book of Judges . Tel-el-Jezair is a long , low mound , about 200 metres high , with steep sides and a flat top , a typical " tel , " or mound , of a buried city , although its stony sides and summit show no sign of the secrets which they hide . At both its eastern and western ends it rises a little and CVIT. ? No. 637. - 11widens , its mid part being lower and narrower . The western knoll is crowned by a ruined wely , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sheikh el Jezair , but , excepting this , a farmyard on the southwestern slope , and a graveyard between the farm and the wely , the rest of the top and sides is bare and wild . Before the excavations began , visitors to the tel were few and far between ; yet there are very few hills in Palestine which offer such an extensive and varied prospect . To the northeast and north are Jaffa , Lydda , and liamleh ; to the northwest , the broad valley of Ajalon leading up to Beth-heron , whose name is associated with Joshua 's victory over the five Amorite kings , and Amwas , with its ancient church ( one of the rival sites of the Emmaus of St. Luke ) ; to the east is the pass of Bab-el-Wad , with the Trappist monastery of Latrun at its mouth , and the valley of Sorek , whose name calls to mind many episodes in the history of Samson . To the southeast is the valley of Elah , the scene of the conflict between David and Goliath . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sandy plain containing the Philistine cities Ekrnn , Ashdod , and Gath not far off . Askelori still more remote , and Gaza in the far distance , where the sands of the desert meet the sky in the southern horizon . Even if we knew nothing as to the ancient history of this mound , its prominence and strategic importance , commanding as it does the passes from the seacoast to Jerusalem , would have invested it with more than usual interest ; but since the discovery of boundary-stones at various points around it , by which it has been identified as Gezer , its importance to the Biblical and historical student has become enhanced . Four such stones have been found , upon which words signifying " Boundary of Gezer " were inscribed in Hebrew letters , together with the name of Alkios in Greek , probably that of some official of the Seleuciclan period . Unfortunately , these stones have , for one reason or other , been removed or destroyed , and there now only remains in situ a portion of one of these inscriptions . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of considerable importance in the history of Palestine . It is mentioned as a conquered city in the Karnak list of Thothmes III. , about 1500 B.C. , and about two centuries later its conquest was claimed by Mcrenptnh . From it three of the Tel-el-Aniarna lettors were written to Egypt in the reign of Amenhotep IV , ( a.c. 1370 ) , and it is referred to in four others . According to Joshua , x. 33 , its king was killed by the Israelites at the siege of Lachish , but the city itself was not taken by them ( Joshua , xvi . 10 ) , so , although it appears in the list given in Joshua , xxi. 21 , as a Levitical city within the territory of Ephraim , it really remained in the hands of the Amorites until the reign of Solomon . When that king married the daughter of Pharaoh , king of Egypt ( or , as some critics would have us believe , the daughter of Pint , king of the Arabian Musri ) , his father-in-law burned the city and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an important place in the time of the Maceabean struggle for independence , and still later during the wars of the Crusades . Thus the chronology of the historical events of which it was the theatre ranges from B.C. 1500 to 1200 A.D. In its undisturbed state the tel showed little sign of its former glories ; its steep sides and flat top show only a scanty vegetation of thorns and thistles , with scarcely any traces of the structures which are buried under its surface . Early in the year 1002 the committee of the Palestine Exploration Fund obtained a firman permitting the excavation of the hill , and they have intrusted the superintendence of the work to Mr. R. A. Stewart Macalister , who had been associated with Dr. Bliss in the excavation of the Shephelah tels in 1898-1900 . Owing to unavoidable causes , the work was not begun until June 15 . ? The results of this excavation , so far , may be summarized as follows : There have been at least six successive cities on this site , possibly seven . Each of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the superposed city was built on its ruins , and there seems to have been a considerable interval between the successive cities , especially between the first and second , and between the fourth and fifth . I have tabulated these results in order of historical sequence , but , of course , in the reverse order of their discovery . The oldest of the occupations appears to have been a semisavage settlement rather than a city . Its inhabitants lived in caves and rock shelters united by causeways of stones . They used flint weapons , and were ignorant of all metals . They gathered and crushed olives , probably made wine of grape juice , and used a very coarse pottery shaped by hand without the aid of the potter 's wheel . They , in some cases at least , cremated their dead , hence it is not easy to be absolutely sure of their physical characteristics . As well as could be ascertained from the fragments of their bones , they seem to have been short in stature , but muscular in frame , with fairly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animals , such as goats and oxen , have been found in their eaves . To this aboriginal people were probably due certain rock-cuttings and cup-markings which may have been used for sacrificial purposes . It is possible that these may be equated to the Avvim , who are said to have been the precursors of the Canaanites in this district , but they certainly were not giants . The stratum which overlies this contains the foundations of many dwellings . rectangular in outline , built of undressed stones . Flint and bone implements and ornaments are common , but with these are a few copper and bronze spears and axes . Many mazzihoth , or pillar stones , are found in the narrow ways between the houses , and some at leaat of the dead were buried in eaves within the city . When I joined my son at the works last July , he had opened one such cave near the top of the eastern hill , in which were the remains of many persons , ? men , women , and children of this city . The cave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a crematorium , and its door was covered with a stratum of burnt bones , but over these were the bones of this second people . Around the walls were stone enclosures built with mud mortar , in which were skeletons , deposited mostly on their sides in the contracted position , and with them much pottery of a finer kind , mostly hand-made without the wheel , although some were apparently wheel-made . Bead and shell ornaments were common . No metal implements were found in this cave . When surveying the middle part of the hill , Mr. Macalister had noted two bosses of stone projecting about a foot and a half above the surface at the place where the tel was narrowest ; and being familiar with the appearance of the rude stone monuments in Britain , he conjectured that these were the summits of standing stones like those which he had found four years ago in one of the ShepheIal tels . Wishing to verify his hypothesis , he set a number of men to work around them , and after little more than a week 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extending from north to south more than half-way across the hill . The largest of these stones measured about four metres in height , more than a metre in width , and three-quarters in thickness . Two of them had fallen , but these have been replaced , and it is intended that these , as well as other of the larger archaeological finds , shall be left in situ , exposed for the benefit of future visitors . To the west of the middle stone of the row was a large and beautifully squared stone , in the centre of which a great square trough had been cut . This can not have been an altar , for it showed no trace of fire , but it may have been a socket for one of the Ashcrah , or sacred trees , the " groves " of the Authorized Version of the Bible , which we know to have been parts of the symbolism in ancient Canaanite worship . These great stones were placed on an artificial plateau or flat pavement made of limestone chips which must have formed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven large earthen jars , each of which contained the skeleton of an infant , in some cases calcined . Small libation vases or other sacrificial vessels were found either in or beside these jars . These objects were evidently the traces of ritual sacrifices , possibly of the first-born , who were among the Semites consecrated to the tribal god . The performance of these rites in later times is referred to in Isaiah , lvii. 5 . There had been a great wall around this holy place , but this has not yet been fully cleared . Certain other sacred enclosures and caves were found in the vicinity , perhaps priestly dwellings and treasure-houses . In an adjoining plot and at about this depthwerefound the broken remains of an Egyptian stele of one An kh-amen-a au , son of Beha , ? names only known in monuments of the old or early middle empire of Egypt , about twenty to twenty-five centuries n.e . In the stratum which overlay this second city were numerous dwellings resembling those described in that layer , but these were usually better built , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with mud mortar . In some places a layer of charred vegetable matter intervened between the second and third strata , but not sufficiently extensive to indicate a general conflagration . Bronze is more common in this third stratum , and numerous scarabs were found here , all of types which are usually associated with remains of the middle empire in Egypt ( between n.e. ' 2200 and B.C. 1800 ) . Pottery was abundant , some of the vessels being of elegant forms and wheel made , some with the peculiar burnishing characteristic of early Amorite ware , and with thickened rims and ledge handles . On the handles of some of these jars are impressions of scarab seals which are of the same general types as the scarabs themselves . In one part of the city of this period was a temenos , or sacred enclosure , in the midst of which was a circular raised sacred hearth , surrounded by a ring of small standing stones . Not far from the temenos was a cistern of the usual bell shape , filled with debris . When Ibis was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skeletons , disposed in various ways , usually in the contracted position ; with them were numerous bronze and copper spears and axes , as well as a few food-vessels , cooked bones of animals , and much charcoal . as though a funeral feast had been held here . Apparently all the bodies had been deposited at the same time , and may have been , perhaps , those of warriors who had fallen in some combat . Of the people who lived in the second and third strata , there are sufficient remains left to enable us to form a judgment as to their physical appearance . This differed little from that of the ordinary Semitic type . It is therefore probable that these cities were built by the peoples who formed the first and second waves of Semitic invasion , the ancestors of the Canaanites , Amorites , and other Palestinian tribes who possessed the land before the Israelitish immigration . Between the remains of the third and the overlying fourth layer were here and there patches of ashes and charred wood and other vegetable matter , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newer city covered the mouth of the great burial-cave and encroached on the enclosure of the temple . Bronze is here the commonest metal , but a few traces of iron have been found . Aere for the - first time we find lamps and bowls buried under the foundation of walls , and the pottery showed some trace of wean influence . Scarabs were fewer , but pieces of Egyptian ware were occasionally met with . As a rule , the houses were more rudely built than those of the third city , but other remains , spindle-whorls , millstones , etc. , show a culture stage somewhat in advance of those that had gone before them . Small clay images of a goddess , probably some divinity allied to Astarte , were still as common as in the underlying layer . The second , third , and fourth cities , as far as the excavations have gone , seem to have been coextensive . The people of the second city built around it a wall , of which part remains . It was largely an earthen rampart , faced with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong and massive stone wall outside this , of which a considerable length has been exposed . This was about two metres and a half thick , and at intervals of varying length expanded into square towers of solid masonry , the corner-stones of these towers being carefully squared . These towers were about six metres in diameter , and projected both externally and internally beyond the wall . At a later period these towers were strengthened by the building , on their outer face , of an additional wall , surrounded but not bonded to the original square towers . These new walls were of larger stones , and they were so constructed as to round off the angles of the towers . The excavation has not as yet been carried far enough to show the exact relation of the wall to the several groups of buildings or to the temple of standing stones . Of the two later strata few important parts have been as yet found . It is probable that the newer cities , those of Solomon 's rebuilding and that of later times , were smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be found for the most part at the western end of the hill . The historical value of these later cities when found will probably be far greater than those of the more ancient cities which have as yet been unearthed . Of the Seleucid and Maccabean periods the chief traces that have been found are the handles of wine-jars from Rhodes bearing Greek inscription of the fourth to the second centuries B.C. , a few coins , and a remarkable bath , which occupied the highest part of the eastern hill , and one Egyptian inscription of 395 n.c. , bearing the name of the first Pharaoh of the twenty-ninth dynasty . All these were either at or very little below the surface . In prosecuting the excavations , Mr. Macalister marks out the surface of the tel into measured squares . The surface soil of one of these is carefully removed , every spadeful being scrutinized in the process . The digging is by men , and the soil is carried away in baskets by girls or boys , as shown in the illustrations . When the remains of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it is carefully surveyed and mapped to scale , every building photographed and described ; those that present no remarkable architectural features are then removed . When the second layer is exposed the same process is gone through . In this manner an absolutely accurate record is kept of all the buildings of each stratum , and of all the smaller articles discovered in each stage of the work . When the excavation is com pleted , these maps will exhibit every detail in the construction and environment of each city as definitely as in our modern way those of any town of the present day are represented . Remarkable remains are left in situ , and the substrata determined in their places by tunnels . Such squares as show no particular features are filled in as soon as their contents have been determined . Few scenes are more picturesque than that of the crowd of busy fellahin in the trenches , the brown-skinned men in many-colored turbans , and ragged , often curiously patched garments , forming bright spots against the light grayish soil . The slender girls , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their heads , are clad in a short - skirted garment of a dark blue serge , often embellished with fanciful embroidery , barefoot , and decked with heavy brass anklets and armlets of varying patterns , and with many finger-rings on both hands . Their white veils are thrown backwards , so as to drape the back of the neck and shoulders . Our workers differ from the peasants in many other parts of Palestine in that they arc not tattooed . As spectators on the bank above the trench , groups of the wilder Bedouin of the neighboring desert are often to be seen , the men black-faced , draped in their long camel's-hair abbe ; the women , disfigured with great nose-ring and ear-rings . These children of the desert look with awe on the piles of potsherds carefully gathered on the banks , for , as one of them told his fellows : " These English are magicians . They change the gold into potsherds , and set the fellahin to dig them out ; then they carry them away and change them hack into gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the time allowed by the Turkish government is limited . The recent outbreak of cholera in southern Palestine has led to the suspension of the work , but Mr. Macalister hopes to be able to resume operations as soon as the rainy season is - over . He wishes to be able to employ double the number of workers , in order to make up for lost time , but at present the resources of the Palestine Exploration Fund do not permit this .
