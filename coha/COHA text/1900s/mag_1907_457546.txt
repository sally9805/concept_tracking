OP all great prophecies ever made to a credulous world , the most futile and woful was uttered toward the end of the eighteenth century by Aurelio Bertola . Having visited many countries , in various capacities ,  --  at times a monk , at times a soldier , at times a man of letters and " philosopher , " ? fl it t ing at t Imes between the lecture-rooms of two renowned universities , but always an optimistic phrase-maker , he , first of all men , published what he called , A Philosophy of history , and , as the culmination of his work , summed up the condition of humanity on this wise : The political system of Europe has virtually arrived at perfection . An equilibrium has been attained which henceforth preserves peo-ples from subjugation . Few reforms are now needed and these will be accomplished peaceably . Europe has no need to fear a revolution .

The world at large , which loves those who prophesy smooth things , took this utterance of Bertola complacently . To the warning of a very different tenor , given by Lord Chesterfield , it gave no heed . Most of all was this optimistic pro . pheey enjoyed by Italians ; for , of all great peoples , they had most reason to long for a future better than their past . During more than a thousand years Italy had been trodden by foreign rulers and soldiers , ? Germans , Saracens , Frenchmen , and Spaniards . She land bee !

Their wain reliance was apparently upon such helpers as St. Januarius at Naples , the Bambino at Rome , St. Anthony and his pigs at Padua , Buddha ? transformed into a Christian saint ? at Palermo , and ten thousand fetiches besides . Faith in tinything worth believing was mainly gone . The mediaeval city liberties had long been a vague remembrance . The utterances of Dante and Michael Angelo were , to the vast mass , as if they had never been . ' ' Their lay rulers were , mainly , frivolous and sensual , their priestly rulers mostly bigoted and cruel , their nobility given to futilities , their people groveling below thew ,  --  ignorant beyond belief . But , shortly after 13e ? tola wrote , the It'renell Revolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and , in 1706 , came an apostle front whom Italians expected much :  - -  Bonaparte ,  - -  an Italian who never spoke French until out of his boyhood ; and , knowing this , Italy saw some reason for believing in him . Bringing his army over the Alps , he promised to the Italian people an end of the miseries which had been accumulating since Ihe destruction of their municipal liberties , more than two hundred and fifty years before . Ile pledged to them the fulfillment of their wildest dreams , ? liberty , fraternity , prosperity , glory . Some of these promises he redeemed , for he deleted materialthan it had ever yet paid , was better than any it had ever known before . He reduced some fifteen petty despotisms to three , east out Bourbon , Papal , and Hapsburg administration , gave better laws , seared off Jesuits , discouraged monks , shot bandits , restored vigor to states which had seemed mere carcasses , and , best of all , gave an impulse to the idea of Italy as a nation . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he had dealt , was left the most abject and distraught . Liberty he had never given them ; he had played with Italian rights as suited his interest or fancy : lutd distributed the whole Italian territory as his private estate ; had , more than once , thrown its liberties to the worst enemies Italians had ever known . While affecting veneration for the Republic of Venice and admiration for the men who represented it , he had tossed it over to Austria as a mere bagatelle , at the Treaty of Campo Formio , just ten years after Bertola 's prophecy . He had carved out of Italian territories a kingdom for himself , with principalities and dukedoms for his family , his satraps , and his courtiers , much as any ordinary brigand might have distributed the plunder of a petty village . Works of art which were to Italians the proudest trophies of their past , he had sent to the contemptible Directory , at Paris . He had left the bones of Italian youth scattered 292 The Statesmanship of Calvin. on hundreds of battlefields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , when , after his treachery in Italy , his infamy in Spain , and his folly in Russia , his throne tottered and fell , the Italians began listening to the Hapsburgs and Bourbons , and the race of princelings who returned in their train after the Peace of Vienna . In the anxiety of these old enslavers to recover Italian territory , their pledges were as splendid as any Napoleon had made ; and especially alluring were their promises of liberties , constitutions , and reasonable government . But they , too , as soon as they were established , forgot all these fine pretenses , and the old despot-. ism of the days before the French Revolution settled down upon the country more heavily than ever . Throughout the whole peninsula the influence of Austria now became supreme . The highest conceptions then applied to Italian development were those of the Austrian Emperor Francis , typical of which was his announcement to sundry delegates of the University of Padua , that he required of them not enlightened scholars but obedient subjects . Typical of his practice was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diet of his Italian prisoners and to make them feel every day ? more and more  --  the bitter results of their patriotism . Acting through him was Metternich , the great apostle of reaction , whose contempt for Italian independence was expressed in his famous utterance , " Italy is simply a geographical expression . " Back of both was the Holy Alliance ,  - -  -  especially Russia and Austria . Rotnanoffs , Hapsburgs , and , for a time , Holtenzollerns , united in the effort to quench instantly in Italy every spark of freedom , every beginning of constitutional government , ? the Bourbons , in France , Spain , and Naples , applauding and helping them . At the northern extremity of the peninsula , in Lombardy and Venice , Austria had established a kingdom peculiarly her own ; honest in at way , but brutally stupid . All traces of earlier independence and liberties were uprooted . The reforms of Napoleon were , as far as possible , brought to naught , and from Milan , especially , radiated the new gospel of Hapsburg despotism ; its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole army of place-holders and pelfseeke ? s . Adjoining this territory on the northwest was the realm of the House of Savoy , to which had been recently attached the Republic of Genoa . Everything like constitutional liberty was blotted out from this territory also . As regards education , the Church , and especially the Jesuits , were given complete control ; but in one thing this Piedmontese kingdom was vastly superior to any other part of Italy : it had a peasantry , hardworking , honest , and conscientious ; a nobility , which , though often narrow-minded and even bigoted , was conscientious and patriotic ; a monarchy differing in its whole spirit from that of the Hapsburgs and Bourbons ; for , though the royal house had been , and , indeed , remained for some years after its restoration by the Treaty of Vienna , bigoted and despotic , it was straightforward and truthful , and , therefore , was respected by its subjects as Bourbons and Hapsburgs lad not been for ages . ' Going southward , the next main division was Tuscany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hapsburg , ? but this branch the best in all Hapsburg history . Its people were hard-working and generally contented ; its beauty , its fertility , and the glories of the arts there developed had made it , for several generations , the ' oust attractive part of the peninsula . Its rulers , indeed , resisted everything like constitutional government , but they devoted themselves to the welfare of their subjects paternally . Neighboring Tuscany were a number of small states , like Parma , Lucca , and Modena , governed by petty despots , as a rule Austrian By birth or education , and among these , worst of all , the Duke of Modena , Francis IV . Even in that bad age he was despised and ablIcrred for his cruel cunning . No blacker stain rests upon the history of any modern man than his treacherous murder of Ciro knot ti and the patriots who had trusted in the ducal promises . Next southward , among the main divisions , came the States of the Church , ruled from the early years of the nineleenth century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed , Pius VII , beautiful in character and ennobled by adversity ; others , like Pius VIII and Gregory XVI , narrow and intolerant . As to moral and religious traits they were , indeed , forced by the spirit of their time far above the level of such pontiffs as Sixtus IV and Alexander VI , but as to ability they were infinitely below such as Sixtus V , and Benedict XIV , and Leo XIII . None of them were strong enough to make headway against the political absurdities that had been so long developing throughout their dominions . To each and all of them anything like constitutional government was unthinkable . None knew any way of governing save by despotism , ; old just as little could any one of them think of conceding any effective part in administration to laymen . All rule must be entrusted to priests , ? and these , the Monsignori , ? mostly young ceclesias tics , who had won their way by family connection , or old ecclesiastics , cynical and sluggish ; some , indeed , well intentioned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they ruled governments as degrading as any that modern civilization has known , ? save , possibly , those to be seen in our own day in some of our American municipalities . To the whole Napoleonic tradition of public works they were , as a rule , invincibly opposed . When railways came , these functionaries , from the Pope downward , mainly abhorred them : for they saw but too well what Buckle afterward stated , that better systems of internal communication bring in new ideas . So bad was their government , its all its practical details , that even Austria remonstrated , and even Metternich complained , " The Papal Government can not govern . " Last of all came , at the southern end of the peninsula , the Kingdom of Naples , or , as it was known after the Peace of Vienna , the Kingdom of the Two Sicilics . In no part of Europe was the whole life of the people so degraded . The Roman states were possibly more wretchedly administered , but the popes who ruled them had been , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so the Bourbons who ruled at Naples . Throughout their entire dominion crime was rampant and murder almost as easy and carelessly treated as it is to-day in many of the states of our American Republic . The ignorance of the country was beyond that of any other which called itself civilized , save Russia . The court was the lowest , as regarded morality , in Europe ; the palace , under the lead of the Hapsburg Queen Mary Caroline , hardly better than a brothel ; the vileness of the Neapolitan populace proverbial . The same city mobs which had committed every sort of cruelty , a few years before , in the name of liberty , had , at the return of the Bourbons , with the connivance of the Queen and under the lead of the Cardinal Archbishop RAF ) , committed even worse crimes in the name of religion . Noble and thoughtful men , here and there in Naples , as in every part of Italy , strove to better this condition of things , but , by doing so , immediately fell under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and were fortunate if they escaped imprisonment or even death ; on the other hand , spendthrifts and rakes , being considered not likely to conspire against the government , received all honors . The Neapolitan Bourbons also , like the popes , discouraged all public improvements of a sort likely to promote the circulation of ideas ; and , several years after the middle of the nineteenth century , when Great Britain and Northern Europe generally were already enjoying extensive railway systems , there was hardly a mile of railway in the whole peninsula south of Genoa . ' To maintain this state of things , popular education was , throughout Italy , systematically discouraged . In Naples and Rome there was virtually no provision for the education of the people at large , trod even in Turin , the capital of the most enlightened of all tile-Italian states , Piedmont , there were , as late as 1846 , only fifteen hundred children in the public schools , hi which to-day there are over thirty thousand . How dense popular ignorance thus became may be judged from an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ careful map giving the percentages of popular education in all parts of Italy . In the most enlightened regions the number of those who could neither read nor write was from forty to fifty per cent , but , in the greater portion of the country the number of illiterates far exceeded this , until , in the States of the Pope , it reached from seventy-five to eighty-five per cent , and , in nearly the whole of Naples and Sicily , above eighty-five per cent . Such was the intellectual condition of the people after they had been cared for by the Church during nearly two thousand years . ' The higher education had been reduced by the same influences as nearly to nothing as public opinion would permit . The utterance of Kaiser Franz to the Pavia professors was carried out to the letter . The Jesuits , who had been expelled by Clement XIV , and by various sovereigns of Europe , half a century before , were , in 1816 , readmitted by Pius VII , and speedily secured control of higher schools and universities . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They had , indeed , been interfered with by the Church , at former periods , in various ways , notably in the days when Vesalius , shielded by Venice , taught anatomy at Padua , and Galileo tried to teach astronomy and physics at Pisa and Florence , Under control of local governments , not especially in fear of the Church or of revolution , there was than some liberty . But 1111 higher teaching was now more and more al . loyed with Jesuitism and directed by the bishops and the Vatican , Sundry studies ? Latin , mathematics , scraps of Greek , a little rhetoric , and concoctions of a suit- able philosophy -- -were taught with skill . Manners also were attended to : as late IS 1883 , an Italian marquis at Milan informed the present writer that he sent his sons to the Jesuits " because they teach : t young man how to enter a room . " But studies which taught men to think , and , above all , history , political economy , and the like , were reduced to nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was absurdly and comically distorted to meet the needs of theology and cedesinst icism . Research in science , in spite of the gold achievements in this field by Italians , was more and more discouraged , and the reading of Dante and other great writers who might suggest ideas of Italian nationality , was , in many places , forbidden . In the Eingdoln of Naples all this was al the worst . The university continued In exist and strong men occasionally a rose in it , but , as a rule , its best professors were humiliated , and finally , for utterances which , in these days , would be ! bought harmless , imprisoned or set at work in the chain-gang . To keep out the higher thought and scholarship , there was sued a Neapolitan edition of the Roman index . In Tuscany it was better ; for in that slate lingered traditions of culture which could not be put down by papal fulminations or even by Austrian armies . In the Papal States the repression of thought was carried out logically . At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the dangers of research or publication of thought were warded off most carefully : any book , before it could be printed , must run the gauntlet of no less than seven censorships ; ' ? it must have the approval , first , of the literary censor , secondly , of the ecclesiastical censor , thirdly , of time political censor , fourthly , of the Inquisition , fifthly , of the archbishop , sixthly , of the police , and , seventhly , a second verification by the Inquisition . Rome , too , as the spiritual centre of Italy and of the world , continued to issue the Inde , e , which forbade the reading of nearly every book which represented any triumph of modern thought , and among them those of Galileo , supporting the movement of the earth around the sun , and of Grot his , supporting arbitration . Even as late as the latter half of the eighteenth century , when Beccaria , a deeply religious churchman , wrote his great work , On Crimes and Punishments , reasonable and mill to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . and penalty , that , too , was placed upon the Index of books forbidden to Christians , and to this decision infallibility was guaranteed by a Bull signed by a reigning pontiff . As regarded the Italian people at large , most things which reminded them of anything higher than futilities seemed forbidden . Typical was the fact that when the opera " ITuritani was given , the word " loyalty " was substituted for the word " liberty , " and a singer who happened to forget tins was imprisoned . The word " Italy " was as much hated as the word " liberty , " and school children were at times punished for using it . Nor was this all . The action of the various governments Was not merely negative but positive . Patriotism and even the principles of morality underlying it were to be extirpated . For this purpose there were prepared political catechisms , and these were forced upon the schools in the name of religion . One of these , issued from Milan , in 1834 , by the Austrian government , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things like the following : ? " Question : flow should subjects behave toward their sovereign ? " " Answer : Subjects should behave like faithful slaves ( servi ) toward their master . " " Question : Why should subjects behave like slaves ( semi ) ? " " Answer : Because the sovereign is their master and has as much power over their possessions as over their lives . " " Question : How does God punish soldiers who forsake their lawful sovereign ? " " Answer : By sickness , want and eternal damnation . " ' Most famous of all these catechisms was that prepared by Monaldo Leopardi , ? father of the famous Liberal who afterward wrought so powerfully for free thought in Italy . This catechism was enforced especially in the Kingdom of Naples , being republished by Archbishop Alm() of Sorrento , the tutor chosen by King Ferdinand II for his son Francis II , better known as " King Bomba . " The Neapolitan edition was entitled , A Philosophical Catechism directed to Princes , Bishops , Magistrates , Teachers of Youth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the most precious monuments of the counter-revolutionary reaction . Its main effort was nothing less than an attempt to root out from the mind of a whole people all that the modern world knows as patriotism , right , justice , and civic morality . The first chapter is entitled , " Philosophy , " and , after a diatribe against modern philosophers in general , it winds up with the following touching question by " The Disciple : " " Do all such persons wear beards and moustaches ? " to which " The Master " answers that , while wearing beard and moustache is not necessarily evil , it is to be regarded with suspicion . Tito third chapter is entitled , " Liberty . " The first part of the dialogue runs as follows : ? " Disciple : Is it true that all men are born free ? " " Master : It is not true , and this lie re/ Soo Probya , Italy , and P. X. Krona , in the Weltgeschichte in Karaderbildern , as above . garding liberty is only one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to seduce people and upset the world . " The fifth chapter is devoted to " The Rights of Man , " and in it occurs the fol-lowing : " Disciple : Is it true that the supreme power resides in the people ? " " Master : It is not true . It would be absurd to affirm that by the disposition of Nature the people can control or modt crate themselves . " The disciple then asks : " May it not be , as the liberal philosophers say , that the sovereignty resides in the people but may be exercised through their represen-tatives ? " The master shows that this idea is utterly delusive , that the people can not delegate a power which they have not . Chapter seven treats of the constitution , and , in its defiance of political morality , is , perhaps , the boldest in the book . It is clear that , in some of the answers to the questions of the disciple , the archbishop was not unmindful of the famous perjuries of various kings of Naples , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitutions and then openly violating them . During the dialogue occur the following questions and answers : ? " Disciple : Can the people establish the fundamental laws of the State ? " " Master : They can not , because the constitution and fundamental laws of a state are a limitation of sovereignly , and sovereignty can not receive any bounds or measures except from itself . " " Disciple : But , if the people , in the net of choosing the sovereign , have imposed upon him conditions and agreements , are not these conditions and agreements the constitution and fundamental law of the State ? " " Master : They are not so , because the people , which was made for submission 101d not for command , can not impose any law upon that sovereignty , which receives its power not from the people but from God . " " Disciple : Is not a prince , who , in assuming the sovereignty of a state , has accepted and sanctioned a constitution or fundamental laws of that state and has promised and sworn to observe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that constitution and that law ? " " Master : He is obliged to observe them in so far as they do not infringe the foundations of sovereignty , and in so far as they are not opposed to the universal and of the state . " " Disciple : Who , then , is to judge when a constitution infringes on the rights of the sovereignty or injures the people ? " " Master : The sovereign has to judge , because in him exists the supreme power ( stablished by God in the state . " Chapter eight is devoted to " Government , " and begins as follows : ? " Disciple : What is the best of all governments for a state ? " " aster : The best government for any slate is that under which it is at the present moment legitimately ruled . " " Disciple : But , considering things in the abstract , what is the best of all governments ? " " Master : Hereditary monarchy , that is to say , that in which the sovereignty resides in the monarch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chapter nine is devoted to " Legitilaacy , " but , though it is , in some respects , the most subtle of the book , it is one of the most inconclusive . The archbishop evidently labors under difficulties . In view of the fact that the Church had sanehled the usurpation of Napoleon in France , against the Bourbons , and of other rulers of the Napoleonic period , elsewhere , against the old ruling houses , nothing was possible here save to raise a cloud and escape in it . But the charge of obscurity can not be brought against the tenth chapter , which is entitled " Revolution . " The archbishop adopts a view as clear as the day and shows the courage of his convictions . Being asked by the disciple whether the people have not the right to resist , " when the prince loads his subjects with enormous taxes and wastes the treasure of the state , " the master answers : " The people have not the right to judge regarding the needs and expenses of the monarchy ; the Holy Spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , ' Pay tribute , ' but does not declare to the people , ' Examine the accounts of the king . ' " After arguments in this strain through thirteen chapters , the disciple says , " Then , according to your judgment , for the good of a state it would be well to favor ignorance rather than education ? " to which the master , after various platitudes , answers as follows : ? " I have already said to you that it is necessary to follow a middle course For servants and ploughmen , a proper moderation consists in knowing the catechism and prayers to be said aloud , and nothing more in other classes , moderation consists in knowing how to read , write and cast accounts a little , and nothing more ; for other classes , moderation consists in studying that which regards the proper profession of each , " etc . Reading this , one ceases to wonder that the official map , issued shortly after tins system had ended , showed that , throughout the whole extent of the combined kingdom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to read or write was over eighty-five in every hundred . Later occurs an especially curious question : ? " Disciple : ' Fell me , do you believe that the newly invented savings banks are the carnal brothers of general instruction , and that philosophy is preparing , by means of them , to accomplish the diffusion of property and goods ? " " Master : Although few suspect it as yet , I sin absolutely certain of it . " The fourteenth chapter is entitled " Our Country , " and it reveals a desperate effort to root out from the Italian mind everything like patriotism . The master tells his disciple that , if similar degrees of the thermometer make 298 The Maimnanship of Cavour men fellow-citizens , then the Romans and the Tartars are of the same country ; that , as to similarity of language , the people at the two ends of Italy hardly understand one another , and that , if similarity of appellation gives fellow-citizenship , and all those are fellow-citizens who are called Italians ,  - -  -  " Then , because your name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bartholotnews throughout the world . " The book is at times witty and shrewd , and has in it , here and there , suggestions which look like wisdom . There is in it much historical allusion , but , of course , as in most cases where ecclesiastics write for the supposed benefit of religion , the author manipulates history to suit his necessities . As to Italian independence , he insists that in three quarters of Italy , Italian independence is already established , and that those who deny it are , to use his own words , " simpletons who are looking round for their hats when their hats are upon their heads . " Ile defends the rights of Austria in Lombardy and Venice as sacrosanct , and winds up by declaring that the " independence of Italy . . . is simply a cabalistic word , used by thieves and seen nd rels . " In this work culminated an effort long and earnest . To its earlier stage belongs the History of Franes for the I:se of Youth , with maps ? .1 . J1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bourbons , in 1820 , by the Jesuit Father Loriquet . Father Loriquet 's effort had been simply to efface all knowledge of the Napoleonic Empire from the French mind , and his history , therefore , made Louis XVII the immediate successor of Louis XVI , and Louis XVIII the immediate successor of Louis XVII , virtually leaving out Napoleon as ruler , mentioning him as little as possible and always under the name " Bonaparte . " Exquisitely na ? ve , also , was this Jesuit historian 's attempt to discredit " Bonaparte " by falsified history . Perhaps of all the innumerable Jesuit attempts to manufacture history to suit ecclesiastical purposes , the most comical was the sc . count given by Father Loriquet of the Battle of Waterloo . In the crisis of the battle , which the world knows by heart , he represents the Old Guard as a mass of madmen , firing upon one another while the British look upon them with horror . The final effort of Archbishop Apuzzo to save the . Neapolitan Bourbons turned out to be as futile as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Each book became a laughing-stock and was suppressed as far as possible by the reactionary governments in whose supposed interest it was written .

The Bourbon king , Ferdinand I , was finally forced to grant a constitution , and this he again and again swore to maintain .

Especially dramatic was his oath in the chapel of his palace , when , with tears in his eyes , he , in the presence of a great assembly , swore to maintain the constitution and invoiced the curse of Heaven upon his head if his oath should be broken . The Holy Alliance took up the matter at once , and the three sovereigns of Austria , Prussia , and Russia wrote letters to King Ferdinand , identical in character , pointing out his duty to violate this oath .

Austria now pursued at Turin the same policy as at Naples . She sent an army which supported Charles Felix in annulling the constitution , in restoring absolutism , in sending constitutionalists to dungeons and scaffolds . These examples served as powerful deterrents to every open effort for liberty , and there now came ten years of slumber , with dreams more feverish than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was seen and felt The poem referred to is Milton 's sonnet " On the Late Massacre in Piedmont , " beginning with the words : " hones Lie xcntio , ud on the Alpluo unouendns cold . " an active and even poisonous ferment of liberty . An early symptom of this was the secret society of the Coal Burners : the Carbonari . With ceremonies somewhat resembling those of Masonry and with fanatical vows against tyranny , this society spread throughout all the Italian-speaking peoples , and embraced vast numbers of devotees of freedom , from the highest classes to the lowest . Even Louis Bonaparte , who afterward became Napoleon III , was , in his youth , one of those who swore fidelity to it . Its fanaticism knew no limit ; outrages and assassinations were everywhere , and this provoked successive rulers at Naples and elsewhere to oppose it with every sort of cruelty . Torture was freely used to detect it , and , in the Austro-Italian dominions , any connection with it was punished by death . Every expedient was tried , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with vows and secret ceremonies equally fanatical , was created to ferret it out and fight it . The natural result followed . Absolutism pointed to these societies as its justiliealion , and by their excesses general European public opinion was first made cool toward Italian liberty and , finally , hies tile . These associations rapidly deteriorated and , in various regions , became a banditti , glorying in outrage and murder , as do the gangs " in some of our great American cities of to-day . Typical was one of these bands ? the Deeisi --  whose leader , an unfrocked priest , being brought to trial and asked how many persons he had himself murdered , answered , " Who knows ! Sixty or seventy , perhaps . " ' Supported by the public opinion thus caused , Austria and her subordinate // despotisms went further . Great numbers oft houghtful and serious men were seized and condemned , among them the heads of some of the most eminent Italian families at Milan , who were arrested and dragged to Austrian dungeons or scaffolds . Notable was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soul , known widely and favorably as a man of letters . Arrested for a petty infraction of rules , nl Venice , he was kept , for nearly twenty years , in an Austrian dungeon , during part of the time chained to a fellow-prisoner who was suffering from a repulsive disease . His final account of his prison life , entitled My Prisons , with his simple recitals of sufferings and consolations , ran through Christendom , touching all hearts and inflaming all with a hatred of Austrian tyranny . Throughout Italy matters grew worse and worse , until even the most determined reactionaries , largely responsible by their theories or their acts for this state of things , found it necessary to express their horror and to throw blame on others . Chateaubriand , committed 11101/01 he was to Bourbon despotism and the Church ; Metternich , yet more devoted to Hapsburg despotism and reaction ; and even Joseph de Maistre , hating liberty and devoted to the most extreme theories of papal authority , denoill teed governments responsible for this cruelty and folly . ' And yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forebodings as was the surface of society in the Ameri- can Republic in 18 ( 30 , when drifting toward the abyss of Civil War which swallowed nearly a million of the best lives our country had to give . Italy at large was immoral , superstitious , and happy . From the whole world pleasure-seekers were attracted by its " fatal gift of beauty , " scholars by its monuments of former greatness , devotees by its poops and ceremonies at the capital of Christendom . But beneath this surface the political disease grew more and more virulent . In 1830 broke out the second stage of revolution in France , and in three days the French Bourbon monarchy was lost forever . Revolutions rapidly followed , in Italy . The murderer , Duke Francis IV , was driven out of Modems ; AIaria Louisa , the worthless widow of Napoleon , fled from her Duchy of Parma ; a provisional government declared the Pope 's temporal power ended in Bologna ; rebellion was seething in Naples ; and , most ominous of all , Charles Albert , with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Again came intervention by Austria . Every worthy effort for freedom was suppressed , every worthless sovereigns was replaced ; constitutionalists were again sent to dungeons and scaffolds . More than this , France , under pretext of jealousy of Austria , sent troops to Ancona , in the Papal States , and thus began a policy of French intervention to match Austrian intervention ,  --  the policy of supplying " bayonets for the popes to sit upon . " Beyond supplying this doubtful seat , the powers could really do nothing . Austria and France , whatever their cruelties and absurdities might be , had at least developed and observed decent rules in ordinary administration . Though they hanged lovers of liberty , they did not systematically foster sloth , poverty , and knavery ; but the various governments throughout Italy , with the exception of those in Piedmont and Tuscany , seemed utterly given over to vicious administration , and among the worst , in this respect , was the Papal Kingdom . Under all save a few of the greatest popes it had been , and continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important offices were filled by cardinals and Monsignori , and , while a few of these were statesmen , the vast majority were sluggish reactionaries . Against this state of things , as leading to revolution , Austria and France protested again and again ; but all to no purpose ; the Vatican would go on after the old , bad way , and , finally , it received its reward . Still another government which gave constant trouble to the great powers banded against constitutional freedom , was Piedmont . Its new king , Charles Albert , was , indeed , strongly religious and inclined to the old ways , but more and more it was seen that he hated foreign intervention and that , to put an end to it , he might accept the aid of constitutionalists ; but Austrian pressure was put upon him and , to all appearance , his patriotism ended . So began a new period of eighteen years , hardly less sluggish than the old , its hero Alazzini . Be was one of the noblest of human beings . Hardly out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cogent attack against the oppressors of his country . Imprisoned in the fortress of Savona , he pondered over the great problem even more deeply , and , on his release , wrote a letter to King Charles Albert , urging him to head the movement for independence and liberty . ' This letter became a vast force in arousing a national spirit . Private letters and published articles rapidly followed from his pen , each a powerful blow at tyranny . In 1831 he created a new weapon . Ile had entered fully into the work of the Carbona ? i , had risked his life with them again and again , but having now ceased to believe in their system he founded the society of " Young Italy . " his activity seemed preternatural. lie appeared to be in all parts of Europe at once , and did his work under every sort of disguise and stratagem . Ills power overthe Italian youth was amazing : obedient to his call they rose in cities , villages , regiments , everywhere , ? going to death joyfully . From London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he inspired every kind of Italian conspiracy and revolt ; but gradually it dawned upon him , as upon thinking friends of Italy everywhere , that these costly sacrifices of the most precious lives were not adequately repaid . From a practical point of view they availed little . his right to sit in his English retreat and send the flower of the Italian youth to be shot or hanged began to be widely questioned . His ideal won an Italian republic , but there were so few republicans ! Republican government to Linn meant . freedom , but even the simplest students of history could remember that the old Roman republic , and every one of the mediaeval Italian republics , had resulted in the tyranny of illiterate mobs , always followed by the tyranny of single despots as a lesser evil . Alen had learned the truth that a single despot con be made in some degree responsible to public opinion , but that a mob can not , The uprisings inspired by Mazzini , not . ably that of the Bandiera brothers , were mercilessly trodden down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tuscany tried to give moderate freedom of the press , but Austria intervened and forced the Grand Duke to appoint min. isters who ended it . Yet forces were at work , more power ful by far than Austria and the I loly Hance . Political activity being checked , genius and talent laid long been mainly directed to literature , and the spectacle of Italy in the hands of her oppressors made this literature patriotic . There had eotne the poetry of Alfieri , Niceolini , Bassett ! . and Giusti ; the philosophy of Itosmini ; the prison reminiscences of Silvio Pellieo : I rattromances of D'Azegl io , Glierazzi , : I II ( I , above 141 , the Promessi Spo.4 of Alanzoni , the most perfect historical novel ever written . These were not all revolutionary by intention ; some , like the writings of Pettier ) and Manzoni , were deeply snil pathetically religious , even inculcating submission to wrong ; but all served to create Italian ideals , to stimulate Italian patriotism , and to give more and more life Io the idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  - -   - -  the idea of Italy as a nation . The patriotic thought , thus gradually evolved as a vast elemental force , was 1141W brought . to bear upon events by three great books . First of these was the . floral and Civil Primacy of the Italians , by Vincenzo tiioberti . This was a glorification of Italy a : : a nation , displaying eloquently her greatness in the past and the possibility of her greatness in the future , and urging a confederation of the existing Italian slides , with the Pope as perpetual president . Though in three large volumes , it was read and pondered by every thinking Italian , man or woman . Closely following this was a treatise of a very different sort , by Cesare Ilalbo , ? . alitled The hopes of Italy . Though voile more than a pamphlet , and though it gave up the idea of an Italian kingdom as chimerical , it pictured constitutional liberty and Italian independence with as dearness and strength which brought . conviction to all patriotic hearts . The third of these works was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Latest Cases in the Romagna . Of all the three writers , d ' Azeglio was the most fascinating as a personality : a genius in sealpture , in poetry , and in statesmanship , who had traveled quietly through various governments of Italy and who re-pried what he saw with amazing lucidity : sal force . The latest cruelties of the papal subordinates in suppressing the upriAings in the Romagna had aroused him , and he made the world see and under-:mind them . His work was not at all declamatory or hysterical ; perhaps its most striking feature was its evidence of self-roust raint ; it was plain , simple , straightforward , and clear as crystal , but with as quiet and restrained eloquence which at times carried all before it . Other writers of genius or talent fob lowed these , ? among them , Durand ? , Capponi , and their compeers , ? each aiding to undermine the whole existing regime . The votaries of science also wrought for the same ideals . The Science Congress at Genoa , in 1846 , inevitably discussed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress at Casale , in 1847 , took the some direction , and to it came a letter from King Charles Albert , which set all hearts throbbing with patriotic emotion . For it contained these words : " If Providence sends us a war for Italian independence , I will mount my horse with my sons and will place myself at the head of my army . . . . What a glorious day will be that in which we can raise the cry of war for the Independence of Italy ! " Meantime , in 1846 , au event of vast importance had occurred . There had come to the papal throne Pius IX . His nature was deeply religious , kindly , given to charitable effort , and his aversion to cruelty was , doubtless , a main cause of his desire to break away from the methods of his predecessors . His manner was most winning and he held wonderful sway over devout imaginations , for , in great religious functions and ceremonies he was supremely impressive , and his blessing , chanted forth from the balcony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bestowing it , appealed to the deepest feelings even of those who differed most from him . But , as a sovereign , he was the last of men to carry out Gioberti 's great programme , ? to preside over an Italian confederation , or , indeed , to govern his own states . As a statesman he failed utterly ,  - -  beaten , in all attempts at reform , by the Monsignori , thwarted in all his good intentions by Jesuits and other intriguers , more or less religious . The times called for a Ifildebrand , or an Innocent III , or a Sixtus V , and , instead of any one of these , there had come this shrewd , kindly , handsome bishop , vacillating , fitful , superstitious , 304 The Statemtunohip of ' ( favour dreaded most by those who loved him best . At first lie mildly opposed Austria and appointed a quasi-constitutional ministry , but he could not rise above the old tradition , and in this new ministry there was no layman . In January , 1848 , a new constitutional movement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Ferdinand H granted a constitution . This movement extended rapidly to all parts of Europe . The Grand Duke of Tuscany promised a constitution , the Pope showed an intention to grant reforms , and even called a new ministry in which , for a wonder , there were three laymen . An occurrence at one of the early meetings of this ministry threw a curious light on the character of Pope Pius . Presiding over this body , his eye happened to light upon the comet then appearing in the Roman sky . Rushing to the window and opening it , he fell on his knees and called on his ministers among them such men as Mezzof anti and Marco Minghetti ? to kneel also and to implore the Almighty to turn away the calamities of which the comet was the forerunner . The pontiff might well be pardoned this stn perstition , for everywhere throughout Europe were signs of coining political catastrophes . Under popular pressure various reforms were granted in Piedmont , among them more liberty to the press , ? a condition of things under whirls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose . ' For Pope Pins 's fear of the comet , use the Deutsche Rundschau , August , 1893 , p. 210 , eiting Minghetti 's " Mci Rieordi . " The statement regarding his dramatic power in the great ceremonies at St. Peter 's is based upon the personal recollections of the present writer . And now , for the first time , Europe hears of Camillo Cavour . While as writer in newspapers and reviews he had long been known and prized by many statesmen and economists in Italy , and by a few thinkers in England and France , Europe and the people at large in Italy as yet knew him not . But it happened that , just as this time , Genoa , true to its old republican traditions , though incorporated into the Kingdom of Piedmont , began to be restive and to demand loudly various reforms of a petty sort , ? among these , the banishment of the Jesuits and the creation of a national guard . This subject being brought up for discussion in a meeting of publicists and journalists , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Piedmont and of Italy into a single sentence . Casting aside all petty demands for changes in detail , he insists that the king be asked " to transfer the discussion from the perilous arena of irregular commotions , to the arena of legal , pacific , solemn deliberation . " The audience and the country , thinking upon this utterance , soon recognized its demand for a constitution , with a free parliament , as wholly to the purpose , ? as the solution of the first great Italian problem , ? and during the great discussions which followed in the press , Cavour led triumphantly . His advice was at last followed , and , on Winn ary 7 , 1848 , King Charles Albert pro mised a constitution which , at few days later , took shape in a royal statute , the " Statuto . " Thus began a great new epoch in which Cavour was to be the leader , and , to this day , the anniversary of this grant is celebrated throughout Italy as the date most significant for her Independence , Unity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
