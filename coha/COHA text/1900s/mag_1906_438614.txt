SOME five years before I was born ? my mother has often told me the story ? there ca me to our country home , one Sunday morning , a black woman of unmixed Hood . She was dressed in her Sunday clothes : homespun dress , neat white the traditional handkerchief tied around her head , concealing the hair , nail stout shoes . There was a general air of cleanness about her . Her face was good and pleasant to look at ; but she seemed weak , not to say feeble , and asked permission to sit down at once . She was evidently far advanced in that state in which " women love to be who love their loots : " only , poor thing , she had no lord , except the Allseeing One above . My mother had seen her before , and knew her . I ler mane was Elsie . She belonged to a neighbor of ours some three miles up the creek , ? a kind master enough in things material , but a rough diamond , a cursing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and no white woman on his premises . Its people took their tone from him . It was a godless place . The woman , Elsie , had no kith or kin among his negroes . The hillier of her child , a turbulent fellow , had been sold to go south , and the woman was alone and half sick . She had cone to beg my mother to ask my father to buy her . " Mr. Briggs will sell me cheap , " she said , " for I ai n't mouth much in him , an ' I wo n't never be well no mo ' . " She went on to plead that she dreadedto die in that heathenish place , and to leave the expected baby to such bringing tip . She had come down to our place once or twice on Sundays to visit sonic of our people , told had seen my mother assemble the black children under the big mulberry tree , and teach them from the ! tittle and the catechism . She wanted lice baby among them . " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Clayton to buy me . I wo n't cost much , an ' I kin sew an ' do housework , Momma Sally say I kin stay in her cabin ; ant ' my baby , when he come , will be mouth money to you , for he daddy was a big , strong man . " It Was curious , my mother said , how she took it for granted that the unborn child Was to be a boy . My mother was greatly moved , and yet she could not see her way . " I am very sorry for you , Elsie , " she began , " but " ? " Oh , Miss Kate , Miss Kate , " broke in the woman . It was too much for my motlmr 's tender heart . She promised to do all she could , and Elsie departed , with the understanding that she was to come again the next Sunday . It could have but one ending , with my mother enlisted on the woman 's side . My father demurred . He had obligations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted . Ile could not buy all the women in the country who were dissatisfied with their surroundings , and so forth . But in the end , he bought Elsie . In due time a little black roly-poly of a deleted material -. ltd . I listened to this profane ditty with . t. , nbtful cars . " Stun , " said I , " I do n't : kink t ha t ' s a good song . " " Why not ? " says Sam . " Missis say loos n ' take de Lord 's name in vain , lid 's ' s all . Dann do n't Maar/ notIt'n , an ' it and putty . " This last word he pronounced , not as urn call the stuff you put in glass with , tnt in as in " put . " I could not deny that it sounded " putty , " and we kept the matter , as see did many controverted points , for future reference to my mother . I suppose that the experience of every person who has left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tries to recall it again to his memory after many years , is about the same , as regards the bigness of things . The distances seem greater , the grounds more extensive , the streams wider . Everything scents on a larger scale than the reality . By the smile trick of the human mind , the years of one 's childhood seem longer , and more in number . My imagination draws the picture of a long succession of happy summers in " that sweet and blessed country , " instead of the four brief years front the time that Sant and I were respectively four and nine years old to the period when we were eight and thirteen , or thereabout . At this time certain things happened . My father had an elder brother , my " Uncle Jack . " This brother had married in early life the daughter of a rice and cottons planter of the low country , who had died , leaving him a large estate ( as estates went in those days ) , and one son , who Was at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not married again . He lived on his plantation in winter , with no household except his servants , headed by the old mulatto " mammy " who acted as his housekeeper ; but , being a hospitable man , his roomy house was generally full of young people , mostly young men of his kin , who went down for the shooting and fishing . Sometimes , too , he would have my sister there , that her music and general loveliness might VOL. 97 ? NO. 6have it civilizing 1111111CM:a on his house-full of boisterous young blades . Uncle Jack was not like my father . lie was more a man of the World . Ile Was a tall , Clark , soldierly man , with something of a Roman nose , and a grizzled mustache , a good deal like the pictures of Colonel Ness in the old editions of Thackeray . Ile was an imperious-looking man , and , indeed , was much inclined to have his own way . I liked him , though , all the stone . Ile knew the way to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Was always jingling loose silver in his pocket . Ile had a way of tipping the servants , too , in a careless and lordly fashion , but had none of my father 's kindly friendliness of manner toward them . On the whole , however , everybody liked him , and he was always a welcome guest . his visit on this particular summer I have occasion specially to remember . It was , as I have said , when Sam was between twelve and thirteen years old , and I some five years younger . One everting , on the piazza , Uncle Jack said to my father , " Alfred , that boy Stun is a superb youngster . lie is just what I want , ? a little too young , but that 's a good fault . I can bring hint up to suit me . I want him about the house . lien is getting too old . " This sounded ominous enough ; but worse was coining , when Uncle Jack went on to propose to buy Sam , telling my father he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was relieved , however , when my father put him off with a jest , telling him he had better not make any such proposition in my mother 's presence . Uncle Jack laughed , and dropped the matter for the time . But he was a persistent man , and not accustomed to be balked , and I was uneasy . I could see his keen , dark eye resting upon the boy frequently . I could sec , too , that he was making friends with Sam , probably foreseeing that the question as to his sale would depend eventually on his own consent , as my father would never sell him against his own wish . The boy was as my uncle said , a superb fellow , well grown for his age , sound as a dollar , and a beautiful combination of strength and activity . His intelligence was unusual for a negro ; Isis temper admirable . The only trace of the slave in his fine , honest , cheerful face was a certain appealing look which is frequently to be observed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lash laid upon his ancestors by the superior race , Certainly , in his own person Sam had never had to shrink from a blow . It goes without saying that I begged my father not to sell the boy away from me . He told use that he would not ; but I have always suspected that Uncle Jack departed with some sort of understanding that possibly , later on , my own and my mother 's consent might be obtained . The story of the life of a boy of eight , or ten , or twelve years , in a quiet home in a civilized country , could not easily be made entertaining to my friend from Massachusetts , or anybody else . The fact that he lived fifty years ago , and in one of the late Confederate states , does not make bins at all the more interesting . It may be briefly said , therefore , that I was not sent to school early ; that my mother taught me the usual child 's learning in English , and a little French ; that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greek ; that my friend Ellick initiated use into the delights of ' possum and coon hunting ; and that , under the guidance of any sister , I learned to love music more and more . I waxed fond of books , and read everything in sight , whether I understood it or not , from the Rollo Books , and Sanford and Merton , and Miss Edgeworth , up to the big Shakespeare with the pictures . I even tackled Josephus and the Koran ; and reveled especially in a noble edition of the Iliad , with pictures , in outline only , of the Greek and Trojan heroes , and Helen , and Andromache , and Briseis and Chryseis . I do not wish to create the impression that there was anything extraordinarily literary about my home . It was only that I was the son of a country gentlenvm , 11 university loan , who , while not averse field sports , was fond of books and milsie. and had collected something of a library . In the changes and chances of war and reconstruction , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blessiag God 1 inherited his tastes ; and the influences of such a boyhood , simple as it was , ingrained into one 's nature , new save him in later years from becoming a mere draught ox , in the sordid straggle for food and shelter . They will build for him an inner temple into which he may retire and worship when the day 's work is done . I have always been sorry for boys growing imp , as so many of them do now , in this Southern country , without the companionship of books . Poor little devils ! they are at work , selling parrs , or behind the counters of stores , or at one thing or another , when they ought to be lying in the shade , reading the Arabian Nights , if any genuine edition of that glorious work can be found in these clays of reform and expurgation . I had grown old enough now to ride about the country alone , and was accustomed to be sent to town on my pony after the mail , or upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rides arose the only incident that I remember of that period , that would interest my friend . My road to town lay , most of it , through the pine woods ; an open , sandy , pleasant country enough . A part of it , however , perhaps half a mile , ran through the swamp which stretched on both sides of the creek of which I have spoken . It was a long causeway , or " corduroy " road , as generally called . It was a lonely , uncanny-looking place , dark even at midday with the dense growth of the swamp on either side , ? bays , a sort of swamp laurel , end other trees , with here and there a cypress . The air was heavy with the overpowering scent of the yellow jessamine and other flowers . The foliage was so thick that one could not see his horse 's length into the swamp . It was supposes ! ta be the resort of the more incorrigible class of runaway negroes , such as were advertised in the newspapers of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Run away from the subscriber , negro man Cato , " etc. ; the description following , and the advertisement headed with a woodcut of a man running , with a stick MI his shoulder and a bundle at the end or it . These were mostly harmless truants , though occasionally there might be a dangerous character among them . Alto-:tether , I did not fancy that part of my way , and generally rode through it as fast as the slippery poles would allow . On this particular afternoon I was on my wry to town , my pony picking his way over the uncertain footing , when suddenly he started , and sprang aside so suddenly as nearly to unseat me . At the so tire time a negro stepped into the road in front of me. ax your pardon , young marster , " he said : " I did n't go for to skear your horse . I jes ' wanted to ax a little favor of you . " I was reassured by this not unfriendly greeting , and look note of the man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a gingerbread color , carried a gun , and had the indescribable appearance of a hunted man . There was a negro at large at this time , who was wanted for murder , having brained another negro with an axe . His name seas I lannilaal . Sam knew him and had talked to me of him , and I had seen his description in the town paper . I took this to be the man . " Is n't your name Hannibal ? " I said . And what if it is , young marster ; you would n ' want to help ' ens ketch a poor crittur like me , would you ? " I was smitten with pity , and told him I would not . He proceeded to tell me that he had seen me before , passing , and knew who I was He said he had stopped me to ask if I would bring him a plug of tobacco as I came back , and say nothing about it ; " though I reckon they 'll git me anyhow , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told him I would bring the tobacco and not tell of it . I tried very hard to get back before the shades of evening set in ; but when I met him , at the same place , it was twilight . He was profuse in his thanks and blessings , negro fashion , and I rode home full of my secret , and feeling myself an adventurous young fellow . I kept my word with him , not even telling Sam ; but the story soon ended in tragedy . The sheriff caught him , and be was convicted and executed in the prompt manner of those days . At the gallows he was allowed to make a little speech , and , as is customary with negro criminals , he announced that his spiritual condition was satisfactory , and that he was sure the Almighty Judge " would have mercy on him . " I read this account to Sam , from the paper , telling him how I had met Hannibal . It was on the sandy bank at the old mill . " Marse Frank , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a meditative way , " you reckon God done it ? " " Did what ? " said I. " Tuk mussy on him ; ' said Sam . I said I hoped so . " Ef I 'd er been God , I 'd er done it , " said Sam . I told bins my mother had said we had best not speculate on these matters . " What do spek ' late mean ? " said Sam . I felt my inability to pursue the subject , and took refuge , as usual , in telling him we would ask my mother . " I reckon , " says Sans , still pursuing the thread of his thought , " fiat 's how come a spek'later sick a had man . " It is necessary to know that " speculator " was the common name applied to the trailers in negroes of whom I have spoken , detested by blacks , and held in small esteem by whites . Sam 's mind was evidently muddled , and the incident is only worth recording in that it illustrates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of himself with the Judge of all the earth . This impressed me at the time , and was recalled to me afterwards by a kinsman telling me he had seen in a churchyard in Aberdeen , Scotland , the following epitaph :  - -  It is hard to imagine a snore pitiful appeal to Omnipotence . I MUM . have beets some nine or fen years old when 1 met Hannibal in the swamp . The doings of the next live or three years offer little of interest . I was sent to is very excellent school in the town , and afterwards to a more advanced one , to lie prepared for the university . Thus brings site to my fifteenth year . In September of this year Uncle Jack made us the most memorable of his visits . He sent up , this lime , his carriage and horses , and it saddle horse , but no groom . Ile asked that lie might have Sam to attend his commands , and the boy accordingly was his driver in his visits about the country . Everybody liked him , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the promise of his youth . Physically and morally , there could pot have been a finer specimen of the unmixed negro race . Under my Mother 's influence helmet been confirmed by the bishop at his last visitation . I was at home at the time . Now , Sans was no saint after the order of Mrs. Stowe 's " Uncle TOM . " If he had been , I should have snitch mistrusted him . He doubtless had the failings of humanity , especially of black humanity . But there Was no malice in his transparent soul . Moreover , he could " say the Creed , the Lord 's Prayer , and the Ten Commandments , " and answer the other questions according to the rubric ; so the bishop confirmed him , along with some half-dozen others , in the parish church . These annual confirmations of the negroes always interested me ; and I remember well that , as the bishop laid Isis hands on Sam 's black head , with the beautiful words so familiar to every Churchman , I hod an uncomfortable recollection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inquiry of his Maker . I sent for the boy to maim to my room , and talked with him late into the night . One of the most delightful creation ' of the great Sir Walter is Cuthbert Headrigg , called " Cuddy . " " My teddy , " any Cuddy , " canna weel bide to be contradickit ; and adds quaintly , " and ye ken , naebody does , if they could help them-sells . " My uncle Jack was much like Lady Margaret , and , indeed , might well have been the brother of that stubborn out female cavalier . I could gather from scraps of talk that he had by no means given up his wish to own Sam . He had set his heart on him , as a man of means will sometimes take a fancy to a horse or dog . My father was reluctant , mainly on my mother 's account . The truth was , though my uncle was not aware of it , that my father needed money , perhaps to meet the expense of sending MC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was silent . She spoke to me , and I held my peace . One morning , after our early breakfast , the brothers sat on the long piazza , smoking , ? my father with his pipe , Uncle Jack with his cigar . This little difference inc their tastes , trifling lint suggestive , rats through all their ways , and marked the contrast between them no less than did the dissimilarity of physique : toy Saxon-looking father , will quiet manners and plaits and simple tastes ; his tall , dark Norman brother , with dominating ways , and liking far handsome dress and expensive luxuries . " Look at them , " said my sister . " Do n't they look like Cedric and Brian de Bois Guilbert ? " The comparison was not fair . My dear sister was a little inclined to be haughty herself , and did not like our uncle as I did . They were , however , good types , each of his class : the upcountry planter , of few slaves , small responsibilities , and easy-going life , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon his shoulders , and al- must of necessity something of a mar- ! Met . They were continuing a conversation . IV uncle was saying , " I will give you a iheck for eighteen hundred for him . " I knew now what they were talking about . The market value of a first-class negro liehI hand , at that time , in our part of the country , was , say , twelve to fifteen hundred dollars , the latter an extreme . In the Southwest , where new lands were Be-ins opened , it was much higher . I remember , at the university in 1859 , hearing a fellow student from Arkansas say that his father had paid eighteen hundred and five dollars , at an auction in Memphis , for an unusually fine negro . My father was silent for a moment . " Well , " he said at last , " if the boy will loll use he is willing to go to you , and you will give me your word to treat him kindly , and " - " I treat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his chin and his Roman nose and his gray mustache in the air . " I know , Jack , I know . You feed them , and clothe them , and all that . Ilia Kate has a feeling for this boy that you can hardly understand " ? " Alfred , " broke in my uncle , a little impatiently , " you know I never liked the way you up-country people treat your negroes . You allow your children to IllakC companions of them . You spoil them . You have no discipline , properly so called . You do n't seem to be awake to the situation . Here are these d ? d abolitionists flooding the country with their papers " ? " Oh , the devil fly away with the abolitionists , " put in my father . " Do n't let 's get upon them . I ain tired talking of them . I believe all this matter of the dissemination of New England literature among negroes has been greatly exaggerated , both as to its extent and as to the danger resulting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper about here . I do n't concern myself about it . So far as my people are concerned , I have no fear for them . I think I should be willing , by way of test , that they ' should send their best speaker down here , ? say Wendell Phillips himself ; I 'd like to see hint , anyhow . I would assemble my people out there in the grove , and he should speak to them . And when he had finished , I would say to them , ' You have all heard what this gentleman has to say . Now , if any of you want to go off with him to Yankeedoodledom , just say so , and you shall go without interruption . ' II bet you Sam against the sorriest hand on your plantation that not one of them would stir . " " You would be a fool for your pains , " said Uncle Jack ; " I would make no such proposition to my people . " " Then , " said my father , rising from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mode of government yields the better result . But here 's Sam with the horses . We 'll ride over to Colonel Elliott 's , and bring him back to dinner ; and we ' II have sonic whist and some music . " The end of it was that Uncle Jack bought Sam . I do n't think that , even with his free use of money , he would have gained the boy 's consent , if Sam had not found out , I do n't know how , that his purchase money would be of service to " AIarster . " This , with my uncle:s promise that he should see us every summer , and that he should not be sold again unless back to us , turned the scale . I am glad to remember that , having completed this transaction , my uncle prolonged his stay with us late into the fall , and seemed loath to leave us . I thought , too , that Isis manner was becoming more gentle . He made friends With Illy sister ; and I sometimes observed him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he were thinking how much better it would be if he had some feminine presence on the other side of his own hearthstone at home . Ile was beginning to show Isis age , and his mustache was growing nearly white ; through his figure was erect , and he sat his horse as much like a field marshal as ever . The Christmas holidays were drawing p deleted material Tennessee , North Carolina , and Virginia su , e ; of mixed political complexion , , : tane consorting with the llotspurs of the lower country , others , the sons of Whig fathers , and taking the color of their more conservative views , giving up slowly and will unwilling hearts their ingrained love for the Union and for the stars and stripes , hoping for peace , and willing to exhaust ; ill honorable means to avert war . There were hot debates , and an occasional fight . But all were ready to meet the issue , if it must come , without fear , and with that superb and supreme confidence in the ability of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ odds which was so striking a characteristic of the Southerner of that clay . War had to come . It came . And nineteen out of every twenty of these young sons of their fathers followed the meteor flag of the Confederacy ; and one out of every four bequeathed : 1Iy friend will give me it line here in which to pay to the memory of these men my tribute of undying love . This feeling of absolute , perhaps overweening , confidence , to which I have referred as pervading all sorts and conditions of men in the South at the outbreak of the great war , is worth a passing notice : the more as it has been made the subject of much adverse criticism . My friend will observe that I am not here discussing the question as to what substantial ground there may have been for this feeling . I am only saying that it was there , as a matter of fact , and , as she desired a picture of Southern life , I have given this as one of its noticeable features . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so marked an idiosyncrasy is not obvious ; but , as it existed , there must have been a philosophical reason for it , else why should it have been a Southern trait more than a Northern one ? I suggest that we owed it , as we did certain fortunate peculiarities of our feminine society to which I have adverted , to the institution of slavery . This made every white man more or less of an a ristocra t , there being an inferior race under him . It accustomed him to command and to be obeyed . Its tendency was to make him bold , resolute , and self-reliant , even if there was danger of its making him somewhat arrogant and overbearing . Also , the habit of command teaches one the virtue and necessity of obedience . If all this be true , it follows that the Southern man started out with some of the points of a soldier already engrafted in him , and to that extent had the advantage of his adversary . As the war advanced , this difference was , perhaps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew each other better ; and there would be no discourtesy now in presenting to our gallant friends , the enemy , the proposition that , in the spring of 1861 , both sides being entirely unacquainted with practical war , an army officered by Southern fliers would naturally have been a better fighting machine than one officered by Northern men . I make the remark with the less hesitation , that , if I remember aright , that fine soldier , General Schofield , has recently expressed something like the same opinion . In the spring of 1861 , I entered the Confederate army as a private in one of the finest regiments of infantry in the service , and served to the cud . With this little bit of history , the work which lay friend asked of me ? that I would try to give her some idea of the life of the average Southern gentleman " before the war " ? is done . I can not hope that it has given her half the pleasure that it has given me to travel again this out road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer than it is . I do n't know why this is so , unless it be that so many of the actors in the times I have been dealing with , who would not now be older than I , and some who would be younger , have passed away . I remain with the minority , a lonely old bachelor , but not a melancholy one . A man may still have his whist and his punch of winter nights , his book at all times , the church 792 Constitution-Mending and the Initiative and the Book of Common Prayer on Sundays , and , God be thanked , a few congenial spirits with whom he can quarrel in an amicable way , ? more by token that my friend from Massachusetts tells me she has no present intention of returning to that bleak Puritan region , in which , by some strange perversity in the ordering of things , she appears to have been born . Again I offer her my humble homage , and again Mr. Thackeray 's lines come into any bead , with their quaint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
