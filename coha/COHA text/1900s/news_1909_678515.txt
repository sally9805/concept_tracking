txt District Attorney Jerome startled ' the guests at the Neighborhood dinner given in his honor , last night at " Little Hungary " on the lower east side , by making what was interpreted by those who heard him as a plea for party regularity . Incidentally he announced that he had once suggested in all serlougness that Jacob H. Schiff ought to move down to the east ' side and become a leader among his coreliglonfats in that congested section of the city . Before the speechmaking began , there came an emphatic disclaimer on behalf of those who had arranged the Neighborhood dinner that it had no political significance whatever , But throughout the banquet hall there was a scattering of politicians representing both parties who were there as " neighbors . " Just after the speechmaking began Sheriff Thomas F. Foley , who is a Tammany district leader , came in and took a seat beside District Attorney Jerome at the guest table . Not far from where the District Attorney sat was Secretary of State Samuel S. Koenig , who is the Republican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a Token . Just before Mr. Jerome was called upon , Albert B. Jaworower , Secretary of the committee which had arranged the dinner , presented him with a tablet of ebony with a golden square mounted upon It a replica of the emblem of the Jerome Nominators in the last campaign , under which Mr. Jerome was carried to victory on an independent ticket . " I hope my angles will be as sharp as those depicted on this square , " said Mr. Jerome In accepting the gift . " It is hard to stand up under the pounding of a nation . You feel lonesome and experience a sense that you have nobody behind you , when you are doing your level beat . But on occasions like this the burden Is temporarily lifted . " The part of Mr. Jerome 's speech which was interpreted as a plea for party regularity was listened to by the audience amid profound silence . The District Attorney had been praising the patriotism , of the Jews tnd their loyalty to Amer -- lean institutions . " If I may venture a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " it is this . There is one fault the Jew must remedy in order to develop the highest type of American citizenship . That fault is his strong ? ndividualism . This may seem strange , coming from me , who for fife most part have played a lone hand , and have done my full share in : winging about the disintegration of party which w is become loglo a diktinct peril . ' Nevertheless , I say you must lend yourself more to organization among yourcalves . I do n't care with what party you ally yourself . It 's all the same to me . But you 've got to develop leadership among yourselves , if you are going to be of az# much use . as you might be in our Amelican commonwealth . " The lack of leadership is what has caused so many young Jews to drift into Socialism . In some respects we are all Socialists . To a certain extent I am a Socialist myself . We all believe in the truth of the watchword of Socialism as it was littered by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when He made his plea for a fuller realization of the brotherhood of man . " The weakness of Socialism lies in the fact that the Golden Rule has not been accepted as the rule of conduct of men and women yet ; that it will not be in the time of our children or of our children 's children . " Mr. Jerome said there was no immediate danger of any great Socialistic wave in this country , but American institutions surely were imperiled by the disintegration of party now in progress . Suggests a Move for Mr. Schiff . This brought him , to the Schiff incident . He told of conversation he had with an uptown Jew , who had come down to the lower east side and had met Mr. Jerome there . The conversation drifted to the lack of leadership among the east-side Jews . Mr. Jerome suggested that it would be a good thing if Mr. Schiff ? with his great ability and strength , would go down to the east side and assume leadership . " The people down here are crying out for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in response , he said he told his friend . " Would you have him come down here and live at Seward Park ? " asked the latter in amazement . " Why not ? " said Mr. Jerome . " Let him come down here , put on a pair of silken trousers , and be one of you . Mr. Schiff is a good man , a strong man , an able man . He ought to be your leader . " This made a hit with the guests at the dinner , who applauded Mr. Jerome warmly when he brought his narrative to a close . Mr. Jerome made a great hit when he denounced the assertion of Police Commissioner Bingham that the percentage of crime among the Jews was greater than among people of other races . " If there should happen to be a good deal of crime on the east side , " he said , " it is not on account of the fact that the people living there are Jews , but because they are crowded together as they are . Crowd any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here and you are bound to get a large percentage of criminals . There is no reason for the Jews to feel sensitive about that accusation . " There were about 400 guests at the dinner , most of them east side merchants and lawyers of the more prosperous class . Kaufman Mandel . an east side banker , was to have been toastmaster , but was taken slightly ill while the dinner was in progress and compelled to retire . His place was taken by Edward Mandel , a Public school Principal , who spoke to the topic , ' Jerome as a Neighbor . Tributes to Our Neighbor . In speaking of Mr. Jerome as a neighbor Mr. Mandel said : " Heq.as faithfully kept his ante-election pledge to live on the East Side . His door has never been locked , night or day , to rich or poor . All could bring their complaints to him and receive equal attention . Conditions here were ' not ideal eight years ago . His residence in Rutgers Street has acted as a restraining influence . The east side is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mr. Dorf said he had voted for Mr. Je , rome twice , and would be glad to vote ' for him again . Mr. Rosenthal said that New York County was to be congratulated on having as honest and capable a man as Mr. Jerome in the District Attorney 's office . , Just as the speechmaking began all the electric lights went out . Before the gas could be lighted by the attendants , there was a moment of confusion , which changed into laughter as somebody shouted : ' Never mind . Jeroine 's here . "
