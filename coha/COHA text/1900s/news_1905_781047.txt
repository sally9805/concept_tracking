Sir C. Purdon Clarke , Director of the Metropolitan Museum , has returned here ' from Paris , where , accompanied by Robert W. De Forest , one of the Trustees of the Museum , he has been inspecting art objects offered for sale to the Metropolitan Museum . Sir Purdon said he had made important choices , but he would not divulge their nature because the deals had not yet been concluded . During his absence from America , J. Pierpont Morgan has added a whole Fragonard room to his London residence . Its Intrinsic value is estimated at hundreds of thousands of pounds , and it is of infinite historical importance . Some appreciation of the value of the collection may be gathered from the fact that while a Fragonard a foot square is worth S5,000 , the largest room in Mr. Morgan 's house le walled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are twelve of these paintings , each measuring three yards high , and two yards wide . In order to embrace the whole collection in a single room , it was necessary to remove the wail separating the drawing rooms of Mr. Morgan 's adjacent houses at I Prince 's Gate . ' The panels , by St Bramantino , which are coming to this city were formerly part of the collection of the late Henry Willett of Brighton , England , and were sold ' by auction in London on April 10 . Mr. Willett Was a collector of pictures of all periods , but he devoted the most attention to the Italian pre-Raphaelite artists , and his collection was extraordinarily rich in spedmens of their work . Probably on account of the fact that the sale was held almost before the London season had begun the sums realized were disappointing , and excellent examples of the early Italian masters were picked up by alert dealers and collectors at prices which , compared with those now ruling , were absurdly low .

They come from the castle of San Martino , between Bresela and Mantua. which was razed in 1880 . Originally there were thirty-four panels , but Mr. Willett parted with some of them to the South Kensington Museum , and one . of them is in the possession of Sir ' Martin Conway . The panels are nearly all profile studies and nearly all of men . The fantastic headgear , in which a turban frequently appears , is very characteristic of Bramantino . Each head is seen against an arch , hung with festooned leaves .

In Bramantino 's work we find much of the severity and accuracy of technique of Foppa , while the enigmatic beauty of Lionardo 's faces is suggested and the color is often as delicate as Luini 's .
