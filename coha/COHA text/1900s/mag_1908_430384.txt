 |p1278  BRAZIL , before the end of the century , will be one of the greatest sources of food supply in the world . More than that , this republic of South America will be the home of an active , industrious race numbering 150 , - 000,000 , engaged in a productive energy equal to that of the United States today , but tempered by a Latinitv that removes our restlessness from life , while leaving results that will show as sure a grasp of material and intellectual civilization . This is a prophecy , but a careful examination of conditions as they exist today in the great republic of Brazil will prove that the prophecy is not unfounded , and that a trained imagination can foresee no future which does not carry a justification of it . The area of Brazil is 3,218,130 square miles ; larger , by the size of Germany , than the United States , exclusive of Alaska and the island possessions . The population is close to the 20.000.000 mark , more than had the United States at the beginning of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts , but the Brazilians themselves like to think of their country as composed by nature of three great subdivisions , considered rather as zones of distinctive products than as geographic entities . The first may be called the tropical zone ; it embraces the drainage system of the mighty Amazon , twice that of the Mississippi , with affluents running from the Bolivian , Peruvian , Eucadorian and Colombian Andes ; this region extends , also , to the southwest , embracing portions of the mysterious State of Matto Grosso , in the interior of the continent , and coalesces with the northern edge of the watershed of the River Plate . The second is both sub-tropical and temperate ; it lies wholly above the Tropic of Capricorn and includes the States of Bahia . Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo on the coast , but also the interior plateaus of prosperous Minas Geraes with the less known but equally rich Goyaz , where the central capital of the republic may some day be located . The third is altogether temperate , and comprises the lower three States of Parana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let us examine these great productive zones in detail . The first is the Amazon Valley . It must be granted that practically the whole area is a system of waterways , all tending toward the open mouth on the Equator . Yet it is by no means such an unexplored region as that of our own Western States one hundred years ago . Today oceangoing steamers pass regularly between New York and Manaos , 1,000 miles up the Amazon , and a few proceed further to the Peruvian port of Iquitos , 1,300 miles higher . Manaos is a city of 50,000 , with trolley cars , electric lights and all the conveniences or luxuries of a European capital . It is , in fact , the center of a commerce stretching over 30,009 miles of inland water . Steamers make regular trips thru this vast interior , and  |p1279  convey as busy a commerce as had the Mississippi fifty years ago . The ambition of modern pioneers is to extend still wider the possibilities of this commerce . so as to tap the west Andean region of Bolivia and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to surround for 18o miles the falls of the Madeira River , and in the end they are sure to overcome all the obstacles nature can place in the course of man . The hidden wildernesses of tradition are melting away before the energy of modern industrial life , and one generation is scarcely necessary to make the Amazon as available for mankind as the northern boundary of the United States . Two great factors are at work to stimulate human energy . One is climate . This is no inadvertent paradox . It is a decadent theory that the human race can not thrive , physically or intellectual ly , within the tropics . We can learn to live in a hot climate quite as well as within a cold one , and heat is the only essential problem against which we must contend . Yet heat is not so destructive as cold , and its destructive consequences arc more easily overcome . Science may devise some means besides coal to keep us warm , but it has not clone so up to now . The coal famines in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifty years . Iceland is becoming depopulated , while the Amazon offers the proper refuge . Tropic fevers are a bugaboo of the past . The experiences on the Panama Canal prove it ; the decreasing mortality rate in Rio de Janeiro . Santos and Para emphasize it . There is no denying that jungle fever attacks the explorer of today , but a modern colonizing scheme will dissipate the danlger . The Madeira and Mamore Railway is be/ ginning its construction work by destroying the cause of infection ? that is , by establishing means to secure thoroly hygienic surroundings for their employees . Other industrial enterprises can and will do the same , and thus the fear of disease will disappear . The other factor is the productive capacity of the region . Its natural resources are inexhaustible ; the woods , the market vegetables and the fruits alone will be in great demand ; sugar and tobacco find no better soil ; in Matto Grosso , at the head waters of the River Paraguay , supplies of food can be sent out to cover half the continent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amazon are rubber and cacao . The consuming world has not yet begun to realize how dependent we are upon two such staples to sustain industry and life . Without rubber the wheels of commerce could not revolve another hour ; without rubber nine-tenths of the pleasure of the world would have to be diverted into different channels , and three-fourths of our rubber is obtained from Brazil ; $70,000,000 worth of rubber was exported in 1907 from the Amazon country , of which the United States took over $33,000,000 . The rubber industry is only beginning to be placed on a scientific basis , but when it is cultivated as successfully as is coffee , Brazil must still be the chief source of supply for the world 's markets . This upper third of Brazil is also the world 's leading purveyor of cacao ; 6o,000,000 pounds was the crop in 1907 , valued at $10,000,000 , of which the United States took almost $3,000,000 , and yet the demand for chocolate and cocoa is ahead of the supply . I do not ignore the sugar output of northern Brazil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to meet local wants , nor the tobacco fields , which in 1907 exported $6,000,000 above the home demand , but these are crops that thrive elsewhere .  |p1281  Take the great middle portion of Brazil . Broadly speaking , this extends from Bahia on the north to Santos on the south , and embraces the States of Espirito Santo , Rio de Janeiro , Sao Paulo and Minas Geraes , all noted for their coffee . Of the 15,000,000 bags of coffee forming the visible supply of the world for the present year , 11,000,000 bags come from Brazil , and today this represents undoubtedly that nation 's greatest source of wealth , but it by no means indicates the possibilities of the whole area . In the interior of Sao Paulo , and over almost the whole of the enormous State of Minas Geraes , 221,894 square miles , but without a seaboard , lies a plateau containing some of the most fertile land of South America . It has been visited for three hundred years and surveyed by the empire and the republic , but its soil has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has mighty rivers flowing in every direction , with water sufficient for all power and irrigation ; it has highlands like the center of Mexico , but what feeble native race occupied it when the Europeans came has almost vanished away , and as yet no great influx of foreign industrialists has come to take its place . This is destined to become , in the language of Burton , " one of the world 's great granaries , supporting untold millions . " Cotton and tobacco can be grown over the lower areas , corn and even  |p1282  wheat on the highlands , while almost the whole extent of this interior is suitable for cattle . The southernmost third is the smallest , including a portion of the State of Sao Paulo , all of Parana , Santa Catharina and Rio Grande do Sul . At present its ern facilities for comfortable life and as ambitious as any of our own centers of American civilization , but the vast stretches of Goyaz , of Minas Geraes , of Parana must be as newly planted , as our own great Southwest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with coffee , tea and cacao in popular consumption , and cattle . Its possibilities , however , are comparable to those of the Carolinas , Kentucky and Tennessee . The area of the United States of Brazil lies broadside to the Atlantic Ocean . Its coast line is almost as long as our own on both oceans . It is accessible to any person who is willing to spend a few days at sea . Regular steamers depart from New York and other ports for every well-known harbor . The interior is approachable from many of these harbors by railways that form avenues of traffic and travel all tending toward salt water , but between points in this interior the mule path or the stage coach road are still the only means of connection . Along the coast are cities as well built , as well provided with mod Possibilities here are illimitable . The soil promises to grow anything , when scientific agriculture is applied and when markets are within reach . There is scarcely a question about markets , because Brazil , tho essentially an agricultural country , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population , but the consuming world of Europe is at her doors . The total foreign trade of Brazil has already in 1907 amounted to nearly $500,000 , - 000 , of which $202,000,000 were imports and $270,000,000 exports . Crops , therefore , will find a market when they are produced . These crops are at present coffee , $142,000,000 ; rubber , $70,000 , - 000 ; cacao , $1o,000,000 ; cotton , $8,500 , - 000 ; yerba mate , $8,000,000 ; tobacco , $6,000,000 . This leaves out of account the hides and dried meats of south Brazil , which , when not consumed within the country , are often unnoticed as  |p1283  contributing to the meat products of contiguous Uruguay . One feature of Brazilian natural resources deserves especial attention . That is the abundance of water in every part of the republic . Perhaps the southern extremity , in the State of Rio Grande do Sul , should be excepted from this generalization , but even here water is found so close to the surface that drought is rarely dreaded . Otherwise , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and inexhaustible resource . Water everywhere , from the oceanic masses of the Amazon , to the mighty Sao Francisco , running across Bahia and Minas Geracs , the Parana on the western frontier , the Tiete in Sao Paulo , and innumerable others coursing thru the plateau . Many of these rivers have cataracts , like those of the Sao Francisco and Guaira , which rival , if they do not exceed , Niagara . All of them have rapids and volume of water enough to turn the wheels of industry that will offer employment and homes for millions of people yet to come . Imagination can only be quickened by such a picture . It presents not alone possibility , but opportunity , for the man whose energy and ambition drive him into new endeavor . It is a field fascinating to the American , because it is a field over which only a republicanism of government , a democracy of effort , can hold sway . And the Brazilians are a kindly people . They have the heartiness , the sentiment of The Latin ; their cordiality and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they accept with courtesy and openmindedness all who come to them with the sincere purpose of making , in every sense of the word , the best of things . Nevertheless , Brazil must not be considered a Mecca for the unemployed . The nation encourages immigration , but immigration there , as well as elsewhere in this busy world , means work , toil and difficulties . When the question of oppor1284 THE INDE :  |p1284  tunity is raised , it must not be taken to imply that El Dorado lies only across " the Line . " There are many conditions to be considered before material success can he attained . Let us see what the chances are for different classes of men , looking at life from various angles , or for different forces directed toward achievement . At the outset , the traveler to Brazil should learn Portuguese . This is the language of the country and as much ingrained in them as English is in us . Imagine a foreigner coming to the United States ignorant of and unwilling to learn our daily speech ! He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an interpreter in hotel or railway , and he can transact no business because he and his client have no common vernacular . Brazilians are too polite to laugh at the foreigner , but they appreciate very deeply an effort made to learn their language and their literature . In this and other respects they preserve their sentiment more than we do . The phrase " there is no sentiment in business " does not apply in Latin America . Sentiment , it may be asserted , controls business and other activities in life to a noticeable degree . Brazil needs and encourages immigration . The immigration laws are liberal and intended to give the individual a free share of land , abundant time and opportunity to develop his chances , with a good promise for future improvement . The nation itself , however , does no more than invite the immigrant and secure for him safe landing and transportation to a selected locality ; beyond this aid he is a ward of some particular State , Sao Paulo , for instance , or Minas Geraes , in which his future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attractive to the South European than to the North American , who is accustomed to act in an individual way . Brazil wants labor , the workman is well treated there , but the individual is not so needed as labor in the mass . For that reason the policy of the republic has hitherto followed that of the empire and invited labor to enter in the form of colonies . The colonial system was successful so long as the immigrants had to remain isolated , but nowadays the railroad is bringing all the world closer together , and colonies are no longer necessary . It is only recently that railroads have begun to advance civilization ; their policy , as in Europe , was merely to keep pace with it . A consequence was that land , a loadstone for the settler , was nearly unattainable . But the railroad is today pushing out beyond a narrow circumference ; soon newer areas will open to settlement as we in the United States understand it , and railroads , just as they have here , will have land to sell in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be stimulated . At present , however , the individual immigrant will be a little lonely . Perhaps ten , or even better , fifty , families can go as a body to Brazil for home seeking . If they are willing to put up with the troubles of a new soil , a new climate and unfamiliar surroundings , such a unit will find opportunity . They will meet German , Italian , Portuguese ? few English speaking ? neighbors , and ultimately their chance of winning success is bright . If the individual home seeker must not expect to find his Paradise in Brazil , the same rule will apply to the individual who must earn his bread by daily or monthly wages . The man who can get a job at home should stick to it ; the man who can not get a job here will find scant encouragement there . The charities of American consular officers who befriend misguided wanderers after fortune are eloquent proof of this statement . This is true also for the professional man , whether lawyer , physician or engineer . Native @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worthily , many of the posts calling for the talent of the schools . They are as quick witted and as well educated as their Anglo-Saxon fellows , and have all the advantages of familiarity with the arena of their work . If the student of any scientific inclination desires the activity of foreign life , he should seek it , not as a money maker alone , but as an investigator ambitious to contribute to the knowledge of his generation . For botanists , zoologists , etc .. Brazil should be a Mecca . Its forests and river valleys are not half explored ; its fauna and flora by no means classified , and the aboriginal races ought to be traced . Let our restless American  |p1285  youths emulate the example of European explorers , who have made unique treks across Africa and Asia , and thereby discovered much of interest and value . Now the man who can be sent into Brazil by employers abroad , or is called there for some special purpose , has a different outlook . This class of young wage earner , educated for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him there should be no question of his opportunity . There is another class , representing capital and home industry , who must no longer neglect the opportunities of Brazil . I refer to commercial travelers , those envoys of a nation 's commercial life . Here again the advice of the resident American consular officers should be followed . American young men do not comprehend what they are missing by not boldly striking for these markets , fond of Amer can goods , and thruout the country there are openings that would astonish merchants here , who will be well repaid for any outlay at the beginning . Agricultural implements , all forms of modern machinery , office and household furniture , special lines of foodstuffs , jewelry and dress goods , building and construction material , are sold today by European manufacturers ; but there is room for us , too , in this growing trade . If , however , we are to extend our foreign commerce in this direction , acceptable methods must be employed . Brazilians are cordial , they are not afraid of sentiment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business . Paciencia is also a graceful habit to acquire . What in the United States is taken for push and hustle , may be mistaken for haste and carelessness in Brazil . Study the language , the people and the markets is a motto not to be disregarded . There is a vet broader field for capital , when the future of Brazil is considered . Money is needed to develop her  |p1286  resources and thereby to offer employment to the labor that is sure to be attracted thither . Look at the opportunity for the investment of capital ! It is certain to be remunerative in the end . What a splendid field for the young man with money who likes to see things grow ! New areas must be made accessible by railroads ; ranches must be started for the growth of cattle and corn ; rubber plantations developed and the fields of cotton and tobacco extended . Brazil has done wonders with her harbors ; Rio , Bahia , Recife , Rio Grande do Sul have now under contract the construction of modern docks for deep-water vessels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but these are by no means the only harbors where foreign shipping demands entrance , and all of them require capital to carry the plans to completion . Then there are the cities themselves . Many need capital for electric light plants , for transportation lines , water service ; the neighboring country needs factories , mills and industrial enterprises . All of these , if properly financed , pay , and the people , as well as the nation , will show their hospitality and gratitude for the confidence placed in them . England has invested millions in just such affairs , Germany and France are following her lead , but the work is not vet finished ? it has scarcely begun , for Brazil is ambitious , she is neighborly , and her policy is a splendid one of progressive Americanism.
