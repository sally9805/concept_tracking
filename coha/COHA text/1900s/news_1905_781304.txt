txt Emperor William has cabled his felicita tions to the yachtsmen contesting for the Raiser 's Cup in the international transatlantic race , which starts to-morrow.1 Learning that they would convene for final settlement of all questions pertainlng to the event after the dinner tenderedl by Allison V. Armour to yacht owners and committee on Saturday night , he sent the : following message to the host : Allison V. Armour , Delmonico 's , New York : Best greetings to yacht owners and starting committee , hoping race will be a success . and wishing good and speedy cruises . WILHELM I. it . The cablegram was received while the ' guests were at dinner , before they had : begun the discussion of arrangements . It was read and received with general ! satisfaction , and put every one in the best mood to enter the contest in the wholesome spirit in which it was conceived . Few changes were found necessary in the rules for its conduct . It was decided to start the race at the appointed hour , 2:30 P. 31 .. to-morrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yachts to manoeuvre about the lightship . Only the densest fog can prevent the boats getting away on schedule . Should a postponement be necessary , instructions will be issued to the yachts at the starting line . Word was received from the other side that the German cruiser Pheil would be anchored off the Lizard Light , a mile away on the line . She will take her sta-ticn there on May 26 and remain until the first four boats have finished . Her pur-pose is to afford a guide to the boats to find the Light in foggy weather to facilitate the establishment of communication with it in order to signal their arrival . This completes each detail and covers every foreseen contingency . All that now remains is for the starting gun to sound and wind and wave to decide the issue . The inclement conditions yesterday in-terfered with the plans of most of the entries to have a trial spin to tune and stretch sails . All lay at anchor in the positions taken Saturday night , restive and uncomfortable in their idleness . It is safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , / will be under sail , though I they can get little real work in because of delays incidental to the final shipping , of fresh supplies . To-night all of the I contestants , with two exceptions , will be I at the line , anchored beside the Atlantic at Sandy Hook . awaiting tow to take - them- out- for the gun . The only absentee is the Hildegarde . The mystery which has surrounded her movements for the last week continues to 1 enshroud her . Mr. Armour heard from Edward R. Coleman , her owner , yesterday . In his letter , dated from New Lon-don , he said he was leaving there Saturday morning to go out to sea . He anticipated cruising about outside all day Saturday and Sunday and would not return until to-night , when he would seek an anchorage at the Hook . If he was looking for a further try out yesterday , he probably found conditions decidedly unsatisfactory . The Atlantic was alone at the Hook . Her owner and his guests were not aboard her . Capt . Barr walked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been spoiling for a chance to take the boat out under full sail for ten days past , and doubtless was none too well pleased that the weather had deprived him of tale chance . He is in the peculiar position of starting in an international race without an opportunity to familiarize himself with his ship , and will be handicapped by the fact decidedly . She has been grooming consistently ever since he has had her , and , in one sense , therefore , is probably in better shape than any of her competitors . Capt . Barr said yesterday that he expected to go out early this morning . At Tompkinsville , the Thistle , the Hamburg , and the Fleur de Lys lay . Mrs. Tod was aboard the former with the Commodore , spending a last quiet Sunday . Everything was shipshape aboard her . and nothing seemed to have been overlooked . It is really remarkable how completely equipped the schooner is . It deleted 2 paragraphs ing returned from the Horseshoe late Saturday evening . Cap . Loesch had intended to go out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She will return in the afternoon for some fresh stores and leave finally for the Horseshoe , in tow , late in the day . She looked trim and alert as she lay at rest . and appeared eager to be off . Over half her crew of twenty-five men were ashore . The rest lounged on the deck gossiping of her chances . Three of the boats are at the New York Yacht Club anchorage In the East River . On the Sunbeam , Lord Brassey received several visitors during the day . There is not the same tenseness aboard her that marks the others . It is more a pleasure cruise for the distinguished Englishman . He has no thought he can win . Beside her was the Utowana and the Ailsa . The latter had left Hoboken late the previous night and was waiting to take on stores before being towed down the bay tonight . She will go down with the Utowana . The Sunbeam will remain where she ' lies until to-morrow morning , having ordered tow to the start at 7 o'clock .
