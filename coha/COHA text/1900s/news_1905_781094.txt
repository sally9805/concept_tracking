txt John D. Crimmins , Chairman of the policy holders ' committee which has been working for the mutualization of the Equitable Life Assurance Society , gave an interview last night after having read the statement made public by James H. Hyde on Saturday night , in which he demanded an " immediate , thorough , and drastic " investigation of the management of . the organization founded by his father . " I think that was a very good and fair statement , ? said Mr. Crimmins , " The air seems to be clearing now , and we do not expect any further trouble . " Mr. Hyde seems to be a very able . young man . Of course , he has youth and all that goes with it . but at the interrogation to which he was submitted at the office of State Superintendent of Insurance Hendricks he answered every question very intelligently and gave abundant eyidence of having remarkable grasp of the situation . " " Then your estimate of the ability of Mr. Hyde would warrant the presumption that you would approve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vice President of the Equitable Life Assurance Society ? " Mr. Crimmins was asked . " Yes , " said Mr. Crimmins . " I see no reason why he should not continue in his present position , Both sides have laid themselves open to criticism , but I do n't believe Mr. Hyde 's resignation would result to the best interest of the Equitable Life Assurance Society " It has been made to appear that . the assets of the Society had suffered under the present . management I ath in a position to know , and I can assure you that tee assets are intact . Even If the charges were true , the blame would not all he on one side . Both sides would Ise to blame , for Mr. Alexander ' would be equally culpable , in not knowing what was being done and putting a stop to it . " Mr. Hyde is away much of the time . Mr. Alexander is here all of the time . If Mr. Alexander did not know what was going on , I should say that he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Equitable Life Assurance Society . " Mr. Alexander signs all checks and ought to have known what money was being spent and what it was being spent for . I do n't believe Mr. Hyde ever signed any checks of the society in regard to the rumors that Mr. Alexander at the conference on Friday practically had delivered an ultimatum calling upon Mr. Hyde to resign , Mr. Crimmins said it was too ridiculous to receive any consideration . From another source It was learned that what really happened was this : Both Mr. Hyde and his counsel , Mr. Root , got up in the meeting and took Mr. Alexander and his counsel , ex-Judge William N. Cohen , severely to task for first agreeing to the mutualization plan worked out by the . Equitable Society 's own committee and then going back on their own pledges . Mr. Crimmins said it was a great pity that the differences among the officials of the society had led to so much publicity as to cause a feeling of doubt in the minds of small policy holders who ' had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the position of their families . " As far as I am concerned , " said Mr : Crimmins . " I would like to see the Legislature pass a bill regulating the investmerits of insurance companies , much the same is is done in reference to the investments of savings banks . I think , though , I that after this matter has been cleared ' up , it will have taught a lesson not only to the Equitable Society , but to life insurance companies , as well as to other big financial institutions . " Cornelius M. Bliss yesterday said : " The compromise effected through the Equitable Muttialization Committee , prOviding for twenty-eight Directors representing policy holders end twenty-four representing stockholders was satisfactory to me becatise I agreed to and signed-it , but it did not meet with the approval . of State Superintendent of Insurance Hendricks . I did not attend yesterday 's conference , but if what I have seen In the newspapers regarding It - is true the Station taken then would seem to be even more satisfactory . " Superintendent Hendricks kept in seclusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he ' will defer to - the urgent wishes of Mr. Hyde and order an investigation of the company 's affairs , which those familiar- with them declare will completely disprove all the allegations made by the enemies of Mr. Hyde . One- of the Directors Of the Equitable Life Assurance Society said last night ' that when Superintendent Hendricks gets to investigating the affairs of the organization he will find that none of Mr. Hyde 's social functions , personal expenses or servants ' salaries have been charged , to the society . The " only thing that was paid for pattly by the organization , said this Director , was the Cambon dinner , and in that ' case-Mr . Hyde returned the money , because be deemed it impolitic to charge it up to the society . deleted paragraph " If the interchange Were Made to-day the anti-Hyde. interests Mild nee sscurc a more ' independent Executive I card than the four new Men to be haired by the Policy ' Holders ' Committee and Cornelius N.
