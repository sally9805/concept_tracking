Enter Olivia , playing a violin . The Bishop follows quickly and seizes the bow . BISHOP Reflect , my child , reflect ! You should not wed This Caleb , this hell-builder upon earth . You counsel well when others are in need . Yourself you counsel not , or in such wise Your steps are led not heavenward . No ! No ! At times your thoughts have made mine error-proof .

My darling Margaret is still in mind . That night ! That night ! ' T is day , but here it is .

RAHAB ( He slams Bible on table . ) ( Aside . ) Worthless ! Worthless ! I 've missed my chance in life ! Hired man comes to window .

Your laziness needs stirring up ! Hired man goes . RAHAB Your spurs are fine ! Your whip is good enough To flog a fellow such as you had here . p. 14 CALEB The law is all that saves his scaly back . RAHAB What need have you for whip and spurs ? CALEB My horse ! RAHAB Your horse ? CALEB My horse must clip it ! Flesh is naught ! A little breeding serves a righteous end . RAHAB You have money !

CALEB He cost a quacking duck and a torn apron . RAHAB The tale ! The tale ! CALEB Jasper , the shoemaker , would not be a hatter lest his handiwork treat heads to a sweat , which treats eyes to a smarting , which fills the mind with hard thoughts , which sharpen as they leave the tongue . He would not be a glover lest there be more clapping than wearing . To wear is to prove greatness . To clap is to hand-bawl ! A bawler ! A bawler ! Jasper would not be a bawler ! He was  --  RAHAB A shoemaker ! Go on with the tale ! CALEB He was too humane to kill a chinch which circled his neck time and again and ended on the tip of his nose before the whole congregation . RAHAB Neither you nor I can understand such humanity . The tale ! CALEB He was too honest to drink water in which the king 's shoepegs had been soaked lest he thrive on stolen substance . RAHAB The King should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a quacking duck that was clock to him in the morning , servant at meal-time , and that feathered his bed at night . A neighbor-woman , who was thirty and nine  --  and who should have had nine and thirty on her bare back  --  who talked the neighborhood into confusion , her husband into murder , her sons into theft , and her daughters into ill-marriages , stole the duck and hid it in a barrel . p. 17 RAHAB Woman and mystery always make a good tale . Go on ! CALEB " Woman , " said Jasper , as she was feeding her ducks , " I suspect you of theft ! " " Man , " said the woman , " I suspect you of insolence ! Let 's see ! Ducky ! Ducky ! I scatter you honest corn ! " " Quack ! Quack ! " came from the barrel . " There 's life in the barrel ! " said Jasper . " There 's a dream in your head ! " replied the woman , and placed her apron over the barrel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jasper , and thrust his hand through the apron and seized the duck . As he held up the apron and duck a stranger rode up on the horse in question . " Fine morning ! " said the stranger . " Quack ! " Quack ! " went the duck . Off ! went the horse , leaving the stranger to take his fall as he had it , and his revenge as he could get it . Jasper was affrighted and said : " Who 'll own the apron and the duck ? " " I own the apron and the duck ! " said I to the stranger . " I 'll pay the damages ! " said Jasper . " I 'll buy the horse ! " said I. " Who 'll pay for the apron ? " bawled the woman . " I , " answered the man and sprang to his feet . Ere I could pay the money the man and woman eloped . They perished in a storm . Jasper buried their bodies by way of damages ; and I kept the horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a torn apron ! When will a fairy tale be given flesh and blood again ? CALEB Never ! The horse cost me two hundred dollars . I 'm feeling gay ! When in such moments I am bound to tell a sprightly lie . p. 18 BISHOP ( In door . ) Your mother is better ! CALEB ( He frowns . ) I 'm worse ! The Bishop shakes his head and goes in . RAHAB Did you not say the sermon should not be ? CALEB I did ! No sermon ! Students will be here ! An undertaker , too ! A sham affair ! You understand ? RAHAB I do ! The sermon 's out ! CALEB I rode the horse to find the students ' place . RAHAB Your father 's horse ! CALEB The horse his death-fees bought . Two hundred dollars of the five ! You see ? RAHAB You are so modern in your filial views . CALEB " Weaker and wiser " is the ancient saw . Hired Man appears at the window . Frony enters from death-chamber . FRONY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That sleep will be too short ! HIRED MAN The undertaker , sir ! Five other men !

She holds money in hand . Frony follows and fans her . She is seated . They stand by her chair . Rahab hugs Bible and looks solemn . CALEB ( To Undertaker . ) A thirty-dollar coffin ? I say no ! Five dollars for a robe ? No , death-worm , no ! Four carriages ? No , undertaker , no ! Think you a son must curb his appetite Because a pauper father breathes no more ? The living must have money !

Now , undertaker  --  sober business man ! You see conditions ! Make your estimate ! You think about your trade ? Drink ! Cigarettes ! You 'd rob me , sir ? Drink ! Cocaine ! Cigarettes ! I 'd stake them , sir , against your trade  --  your life ! Out ! Out ! death-worm ! Out ! Out ! You wont ? You will ! Offend not living men to serve the dead ! Out ! Out ! Undertaker hurries out . He went ! ( To Patsy )  --  Old woman , why those tears ? p. 21 PATSY ( Faintly . ) Caleb , my boy , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in his pauper breast . He boasted of a hide-bound honesty . I boast me of my liberty and wit . BISHOP ( To Caleb . ) Are you a human being ? CALEB Look me o'er ! BISHOP You have a soul ? CALEB What mean you by that word ? BISHOP I mean  --  CALEB I would not know your meaning ! You Would make sense senseless in explaining it ! BISHOP You are a monster ! CALEB You have spoken truth ! BISHOP You know not God ! CALEB You mean God knows not me ! BISHOP You are an infidel ? CALEB I am ! I am ! BISHOP You move without a current , sail , or creed ! CALEB My current is myself ! My wit 's my sail ! p. 22 BISHOP Your creed ? CALEB I have a creed ! It suits you not ! BISHOP What is it ? CALEB Here it is ! Prepare your ire ! Men stagger in my light , yet are too dull To see that my creed is infallible . They rather worship God whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The time shall be when they will cease to follow Views that are so disgusting and so hollow . Let blinded Christians , ere they think or stir , Confer with me , their great philosopher . When they have steeped their souls in blasphemy , And trodden under foot theology , They will be fit to teach true piety . As I have searched for light should Christians search , They 'll find that faith in God the soul will smirch , And know that hell 's another name for church . Therefore , my fellow-men , on you I call . I am your friend , and heartily extol My creed of life to save you , one and all . There is my creed ! BISHOP It is no creed ! CALEB What then ? BISHOP ' T is soulful nothing with a dash of brain That sees itself polluted through itself . p. 23 FRONY Our demon ! NOAH Hell 's forerunner ! PATSY ( Motherly . She rises . ) Caleb  --  son  --  This mother 's breast of mine would feed you still ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rahab holds door leading to yard . Student gives Caleb money .

Frony tries death-chamber door and finds it fastened . Caleb looks at money and smiles . Rahab motions to him to divide . Curtain. @x Enter Olivia . OLIVIA ' T was horrible ! ' T was horrible ! Caleb Did prove a demon ! ' T is my sober thought Great God will hear no prayers that he will make . Enter Frony hurriedly . FRONY You should have seen ! You should  --  OLIVIA I heard enough . FRONY Are satisfied ? OLIVIA That I should strive the more . FRONY I 'd give my life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your wit . ' T will stand the better watch . FRONY Upon which side ? Explain ! I 'll take a breath ! She sits on chair . OLIVIA An urchin stretches him upon the ground ; And , dog-like , laps the water from the spring . He fears no ill . He thinks : " I am , therefore , I am protected . " Life 's too full of life To shake his faith . So Patsy trusts in God . One tells a story till the plot grows dear . Men clamor for a change . He says : " Not so ! I 've put my joys and sorrows into it After this fashion . " Patsy scrons to change Her worship 's rule . ' T is life through joy and pain . Such constancy is life in league with God . She sees no penury in wanting bread When that want comes from giving , crumb by crumb , One 's little store to such as toil for naught . A little sock or kerchief or a hood Is dearer unto her than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in man For pen and ink to libel nature with . She serves her day by serving her hearth-stone. p. 25 FRONY She is so worthy ! Speak the truth of her ! OLIVIA A button 's dropped by some one in a crowd . One passes it and scarcely sees its form . Another comes and sees it 's what it is , But goes his way unmindful of its worth . Another , curious and prudent-wise , Stores it about him for a future need . The need may come a score of times , but he Bethinks him not he has it near at hand . A wiser one will use it in his need , Perchance , with others of no kindred . Then Another , with fine sense of fitness , will Seek out its fellows somewhere and salute The seeing eye with wholeness . So we think . Thoughts face us as we move . We see them not ; Or see them simply recognizably , And plod along unburdened by their aid ; Or press them to us but ne'er think to use Such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in connection where no trace Of fellowship or kindred may be found . Few use their thoughts as wisely as a child Uses the buttons it has found in play . Patsy is such a thinker . She can think A thought into the world , and thereby guard It with the destinies that save the world . She 'll soon give back to earth and air and sky Her mortal dust , immortal in its trend . FRONY She is so worthy ! p. 26 OLIVIA You would help her then ? FRONY I would ! OLIVIA Help me ! FRONY To wed  --  ? OLIVIA No argument ! The Bishop comes ! FRONY I heard ! I know ! I 'll help ! She rises . He would invite you to an argument , Making this Caleb serve as central point . He boasts him that if you will listen well Your thoughts of Caleb shall be spears to prick Your wild affections into haggardness . I 'll go to meet him ! You 've a starting point ? His sermons ! He is pleased to hear from them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you out . We women must be women ! Men are men ! Exit . OLIVIA I do remember some well-timed remarks Concerning genius and the fear of hell . They 're from a sermon I once heard him preach . These will I cite and wed to argument . I 'll at him first ! The rule of courtesy Will steel his patience . ( Steps are heard . ) I do hear his step . Re-enter Frony. p. 27 FRONY Some ministers will seek the Bishop here To say good-bye . Can you make use of them ? OLIVIA I know them well . Each one is practiced well . I had it done bethinking of this hour . The Bishop ? FRONY In his garden ! OLIVIA Doing what ? FRONY Consulting with your father . Exit . OLIVIA Plotting still ! These ministers will play a little part . ' T will break monotony and give me rest . What if the Bishop knew ? Appointments ? No ! Re-enter Frony with Bishop . FRONY You saw this Caleb and remember him . BISHOP I did ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought him worthy of death ? BISHOP I do ! I did ! FRONY Think you a sermon would be remedy ? BISHOP No one remembers sermons ! OLIVIA I do ! FRONY She does and often speaks to me of yours . p. 28 BISHOP Of mine ? FRONY Your text , your sermon and your very voice She oft repeats to me , and I say true . Provoke her , Bishop , and she 'll gladly preach A part of your own sermon . Try her once ! OLIVIA As Frony says your sermons cling to me . BISHOP As you to Caleb ? OLIVIA I have no mind to make comparisons . Besides the ancient rule of courtesy Forbids that you bring up a second point When I have introduced a sober first . BISHOP ' T is true ! Go on ! OLIVIA I heard you preach , and seem to hear you still . The Bishop takes it for a compliment . It was on " Genius and the Fear of Hell . " " The fear of hell doth lift man heavenward . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think not so ! FRONY I think not so ! Bishop , You think not so since you have older grown ? The Bishop is silent and buries his head in his hands . OLIVIA ' T would edge my temper and unwing my hope . p. 29 FRONY ( To Bishop . ) Make that a text and preach the sermon o'er . Bishop takes Bible from pocket and opens it . OLIVIA Whenever man is taught the fear of hell , He seeks it in the living and the dead . See how the ages all do sanction this ! FRONY You see it , Bishop ! Sanction what you see ! OLIVIA No longer do the airs of Paradise Exist for him to hearten and assure . No longer does he know that God must still O'ermaster Satan ere the soul be dumb . Man 's ever doomed to woe and death in life , To make his faith the tutor to his fear , To crush his God and elevate an Imp , So long as he does hold such savagery . His wild audacity will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's face . Then straight his witlessness would wonder how So pure a stroke could leave so foul a stain . FRONY That stroke hit home . Some sparks should be in sight . OLIVIA The tragedy of tragedies must be : To teach the laws of Heaven so that they cross And smite each other till the sons of men Know not the voice of God from that of him Who sits in Hell , but reigns not anywhere . p. 30 FRONY That is theology . ( To Bishop . ) Speak I the truth ? The Bishop looks through his glasses at the ceiling . OLIVIA Past ages toyed with man . He knew it not , And made their jest the altar of his praise . They thorned his soul with fear , yet asked him why He was so slow to sniff the Rose of Life . They dulled his sight by bringing Hell so close , Then scorned him for not seeing Heaven afar . The Present should be loath to fellowship A Past whose creed made life 's sweet peace a dirge . BISHOP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? FRONY ( Quickly . ) Are you ? BISHOP ( Quickly . ) Are you ? He listens attentively . OLIVIA As some strong man , in firm and joyous mood , Plants a small seed beside his cabin door , And without thought of fear or future ill , Tends it by day and croons o'er it by night Until the vine springs up and bears a gourd , The which he takes , all famishing of thirst , And , step by step , climbs up a shaggy steep Where from a stream so small it comes in drops He fills it to the brim ; but ere he drinks , Hears cries from a poor , thirsty traveler Who pants and groans upon the plain below ; And then , forgetting his own ease and weal , Bears down the water and so saves a life ; Then as he dies from bruises and of thirst Thinks all is well since he has humbly served His gracious Maker in a simple act ; So , you , O , child of Heaven and of Earth , Must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish to gain that you may give ; Feeling no fear , firmly believing that Nearness to duty , not to burning Hell , Must ever be the voice that leads to Heaven . p. 31 FRONY Good thought is that ! Some seem to think not so . BISHOP Duty is ever right . Fear plays its part . ( To Olivia . ) I spoke of genius . Now , speak you of it . What did I say ? Do you remember it ? OLIVIA Yes ! You said naught , and I remember it . FRONY She told me of it , and I  --  . ( To Olivia . ) Did I laugh ? Speak on , Olivia ! BISHOP Yes ! Say your say . I worship thought though feminine in garb . OLIVIA You lead by questioning . ' T will draw me out . BISHOP I question ? I ? FRONY O , question anything ! Loud coughing without . Some ministers would say good-bye to you . I go to let them in . Now , question on ! Exit Frony . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questioning . OLIVIA I 'd hear your answering . BISHOP No ! No ! No ! Ask You on and on and answer when you will . p. 32 OLIVIA Is genius feminine ? BISHOP The question 's good . OLIVIA Your man of genius is not masculine . There 's much of woman in him . He prefers To keep the secret and the worth of it . Is it bred of disease ? BISHOP The question 's good . OLIVIA Eloquence proves not that the vocal chords Are in sad plight . So genius and the brain . The one who 's dull has a diseased brain . One 's birthright is fine feeling and a true thought Is genius satisfied ? BISHOP The question 's good . OLIVIA Rarely , if ever , is it ours to see A thinker who is trained harmoniously . He who has genius in a certain line Allies himself , or may , with the divine . But mostly is this done at the expense Of a well-planned and rounded excellence . The gods proclaim that he is doubly blessed . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distressed ! " Frony shows two ministers in .

The ministers stand on either side of table and toss ball to each other . Olivia and Frony let their hair so fall that it covers back of head and face .

Third minister enters hurriedly , lays on table doll-toys and loaf of bread . THIRD MINISTER Bishop , look well ! FRONY The game ! The game ! OLIVIA Who 'll live to see it out ? First and Second Ministers run to Olivia and Frony and fan them with their beavers . Noah puts Bishop 's beaver on table and goes to door . BISHOP Noah , you go ? NOAH My wits wo n't let me stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair . BISHOP Things seem to say : " Be philosophical . " You 'd have a game ? Let each one take a part . First and Second Ministers give their hats to Third Minister to hold . He bows and holds them with dignity . Draw near ! ( All draw near . ) Olivia , take you the ball ! Good Ministers , take each a little shoe ! The loaf of bread , Frony ! ( To Third Minister . ) Some of the toys ? p. 35 THIRD MINISTER Bishop , I 'm toying now with this headwear That wears so well a score of years might fail To see its gloss in need of hatter 's aid . Suppose my grandfather had owned these hats ; Suppose they came to me as his estate ; Suppose I brought them to a place like this ; Suppose I fanned two ladies , side by side ; Suppose I gave them to a friend to hold ; Suppose he held them in his sturdy left ; Holds them so . Suppose he drew his right and poised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Suppose  --  FIRST MINISTER We take our beavers back again . They take them and lay them aside . BISHOP ( To Third Minister , ) What would you have ? We would not slight you , sir . THIRD MINISTER ( Walks to Frony and points to bread . ) A slight division of the honors here . OLIVIA I 'll squeeze . ( She squeezes the ball . First Minister points to Second Minister 's feet and to little shoes. ) p. 36 FIRST MINISTER How many pairs will make a pair ? Frony looks at bread as though she would eat it . FRONY My teeth are many years younger than I. THIRD MINISTER ( Aside . ) I do not ask for a division there . BISHOP These trinkets seem to tell a sober tale . I see a people , friendless , ignorant , Living from hand to mouth , from jail to grave . They wander here and there , scorning the moss That clutches to the heel of industry . They swarm into the towns with empty heads , With idle hands that know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , With views of life a child might scorn to hold . They know the past but as a burial ground . No friendly spectre rises up therefrom . A thousand years of life glare in their face . They glare again and mock their seriousness . When God turns politician they are saints . Philosophy is made to lag behind . A childish intuition 's asked to point A certain finger toward the times to be . How poor , how helpless , how misguided they ! FIRST MINISTER Bishop , these trinkets tell a sober tale . OLIVIA ( Aside to Frony . ) The secret 's out ! How happened it ? p. 37 FRONY I guess ! OLIVIA Your guess ? FRONY ( Aloud . ) The Ministers kept not their word . FIRST MINISTER The Bishop makes appointments ! That means much ! OLIVIA Bishop , we would explain the whole affair . FRONY It shall be plain . BISHOP Let it come further on ! FIRST MINISTER The Bishop knows , and he 'll explain it well . BISHOP These people , my beloved people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seize the shaft That sets in motion life 's unnumbered wheels . The head ! The hand ! The hand ! The head ! These two Will save the noble remnant . Let us act ! OLIVIA Let us act ! FRONY Let us act now ! FIRST MINISTER Let us act ! BISHOP The ball means progress . OLIVIA ( Tries to make the ball bigger . ) I 'll not squeeze it more . BISHOP It means the progress that draws after it The things we eat and wear and use in life . p. 38 FIRST MINISTER These little shoes are very small . How 's that ? BISHOP The smallness shows how scant our footing is . We are a baby that 's too small to shoe . Ages ago the white man 's effort dropped A pebble in the sea of progress . Now , Circles that gird the universe are seen . We drop a pebble in to-day . We see Our pebble but the white man 's circle . Strange ! FRONY My teeth are younger far than I , but I Can see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MINISTER ( Aside . ) Each speech is seasoned with her younger teeth . OLIVIA The bread means what ? BISHOP The Bible tells us that In our own brow 's sweat shall we eat our bread . FRONY The doll-toys , Bishop ? BISHOP They are models of The many things we need to learn to make . OLIVIA ( To Minister . ) You told ! FRONY ( To Minister . ) You told ! p. 39 FIRST MINISTER We did ! SECOND MINISTER We did ! BISHOP They did ! OLIVIA We meant to play and then explain the game . We train the hand . Our boys and girls find books Are good to make , to guide , to let alone . Making a book is caging life 's best life . Go , cage life 's life before you pause to read . Books guide you when you own their soul and thought . BISHOP Industrial training is the thing at last . FRONY How dull we were ! OLIVIA How far we looked to learn A truth that 's taught by jingling pots and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we excused ? OLIVIA Address the Bishop there ! FIRST MINISTER Good-by , Bishop ! BISHOP Frony , they say good-by ! FRONY I 'll go with them and talk the matter o'er . THIRD MINISTER I 'll go with you . The bread is tempting still . Frony goes out . The Ministers follow with toys in their beaver hats . Enter Noah slowly . p. 40 BISHOP Well ! Well ! Noah ! Your wits wo n't let you stay ? Exit Noah quickly . Olivia holds the Bishop 's beaver and motions him to toss the ball . He does . She catches it in hat . OLIVIA My hat ! Is this a game of ball ? My hat ! BISHOP Olivia , my child , it is a game Of progress that I riddled out for you . She puts hat on table . OLIVIA To-morrow night at our industrial school My pupils show their work . Be there on time ! BISHOP I learned your little game . OLIVIA You learned it well . What think you of the force of handicraft ? BISHOP God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 've seen my book  --  " The Negro and His Hands ? " BISHOP I have not read it . OLIVIA I will give you one . She goes out to get book . BISHOP How she evades ! Ha ! ha ! That little game ! That little riddle on industrial work ! She thought to puzzle me and then explain . The ministers would blab ! I did the rest . She cunningly evades at every point . Caleb 's my theme . Directness wins her scorn . There am I weak . Re-enter Olivia . p. 41 OLIVIA Somehow I have misplaced The book . ' T was my last copy . BISHOP ( Aside ) I see now ! You gave the book to Caleb ? OLIVIA I did not . BISHOP ' T was in his hands . He said it was your last . You have one copy of yourself . Beware ! OLIVIA The rule of courtesy is potent still . Caleb is not the subject . She looks at books on shelf . BISHOP ( Aside . ) Books ! Books ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holds one up and reads lead-pencil writing on back . She thinks he reads title . " The Negro and His Hands . "  --  Olivia . She starts to him . OLIVIA You 've found it ? Now , take back your hasty charge . He still holds up book . BISHOP ' T is written plainly with a lead-pencil . She returns to book-shelf . ( Aside . ) Another indirection , win or lose ! ( To Olivia . ) Your ideal man ? p. 42 OLIVIA I have him . BISHOP Let me hear . OLIVIA He is a man who lives a peaceful life Which kills from a continual round with strife . His being born without a single fear Makes him of course an abject coward here . He grows so fast the growing duly stunts , And breathes so smoothly that he always grunts . The more he learns , the more he sees ' t is needed To keep his empty mental-garden weeded . When men are killed outright and resurrected He holds such little things should be expected . And to become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misapply his eyes . And seeing things as they will never be Leads ever on to true philosophy . By placing twilight at the early dawn He stops his motion while he still goes on . Humility in him is two-edged pride , And what 's in glory is not glorified . He makes an everlasting truce with death , Then straightway turns and draws his latest breath . BISHOP That character 's impossible . Again ! OLIVIA His is an eye that runs compassion 's length . His is a tongue that snares the simplest words Round simplest thoughts in beauty 's fadeless mesh . Such art as his the soul of man endears Through all the silences of all the years . Right-fettered and full-faced he halts him by Each column wrong has builded to the sky . He flaws each flaw until proof-laden runs Faith 's highest hope past earth and stars and suns. p. 43 BISHOP That is not Caleb  --  OLIVIA Well you know ' t is not . BISHOP Again ! OLIVIA How many think you I possess ? BISHOP Enough to banish Caleb . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his creed  --  his atheist 's creed . He thundered it into his mother 's ears . He blurted it above his father 's corpse . OLIVIA I think not of it now . I do not wish . Accept the creed of strenuous modern life ? BISHOP Of strenuous modern life ? Well , let me hear . OLIVIA God makes a man . Conditions make his creed . When reason 's torch has once been kindled by The vicious fancies of the ignorant And fueled by the greed and soullessness That stamp eternal vengeance everywhere , The human in us often scoffs and says : " There is no God nor Heaven to be found . Hope is the star that lights self unto self . Faith is the hand that clutches self 's decree . Mercy is oil self keeps for its own ills . Justice is hell made present by a blow . Conditions , therefore , make this creed I hold : God-like I strive , but man-like I rebel ! " Man is most man , and , therefore , most like God When he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not for his sufficiency , But quiver till the All-intelligence Applies a power whose name is very truth . Great men , not creeds , will have the right of way . p. 44 BISHOP ( He calls as to one afar off . ) Caleb ! Caleb ! You have the right of way . A great man , you ? ( Takes up his hat . ) Ha ! ha ! ( Starts to door . ) Ha ! ha ! ( Bows to Olivia . ) Ha ! ha ! ( He raises hat to put it on . Ball falls to floor . He hurries out . She begins with last line pronounced . ) OLIVIA Great men , not creeds , will have the right of way They clash in every age ; and clashing strip Some worn-out garment from the limbs of Truth . Should one put forth his eager hand and touch Truth 's perfect robes they would entangle it And hold it captive till God 's reckoning time . Exit . Curtain . p. 45 Act 2 , Scene 2 : Patsy 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a couch . Her head is bandaged and slightly elevated . Caleb sits in a chair , nodding and holding in his mouth a partly-consumed cigarette . Patsy claps her hands to arouse him . PATSY ( Clapping her hands . ) Caleb , my boy ! My breath ! My breath ! Caleb ! Come ! Come ! A kiss ! A touch ! Caleb ! My breath ! She tries to clap her hands , but simply beats the air . O , God , forgive my boy ! My  --  breath  --  is  --  short . She dies . Enter Bishop and Frony . They go to the bed and examine Patsy . Caleb awakes . FRONY ( To Caleb softly . ) Patsy is dead . CALEB ( After lighting his cigarette . ) She is ? Then bury her . He remains in the chair and smokes with dignity . Frony arranges bed , crosses Patsy 's hands and feels her forehead . BISHOP ( Pointing to bandage . ) That bandage on your mother 's head ! p. 46 CALEB I see ! BISHOP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How happened it ? CALEB You know ? Then tell . I do not deal in dreams . BISHOP ( Coming closer . ) You tell me you could listen ? CALEB Yes ! Why not ? ' T is but a serious trifle . Speak ! I hear ! Bishop steps aside , rubs his hands and looks puzzled . FRONY ( Points to chair in which Caleb sits . ) ' T was in that very chair she sat . CALEB ( Playfully . ) And dreamed . BISHOP Of you ! CALEB You fear to tell a dream ? Then speak ! FRONY ' T was from that chair she fell ! BISHOP Her bandaged head ! FRONY Her death has followed . BISHOP How she did cry out : " My baby ! My Caleb ! Perdition ! " p. 47 CALEB Whew ! You are so easily excited ! Whew ! BISHOP ( Takes hold of chair . Caleb nods in answer to each question . ) ' T was in this chair she sat ? From it she fell ? Her head was cut ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that fall ? CALEB ( Nods several times . ) I 'll nod and nod ! Your other questions now are answered . Whew ! The dream ! FRONY I heard her tell it oft . I wept Each time . BISHOP Who could refrain ? CALEB Tell it and see . BISHOP After this manner did she speak . CALEB ( Lightly . ) Come on ! BISHOP " Methought my Caleb was a babe again . I pressed his head to mine and crooned and crooned A baby ditty  --  old , nonsensical  --  Yet ever sweet to each true mother 's heart . When he said dad I kissed his chin , mouth , nose , Eyes , forehead ; breathed and kissed them o'er again . Five years passed by . He sat upon my knee While I placed roses on his tender brow . Ten years passed by . I saw him stand above His school-mates in their studies and their games . Again I looked and saw a man full-grown  --  I , bent and gray , leaning upon his arm  --  Loved by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the robber , beckoned to my babe . I pinched his chin and kissed it o'er and o'er . I clapped his hands and kissed until he laughed . I rubbed his feet and kissed and kissed and kissed . I fell asleep . When I awoke my babe Was lying on the floor . Thinking ' t was hurt , I screamed my babe. Straightway it was a man  --  Caleb , the heartless . Caleb , then I called . A flame of fire sprang up . It circled him . I cried : Perdition ! Save ! O , God ! O , God ! I leaped to help him . O , this head of mine ! ' T will be my death ! A mother 's love is all Of God 's great love and all the million pangs Of mother-hood can drive into her soul . " p. 48 CALEB I have refrained . Come , Frony , with your tears . Frony removes bandage from Patsy 's head and shows scar across forehead . FRONY This scar will place the word ingratitude ' Cross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tame speech . BISHOP Your mother told this dream . You heard ! You scoffed ! You came one morning , hungry , barefooted . " Shoes , Patsy ! Money , Patsy ! " This you said . She leaned to kiss you and  --  CALEB I shoved her off . That scar is ugly . My fine taste rebelled . BISHOP She saw your feet . She thought of how she kissed Them in her dream . She stooped  --  CALEB I coldly said : " ' T is not caresses . It is shoes I want . " BISHOP You got them ? CALEB Yes ! It was her place to give . Frony looks upon Patsy . FRONY Her eye-lids quiver ! She 's alive  --  alive ! Patsy 's alive ! Bishop runs to bed . Caleb is undisturbed. p. 49 BISHOP Let 's see ! No ! No ! She 's gone ! CALEB You are so easily excited . Whew ! BISHOP You slew your father . Now , I understand . You have all God condemns the Devil for . CALEB Sink not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father through your mind 's eye . CALEB No ! He 's gone ! Let him continue ! Speak ! I sleep ! He pretends to sleep . He snores . BISHOP You turn yourself into a spurious coin And boast that it has naught that recommends . Bad , worse , worst , worsted you ! Naught can come next ! He snores more loudly . The Bishop shakes him roughly . You sleep ? The slaying of your father wins A blissful rest ? You sleep ? Defaming her Who gave you life  --  Caleb tries to rise . CALEB Let me confess ! BISHOP Is just ? You sleep ? CALEB ( On his feet . ) I would confess ! p. 50 BISHOP ( Forcing him to his knees . ) No ! No ! Sleep on ! CALEB I will confess ! I 'd wed your foster-child ! BISHOP You 'd wed ? I 'd slay !

It rises immediately on next scene. p. 51 Act 2 , Scene 3 : Patsy 's Orchard Enter Noah , chased in by Caleb . CALEB ( Yells in Noah 's ear . ) Hello , graybeard ! Would have good company ? Have mine and answer as I question you . Olivia and I  --  You see the point ? Too dull to see ? You need a shaking up ! Shakes him . Olivia and I would  --  ( Noah shows disgust . ) How you frown !

I prophesy for you . Now , listen well ! A thief you 'll be . Makes movements of picking chickens . Chickens ! chickens ! chickens ! You 've stolen one . You have it in the pot . Your thumb and finger grip a steaming leg . Some of the meat is sizzling in your mouth . A voice without says : " Noah , let me in . I fear my chicken 's feeding in your coop . " " No ! no !

No ! No ! Graybeard ! You gamble with yourself , Or rather with the lice upon your back . They bite a hundred places all at once . You 'd season pain with fun . Therefore , you cast The dice to see where first to make attack . Noah starts to leave . Caleb leads him back by his beard . I 'll tell you when to shun a bit of truth .

There is empty space on wall where horse-shoes are to be hung . Boys and girls are uniformed . On the rising of the curtain the Bishop stands alone . He strikes the anvil with a hammer and lays it aside . BISHOP That sound is the password to Negro enfranchisement . Muscle woos the field . Brain woos the market . Wedded they conquer the world . He , in whom they unite , may issue the contract for running all things and award it to himself . Enter Olivia examining a piece of sewing . The Bishop follows her and tries to steal a kiss . OLIVIA ( Turning . ) As many as you wish , Bishop-father . BISHOP ( Kisses her . ) Some boys came to steal my roses . I tapped upon the window-pane and frightened them away . They came again . Again I tapped . Again they fled . I bethought me of some such trick my boyhood 's follies knew . I said : " Come , boys ! Roses , boys !

The clocks seem to say : " Stop ! " The watches say : " Go on ! " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruined . When silence reigns , the monkey says : " I have set progress a foot . " ' T is a damning combination . p. 58 OLIVIA Emphasize it , Bishop . BISHOP Many a naked African is superior to the Negro American collegian . His simple thought is his own , and he can give it an original setting . Witness the proverbs and fables among the wild Africans . Witness the vast amount of undigested thought in the other case . Enter four girls who examine tools and other things on boys ' side . OLIVIA How make the Negro more original ? BISHOP He must follow the laws of inquisitiveness and necessity . Till then he is a puppet where there is no material for laughter , and is straightway silenced out of court . OLIVIA Give an example . BISHOP I am alone . I see the heavens , the earth , and a wild boar . The boar would pierce me , but I seize a rock and break off its tusks . When hungry I slay the boar and eat . As I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I arise and build me a house in the boughs of the trees . As I look down upon the damp earth and the bones of the boar I see what lessons I have learned from necessity . As I look from my house and behold the moon , stars , and blue expanse above I grow inquisitive . Gratitude and inquisitiveness wed , and from them I spring a child of song to sing and sing of what I have seen and felt . p. 59 OLIVIA How cultivate his own style ? BISHOP His thought must spring from action , and his words from sheer necessity . He who has a thought has a style . Start a handful of snow down a hill . At the foot it is a huge ball . Thus thought finds words for its utterance . OLIVIA Give an example of thought and style . BISHOP A dog attacks a cat . The cat claws not , bites not . It simply humps its back , and the dog retires . OLIVIA What will you draw from that ? BISHOP A proverb showing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hump in the back , rather than the sharpness of the claws , protects the cat . OLIVIA One more ! BISHOP A person with rheumatism is undignified in movements . OLIVIA Now , for that . BISHOP Few cultivate dignity and rheumatism at the same time . OLIVIA The Negro would be literary .
