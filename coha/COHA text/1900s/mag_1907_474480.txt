A GREAT volume might be written on the intelligence of plants , even as Romanes wrote one on ani- mat intelligence . But this sketch has no pretension towards becoming a manual of that kind ; and I wish merely to call attention to a few interesting little events that happen beside us in this world in which we a little too vaingloriously think ourselves privileged . These events are not selected , but taken , by way of instances , as the random result of observations and circumstances . I propose , however , in these short notes to concern myself above all with the flower , for it is in the flower that the greatest marvels shine forth . I set aside , for the moment , the carnivorous flowers , Droseras , Nepenthes and the rest , which approach the animal kingdom and would demand a special and expansive study , in order to devote myself only to the true flower , the flower properly so called , which is believed to be motionless , insentient , passive and inanimate . To separate facts from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had foreseen and conceived in the manner of men all that it has realized . We shall see later how much we must leave to it , how much take away from it . For the present , let it take the stage , alone , like a splendid princess endowed with reason and will . There is no denying that it appears provided with both ; and to deprive it of either we must needs resort to very obscure hypotheses . It is there , then , motionless on its stalk , sheltering in a dazzling tabernacle the reproductive organs of the plant . Apparently it has but to allow the mysterious union of the stamens and the pistil to be accomplished in this tabernacle of love . And many flowers do so consent . But to many others there is propounded , big with awful threats , the normally insoluble problem of cross-fertilization . As the result of what numberless and immemorial experiments did they observe that self-fertilization , that is , the fertilization of the stigma by the pollen falling from the anthers that surround it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ species ? They have observed nothing , we are told , nor profited by any experience . The force of things quite simply and gradually eliminated the seeds and plants weakened by self-fertilization . Soon there survived only those with some anomaly , such as the exaggerated length of the pistil , rendering it inaccessible to the anthers , which were thus prevented from fertilizing themselves . These exceptions alone survived , through a thousand revolutions ; heredity finally determined the work of chance ; and the normal type disappeared . We shall see presently what light these explanations throw . For the moment , let us go out into the garden or tho field to study more closely two or three curious inventions of the genius of the flower . And already , without going far from the house , we have here , frequented by the bees , a sweet-scented cluster that is inhabited by a very skilful mechanic . There is no one , even among the least countrified , but knows the good Sage . It is on unpretending Labiata and bears a very modest flower which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rays of the sun in passing . For that matter , it presents a large number of varieties , not all of which ? this is a curious detail ? have adopted or carried to the same pitch of perfection the system of fertilizing which we are about to examine . But I am here concerned only with the most common Sage , that which , at this moment , as though to celebrate spring 's passage , covers with violet draperies all the walls of my terraces of olive . I assure you that the great marble palaces that await the kings were never more luxuriously , more happily , more fragrantly adorned . One seems to catch the very perfumes of the light of the sun at its hottest , when noonday strikes . ... To come to details , the stigma , or female organ , of the flower is contained in the upper lip , which forms a sort of hood , in which are also the two stamens , or male organs . To prevent these from fertilizing the stigma which shares the same nuptial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so that they have no hope of reaching it . Moreover , in order to avoid any accident , the flower has made itself proterandrous , that is to say , the stamens ripen before the pistil , so that , when the female is fit to conceive , the males have already disappeared . It is necessary , therefore , that an external force should intervene to accomplish the union by carrying a foreign pollen to the abandoned stigma . A certain number of flowers , the anemophilous flowers , leave this care to the wind . But the Sage ? and this is the more general case ? is entomophiIous , that is to say , it loves insects and relies upon their collaboration alone . For the rest , it is not unaware ? for it knows many things ? that it lives in a world where it is best to expect no sympathy , no charitable aid . It does not waste time , therefore , in making useless appeals to the courtesy of the bee . The bee , like all that struggles against death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and for her kind and is in. no way concerned to render a service to the flowers that feed her . Bow shall she be obliged , in spite of herself , or at least unconsciously , to fulfil her matrimonial office ? . Observe the wonderful love - trap contrived by the Sage : at the bottom of its tent of purple silk it distils a few drops of nectar ; this is the bait . But , barring the access to the sugary field , stand two parallel stalks , somewhat similar to the beams of a Dutch drawbridge . Right at the top of each stalk is a great sack , the anther , overflowing with pollen ; at the bottom two smaller sacks serve as a counterpoise . When the bee enters the flower , in order to reach the nectar , she has to push the small sacks with her head . The two stalks , which turn on an axis , at once topple over and the upper anthers descend and touch the sides of the insect , which they cover with fertilizing dust . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fly back and replace the mechanism in. its first position ; and all is ready to repeat the work at the next visit . However , this is only the first half of the play : the sequel is enacted in another scene . In a neighboring flower , whose stamens have just withered , there enters upon the stage the pistil that awaits the pollen . It issues slowly from the hood , lengthens out , stoops , curves down , becomes forked so as , in its turn , to bar the entrance to the tent . On its way to the nectar , the head of the bee passes freely under the hanging fork , which , however , grazes her back and sides exactly at the spots touched by the stamens . The two-cleft stigma greedily absorbs the silvery dust and the impregnation is accomplished . For the rest , it is easy , by introducing a straw or the end of a match , to set the apparatus going and to take stock of the striking and marvellous combination and precision of all its movements . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will spare you the enumeration of the majority of their scientific names , which are not always elegant : Salvia Pratensis , Officinal-is ( our Garden Sage ) , Ilorminum , Horminoicles , Glntinosa , Solaro , Roemeri , Azurea , Pitcheri , Sigendens ( the magnificent Sage of our baskets ) and so on . There is not , perhaps , one but has modified some detail of the machinery which we have just examined . Some ? and this , I think , is a doubtful improvement ? have doubled and sometimes trebled the length of the pistil , so that it not only emerges from the hood , but makes a wide plume-like curve in front of the entrance to the flower . They thus avoid the just possible danger of the fertilization of the stigma by the anthers dwelling in the same hood ; tut , on the other hand , it may happen , if the proterandry be not strict , that the insect , on leaving the flower , deposits on the stigma the pollen of the very anthers with which the stigma cohabits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make the anthers diverge farther apart so as to strike the sides of the animal with greater precision ; others , lastly , have not succeeded in arranging and adjusting every part of the mechanism . I find , for instance , not far from my purple Sage , near the well , under a cluster of Oleanders , a family of white flowers tinted with pale lilac , which has no suggestion or trace of a lever . The stamens and the stigma are heaped up promiscuously in the middle of the corolla . All seems left to chance and disorganized . I have no doubt that it would be possible , for any one bringing together the different varieties of this Labiata , to reconstruct the whole history , to follow all the stages of the invention , from the primitive disorder of the white Sage under my eyes to the latest improvements of the Salvia Pratensis . What conclusion are we to drawl Is the system still in the experimental stage among the aromatic tribe ? Has it not yet left the period of models and " trial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screw in the Medick family ? Has the excellence of the automatic lever not yet been unanimously admitted ? Can it be , then , that everything is not unchangeable and preestablished ; and are they still discussing and experimenting in this world which we believe to be fatally , organically regular ? Be this as it may , the flower of most varieties of the Sage presents an elegant solution of the great problem of cross-fertilization . But , even as , among men , a new invention is at once taken up , simplified , improved by a host of small indefatigable seekers , so , in the world of what we may call mechanical flowers , the patent of the Sage has been turned over and in many details strangely perfected . A pretty general Scrophularinea , the Common Lousewort ( Pedicularis Sylvatica ) , or Red Rattle , which you must surely have noticed in the shady parts of small woods and heaths , has introduced some extremely ingenious modifications . The shape of the corolla is almost the same as of that of the Sage ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the upper hood . Only the lit-tle moist tip of the pistil protrudes from the hood , while the anthers remain strictly captive . In this silky tabernacle , therefore , the organs of the two sexes are very close together and even in immediate contact ; nevertheless , thanks to an enactment quite different from that of the Sage , self-fertilization is absolutely impossible . The anthers , in fact , form two sacks full of powder ; each of the sacks has only one opening and they are juxtaposed in such a way that the openings coincide and mutually close each other . They arc forcibly kept inside the hood , on their curved , springy stalks , by a sort of teeth . The bee or humblebee that enters the flower to sip its nectar necessarily pushes these teeth aside ; and the sacks are no sooner set free than they fly up , are flung outside and alight upon the back of the insect . Rut the genius and foresight of the flower go farther than this . As Hermann Miller , who was the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Lousewort , observes ( I sin quoting from a summary ) : " If the stamens struck the insect while preserving their relative positions , not a grain of pollen would leave them , because their orifices reciprocally close each other . But a contrivance which is as simple as it is ingenious overcomes the difficulty . The lower lip of the corolla , instead of being symmetrical and horizontal , is irregular and slanting , so that one side of it is higher by a few millimetres than the other . The humble-bee resting upon it must herself necessarily stand in a sloping position . The result is that her head strikes first one and then the other of the projections of the corolla . Therefore the releasing of the stamens also takes place successively ; and , one after the other , their orifices , now freed , strike the insect and sprinkle it with fertilizing dust . " When the humblebee next passes to another flower , she inevitably fertilizes it , because ? and I have purposely omitted this detail ? what she meets first of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corolla , is the stigma , which grazes her just at the spot where she is about , the moment after , to be struck by the stamens , the exact spot where she has already been touched by the stamens of the flower which she has last left . " These instances might be multiplied indefinitely ; every flower has its idea , its system , its acquired experience which it turns to advantage . When we examine closely their little inventions , their diverse methods , we are reminded of those enthralling exhibitions of machine-tools , of machines for making machinery , in which the mechanical genius of man reveals all its resources . But our mechanical genius dates from yesterday , whereas floral mechanism has been at work for thousands of years . When the flowers made their appearance upon our earth , there were no models around them which they could imitate ; they had to derive everything from within themselves . At the period when we had not gone beyond the club , the bow and the flail ; in the comparatively recent days when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the ram ; at the time ? it was last year , so to speak ? when our masterpieces were the catapult , the clock and the weaving-loom , the Sage had contrived the beams and counterweights of its lever of precision , and the Lousewort its sacks closed up as though for a. scientific experiment , the successive releasing of its springs and the combination of its inclined planes . Who , say a hundred years ago , dreamt of the properties of the screw which the Maple and the Lime-tree have been turning to account ever since the birth of the trees ? When shall we succeed in building a parachute or a flying-machine as rigid , as light , as subtle and as safe as that of the Dandelion ? When shall we discover the secret of cutting in so frail a fabric as the silk of the petals a spring as powerful as that which projects into space the golden pollen of the Spanish Broom ? As for the Momordica or Squirting Cucumber , whose . name I mentioned at the beginning of tills , little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miraculous strength ? Do you know the Momordica ? It is a humble Cucurbilacsa , fairly common along the Mediterranean coast . Its prickly fruit , which resembles a small cucumber , is endowed with inexplicable vitality end energy . You have but to touch it , at the moment of its maturity , and it suddenly quits its peduncle by means of a convulsive contraction and shoots through the hole produced by the wrench , mingled with numerous seeds , a mucilaginous stream of such wonderful intensity that it carries the seed to four or five yards ' distance from the natal plant . The action is as extraordinary , in proportion , as though we were to succeed in emptying ourselves with a single spasmodic movement and in precipitating all our organs , our viscera , and our blood to a distance of half a mile from our skin and skeleton . For the rest , a large number of seeds have ballastic methods and employ sources of energy that are more or less unknown to us . Remember , for instance , the explosions of the Colza and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artillery is the Spurge . The Spurge is an Ruphorbiacea of our climes , a tall and fairly ornamental " weed , " which often exceeds the height of man . I have a branch of Spurge at this moment on my table , steeped in a glass of water . It has trifid , greenish berries , which contain the seeds . From time to time , one of these berries bursts noisily ; and the seeds , gifted with a prodigious initial velocity , strike the furniture and the walls on every side . If one of them hits your face , you feel as though you had been stung by an insect , so extraordinary is the penetrating force of these tiny seeds , each no larger than a pin 's head . Examine the berry , look for the springs that give it life : you shall not find the secret of this force , which is as invisible as that of our nerves . The Spanish Broom ( Spartium , Junceum ) has not only pods , but flowers fitted with springs . You may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this powerful family of the Brooms . Greedy of life , poor , sober , robust , refusing no soil , no trial , it forms along the paths and in the mountains of the South huge tufted balls , sometimes three yards high , which , between May and June , are covered with a magnificent bloom of pure gold , whose perfumes , mingled with those of its habitual neighbor , the Honeysuckle , spread limier the fury of a fierce sun delights that are not to be described save by evok -- ing celestial dews , Elysian springs , cool streams and starry transparencies in the Follow of azure grottos . . . . The flower of this Broom , like that of all the papilionaceous Leguminosw , resembles the flowers of the Peas of our gardens ; and its lower petals , shaped like the beak of a galley , contain hermetically the stamens and the pistil . So long as it is not ripe , the bee that explores it finds it impenetrable . But , as soon . as the moment of maturity arrives for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weight of the insect that rests upon it , the golden chamber bursts , hurling with violence and afar , over the visitor , over the flowers around , a cloud of luminous powder , which a broad petal , shaped like a penthouse , casts down upon the stigma that is to be impregnated . As I have said , one could prolong indefinitely the list of the ingenious inventions of the flowers . I refer those who might wish to study these problems thoroughly to the works of Christian Konrad Sprengel , who was the first , in 1793 , in his curious book , Das entdeckte Geheirnniss der lVatur im . Batt and in der Befruchtung der Btu men , to analyze the functions of the different organs in the Orchids ; next , to the books of Charles Darwin , Dr. Hermann Miller of Lippstadt , Hildebrand , De1pino the Italian , Sir William Hooker , Robert Brown and many others . We shall find the most perfect and the most harmonious manifestations of vegetable intelligence among the Orchids . In these writhing and eccentric flowers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with an unusual fire , pierces the wall that separates the two kingdoms . For the rest , this name of Orchid must not be allowed to mislead us or make us believe that we have to do here only with rare and precious flowers , with those hothouse queens which seem to demand the care of the goldsmith rather than the gardener . Our native wild flora , which comprises all our modest weeds , " numbers more than twenty-five species of Orchids , including just tho most ingenious and complicated . It is these which Charles Darwin studied in his book , On the various Contrivancesby which Orchids are fertilized by Insects , which is the wonderful history of the most heroic efforts of the soul of the flower . It is out of the question that I should summarize here , in a few lines , that abundant and fairylike biography . Nevertheless , since we are on the subject of the intelligence of flowers , it is necessary that we should give some idea of the methods and the mental habits of that one which excels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the butterfly to de exactly what it wishes , in the prescribed form and time . It is not easy to explain without figures the extraordinarily complex mechanism of the Orchid . Nevertheless , I will Try to give a sufficient idea of it with the aid of more or less approximate comparisons while avoiding as far as possible the use of technical terms such as retinfacatum , labellum , rostellum and so forth , which evoke no precise image in the minds of persons unfamiliar with botany . Let us take one of the most widely distributed Orchids in our regions , the Orals Maculata , for instance , or rather , because it is a little larger and therefore more easily observed , the Orchis Latifolia , the Marsh . Orchid , commonly known as the Meadow Rocket . It is a perennial plant , which attains a height of an inch or more . It is fairly common in the woods and the damp meadows and bears a. thyrso of little pink flowers which blossom in May and June . The typical flower of our Orchids represents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dragon . The lower lip , which is very lung and which hangs in the form of a jagged or dentate apron , serves as a landing-place for the insect . The upper lip rounds into a sort of hood , which shelters the essential organs ; while , at the back of the flower , beside the peduncle , there falls a kind of spur or long , pointed horn , which contains the nectar .. In most flowers , the stigma , or female organ , is a more or less viscid little tuft which , at the end of a frail stalk , patiently awaits the coming of the pollen . In the Orchid , this traditional installation has become irrecognizable . At the back of the mouth , in the place occupied in the throat by the uvuhi , are two closely welded stigmas , above which rises a third stigma modified into an extraordinary organ . At its top , it carries a sort of little pouch , ur , more correctly , a sort of stoup , which is called the rostellum . This stoup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiny balls , whence issue two short stalks laden at their upper extremity with a packet of grains of pollen carefully tied up . Let us now see what happens when an insect enters the flower . She lands on the lower lip , outspread to receive her , and , attracted by the scent of the nectar , seeks to reach the horn that contains it , right at the back . But the passage is purposely very narrow ; and the insect 's head , as she advances , necessarily strikes the stoup . The latter , mindful of the least shock , is at once ruptured along a convenient Tine and lays bare the two little balls steeped in the viscid fluid . These , coming into immediate contact with the visitor 's skull , fasten to it and become firmly stuck to it , so that , when the insect leaves the flower , she carries them away and , with them , the two stalks which rise from them and which end in the packets of tied-up pollen . We therefore have the insect capped with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a difficult work now visits a neighboring flower . If her horns remained stiff , they would simply strike with their pollen masses the other pollen masses soaking in the vigilant stoup and no event would spring from the pollen mingling with pollen . But here the genius , the experience and the foresight of the Orchid become apparent . The Orchid has minutely calculated the time needed for the insect to suck the nectar and repair to the next flower and has ascertained that . this requires , on an average , thirty seconds . We have soon that the packets of pollen are carried on two short stalks inserted into the viscid balls . Now at the point of insertion there is , under either stalk , a small membranous disk , whose only function is , at the end of thirty seconds , to contract and throw forward the stalks , so that they bend and describe en arch of ninety degrees . This is the result of a new calculation , not of time on this occasion , but of space . The two horns of pollen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front of her head , so that , when she enters the next flower , they will just strike the two welded stigmas over which hangs the stoup . This is not all and the genius of the Orchid has not yet exhausted all its foresight . The stigma which receives the blow of the packet is coated with a viscid substance . If this substance were as powerfully adhesive as that contained in the stoup , the pollen-masses , after their stalks were broken , would be caught in it and remain fixed to it whole ; and their destiny would be ended . This must not be ; it is important that the chances of the pollen should not be exhausted at a single venture , but rather that they should be multiplied to the greatest possible extent . The flower that counts the seconds and measures the lines is a chemist to boot and distils two sorts of gums : one extremely clinging and hardening as soon as it touches the air , to glue the pollen-horns to the insect 's head ; the other greatly lenified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just prehensile enough slightly to unfasten or loosen the tenuous and elastic threads with which the grains of pollen are tied up . Some of these grains-stick to it , but the pollinic mass is not destroyed ; and , when the insect visits other flowers , she continues her fertilizing labors almost indefinitely . Have I expounded the whole miracle ? No ; I have still to eel attention to many a neglected detail : among others , to the movement of the little stoup , which , after its membrane has been ruptured to unmask the viscid balls , immediately lifts up its lip in order to keep in good condition , in the sticky liquid , the packet of pollen which the insect may not have carried off . We must also note the very curiously combined divergence of the pollinic stalks on the head of the insect , as well as certain chemical precautions common to all plants ; for the experiments made quite recently by M. Gaston Bonnier seem to prove that every flower , in order to preserve its species intact , secretes poisons that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that we see ; but here , as in all things , the real , the great miracle begins where our power of vision ends .
