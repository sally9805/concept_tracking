txt Senator Foraker began an open : ight on the Taft men in Ohio to-night . His first move was a challenge that surprised the Taft men . He offered to go before the Republican primaries in Ohio with a proposal that delegates to a State Convention whom they should name should express the choice of the people for the United States Senatorship and the Presidency . This move undoubtedly is ** to force into the open not only Secretary Taft , but Representative Burton , who is being groomed for Foraker 's seat . Another move made by Mr. Foraker has been to demand the renomination of Gus ' . Harris . Taft men are saying that this action . will prove a boomerang , as Harris has aligned himself with them and is their candidate , Challenge by Foraker . Mr. Foraker says in his statement : " i have been so busily occupied that I have had neither time nor disposition to even think about politics , either State or National , especially politics that belong to next year . " It seems to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , in view of the interviews and announcements of one kind and another that are appearing in the newspapers , I feel that I may with propriety say that I do not want any political honors from the Republicans of Ohio without their hearty approval . In order that there may be no doubt as to their preferences I shall at the proper time request the Republican State Central Committee to issue a call for a Republican State Convention , to be composed of delegates elected by the Republicans of the State at duly authorized primary elections , for the purpose not only of nominating candidates for State offices to be voted for at our next State election , but also to determine the preference of the Republicans of Ohio as to candidates for United States Senator and for President . Asks for Open Discussion . " If this suggestion should meet with favor , it should be provided that the primary elections shall be held at a convenient Bine long enough after the call therefor has been issued to enable all who are interested in the work of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the people and discuss the public questions about which we are all concerned , so that the people who are interested my act intelligently in the selection of their delegates . thus bringing this selection as nearly to a direct popular vote us is possible under the laws now In force . " I have no opinions to conceal from my constituents , and there is no point in my public record as to which I am not ready to render them a full account . " Mr. Foraker does not say that he will be a candidate to succeed President Roosevelt . but it is generally understood among his friends in Washington that at a later date he will formally announce his candidacy , and will enter the fight to get the indorsement of his own State . Dow Foraker Went Wrong . The announcement of State Supt. of Insurance Arthur I. Vorys that he would support Secretary Taft for the Presidential nomination led Senator Foraker , It is believed , to issue the statement outlining his position . Vorys is to manage the Taft campaign . Foraker seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He seems to have jumped to the conclusion that Gov . Harris was to be put aside , and he telephoned to his newspapers in Cincinnati this message : " The attack upon Gov . Harris Is cowardly , and It will arouse to the support of the noble old Governor every man who believes In fair play . He is in all probability the last old soldier we will have as Governor of Ohio , and we must elect him by an overwhelming majority . Thero must be no backing , no halting . We must line up solidly for Gov . Harris , and we will . " About this telephone message of Fora , ker 's there is no doubt . Exactly where he got the ' idea on which he based it no one knows , for according to reports from Ohio Gov . Harris , while not active In the movement , is a Taft man heart and soul , a fact of which Foraker was not aware . It further appears that Harris is the candidate of the Taft men for Governor , A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ P. Taft , the Secretary 's brother , has published this over his signature : " We believe that the overwhelming sentirdent in Ohio is favorable to Secretary Taft for the Presidency and our efforts are to give this sentiment concrete form , so that it shall be expressed emphatically at the proper time . It is , furthermore , obvious that Gov . Harris is his own logical successor as Governor of Ohio and should have the unanimous support of the party . " This amounts to a formal launching of the Taft boom , and a declaration for Harris as the Taft candidate . Foraker , It thus appears , made a false start in his fight . It seems assured that the State Administration will line up with Taft . Every eye here is on Ohio . One of the leading Republicans in the Senate said to-day that in his opinion the fight there would develop into the ugliest and meanest one in recent political history . Foraker 's action in appealing to a primary is a desperate play , but so daring that it is likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men here to see how the Taft men can afford to refuse his proposition .
