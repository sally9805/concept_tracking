( Bus . with pocket hairbrush , mirror at back ) I did think my chance had come when she sent for me to Cumberland . I got the hair-dresser to touch out all the grey ones , thinking I might fetch the old girl , but as soon as she saw me she was very rude , called me a fright , and began asking some damned awkward questions about my late wife 's trust money . Just my luck ! ( sits at writing table ) Pearl . ( reading from letter which Ruby holds ) " And , my darling Ruby -- if your father dies "  - -  there 's not much " if " about it . He does .

You 've never obeyed me in your life -- either of you -- but I 've made up my mind this time , and damme -- I 'll make you obey me . I swear that dear cousin Jack shall be my son-in-law. ( crosses C. ) Pearl . ( going quietly to him , standing between him and Ruby ) If such is your determination , I will sacrifice myself . Plant . ( contemptuously ) You ! Ruby . ( rushing to Pearl ) You sha n't ! Pearl . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in heaven now-a-days . Ruby . No , no , Pearl . you 're too good . I 'd rather marry him myself . Pearl . You can't -- you know you can't -- you 're engaged . Ruby . Sneak ! ( pinches her arm ) ( Pearl howls . ) Plant . ( shouts ) Stop quarrelling ! Such rivalry between sisters is most unseemly . What do I dress you alike for ? Pearl . To save expense . Plant . No , miss , to save jealousy , and I 'll have no Jealousy about this . Settle it amicably between you , ( aside , crosses to R. ) Good idea ! They 'll go it faster without me . I 'll leave ' em alone with him . ( aloud ) Dear , dear , I 've forgotten something I particularly want to show Jack . I 'll step over to our apartments --  --  Ruby . Pa , you ca n't leave us alone in a bachelor 's room ! Plant . Hang it , you 're cousins , and you 're two to one . Now , remember , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word , and you know my word , like my profession , is law ! ( Exit Plant . ) Pearl . We 've got a nice thing in fathers , ( looking out of window ) He 's brought us up to London to put us on the market Ruby . Yes , and by a cheap excursion . ( goes L. ) Pearl . Now we know why we 've come to encamp just across the street -- it 's to lay siege to a penniless cousin . ( picks up " Quayle on Muscles " off couch , takes it to table ) Ruby . ( at small table up stage L. , opens case , shrieks ) Ach ! knives ! Pearl . ( looks up from book ) You would n't do for a doctor 's wife , whatever Pa says , ( looks at picture ) Besides , you 're not free , but I am. ( sadly ) Ruby . Pearl . there 's Waverly !

He 's been staying at Southsea with Lieutenant Merry for a whole week , ( turns page ) and father 's been away the whole time . ( turns page ) And I 've given him every possible encouragement .

( shuts book and puts it back on couch ) Pearl . Yes , you were ! ( laughs ) Ruby . How dare you ! I never gave Andrew the slightest encouragement , ( sits on sofa ) Pearl . My dear Ruby . I judge by results . He proposed to you the second day . ( comes and sits by her on sofa ) Ruby . What about you ? You let Waverly kiss you . Pearl . Only once -- just there ; ( touches her cheek ) and that was after a dance , which does n't count . No , I 've gone as far with Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flirt , ( pointedly looking at Ruby ) can go , and he 's said nothing -- yet So I 'm going to get father to invite Doctor Sheppard down to Southsea , and I 'll flirt desperately with him . ( Ruby crosses C. ) You see , I shall be obeying father -- I shall get you out of your difficulty , and it will force Waverly to say something -- definite , ( sits on the word ) Ruby . Oh , Pearl ! What a clever idea ! ( thinks ) Andrew has n't been quite so attentive since I accepted him . And , as you say , dear papa must be obeyed , so I 'll flirt with Doctor Sheppard too , before Andrew -- it 'll do him a world of good . Pearl . Doctor Sheppard ! Ruby . No , Andrew , of course . Oh , Pearl . I wonder how they 're getting on without us ? Do they ever talk about us , do you think ? Pearl . Of course they do -- everybody talks about us -- in Southsea . Andrew .
