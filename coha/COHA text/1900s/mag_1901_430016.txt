MY subject , and , sadly . my purpose , may be hackneyed . Neverthe less , it is plain that , despite all that has been said and done , even the best of men and women in the North have not yet arrived at the point of insight and knowledge of conditions essential to real sympathy with their fellow-citizens of the Southern States . I fear that the average Northerner is at best indifferent , and that there are those who regard the Southern people , in politics at any rate , with something akin to scorn . Once more , then , let me present the case for the South as an appeal to the sympathy , the patriotism , and the common sense of the North . I confess that I am prompted to the writing of this article by the result of the recent election ? seeing that for two years surely , for sev eral more probably , the affairs of our nation are to be in the hands of the Republican party , in which obviously there is scant sympathy with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I lay no charge against the party . It were too much to expect that , having so few representa tives of the South in its official ranks , and having received a steadfast opposition from the South from the beginning , the Republican party should sympathize with the Southern people or in the slightest degree appreciate their point of view . Without irony , however , let me interject that a party that has done so much to make the South a part of the Un ion owes it to itself to regard the Southern people as of one common country , and to be concerned for them as zealously as for those of faith ful New England . Now let me point out some more or less familiar facts . The Southern people are a conquered people . They fought to the bitter end . But history contains nothing to surpass the nobility with which they have conducted themselves since 1865 . The soldiers of Lee lived to become , with whole hearts , citizens of our common country ; and , without excep tion , they have reared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Confederacy is but a memory . There is not the remotest vestige of the passion that swept the male population of our section against the North : there is a natural , unrestrained love for our common country . We honor  |  | the Confederate veteran , we glory in his valor , we cherish the fame of leaders lost ; but of actual feeling against the Union there is not , l repeat , the remotest vestige . One born since the war finds it almost impossible to realize that the war occurred ; and the records of its bitterness and intensity can scarcely be believed . Children of ease , softened by a stately civilization , unused to labor , the Southern people found themselves at the close of the war confronted with conditions that would have destroyed them , had it been possible ? labor gone , property gone , lands run down , currency abolished , male population sadly reduced , national hopes utterly wrecked . The oftportrayed spectacle of the Southern soldier with armless sleeve returning to find his home in ruins and desolation can never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , but of tens of thousands . All this represents only the background . Had there been no more than this , the New South would have arisen from the ashes long ago . But hear me . Confronting that soldier was a mass of freed negroes , unversed in government , suscept ible to every kind of darkness , yet invested with the high prerogatives of Anglo-Saxon self-sovereignty and cooperative government . There were 4,000,00 ( I of them , all told , 850,000 of them voters ! But this is not the worst of it . ' I'hc fernier master might have instructed his one-time slave . But , from the North came another army of invasion , camp-followers and adventurers , in the name of I cconstruction , who ? destroyers that they were , as unworthy of the North as the South ? filled the hearts of the negroes with a bitterness and a suspicion of their former masters that had not been known before . If the North wonders why the white is against the black let it read history and learn that sons of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the white man . Out of these circumstances has come the solid South ? a sectional protest against sectional passion . It is only thirty-five years since ; but one may reckon it a hundred when he sees the changed conditions . The stately antebellum civilization passed , not to return ; the country estate is known no more ; the very atmosphere has passed away . Here is a prosperous people , quite as happy as that other day knew ; here are thriving cities where once were only court-houses ; here are thousands of small , but busy , farms where there were hundreds of greater and more idle ones ; here is a social life quite as hearty , if not so aristocratic , as that of slavery times ; here are manufacturing enterprises in ever-increasing numbers where formerly the thrill of industrial enterprise was never known ; here , in brief , is as hopeful a people as the sun shines on . The Southern people have come to this through agonies of poverty ;  | and , though they were compelled by necessity to work on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have paid for every thing they have almost tw ice over . It is a tribute not more to the pro ductiveness of their lands than to their industry and the courage of their hearts . They have reared churches and schools everywhere ; they have built cities , railroads , and factories ; and , at present , with a population schooled in adversity at last Cone into the borderland of prosperity , they are charged wiith the thrill of an industrial impulse that will astonish their Northern brothers long before it shall have spent its force . The Southern pi plc Were , not long perplexed with the difficulty of commercial and social readjustment . Energy and labor and self-respect were required ; and these could not be destroyed . But the South struggles yet with her political problem , thrust upon her by that greatest of civil blunders , the enfranchisement of a numerous host of ignorant men of a lower race , who were incapable of the ballot , and who , it is unreasonable to hope , can be made fit for its responsibilities within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war was not the loss of slaves , for from the day of surrender until now negro labor has been as cheap as it was in slavery ; not the loss of money , not the loss of hope ? all these have been overcome , and in their stead we have real blessings ? but the enfranchisement of the negroes . If the negroes in North Carolina have a more constant friend than myself , if they have a friend who has spoken more frequently in their behalf these last two turbulent years , it is not because he has excelled me in zeal for their welfare or in appreciation of their potential virtues . I do not mean to say that we would have had a perfect civilization but for the enfranchisement of the negroes , or that the negroes have been intentional authors of our woes . I simply mean that the presence of the solid negro vote ? in vast majority in many districts and in some entire States ? has presented , perhaps , the most serious evil that could have confronted the South . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No matter into what condition their party might fall , no matter what it might do , no matter who should lead it , they have had to vote all one way or give over large sections to the rule of negroes ? which , men of the North , surely meant corruption and anarchy . The negro can not rule , whatever else he may be capable of . Here is a case in point . In one Congressional district in North Carolina , Mr. McKinley appointed eighteen selected negroes to federal positions . In three years , five of them were arrested for robbing the mails . It is not a matter of prejudice in the South , but one of incontrover tible fact , that it is the exception and not the rule when negroes are found  | capable of responsible position of trust . That there are such negroes is a blessed fact ; hut they are not in politics . The very nature of Southern ? and , I hear , Northern ? politics in all parties is corrupting ; and if the white man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect the negro , whose conscience has not been long under the tutelage of independence , to withstand it . So , then , as between municipal care lessness , boss-rule , partisan laws , and passionate politics , on one hand , and municipal carelessness , boss-rule , partisan laws , and passionate politics , plus negro incompetence , weakness , and insolence , on the other ? the Southern people have chosen to have the former when they must ; and I make haste to say that it has not always been necessary , not by any means . North Carolina has had many a year of good government , and so have other Southern States . The point is , though , that the negro has made corruption ever near at hand and kept us powerless against it . Of course , it is obvious that , exerting such an influence , the negro vote has made political progress very tedious . Reforms and more timely laws have come tardily , lest their suddenness might divide the white vote . These are some of the conditions . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progress politically has been the presence of a large body of negro voters , ignorant and irretrievably prejudiced . Having overcome in every other respect the consequences of the Civil War , within the last ten years the Southern people have made bold to devise swans of overcoming this difficulty . Let the reader put this to their credit , no matter what he thinks about it : their motive is good . And I have an idea that the Southern people have some advantages over the Northern politicians in this matter . They have lived here and dealt with this problem for thirty-five years . This is the point I wish to impress particularly . I would not undertake to deny the fact that in the " black " districts there have been for years various irregular methods of cutting down the negro majorities . But what reasonable man will not at least appreciate the animus of the white citizen who , having to choose between defraud ing the negroes of the suffrage and turning a county over to them and to anarchy , between cheating or intimidating the negroes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the former ? Of course , this has brought the suffrage low . Of course , it was inevitable that the ballot-box should fall into the hands of bad men , under such circumstances . Of course , such conditions tend to prostrate the people morally . Southern citizens have known this . And here is the word for the Northern reader : Out of reflection upon this condition and its one cause , the Southern Stat cs have these ten years been following one another in measures de- signed to eliminate the negro vote legally . Is not the motive good ? Would the noblest citizen in Massachusetts do less ? It is this view that I desire to get before the citizens of the North . I declare that the ammendment to the constitution of North Carolina dis franchising the negroes was ratified , not in prejudice against the negro , not for any party 's side , but for honesty 's sake , to save the State from moral prostration , t o save the people from political slavery , in the bondage of fear.If the Republicans could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their party in the South In the recent election the majority for Mr. Bryan in North Carolina was about 25,000 . Of this major ity fully three-fourths was " rolled up , " in the black districts , where the negroes did not vote . The two districts in which White people are in the largest proportion elected Republican Congressmen by handsome majori ties . This indicates the evenness of political chances where there is lib erty of choice . Since our Suffrage Amendment was ratified there has been far more freedom of expression . And on every hand there is a de mand for a fair election law , for better schools , and for progressive legis lation ; and there is good earnest that this demand will be heard . As I write these words our General Assembly is passing a bill appropriating $200,000 extra to our public school fund ; and I am enabled to say that a fair election law has been agreed upon . If , however , these measures of elimination are interfered with , my word for it the South is all but hopeless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For if legal means may not be , illegal methods will prevail by common consent , against which no power that I know of may successfully cope . Force bills and soldiery might be offered . I hesitate to contemplate the effect of such measures . I prefer to hope that statesmen will take counsel before giving any section of our land over to the negroes , who by every token of experience and reason are unfit not only to bear office , but to vote . To a Southern man , in the light of common observation , it is a constant wonder that any one ever ventured to hope that a million slaves could reach the point of AngloSaxon self-sovereignty in a day or a decade or a century . And in view of General Wood 's experience in Cuba and Mr. Dole 's in Hawaii , not to mention the Philippines , he takes hope that his Northern brethren will at last appreciate the South 's long struggles against great odds , up from desolation , under a handicap like which no people ever bore before . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her mines , her forests , her fields , and her factories have begun to attract the tide of population . The latest census indicates that her population has increased by a larger  | percentage than that of the West . The new regime in Cuba and the opening of our isthmian canal will enlarge her market . By manufacturing her own cotton she will easily increase her annual income 300 per cent . Her industrial life is fast becoming like that of the North , and her political sympathies will surely tend the same way ? but not if the party in power strikes down her arm as she raises it to free herself . The population of the South is homogeneous . The foreigner is a stranger here . The Southern people are sons of those first pioneers who came from England and Scotland , and , in the farther South , from Spain and France . In other days the South played a great part in national life . Not a few of the nation 's great leaders came from below Mason and Dixon 's line . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the first rank the reason is plain . Her political condition has rendered it impossible . Let no one fancy that the potential blood is not here . It is here , if anywhere ; and a few years , if the South 's determined effort to free her sons is appreciated , will bring forth rich contributions to the glory of our nation . So , then , I submit that it is good statesmanship to leave the South to her own way in working out her salvation from the ignorant negro vote . If her plans shall be proved unconstitutional , I submit that it would be better to abrogate the fourteenth Amendment than to drive her back into the wilderness . I submit that it is good political policy . I hold no brief for any party ; but I say what Democrats and Republicans in the South all know when I declare that the only hope of the Republican party and of political progress in the South lies in the elimination of the ignorant negro from the voting body . Republican victory by means of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into its councils ; nor will it be on a permanent basis . But there will not be any Republican victory of consequence so long as the negro is suffered to vote . I submit that the interests of all parts of our country are largely identical . If the South is paralyzed the North must suffer . In this new time , when our nation must confront the world , we must make the most possible of the whole nation , and we must make it whole . Thus , the Republican party in full power is confronted with alluring opportunities of constructive statesmanship , second to none in our political history . 1 appeal to the men of the North to allow their Southern brethren to determine the means of dealing with the negro vote . In all else the Southern people have recovered from the war . In this they can recover , if permitted to follow the impulses arising from moral and political necessity , and from the dictates of long experience .               @ @ @ @ @ @
