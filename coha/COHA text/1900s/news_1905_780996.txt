WOMAN SKIPPER OVERBOARD . Mrs. Havens Pluckily Regains the Tiller of Her Catboat . Mrs. F. J. Havens , wife of a well-knownl member of the Atlantic Yacht Club andl daughter-in-law of Rear Commodore Edward B. Havens , was ' dumped into the water yesterday off Sea Gate from her ' eighteen-foot catboat Red Devil , which she was sailing . Instead of shouting for help she swam to the catboat , got aboard , and sailed It home . Mrs. Havens was alone in the little craft in spite of the stiff breeze that was blowing , and was cruising about the Atlantic Yacht Club wharf , where she had been watching her husband 's sloop Guest start in its race for her father-in-law 's trophy . The wend lightened , and Mrs. Havens attempted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mainsail . As she leaned against the boom with tiller and main-sheet in one hand and the other occupied with the reef points , her weight snapped ' the slender spar and she was thrown into the water . She retained her grasp on the mainsheet , and when she came to the surface she swam to the boat , using the rope as a glue . The weight of her skirts did not prevent her climbing back into the craft aed taking the tiller again and steering for the dock . . There were . hundreds on the porches of the Atlantic Yacht Club watching the racers , who saw the whole occurrence . They were greatly alarmed , but were powerless to help , as not n launch or rowboat was at hand . Had she been unable to swim Mrs. Havens might have drowned before assistance could reach her . A launch came up just as she effected a landing and she was surrounded by friends eager to congratulate her on her escape and her pluck . She hastened to her cottage , and In halt an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the club porches , none the worse for her adventure . Mrs. Havens 's catboat , the Red Devil , has a hull and spars of brilliant red , and it is fitted with a bright-red Ratsey that can he seen two miles away . Mrs. Havens can handle it perfectly , but for safety 's sake the boat is equipped with air-tight tanks , and so can not sink .
