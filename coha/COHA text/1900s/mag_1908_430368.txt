 |p1053  INTO the office of District-Attorney Jerome there came one day a griefbowed , broken - hearted old man . For twenty-five years he had lived happily with the wife of his choice . Then came disaster . His gray-haired sweetheart lay near to death , and , neglecting all else , the aged lover gave himself up to nursing his dear one back to health . Naturally his business suffered . In an evil hour he sought relief by borrowing from a usurer . And now , unable to pay the exorbitant interest demanded , he was about to lose thru foreclosure of a chattel mortgage his printing plant ? the one thing that stood between himself and the poorhouse . Fear of the future , and the certainty that the knowledge of the foreclosure would kill his wife , had driven the helpless old man into a frenzy of despair . When he found relief at the hands of the District Attorney his gratitude was touching . Pitiful as was his case , it was , nevertheless , an ordinary occurrence ; for the old printer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressing necessity , have sought relief in a usurer 's loan , and found themselves only the more deeply enmeshed . Despite the crusades waged against them , the loan sharks of America have continued to thrive , and the system of usury has steadily become more remorseless . The rates of interest charged by the usurers range from 5o to 400 per cent . per annum . The aged printer already mentioned paid $7.50 a month interest on each $ioo of his loan ? exactly 90 per cent . Another case on record in the courts of New York is that of a man who paid $125 interest for five months ' use of $225 , or 133 per cent . a year . At the rate of 150 per cent . a year two other men borrowed jointly $200 , to pay for an operation on the bride of one of the borrowers ? an operation necessary to save her life . Yet before they could secure the loan , they had to sign promissory notes for $300 , payable in four months , and give chattel mortgages on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very poor , however , that the burden of the loan shark falls heaviest . The sums these people are able to borrow are small , and the rates of interest increase as the size of the loan diminishes . Twenty-five dollars is an ordinary loan . For this the usurer compels the return of $33 at the end of one or two months . In the latter case the borrower is paying 197 per cent . interest a year . In the former 384 per cent . And small loans constitute the bulk of the usury business . Recently a New York clerk got into financial straits and was lured into borrowing $25 from a usurer . His need was so imperative that he agreed to pay $14 a month interest ? an annual rate of 672 per cent . At the end of the month he was not able to pay back the loan . The usurers began to hound him . He extended the loan another month and agreed to pay $14 more interest . By the most rigid economy and self-denial he got free . But for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $28 interest . What this man escaped , many who borrow from loan sharks are unable to avoid . The poor live so close to the danger line that the slightest necessity for unusual expenditure puts them hopelessly in debt . Many who take out these $25 loans earn only $40 or $50 a month , and some even less . To save $33 in one month , or even in two months , out of such small sums is obviously impossible . When the day of reckoning comes , the borrower is unable to pay his indebtedness . So he pays the interest and lets the principal stand . At the end of the second month the borrower is just where he was at the end of the first . Once more the interest is paid and the loan renewed . Again and again this happens  |p1054  until the borrower loses hope of ever being free from debt and becomes a loan slave . Incredible tho it may seem , these wretched people continue to pay tribute to the usurers month after month and year after year . And at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loan shark 's toils . Recently a woman came into a New York police court hysterical with fear . Her furniture was about to be seized . For six months she had toiled early and late to save it . Worn out at last , she had defaulted in the payment of her interest , and now her furniture was to go ? because she owed the paltry sum of $25 , altho she had paid back $48 in interest . Among the papers in the District Attorney 's office are the records of two policemen . The first one paid $7 interest every two months on a $100 loan . At the end of five years the usurers pushed him so hard for the principal ? wishing to put their money out at a higher rate of interest ? that he sought relief thru the public prosecutor . The second policeman paid $I2 interest a month for three years on a similar loan . Then he died . He had paid $432 interest , but still owed the $100 . Immediately the usurer came to seize the widow 's furniture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thru payment by friends of ? her husband 's of the usurer 's demands . Even more pitiful is the case of a telegrapher , the father of twelve children . With an income of only $18 a week , it was necessary , whenever there came a demand for unusual expenditure , for him to resort to the loan sharks . He could save nothing from his salary to repay these loans . So he borrowed from Peter to pay Paul . But every new loan put him more hopelessly in debt . His furniture was mortgaged , his salary assigned , and a default in payment meant loss of both his chattels and his employment . Obviously it was necessary for him to do extra work . As his financial burdens increased , so did his hours of labor . For months now he has been working nearly eighteen hours a day . Yet his family profits little by his extra efforts . Almost half of his earnings goes to the loan sharks ? as interest . The principal of his indebtedness he can by no human probability ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true of these men is true of hundreds of thousands of others in the United States today . To be sure , not every one who falls into a usurer 's hands is deserving of pity . Some borrow money to spend it foolishly . Usually these are wayward young men . Men of family are really the pillars of usury . Necessity drives them to the Shylocks . So small are the wages of the average worker that the slightest call for extraordinary expenditure often necessitates the borrowing of money . Thus legions of the unfortunate , before they see how they are to meet the obligations they contract , bind themselves with the usurer 's chains . That is because they do not realize that their agreements are chains . The entire business of usury is conducted in a cunning , sugar-coated manner that completely deceives the uninitiated . The borrower sees only the velvet side of the usurer 's claw . He does not realize what rending claws are beneath the velvet . The usurer 's advertisements are typical of his whole manner of business . Here is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your home . Our rates lower than others . We defy all competition . Every man in New York getting a salary call at our office and get all the money you want on your plain note . A written guarantee will be given not to enforce payment through your firm . We Must Get Our Money Out . Hence , every one come and get it . Easy payments ? lowest rates . Kindly call . SOUND CREDIT CO . In similar vein are couched the advertisements of the others . They sound attractive , do they not ? " But how , " you will naturally ask , " is it possible for men thus to be held in slavery when the entire system of usury is illegal ? " The answer is simple : Thru the bondage of fear . From the borrower the usurer always requires a complete personal history , a promissory note and a salary assignment , and frequently a chattel mortgage and the signing of what is called a " mis- appropriation of trust funds " clause .  |p1055  page deleted  |p1056  to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Provident Loan Society , started with a gift of $100,000 . It lends money at the rate of 1 per cent . a month , and cuts that rate in half for prompt repayment . Last year it made 286,000 loans . The Hebrew Free Loan Association is a similar organization . It lends money to any Hebrew who can get good endorsement . Then there are the St. Bartholomew 's Loan Bureau of New York , the Collateral Loan Company and the Workingman 's Loan Association of Boston , and similar organizations in other cities . Their object is not only to help the poor over slippery places , but also to teach them thrift and economy . Better yet , as showing an active interest in one 's employees , is the system of lending money that a New York department store has instituted . Small sums are advanced to employees without interest , the money advanced being deducted from the borrowers ' pay envelopes in ten weekly deductions . Slight as is this assistance , it is just the help that is needed ? and it is assistance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this way . Best of all is the movement toward self-help in the form of mutual loan associations that is spreading everywhere among the poor . A typical organization of this kind can be found in a New York newspaper office . Each member of the staff may carry three shares of stock . For each he pays $r a week . From the sum so collected he may at any time borrow an amount equal to his equity , , and non-members may borrow upon endorsement of a member . A slight weekly charge is made for these loans . At the end of the year the money in the treasury is divided among the stockholders . Each share is then worth about $75 . Thus the borrowers have made money by lending themselves money . Organizations somewhat similar to this are springing up all over the country , bringing timely relief without an accompanying penalty . When they come the usurer goes . To establish such a charity as the Provident Loan Society is within the power of few people . But it is within the power of many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to establish , loan associations of their own . Every employer has employees who at times are prest to make both ends meet . A very little assistance will tide them over their difficulties . The average amount of the 286,000 loans of the Provident Loan Society in 1907 was $37 . Wherever the idea of a mutual loan association is suggested employees take to it readily . Workingmen are fully competent to run their own societies , and even to organize them . But in many cases they have not thought of the possibility of such societies . So long has the workingman lived as an individual that the possibilities of combination percolate but slowly thru his brain . Recently he has learned to organize to secure better wages . In future he will organize to furnish himself at low rates the assistance he now secures from usurers at high rates . When that day comes the usurer will vanish from the land . In accomplishing this happy end the workingman will increase his self-respect and manliness . At the same time he will become a better and more efficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this end will not only help his employees , but will at the same time benefit himself .
