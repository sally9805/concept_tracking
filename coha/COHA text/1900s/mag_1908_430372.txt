 |p1100  I AM going to tell you a true love story of the days when I was young , in order to show you a curious difference betwen that time and this , It seems to me that love and marriage counted for more in the life of Americans in those days than they do now . In the early part of last century nothing concerned a young man or woman so much as that mysterious , sudden heat in the blood which drew them together . Why should one blue-eyed , freckled girl , after an hour 's talk , matter more to John than all the other women on the earth ? He did not know . But he knew that she did , and he thrust all the other business of life aside until he had made her his own . Questions of income , of position , or of fitness were not allowed to interfere in the matter then as they do now . The whole success or ruin of a man 's life often depended on the outcome of this mysterious fit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will show von how incurable that fever was held to he and how it absorbed the whole life of its victim . Then , in the opinion of the public , the history of men and women ended , as they did in those novels , with the wedding day . But now the graduates of Brvn Mawr or of Harvard thrust aside the consideration of love and marriage until a dozen more important questions in their lives have been settled . The success of Jenny 's picture in the spring exhibition , the kind of assignments which Jim is given by the city editor , the hospital into which Bob shall make his way as interne ? these things weigh much in the game of life , while the sudden thrill of rapture in the souls of Jenny and Bob when they meet is promptly , smothered out . Neither of them has a marrying income and they know it . Enough . The matter is postponed indefinitely . No hearts are broken . The marrying age is set backward from the teens to the thirties . No doubt love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as strong and lasting as in the old time . But surely it is more sane and more cautious than in the days of our grandfathers , more anxious to wear clothes of a fashionable cut and to be secure in the foundation of a good bank account . This little true story of the doings of a pair of lovers long ago will perhaps show you the difference between then and now . As you remember , at the close of the Revolutionary War , two of the Orleans princes came to this country on an exploring tour . They crossed the Alleghanies , with an escort of hunters and servants on pack mules , stopping at the houses of the squatters in the wilderness and bearing themselves like hearty good fellows out for a lark , the elder dubbing himself Philippe Egalite . But the poor farmers regarded them with breathless awe . Princes were unknown factors in  |p1101  the brand-new republic . To this clay the descendants of the squatters boast of the feasts set by their grandfathers for these royal guests . Now , it chanced that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a farmer in the mountains . The only child in the family was a little girl of twelve . The princes noticed her pretty face and played with her . When they were going away she followed them and stood shyly leaning against the gate . Philippe Egalite gaily doffed his cap . " Ah ! stay there , my child , and wait until I come back to make thee a princess ! " he called , and rode down the hill , laughing . The story was told all over the hills and made little Lotty famous . But apparently she had good sense as well as good looks , and did not let her dream of a crown blind her to more practical chances . In a few years she married a miller named Hogue and settled down to the cooking , washing and scrubbing which made up a woman 's life in the mountains . But it chanced that her ( laughter Pauline was one of those women who come into the world with a strange charm ? the Lauras , the Beatrices , the Mary Stuarts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the child grew to womanhood she was fully aware of the difference between her and other women , and of her powers over the honest farmers in the neighborhood . The promise of the prince to her mother had been the only bit of romance known to her childhood . Philippe Egalite was ( lead . But no doubt there were hundreds of kings yonder beyond the sea , who any day might come over hunting a bride . She early set herself apart for this royal lover who some day would conic riding up out of the woods . She had a few offers of marriage , hut men . for the most part , were shy of this idle , exquisite creature who could not make soft soap nor dip candles . Rob Wicklev , the blacksmith 's son , told the child one day that he would marry her some time . " You ! " Pauline shrieked . " Do you think I will marry- a man with a mole on his chin and a club foot ? You ? cripple ! " " I ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and looked in the glass , gaping stupidly . He never had seen the mole on his chin before nor noticed that he walked differently from other boys . He stared in the mirror at the ugly face covered with soot . " But I will marry her some day ! " he said , doggedly , as he stumped back to the forge . In that day , in the working clas , a boy 's labor belonged to his father until he was eighteen , in order to recoup him for the money spent on the boy in his childhood . Bob began now to work far into the night to pay this debt to his father in advance . He was years in doing it . On the day he had cleared off the last dollar he washed away every sooty trace of the forge for the last time , put on a new jeans suit , and going to the miller 's in broad daylight , asked for Pauline . In all of these years he never had gone to the house . But a young man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he called an omnivarious store in the mountains , had gone often to the miller 's , and had just asked Pauline to marry him . She was glowing now with the triumph of her refusal , and the nameless prince who tarried so long on his way was more real to her than ever . But Rob , now that the grime of the forge was gone , suddenly came out a big and handsome man , and there was a certain power in his dark blue eyes that frightened her . " You are going away ? " she faltered . " I am going down into the world to find my fortune . " he said . ( He had said the words over to himself every day for years . ) " And I am coming hack to ask you to marry me . " " M. plans are different from yours . then . " Pauline giggled . The women of the village always said that the girl 's character was as weak and sour as buttermilk . But Rob knew nothing of that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tie knew it would be years before he would see her again . The cold sweat stood over his face . but still he had no words . He took up her hand and held it to his lips , then laid it down as if it had been a sacred thing , and , turning , went clown the hill . not once looking back . * * * * * Rob went to a village on the Ohio . in Virginia . the terminus of the great na/ tional road , where all the freight sent between the South and the North was exchanged and reshipped on boats or wagons . He learned this business thoroly . Then he begged for commissions . W hen he got one he himself drove the dray loaded with the cotton bales from the boat to the wagons , and then went with the wagons across the mountains . In a year or two he had a small warehouse of his own . At night he studied with the old parson Latin and Greek , geography ? everything , in short , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gentleman , " he told himself , incessantly , " She never must be ashamed of her husband . " With the first money he could save he bought a hill tract overlooking the town . " She is used to the hights , " he thought . He planted there an orchard and garden , and with his own hands dug deep cellars for the house . From time to time , too , he sent Pauline gifts . They cost so much and the money was so hard to get that they seemed quite royal to the boy . One was an album , purple and gold on the cover ? the poems inside encircled with painted wreaths . Rob wrote a song to Pauline on the front page . It took him months to compose it , but it seemed to him quite as fine as any of Moore 's or Scott 's songs when it was done . He sent her , too , a work-box with ivory fittings , and a vase of wax flowers , and a gold locket and chain . " Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he muttered , his face turning scarlet at the thought . The last gift was a hymn book . Both he and Pauline were Baptists . " When I give her a Bible " ? he thought ? " it will be a big , gilt-clasped one , on our wedding day , with a Family Record in it , and on the Marriage page just two lines " The man 's eves filled with tears and he did not finish the sentence . He stole a week from work and took the book up to her . Pauline dimpled and blushed over it . Secretly she thought his gifts very splendid . " But , you know , " she cooed . " I must give them all back to you when the prince comes . " " All right . " said Rob . " Princes do n't scare me . " He said little , being a dumb fellow by nature , but his eyes did not meet her face . She had always been a kind of miracle ? the whitest , purest , of living things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , blue-veined hand and held it in his big , scarred palm for a minute . He said nothing , but he trembled and the blood went out of his face . Pauline giggled . " But a gentleman 's hand should be white , too , " she chirped . Rob drew his yellow fist away , and after that tried to keep it out of her sight . Indeed , the poor cripple used to feel that he should keep himself altogether out of her sight , he was made of such coarse , common stuff . It was about this time that Pauline 's uncle was elected to Congress , and he and his wife took the girl to Washington for two years . They drest her gorgeously , according to their ideas . She met politicians , diplomats , barons , and now and then , perhaps , a stray prince . They danced , chatted , flirted with her . But they did not ask her to marry them . Rob heard of her far-off triumphs . The man grew lean , grave and silent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told himself . " But her house shall be ready for her just the same . " So he built it with pillars in front , like a Greek temple , a fashion much admired then . When it was finished , the last carpet laid and mirror hung , he locked it up and took the stage coach for the East . It was whispered that he had gone to Washington and would soon bring his bride to her fine home . Two months later Wickley came hack. alone . He gave no explanation and nobody dared ask for one . He closed his house , placed his business in the hands of an agent , and took the boat for New Orleans . For two years he was not seen . Then reports drifted back of his success . Success was a matter of course for Rob . He was a shrewd speculator and had won in a few large ventures . He was young . handsome and magnetic , and he had made a host of friends . The names of the two foremost belles in New Orleans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But . in fact , Wicklev was a cold and rather harsh critic where women were concerned . At the end of the two years he came home . He was received as a conquering hero . The town rose at him . Energy and marked success were rare  |p1103  things in those days . Councils gave him a banquet ; there were supper parties every night . One old friend asked him plainly when he would bring home his bride from the South and open his mansion . Rob made a joking reply , but never looked up at the dusty , pillared house . One day on the street he met Pomeroy , the postmaster from his old home in the mountains , who poured out the news . And the ? the Rogues ? " Rob said , when Pomeroy stopt for breath . " Hogue ! Did n't you know ? Mill burned down a year ago ; house , too ? all gone . No insurance . Cleaned Hogue out to the last dollar . That girl of his , Pauline " Pauline ? yes ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawn and pinched . She was hurt in the fire . Leg broken ? she goes lame now . Face scorched . I 'll say for the girl she 's not so worthless as she used to be . She works hard for the old man . Started a store and getting herself out of debt in it , hand over hand . " Wickley left Pomeroy with a stammered excuse and in a few minutes was on his way to the mountains . * * * * * It was near nightfall on the third day when he reached the little store in the village . She was tying up a package for a child and did not see him . She dragged one leg after her as she walked , and her face was drawn and scarred . But she was still the whitest , cleanest thing on earth to Rob . " Like the angels of God ! " he sobbed , choking when he tried to speak . When she saw him the poor face grew ashen , but she came limping out at once , controlled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would see you again ! So kind in you to come back to the old place . Help me to shut up the shop and go down with me to supper . You must be hungry . " Rob said loudly that he was famished and would she give him an old-time supper , and ? . He did not know what be said as he ran about closing the miserable little shop and looking at her . He thought that she stood in the light purposely , wanting him to see how much she limped and how horribly she was scarred . " They walked down the hill together . It seemed to Rob that with all the horror of her crippled body and branded face there was some intangible thing about her which never had been there before . It had nothing to do with the angels of God ? it was foolish , womanish , dear ? it made him want to pick her up and carry her out and hide her from the sight of men . He went to the house , ate supper and talked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer . " Pauline , " he said , " let us go out and watch the moon come up behind the peak . " When they were outside he caught her hand , wrenching it fiercely . " This has to end . I have waited all my life . And you ? all these years looking for a prince who never was born ! " She drew her hand away and stood apart from him . " Do n't tell me that I have been an idiot , Rob . I know it . " She laughed . I know now what you are . And ? I know what I am . " " You are what you always have been to me , " he cried . " The one woman on God 's earth . " " Why , look at me ! " She turned her scarred face up to the light . " What is that ? When you were a tottering baby you were the only thing alive that I cared for . You will be that as long as you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any more talk , " he said , trying to speak in his ordinary , cheerful voice . " I have come for you . I am going to take you home with me . If you do not love me now I will make you do it some day . But ? Pauline ! " ? he held out his arms with a hoarse cry ? " I 've waited for you all my life . Have you nothing to give me ? Ca n't you understand ? " " Yes , I understand . " She came tip to him and took both his hands in a friendly grasp . " Do n't let us talk of love . I can never leave father . Do n't you see ? God has given me this thing to do ? God . I must stay here and do it . " Rob laughed . " Your father ? That is nothing . Why , your house has been waiting for you for years . There 's room in it for a dozen fathers . I 'll take care of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fun in her eyes . The miller was known thruout the county as the most cantankerous man in it . " No , Rob , " she said ; he would not take help from you . " Rob wrenched the thin little hands in his . " What does he matter ? It is von have you no word for me after a l l these years of waiting ? I f you had ever said once that you loved me There was a heavy step behind them and the miller came down the path . " Pauline ! I thought this was coming ! " he said . This is the end of your great marriage ? The prince is Rob Wickley ! This fellow ! Why , nobody knows anything of him since he hid away in New Orleans . A river gambler , I reckon . And he 's goin ' to take me home with him on charity ? Not if I know it . I 'm poor , God knows . But I 'll not beg my bread from old blacksmith Wicklev 's son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him and was silent ; he never could remember what the old man said . But the night remained with him all of his life . In it he knew he had been thrown into the gutter and fought with beasts . Always before that night his love had seemed to him one of the divine , mysterious things in the world , like the song of birds , or the beckoning of stars , or the thought of God himself . But now the old man had dragged it into the slime ? he loathed the thought of it . As he went down the mountain , leaving them behind , he told himself that he never would return . The woman herself suddenly became abhorrent to him . He had given her his life . What had she ever given in return ? She was petty , mean , cruel . He never would see her again . Out of the window of the miserable . house a woman was leaning watching him go . " Good-bye , Rob ! Rob , good-bye ! " she cried , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about his business , telling himself incessantly that this chapter of his life was ended . On the sixth he went back to the mountains . The shop was closed , the dust lay thick on the steps . The neighbors told him that the miller had sold his stock and with his daughter had gone away at night , nobody knew where . It was easy for any man to lose himself in this country then , when there were no railways , no telegraphs , no daily papers . For two years Wickley searched the great wilderness from New England to the Gulf of Mexico to no purpose . ' he miller had lost himself effectually . Then he went back to his work in New Orleans . His disappointment had not embittered him . He was for years the most popular Congressman sent to Washington from the Gulf States . Men trusted him , all children loved him . There were , too , good and fair women whose hearts beat faster at the sound of his voice , but they did not count for as much to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent as our Minister to France . When his term of office expired he remained on the Continent for several years . One day , in Paris , he met , in a cafe in the Bois , Jem Stewart , a neighbor in his old home in the mountains . They dined together . Now , the story of Rob and Pauline had always been known to Stewart . During the meal he watched his host furtively . Presently turning his head carefully , that he might not see Rob 's face , he said : " Did you hear that the miller and his ( laughter had been found ? " Rob sprang to his feet . " Yes , " Stewart hurried on , not looking at him . " Or , I should say , Pauline . Her father is gone . He had taken her to the Far West and died there . She made her way back , and , I heard , was living in Pittsburgh . She has grown old and she has lost her voice . Why Rob ? Mr. Wickley ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you , and now ? she 's an old , battered wreck " Silence ! If there is enough of her body left to hold her soul I will claim it and thank God . " He checked himself and took leave of his guest courteously . Stewart looked for him at his lodgings the next day , but they were closed and he was gone . Rob found her in a miserable hut in an alley in Pittsburgh . She was earning her living by dyeing old clothes for the work people about her . The purple stain of the dye was on her face and hands . Her hair
