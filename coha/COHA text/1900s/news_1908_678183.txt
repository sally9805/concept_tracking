" The test must ever be when you cona ? to the question of any appointment . Is this man qualified for the job ? Will he do his work honestly ? Trill he do his work faithfully ?

If We find the laws need correction we may supply that needad correction in accordance with the will of the majority of the people . " My friends , as I have often said , in the history of American life there never was a more wholesome sentiment than we have to-day , from one end of this broad land to the other . There never was a time when the people were more determined to put any proposition to the test of reason . There never has been a time when you could expect to do less with . manipulation  --  less with any effort at demagogy . You have simply to say , ' this is right , and It is right because of these reasons , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and conscientious electorate . " The average man throughout the State and throughout the country appreciates and be comes up with a high idea of the dignity of his citizenship to the decision of these important questions . So It is that we look to the future without misgiving . It Is not a question of this than-or that man ; it s a question of what we shall do , each in our own place ; In office or out of office , to maintain these ' principles . of Government , being assured . that upon their maintenance everything which we prize in our own individual lives will surely depend .
