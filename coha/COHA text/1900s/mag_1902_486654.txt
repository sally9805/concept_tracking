As we go to press , the strike leaders are considering an offer from the operators to submit " all questions at issue between the respective companies and their own employees " to a commission of five disinterested experts to be appointed by the President ; this upon condition of immediate resumption of work without objection to , or further molestation of , non-union workers . This offer has the advantage over MitchelPs , of seemingly like tenor , in that it prescriptively excludes politics from the commission . It has the moral virtue of conceding nothing to the dominating spirit of trade-unionism . Its fate will be known by the time these lines are read . While we wish it success , we have no desire to qualify what we have written elsewhere on the general aspects of the strike up to the present attempt at settlement . The President 's intervention from first to last will forever stand as a sign of national concern with the chronic disturbance of American industry and commerce by unscrupulous and tyrannical labor organizations . The present contest , we may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the operators ' offer be accepted . But it is something to have stood for the principle of free labor and free contract like men , and to have averted a " dishonest victory At Cleronea , fatal to liberty . " Mr. Goldwin Smith , of whom it may still be said , as Cobden said of him forty years ago , that " his pen is a power in the state , " had a brief but weighty letter on the coal strike in Sunday 's Sun . The sum of it is , that the crisis calls for a new assertion of the national authority . He points out that anthracite mining has clearly become a national interest , and maintains that the national Government ought to hate power , when local government fails , to " declare the imperilled interest national and take the matter into its own hands . " By this Mr. Smith does not mean to countenance any scheme of " nationalizing " the mining business . He desires , rather , to see it simply rationalized . That is , he would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law , so that when the comfort and well-being and almost the very life of the people are threatened , we shall not have to present to the world the spectacle of a great nation unable to protect itself from internal enemies Mr. Smith 's letter closes with these words : " The political verdict of the civil war was that you were no longer a federation of sovereign States , but a nation Confirmation of this verdict may be a useful and redeeming consequence of the strike . " This acute and friendly observer has put his finger on the sore spot . All reflecting Americans have felt , within the past few weeks , a soil of baffled and angry sense of national impotence and hit miliation . Is there not a solemn warning for the Republican party in the way in which its campaign has been shattered to fragments by the coal strike ? Here we see its managers in two great States , with critical elections on their hands , dropping everything in unconcealed alarm , and practically confessing that they are beaten in advance unless they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pitiable state of panic for a great party to fall into ! And the worst of it is that it is the direct result of its own boasted claims and favorite teachings . It has posed as the guardian angel of every laboring man , the universal provider of prosperity , fatuously failing to perceive how this attitude puts it at the mercy of every industrial disturbance or crop failure that comes along . In 1892 it was the rueful confession of Republicans that it was the Homestead strike that lost them the Presidency . Yet since then , with redoubled folly , the party leaders have gone on delivering themselves into the hands of strikers and agitators , until now they are aghast at the political precipice up to which they have walked so light-heartedly . It is in vain for them to point to good administration at Washington and Albany , at better appointments , at economy , at farsighted plans of tax reform  --  all is swept away in the angry demand- that a party which undertakes to make every citizen happy and prosperous , end the coal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perilous situation should awaken thoughtful Republicans to the frightful mistake their party has been making all these years . If Secretary Shaw 's direction to collectors , to " facilitate " in every way the importation of coal , means , as is broadly hinted , that the - legal duties will be waived , we have a still more alarming example than was his suspension of the bank-reserve rule , of nullifying the law by executive interpretation . No one can hold a lower opinion of the tariff on coal than we do . It is unnecessary , vexing , foolish . It is one of the most hateful instances of protectionist greed . But there it stands in the law , and , until repealed , must be enforced . Winking at an evasion of it would bring both the law and the Secretary into contempt . We were going to say that it would bring the whole protective policy into contempt ; but that work is , at present , one of the purest supererogation . We do not remember the time when protection was in such disgrace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very devotees and apologists have such gentle words to apply to it as blood-sucking and piracy . But there must be no attempts to punish the protectionist blood-suckers and pirates . Oh , no ; to do that , the President says , would " unsettle confidence . " Now we have Secretary Moody proposing to rip open the tariff and ' paralyze business . In his speech at Madison , Wis , he asserted of his own knowledge that the duty on coal of 67 cents a ton was " covertly and in a cowardly manner smuggled into the Dingley bill . " He urged , and Washington dispatctes say that the President will recommend , that Congress promptly remove that tax on a necesssary of life . But how can the thing be done ? Has not President Roosevelt himself protested against tariff-tinkering ? Did he not find out , in the case of the protective duty on beet-sugar , that it is impossible to strike at one greedy interest without arousing all the other greedy interests to come to its rescue ? The President has much to learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he imagines that what Secretary Moody calls " blood-money " can be taken out of them without exsanguinating the whole system . What if selfish and cowardly duties were smuggled into the law , no one but wicked Democrats will talk about forcing them out . If the President and Secretary Moody go on talking about the monstrously unjust tariff taxes that Congress should repeal , the protected interests will send Lodge to the White House and the Navy Department to repeat his great speech on the impossibility of any patriot uttering the words tariff revision except in a whisper and in a dark closet . In the midst of the coal crisis and of much other internal disorder , we are asked to give attention to our duties as guardian of the island of Cuba , and to see that she fulfils her duties to us . She has not signed the treaty which is required under the Platt Amendment She has not turned over to us any coaling stations or forts . She has not completed the treaty of reciprocity which we have offered to her . The worst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have done for Cuba , she does not love us . How sharper than a serpent 's tooth ! But this is only a beginning of our outside perplexities . Congress will soon be requested to assume responsibility for the Danish West Indies and to pay $5,000 , - 000 cash for that privilege , plus a considerable stipend each year to meet the deficit which has been a charge on the Danish treasury . Confronting us also is the much greater problem of getting rid of the friars in the Philippines , paying them off , disposing of their lands , and bringing in their successors . Added to this is the task of preparing the Filipinos for " ultimate self-government " ? except the Moros . The duty of killing the latter is still upon us . They are unconscionable Mohammedans , polygamists , and slaveholders . We must put them down anyhow . There has been an earthquake and tidal wave at Guam , and the officer in charge there has sent a pressing appeal for money and material to rebuild the piers and barracks . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and also a counter petition which tells of intolerable cruelty practised upon natives of Porto Rico who had been induced to migrate to Hawaii to take the adces of Chinese coolies hitherto working there . The foolish may now ask whether the problems which face Uncle Sam in his own territory are not sufficient to engage his energies and tax his ingenuity without seeking new ones on the other side of the globe , or even in the neighboring waters of the Carib-bees . The refusal of the Sultan of Bacolod to accept the blessings of American civilization is one of the most singular happenings of the hour . This wretch actually prefers death to the kind of Americanization which has been going on in Luzon , and Samar , and elsewhere these last four years . With inconceivable stupidity and shortsightedness he would rather be ruler of his own lands than accept the sovereignty of the United States as enforced by Gov . Taft and Gen. Sumner . Instead of being ready to have Christianity forced down his throat at the same time , he wishes to die for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Peace Anybody , we insist , who is such a blockhead as to decline all these advantages , including the enforced learning of English , particularly when they are offered by the Republican party , ought to be done away with , and very promptly , too . If anybody insinuates that this killing of hundreds of Mohammedans in an equatorial island 8,000 miles away is despicable and unworthy business for a great nation , why , tell him he is unpatriotic , set him , as Secretary Shaw would suggest , to singing " America , " and talk about the coal strike . The paralysis of law , in a community over-afflicted with petty politics and labor-union tyranny , had sharp illustration in New Orleans last week . For days the riotous striking motormen domMated the city and defied its police force . Men were ready to take the places of the strikers , but not a car was run . With policemen enough on Canal Street , according to the local papers , to have swept the thoroUghfare clear of rioters as fast as the route could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cars were stopped almost as soon as they left the barns , and their motormen were beaten and dragged-away . " Please give way there , gentlemen , " said the polite policemen on the cars , " we do n't want trouble " ; and not a police club met the bludgeons of the mob . To club a brick-throwing striker might be to club a political worker of one of the Police Commissioners . Besides , unionists have votes , and election day is only three weeks distant . Nor could reliance be placed on the local militiamen , who forgot their oaths to the State in their sympathy for unionism , or their fear of its boycott ; and the strikers modified their terms only when confronted by militia brought from the rural districts , where there is less of corrupt politics and of union domination . The Grand Army treated the new Pension Commissioner rather badly on Thursday , in that it failed to rebuke him for standing in. the way of the veterans who wish to coin their patriotism . We must confess that Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for every watchful and efficient Commissioner has hitherto been so savagely attacked by the Grand Army that this treatment had come to be regarded as a certificate of merit , and its absence as a ground for suspicion . We doubt whether President Roosevelt will like the outgoing Commander-in-chief 's assertion that the Grand Army compelled the retirement of Commissioner Evans . The President gave other reasons , and it should cause him considerable food for reflection , now that he finds the pension-grabbers rejoicing over it , and saying , " We did it . " Mr. Ware having removed the Chief Pension Examiner , who was a foe to dishonesty and fraudulent pensions , the Grand ' Army has moved on to attack a third of the safeguards supposed to protect the Treasury from unwarranted riflers . Its Pension Committee assailed the whole medical division of the Pension Bureau , declaring it " a dead line where are executed the claims of veterans seeking pensions . " By all means let us get rid of this protection , and turn the Treasury wide open to the swindlers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 200,000 veterans without pensions , Gen. Torrance declared . At any cost let us give them everything they want , and demonstrate the fact that true patriotism consists ininulcting your Government as much as possible because you did your duty honorably , or dishonorably , forty years ago . Earnings of the Steel Corporation for the ? September quarter add their testimony to the remarkable prosperity of the iron trade . The company 's earnings during the past three months , in excess of operating expenses , have surpassed last year 's by eight million dollars , or 28 Per cent . Part of this increase results , no doubt , from the fact that last year 's strike of steel workers came in the summer quarter . One curious part of last year 's showing , however , was that the company 's net earnings increased in each successive month of the strike until September ; July , 1901 , showing $185,000 more net receipts than June , and August $230,000 more than July . The higher price of the company 's products counts for much this year . Prices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent . above those of this date a year ago . Not only has pig-iron risen since last October from $14.90 to $22 per ton , but steel billets , a staple product of the trade , sell at Pittsburgh now for $29.50 , as against $26.50 a year ago , and $16.50 in 1900 ; the other forms of steel having advanced correspondingly . This great advance may fairly be said to have occurred in the face of the company 's efforts to maintain a steady market . It is , in fact , an index to the enormous continuing demand for iron , chiefly for building purposes . Our import , during the eight first months in the present year , of 160,000 tons more foreign steel than we took in 1901 , is one evidence of this American demand . The situation suggests two comments . The first should be , on the utter absurdity and wrongfulness of the 30 per cent . duty on these steel imports at a time when the public revenue is too large already and the home steel-maker unable to meet the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singularity of ? the demand , by a company in the Steel Corporation 's present situation , that there be saddled on the enterprise a debt of $200,000,000 , through which not a dollar of new assets is obtained . After a censored war , a censored inquiry into it . That was the case with our Philippine war , and now it is to be the course with the South African war also . The Royal Commission of investigation begins its labors by excluding the press This is as if in humble imitation of Lodge 's committee at Washington . And the reasons alleged in either instance are curiously alike , and curiously fallacious . As long as the war is in progress , no questions must be asked . It would be unpatriotic to ask any ; it would only encourage the enemy ; it is well known that the bravest and purest soldiers can not fight so well when their peculations and violations of the laws of war are exposed . Wait till the war is over , and then thrust in the probe as deeply as you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at last , and the promise of thorough investigation the Government finds it highly inconvenient to fulfil . A Royal Commission is named , but certain subjects of inquiry are carefully withdrawn from it . The old excuses , supposed to be good only for war-time , are alleged again  --  we must not betray our military weakness ; we dare not give aid and comfort to a possible enemy in the future . And , to crown all , the Commission is to sit in secret . If - anything disagreeable should be put in evidence , you know ! Besides , the Commission will publish all that the public really ought to have . We Americans can see how absurd this is in the English . Mr. Balfour convenes Parliament today , and will renew the discussion of the Education Bill , the essential clauses of which have already been passed . He has before him the alternatives of jamming the bill through in its original form ? a policy which would threaten a prompt dissolution  --  or of withdrawing it ignominiously and continuing the present makeshifts , or of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ privileges in the schools . During the prorogation of Parliament the matter of public primary education has been vigorously debated in both the Unionist and the Liberal press , and it may fairly be said that the whole question has passed beyond Mr. Balfour 's control . Many of his own supporters look longingly towards the non-sectarian schools of America , and even those who insist upon denominational control of the schools desire freedom of voluntary religious instruction , under some form of the Faribault plan . Undoubtedly a small but influential part of the majority will insist that the Church schools offer in their buildings , valued at $20,000,000 , an equivalent for the support they are to receive from the rate-payers . But the rate-payers are not of this opinion , and if Mr. Balfour persists in saddling upon the people schools maintained from the rates , but managed by denominational committees , he will force a political crisis . Mr. Chamberlain has told the Liberal Unionists that on the Education Bill the Ministerial programme is battle , not compromise . He adds that the bill is not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education ; but he promises the measure his loyal support ; and , since the Ministry is irretrievably committed to the Bishops ' plan , he bids Liberal Unionists pocket their prejudices and swallow the bill . Unless the dispatches misrepresent the tone of his address , he assumes that the dose will be a bitter one . Mr. Chamberlain is a fighter , and his loyalty in this matter is unquestioned , but one can not help remembering that if Mr. Balfour should perish politically while leading this forlorn hope , Mr. Chamberlain would certainly survive , and would , almost inevitably assume the vacated command of the baffled Unionist forces . This obvious consideration does not detract from the sincerity of that counsel which bids Mr. Balfour take the chances of attack rather than abide the perils of retreat , but it explains why Mr. Chamberlain is able to urge desperate courses with a certain cheerfulness . The celebration of the tercentenary of the Bodleian Library at Oxford , which took place last week , is an event of more than local importance . Scholars from the entire civilized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and have received the courteous assistance of its accomplished staff . A great storehouse of books thus administered deserves Professor Dixon 's appellation ? " An International University . " Sir Thomas Bodley , when he founded a library as an ultra-British and ultra-Stuart university , could not have imagined that he was endowing an essentially cosmopolitan institution , and it was two generations before the German-born Hollander and pioneer English philologer Francis Junius gave his Anglo-Saxon collection to his neighbor , Bodley 's librarian , for the use of all students in perpetuity . This was perhaps the first hint of the international character that the Bodleian Library was to assume . No one who has read in the halls that Duke Humphrey of Gloucester built and Sir Thomas Bodley rebuilt and filled with books , could fail to attend in spirit the recent ceremonies . And hundreds of students who have not had that good fortune have yet had occasion , by correspondence , to test the fidelity and good will of the administrators of Sir Thomas Bodley 's trust . There are great libraries which are veritable cemeteries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an intruder . This the Bodleian emphatically is not , and the attendance of representatives of many lands and institutions of learning of the Bodleian tercentenary , is , perhaps , quite as much a tribute to the enlightened management of Sir E. Maunde Thompson , Mr. Nicholson , and their assistants , as it is to the revered memory of Sir Thomas Bodley . The riotous demonstrations at the opening of the Hungarian Parliament may merely represent the permanently unhappy conditions of Parliamentary debate in the Dual Monarchy , or they may portend a bitter opposition to the renewal of the fiscal apportionment ( Ausgleich ) between Austria and Hungary . It is to be feared that the graver interpretation is the truer one . Since December , 1897 , this battle of the Ausglesch has been fought , and while the minor controversies that disturbed the parliaments of the Empire and its con - - stituent kingdoms have been thoroughly threshed out , the apportioning of the burdens of empire has resisted solution . The continuation of the old treaty as a modus vivendi was probably the only possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has given the Hungarians every reason for wilful obstruction . Under this temporary arrangement , Hungary pays a little less than one-third of the imperial expenses . The Austrians , who wish to make the apportionment upon the basis of population , not of taxable property , contended that the share of Hungary should be 43.14 per cent. ? an extreme claim , which they have subsequently reduced to 36 per cent . If it were purely a fiscal matter , arbitration would be easy . But the whole debate is complicated by a racial incompatibility between the German-Austrians and the Magyars which strikingly recalls the Anglo-Irish imbroglio , and by the dread of the growing Pan-Germani% propaganda . The Emperor , who was bitterly attacked , has maintained aikemirable impartiality , and has made grafiual progress towards conciliation . He can , however , hardly live to see his work completed , and will leave no successor of equal ability . It is in view of this great uncertainty that the chronic disorder and obstruction in the legislative bodies of Austria is doubly ominous .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
