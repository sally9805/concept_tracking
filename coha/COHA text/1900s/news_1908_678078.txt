txt Wants to Go to College . One sentence in your interesting item under Topics of the Times about " A Problem of the Family " in yesterday 's TIMES particularly interested me . It is this : " Any boy who really wants -- one might say who really needs -- to go to college , can in this country do it with little or no help from anybody . " Perhaps others besides myself would like further enlightenment as to just how this may be accomplished . I have in mind the case of a boy who is just about to graduate from a New York high school with honors , after a notably successful course . He will try for and probably win a Cornell scholarship . He is very anxious to go through college , intending to study law . His family , however , are not in a position to give him much financial help . He is ambitious , determined , and capable , and perfectly willing to work his way through college if the opportunity be found . The first year is the hardest problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better . If , then , the facts are as you state , perhaps you could suggest some ways of solving the problem of expenses for him and many other young men similarly situated .
