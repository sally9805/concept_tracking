A STORY once used to be current that Lowell took Thackeay to task for employing in Henry Esmond such a modernism as different to . That single expression , lie is reported as saying , proved that the work could not have been written in the period to which its authorship was assigned . The novelist , it was added , admitted the blunder . The story itself is certainly doubtful and probably false . Its truth would argue a lack of familiarity with the language of Queen Anne 's time on the part of two men who were exceptionally familiar with its literature . Assuredly let us hope that it is false for the sake of the one criticising and of the one criticised . If it be true , it is evident that Thackeray was as ignorant that he was all right in his practice as was Lowell that he was all wrong in his criticism . Both must have met the usage in question in works which they had read , even if they had failed to heed it . Thackeray may have been censurable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not for using the expression itself . So far from being a modernism , the employment of it goes back at least to the early part of the seventeenth century . Ever since , it can be found more or less frequently . In the reign of Queen Anne , Esmond could have heard it from the lips of his friends Addison and Steele ; at least he could not help seeing it in print if he read their writings . To find it we have only to turn to one of the most noted pamphlets of the time , with which both Lowell and Thackeray were unquestionably familiar . This was the famous treatise entitled An Argument against Abolishing Christianity . " Not that I am in the least ? of the opinion , " wrote Swift , " with those who hold religion to have been the invention of politicians to keep the lower part of the world in awe ; unless man-kind were then very different to what it is now . " It is the antiquity of the construction that is here under consideration ; not its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this fable teaches , to use the phraseology of tEsop , is that while it is perilous to attempt the reproduction of the speech of the past , it is also perilous to criticise him who sets out to perform the feat . Still , of the two , the former is the much more difficult task . To accomplish it with perfect safety requires a fuller and preciser knowledge of the words and constructions of our speech than has yet been secured . Accordingly a spurious linguistic manufacture is sure to be foisted upon us as the genuine article . It is largely made up by intermingling certain well-known phrases of the period in question with many later verbal and grammatical coinages . Even were the imitator to succeed with the words ? which with our present dictionaries is gradually becoming more possible of achievement ? he is sure to break down in the employment of idioms or syntactical constructions . Instead of the language of a particular century we are supplied with a hodgepodge gathered from the language of centuries before or after . Accordingly , as Wardour Street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great mart for the sale of imitation old furniture , it seems fair to apply the term Wardour Street English to those productions which set out to show us how men spoke in a particular age and succeed only in giving us something which men never spoke in any age . In these attempts writers great and little , but especially little , have been concerned . With the latter we have naught to do here . Of the former Spenser was the first to undertake the practice . The archaic appearance of his writings was not indeed due entirely to an attempt to reproduce the language of the past . It was part and parcel of the general liberties he took with the English tongue . These approached at times dangerously near license , if they did not actually reach it . He had invented a stanza which required a large number of rhymes . But for scarcity of rhymes English is more remarkable than for abundance . In consequence , Spenser , with all his ability to make the most of the resources of the language in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the line in his complicated verse . Accordingly , to secure the requisite number of rhymes he sometimes varied the spelling of a word , sometimes he imposed upon a word a meaning in which no one else had ever thought to use it . There is no intention of conveying the impression that this happened often . It did not . Had such been the case , his work would have been largely unintelligible . Nevertheless it happened occasionally . These variations from authorized forms and accepted senses are sufficient in number to arrest the attention of the linguistic student and occasionally puzzling enough to confound him ; for he is obliged to strain the signification in order to give to the sentence the meaning it was evidently intended to convey . A few examples will make this point clear . Spenser gave , for instance , to inquire the sense of " name " ; for he speaks of " Cantium which Kent we commonly inquire . " He mentions a castle-roof as being " decked with flowers and herbars daintily . " Herbar is au obsolete variant of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Among the creatures , real or imaginary , which are painted on the walls in the castle of Alma are " infernall hags , centaurs , feends , hippodames . " No fauna , truthful or legendary . has had the good fortune to include among its specimens the hippodame . It strictly means a " horse-breaker . " Spenser may have mistaken it for hippotame , an obsolete form of hippopotamus , but probably for the mythological sea-horse called hippo-camp . Finally ? for it is hardly worth while to multiply examples ? Sir Guyon is entertained at the castle of the courteous dame Medina , who meets him at the threshold and him " well did enterprise . " By this last word Spenser meant that she received him with cordial welcome ? a sense which enterprise is hardly fitted to bear , and which is probably not to be found in any other author of our speech . There is , therefore , a good deal of truth in Ben Jonson 's observation that " Spenser writ no language . " He employs words no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sense no one else has ever given them . It was not , however , this disregard of ordinary usages to which Jonson was referring specifically . His condemnation . as the context shows , was of the whole practice of attempting to reproduce the language of a previous period . In his eyes it was clearly not practicable , and even if practicable not desirable . The whole business of " affecting the ancients , " as he phrased it , was objectionable in whatever language attempted . He praised Virgil for his rare use of older forms and terms . He censured Lucretius for his fondness for the rugged survivals and revivals of the past . " He seeks them , " says Jonson , " as some do Chaucerisms with us , which were far better expunged and banished . " As the greatest scholar of his time , at least among men of letters , Jonson could not have failed to be struck both by Spenser 's evident attempts to imitate the diction of his predecessors and by his frequent failure . He saw clearly then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while trying to use the language spoken by the men of a former generation , was often using a language which had never been spoken by men at all . A devoted admirer and follower of Chaucer , Spenser had studied the writings of the elder poet with peculiar care . It was easy enough to revive inflections which had fallen away entirely or had been cut down . He could introduce , as he did again and again , such forms as seeker for " seek " and haste : , for " hosts . " But when it came to the exact sense of words or exact employment of inflections which had become obsolete , he was always liable to be misled in an age in which few facilities existed for mastering the special peculiarities of the speech of the fourteenth century . It was almost inevitable , therefore , that be should sometimes be betrayed into de-filing the speech of him whom he termed the well of English undefiled . This was not from the lack of intimate familiarity with his writings , but from occasional lack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two examples may be deemed sufficient to put the fact beyond dispute . One illustrates the poet 's ignorance of the signification of old words , the other the confusion in the employment of grammatical forms into which he fell . One of the senses in which Chaucer uses the noun chevisaunce is that of " furnishing money on good security . " Spenser supposed it to mean " achievement , noble enterprise . " Fortune , for illustration , is spoken of by him as " the foe of famous chevisaunce . " But an error in the use of a grammatical inflection is always more impressive than one merely in the use of a word . The early English preterite of go , for which went had been substituted , was yede or yode . Spenser did not recognize the two words as variant forms of the same tense . He looked upon yede , the first of them , as an infinitive and present ? frequently spelling it yeed ? of which yode was the regular preterite . Thus we are told that Sir Guyon " on foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have been as strange to Chaucer as to us . Spenser had , in fact , offered to the language a new strong verb , yede , yode , formed after the analogy of steal , stole , or freeze , froze . This the language has declined to accept . If , however , Spenser , dent of Chaucer , used flections that would have astonished his master , his own eighteenth-century imitators contrived to invent or misemploy them in a way that would have confounded him . They not only misunderstood the meaning of his terms , but introduced some new ones which are only known now , so far as they are known at all , by being found in their pages . Let us turn to a production of one of these imitators , which has enough vitality and charm of its own to insure it an independent existence . This is The Castle of Indolence of James Thomson . With-out spending too much time on details , i it is enough to say that Thomson was not satisfied with merely reproducing the errors of Spenser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his text " they yode " and used it rightly . In his glossary , however , he wrongly explained it as " the prefer tense of yede . " But further , on his own account , he turned a weak verb into a strong one when he spoke of having " depainten " a certain scene . But his most unpardonable blunder was his using the ending - en of the infinitive and the plural as a singular . " These I passen by , " he says in one place . " Taunts he casten forth most bitterly , " he writes in another . Grammatical atrocities of this sort are all Thomson 's own . They would have made Spenser himself shudder . In the eighteenth century it was the imitators of Spenser who were responsible for most of this spurious manufacture . In the nineteenth century it was mainly the imitators of Scott . In this particular , as in so many others , the great novelist showed the superiority of his genius to those who strove to follow in his footsteps , The action of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previous study had made him familiar . What he sought . therefore , was to produce upon the reader the impression of it which he himself had come to entertain . The correctness or incorrectness of his view is not in question . It was the truth of life , as he looked at it , that he sought to reproduce . If he could secure that effect , he was as indifferent to the truth of petty detail as was Shakespeare himself . Not that he failed to make the fullest use of the knowledge of the past with which he abounded , whether it pertained to manners or to language . But unlike his imitators he never studied up the subject for the express purpose of unloading upon his unfortunate readers the knowledge he had acquired . Of his attitude in this matter he has not left us in doubt . In the preface to Ivanhoe , in the shape of a dedicatory epistle to the Reverend Doctor Dryasdust , he set forth his own course of action in dealing with the manners and language of the past , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his romance of Queen-boo Hall . " I neither can nor do pretend , " he wrote , " to the observation of complete accuracy , even in matters of outward costume , much less in the more important points of language and manners . " He was as conscious of the folly of such a course as he was of its futility . The liberty of confounding times and speech must indeed be confined , as he said himself , within legitimate bounds . But within these bounds it is more than reasonable ; it is necessary . Outside , therefore , of the words and phrases which came naturally to his thoughts as the result of previous reading , Scott made no effort to revive the peculiar expressions and idioms of the past . He was glad to make use of them when they came in his way ; but he did not go out of his way to search for them , still less did he purpose to confine himself to them . He was trying to give a picture of the times , as he viewed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dictionary or the composition of a grammatical treatise . Naturally it was inevitable that Scott should occasionally employ expressions with which his previous reading and studies had made him familiar . By the immense and permanent popularity of his writings he brought again into use words which had died out . He occasionally started them on a new course of life in senses they had never previously known . Damosel , for instance , was a variant of damsel . This form he revived and made current , in the signification particularly of a lady of high degree . So he brought once more into vogue the obsolete henchman and gave it the meaning of personal attendant . The term has now become fairly familiar . He added also to current use words which in their origin were blunders . One of the most stirring scenes in Ivanhoe is where Rebecca tells the wounded hero of the story of the indifference displayed by the Black Knight to the beams and stones rained upon him as he is battering down the postern of the castle of Front-de-Bceuf . Ivanhoe , ignorant that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there is any one in England besides the king who could perform such a feat . " Singular , " he mutters , " if there be two who can do a deed of such derring-do . " This last word , adopted by Scott 's imitators , though far from common , is now fairly established in the language of poetry and romance . Yet it owes its existence to a series of blunders . It was taken by Spenser from Chaucer . The earlier poet gives it simply its proper sense of " daring to do , " with the not unusual omission of the preposition after dare . Thus he describes Troilus as being " In no degree second In daring do that longeth to a knight . " Spenser combined the two words into one in the form derring-do , and glossed it as " manhood , chivalry . " Then came Scott in the passage just quoted . In a note to it he explained the compound as meaning " desperate courage . " Strictly speaking , therefore , the word is a pseudo-archaism . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the meaning it has assumed is a modern imposition in both senses of that word . Spenser had mistaken Chaucer , and Scott had mistaken them both . Etymologically this is all wrong ; but the language is to be congratulated that a series of blunders has given it an expressive word of great poetic beauty . But Scott , while not averse to using occasionally ancient words and phrases , if he could use them effectively , never inserted them for their own sake . Nor did he seek to obtrude them upon the reader . In this respect his course was not followed by his imitators . These vainly strove to make up for lack of genius by fulness and preciseness of information . They paid close heed to the reproduction of the dress and speech of the period , or what they supposed to be its speech and dress . In the matter of language they thought to cast about the subject the air of antiquity by lugging in on all sorts of pretexts obsolete or dialectic words which were supposed to characterize the speech of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speech of the present . The practice , indeed , was sometimes resorted to by men who were in no sense imitators of Scott . Take , for instance , Charles Reade 's fascinating romance of The Cloister and the Hearth . The action takes place in the fifteenth century , and there is at times a pretence of imitating its language . We can pardon iii a work which stands in no need of adventitious linguistic aids such provincialisms , or rather Scotticisms , as anent in the sense of " concerning , " as nor in the sense of " than , " as the use of the verb behave with a personal subject ; such late forms as anan , denoting the desire to have a remark repeated , a word frequent on the lips of Cooper 's hero , Leatherstocking ; such vulgarisms as yours and hisn had even thus early become . But what can we say of eftsoons , which means " moreover , afterward , speedily , " but is used by Reade to signify " lately " ? Even worse , what are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cowen for " places " and " prices " and " cows " ? No human being ever thought of using such forms seriously . Probably no human being before Reade ever thought of writing them . Reade 's linguistic offences , however , arc all lost to sight in the absorbing interest of the story . In another fifteenth-century romance there prevails a similar confusion of the past and the present , of the dialectic speech and the literary . This is the Black Arrow of Robert Stevenson . The condition of this work is even worse than that of Reade 's , because its archaisms , real or reputed , are not merely brought in occasionally , but systematically and regularly . As a result its errors are constantly forced upon the attention . But among all these crude imitations the palm must be awarded to Bulvver 's Last of the Barons . Like that of the two previous works its action goes on in the fifteenth century ; but much of the language used in it belongs to no century with which modern man is acquainted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fails to represent the speech of its period . Take , for illustration , the use of the pronouns . The characters constantly employ the objective you as a nominative . It conduces to the comfort of the reader that they do so . But it was not the way people did at that time . You as a nominative is a corruption which in the sixteenth century became a common usage and later became the common usage . Nobody thinks now of employing ordinarily the grammatically correct ye ; but men did so in the age of which Bulwer was writing . Exactly the same thing can be said of its . All the characters in this Von. cxkx. - 140. 709. - 12 work use it , though this pronominal form was not even in existence until more than a hundred years after . Offences such as these may be pardoned as permissible or at least as venial . But not so others in which the novelist 's defiance of the recognized usage not only of the period he has taken , but of any period whatever , fairly runs riot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no existence in the fifteenth century . There is banter , which did not come into the language till the end of the seventeenth , and starvation , which made its first appearance in the second half of the eighteenth . But words occur in this work which may perhaps be found somewhere else , but which the most comprehensive dictionaries have as yet failed to record . Bulwer speaks , for instance , of " the raptril vulgar " and of the " Lancastrian raptrils . " One feels that this must be a peculiarly disparaging epithet , but exactly what it means or where it came from is no easy matter to ascertain . Like Mrs. Malaprop , indeed , Bulwer in this romance is quite the lord of the language and bestows upon the particular word on which his favor falls any meaning he chooses to have it convey . " Cling to me , gentle donzel , " says one of his characters to a terrified maiden . Donzel is a word which made its first appearance in the speech in the reign of Queen Elizabeth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it do duty for a young woman . With God wot in the sense of " God knows " we are all familiar . Bulwer turned this present tense into a noun and gave us an exclamation , God 's wot . What he meant by it nobody can tell , nor probably could he have told himself . His whole work , indeed , furnishes a fertile field for the gathering of these artificial linguistic flowers , and it would need many a page to describe all the specimens . It may be urged that Bulwer put forth no direct claim that he was designing to reproduce the language of the fifteenth century . He did not indeed do so expressly . But he did it by implication . Otherwise there would be no excuse whatever for the peculiar phraseology employed throughout the work . But not even this plea can be set up in the case of Henry Esmond . Abnut the success of Thaekeray in giving us the speech of the early eighteenth century the most extravagant statements have been made . It has been asserted again and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ romance . No one , we have been told , says in it anything that would not have been said in the time in which the action goes on . One indeed gets the impression from the dedication of the work to Lord Ashburton that Thackeray himself shared in this belief . In that he says expressly that the book copies the language and manners of Queen Anne 's time . So far as regards language , if he meant that he had confined himself to the speech of the period in question , the claim is altogether unwarranted . It was no hard matter to catch certain superficial characteristics of the style of the first half of the eighteenth century . It was easy to begin sentences and clauses with ' t is and ' t was and to stud the page with certain phrases which turn up with unfailing regularity in the writings of the reign of Queen Anne . They can not well be missed by the most unobservant reader . The difficult thing to do is to avoid the use of words and constructions which came in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signally . No small number of his modernisms were long ago pointed out by Fitzedward Hall ; and there are others which escaped even that scholar 's wide-embracing drag-net . Take first the case of a single word . Greville tells us in his Journal that when Queen Victoria read her speech to the council in June , 1837 , everybody was satisfied with the composition of it save Brougham . He appeared in a state of considerable excitement . The noun amelioration had been used . Brougham turned to Sir Robert Peel and made about it the speech we all do when we object to some particular expression . " Amelioration , " said he , " that is not English . You might perhaps say melioration , but improvement is the proper word . " " Oh , " replied Peel , " I see no harm in the word ; it is generally used . " In spite of its modernness there could be no real objection to the employment of it in the reign of Queen Victoria . It is objectionable , however , for a writer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the reign of Queen Anne . Yet this is precisely what Thackeray does . In one of the earliest chapters of Henry Esmond mention is made of " a notable amelioration of the infant 's health . " If any contemporary of the hero of the story used the word , the fact has not been as yet ascertained . Restriction of utterance in order to conform to the grammatical practices of a previous period , furnishes , however , the hardest test of imitation . Two of Thackeray 's errors in this particular are so striking as to deserve special mention . Take the case of the conversion of the adverbs directly , immediately , and instantly into conjunctions with the sense of " as soon as . " This is a usage rarely heard in America , but is not uncommon in England . But even in England it was not known till the very end of the eighteenth century . But in this romance all three of these adverbs are so employed . In the very first chapter we are told that the little heir of Castlewood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother . " But lapses such as these are as nothing compared with the not infrequent use of that new passive form , often illustrated by the expression " the house is being built " as contrasted with " the house is building . " During the middle of the last century ? at the very time indeed when the novelist was writing his story ? there raged so fierce a controversy about this particular construction that it hardly seems possible that any writer could have been ignorant of its comparatively recent introduction into the speech . The language , in fact , was doing one of the rarest things a language ever does after having come into the possession of an established literature . It was evolving a new grammatical inflection . Mighty and protracted are the throes which a cultivated tongue goes through in giving birth to a creation of this sort . In this particular instance the cries of pain echoed almost down to the end of the century . It is certainly strange that Thackeray should have been unaware of the clamor that attended the introduction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been indifferent to the violent anachronism of attributing it to the speech of a period which he was WARDOTTR STREET ENGLISH . professedly aiming to imitate . Yet in his very prefatory chapter he spoke of a resolute old loyalist as staying with the king " while his house was being battered down . " This , too , is but one of several instances . In justice to Thackeray it is fair to say that the verb-phrase in question had made its appearance in the speech before his hero was born . In the second act of Major Porter 's play of The Villain , which was published in 160 , occurs the earliest known instance of the construction which is now far from being uncommon . It is in these following lines : " The fear of theeves is worse than the loss we can sustain by them : We 're still a being rob 'd . " But a single example does not constitute a usage any more than one swallow makes a summer . A hundred years went by before the new verb-phrase began to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the opposition it encountered . Not an instance of its employment has beeM pointed out in a writer belonging to the reign of Queen Anne and the first Georges . It may be said , too , of this construction that its history furnishes a peculiarly interesting illustration of the efforts , in this instance the successful efforts , of a language to supply itself with means of expression which it feels to be lacking . To use the example already cited , . " the house is building " was itself in its origin a corruption . A verbal noun " building , " governed by a preposition , came by the dropping of the preposition to be considered a constituent part of the verb . Still the inflection thus begot was so useful that the offence was condoned . The language accepted it and employed it . The trouble.with it was that it did not go far enough . It could be used only when the subject was impersonal or rather inanimate . One could say that " the dinner is preparing " and nobody would assume that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of getting itself ready . But all the possibility of such interpretations of the meaning disappeared when the subject of the verb had life . " The dinner is preparing " could serve as a sort ofquasi-passive . But such an expression as " the man is eating " could not . No one could or would draw from it the conclusion that the man himself was serving as a sort of food supply . This one example reveals the fatal defect of the inflection . It lacked universality . But it was only after long and abortive efforts to reach a satisfactory solution of the problem that the users of language hit upon the expedient of forming a new verb-phrase out of the substantive verb and the compound past participle , with which personal and impersonal subjects could alike be employed . Even this it required years of agitation and controversy to induce men . to accept . But in the days of Queen Anne the probation of the new inflection had not even been begun . Consequently in using it as he did several times in the course of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period he was depicting . There are two lessons to be drawn from the facts here given . One is that attempts to reproduce the language of the past are fairly sure to end in failure . The utmost that can ordinarily be hoped for is to drag in those characteristics of the speech of any period which lie on the surface , and by this means cast about the work in the minds of the ignorant and unwary a false glamour of antiquity . ' Whether this is worth doing at all is another question . But even if absolute success could be secured in the matter , it would be gained at the expense of spontaneity . We must keep before our eyes the unnecaisary burden with which the author weighs himself down who sets out to represent the past in the language of the past . He must sedulously refrain from the use of no small number of words and phrases which would naturally occur to him as best expressing the ideas he seeks to convey . He would be compelled to sacrifice a greater beauty in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawn is that the fact of failure here set forth is in itself of no special importance . It detracts little if at all from the value of the works just mentioned that in them errors of this particular kind appear . It is the business of the creative imagination to portray the truth of life in order to delight , to inspire , to uplift . It is not its business to satisfy the cravings of the antiquary by its fidelity to precise fact . Of course a writer ought not to set at naught the knowledge which may be considered the common property of all men , unless by so doing some higher purpose is subserved . But he is misapplying his time if he spends it in seeking to secure accuracy in matters not germane to his purpose , in which also few will know if he fails and which fewer will appreciate if he succeeds . But any blunders into which he may be betrayed by his ignorance will be of slightest importance as contrasted with the blunder of the critic who insists that the non-essential shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to be judged by its success in its own field and not by its failure in some other field into which its creator has inadvertently strayed or consciously intruded . Were a writer to set out to furnish a scientific description of the valley of the Susquehanna , he would justly draw upon himself contempt and derision were he to represent the flamingo as disporting in its waters or palms adorning its hillsides . Yet these were contributions made to the flora and fauna of the region by Campbell in his Gertrude of Wyoming . Whatever value we attach to the poem as poetry is not affected in the slightest by his action . As regards this same truth of fact it would also have been better had Kingsley in his Westward Ho refrained from supplying Virginia with the palm . It would furthermore have been better if Thackeray had not allowed George Warrington , in narrating his escape from Fort Duquesne in the autumn of the year , to observe that he had fallen in with hunters who were making sugar from the sap of the maple . Lapses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who is aware of the actual truth ; but if he has an atom of sense they will not detract from either his enjoyment or appreciation of the work wherein they are found . It is exactly the same with the linguistic errors into which he falls who with insufficient equipment sets out to tell the story of the past in the language of the past . The mistakes he is sure to make will not impair perceptibly the worth of what he has accomplished . They will indeed never be suspected by the vast majority of readers . It is only indeed by some wretched pedagogue like myself that they will ever be recognized at all . Even to such the main regret they cause is that writers should take up or rather waste time in efforts to secure for their works a sort of ornament which , if genuine , would be of slightest value , and which can be trusted to turn out almost universally to be spurious .
