THE most far-reaching scientific conclusions can often be expressed in very simple words . The difficulty in comprehending such truths is not a matter of understanding the bare meaning of the words . It is rather a question of an imagination awakened so as to realize , to visualize , as it were , statements that are usually simple in form but profoundly intricate in their implications . It is a commonplace that the Earth -- this familiar Earth , our home ? is spinning through space in circles round the Sun ; that the Moon ? our Moon ? is spinning round the Earth in the same way . Nothing can be simpler than the bare statement ; every school-boy has it at his tongue 's end ; but is it realized ? The motion of a rifle ball is startlingly swift . One can not even think of it without a strain of the attention . The motion of the Earth in its orbit is forty times more swift . The words are simple ; but the picture of our Earth hurrying through space at this amazing speed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balls of the sea-fight at Santiago de Cuba when stopped by an armor plate fuses the steel all around its point of impact ? melts it with fervent heat . If the Earth were to strike another mass of the same sort , both masses would be melted , vaporized , almost in an instant . The difference between our Earth and the Sun depends on a difference of temperature . The Sun is a star ; and a star is a mass of flaming incandescent gas surrounding an intensely heated nucleus . Cool such a mass sufficiently and it becomes a dark star very like the Earth . Cool the Earth to the temperature of Space and it becomes a body very like our own Moon . Or , heat the Earth sufficiently and it becomes a miniature Sun , differing in no essential respect . from the Sun in our heavens . The problem of the birth and death of worlds is bound up with the problem of stellar temperature . It is seldom realized how narrow are the temperature conditions under which human life can exist at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Church spire measured the whole range of cosmical temperatures , the thickness of a single one of its building-stones would more than suffice to measure the very few degrees within which human life is possible on the Earth . Men can live , as the Arabs do , in the burning Sahara , or , like the Eskimo , in the frozen North . These are near the limits ; a very few degrees more ? or legs ? make human life impossible anywhere . It is fairly Certain that the Earth has not received any considerable amount of heat from the outside since the earliest geological ages , except its steady supply from the Sun . The changes in the Earth 's structure and condition have arisen , then , from changes in its own temperatUre . The interior of the Earth is now much hotter than its surface , and very much hotter than the celestial spaces surrounding it . It is continually losing heat by radiation . The heat of the interior regions is continually working its way to the crust , and as continually it is radiated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crust would , long ago , have become as hot as the interior . This loss of heat must , necessarily , have been continuing for ages . If we go a step backward in time we find that the Earth must then have been hotter ; another step , and the Earth must have been hotter still . Other such steps take us backward to a period when the Earth was molten , and , finally , to an epoch when the whole Earth was a mass of fiery vapor . Precisely the same reasoning shows that the Sun is constantly losing heat . It had more heat yesterday than to-day ; more heat last year than this . The further backward in time we go , the greater the heat of the Sun must then have been . Increase of size runs parallel with increase of temperature . A red-hot cannon ball fills more space than a cold one . Vaporize the iron mass , and its gaseous particles will fill a much greater spherical extent . There must have been an epoch in the past when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole of the space now occupied by the planets . The planets were , then , not separate individual bodies ; they were , at most , nuclei within the fiery mist of the expanded Sun . As the mass cooled , contraction and condensation took place . The mass was at first , in all likelihood , globular , of nearly homogeneous density throughout , and endowed with a slow rotation in the direction in which the planets now traverse their orbits . As cooling progressed . the mass grew smaller and rotated more rapidly . A rotating body of the sort is flattened at the poles ; and in consequence the primitive sphere would.in time , and with increased velocity of rotation , become a flattened , lens-like disc , very thin in proportion to its extent ? like a twirled mop . Solid nuclei within the disc would be drawn together by their attractions and form primitive planets . As the fiery nebula contracted still further other such planets would become isolated . Each of them would consist of a. nucleus formed of substances that condense at very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atmospheres containing the white-hot vapors of more volatile metals ? iron , zinc , magnesium , etc . From such planets , satellites might be formed by a like process . The Moon was born of throes like these ? separated from its parent Earth in some moment of titanic convulsion . At the beginning all the planets would be molten ? shining like miniature Suns . So long as they remained liquid their cooled crusts would sink into the hot interior , and new portions of the interior would rise to take their places . The whole planet would boil , so r o say . In time continued cooling would form a permanent semi - solid crust , and the cooling of the interior would be greatly retarded . The earliest stages of the Earth 's history are represented by the state of the Sun at the present day . The Earth was then surrounded by a fiery atmosphere , whose white-hot clouds and rains were drops of melted metals ? drops of iron , copper , quicksilver . Tts winds were hurricanes , tearing and driving the metallic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ molten lava and flame rolled round the surface , building a new crust with every tide . What the Earth is now , we know . What it will become in the future , the Moon tells us . The Earth is a Sun that has lost most of its heat ; the Moon is an Earth that has lost all of it . Such , in the briefest form , is the Nebular Hypothesis , known as Laplace 's ( though independently proposed by Swedenborg and by Kant ) . It accounts , on the whole satisfactorily , for the transformations which have taken place in the matter forming our solar system . It has not a word to say as to the origin of matter ; it deals with its transformations alone . Neither has it a word to say as to the origin of life . The widest generalization connected with it announces that the original nebula must have contained all the matter now in the system , and must have possessed all the energy now operative as light , heat , etc. , as well as all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past . It follows that the system can not be self-sustaining . As it had a beginning in its present form , so it must have an end . Its life - blood is heat . Its heat is being expended . At a calculable time in the future some 20,000,000 years ? all its heat will have been expended , and all life will have become extinct . The Earth , the Sun , and all the planets will have evolved to the present state of our Moon . The Nebular Hypothesis of Laplace , with a few additions , brings us to conclusions like the foregoing , and there is uu reason to doubt that they will stand . The precise number of millions of years that the solar system is to endure is not fixed , but the principles at the basis of the reasoning are sound and sufficient. - Since the time of Laplace there has been but one material addition to the principles involved in his vast argument ? namely , the principle of Tidal Evolution , which was suggested , in its essentials , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its development in the elaborate mathematical analysis of Professor George Darwin , a son of the great naturalist . It is a postulate of the Nebular Hypothesis that all the energy in the primitive mass which formed the Earth was transferred to it , and has been expended only in certain known ways . The Earth is considered , according to Laplace , as a huge rigid fly-wheel , rotating about its axis . But is the Earth rigid ? Its solid mass is substantially rigid , but what of its oceans with their tides ? The tides , we know , are the visible effects of the attraction of our satellite the Moon . Vast bodies of water are daily moved by this attraction , and by their motion perform work . The terrestrial fly-wheel is perpetually retarded in its rotation , by it brake perpetually applied , and its energy of rotation is perpetually diminished . The action of the tides is always in one direction ; they constantly retard the Earth 's rotation , though by an excessively small amount . The day ? the time required for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then , be growing longer . To - day is longer than yesterday ; yesterday was longer than the day before . The increase in the length of the day is so small that there is no experimental , observational proof of it . In a thousand years it does not amount to a second . But the brake is always there ? always acting ; and its action is always in one - direction . The Earth revolves on its axis once in twenty-four hours . Millions of years ago the day was twenty-two hours ; millions of years before , it was twenty-one hours . As we look backward into time we find the Earth revolving faster and faster . There was a time , ages ago , long before geology begins , when the Earth was rotating in a day of five or six hours in length . In the remotest past the Earth revolved in a day of about five hours . It could revolve no faster than this and remain a single unbroken mass . It was at this time that the Moon was born ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Earth . The Earth was then a molten flattened sphere of lava . Its whole body was fluid . The tides , which now are small , superficial , and , so to say , local , were then universal and immense . They occurred at short intervals . The whole surface of our globe was affected . And the corresponding lunar tides in the fluid molten Moon were indefinitely greater still . Our day is now twenty-four hours ; the distance of the Moon is now 240 , - 000 miles .. When our day was about five hours long , the Moon was in contact with the Earth 's surface . It had just broken away from its parent mass . As the length of the terrestrial day increased , so did the distance of the Moon . The two quantities are connected by inexorable equations . If one varies , so must the other . Whenever the rotation time of a planet is shorter than the period of revolution of its satellite , the effect of their mutual action is to accelerate the motion of the satellite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? to increase its distance , therefore . The day of the Earth is now shorter than the month ? the period of revolution ? of the Moon . The Moon is therefore slowly receding from us , and it has been receding for thousands of centuries . But the day of the Earth is , as we have seen , slowly growing longer . The finger of the tides is always pressing upon the rim of our huge fly-wheel , and slowly but surely lessening the speed of its rotation . So long as the terrestrial day is shorter than the lunar month , the Moon will continue to recede from us , There will come a time in the remote future when the terrestrial day will have lengthened , by slow steps , to fifty-seven of our present days . And at that distant epoch the Moon will revolve about the Earth in the same period of fifty-seven days . The Earth-Moon system will then resemble a huge dumb-bell with two unequal ends . The mass of the Earth at one end and the mass of the Moon at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ends of the dumb-bell will revolve face to face precisely as if they were connected by a rigid rod . The Moon will hang over the sky of a single region of our globe forever . This we may truly call the epoch of the death of our Moon . The mark of life is change ; and in that distant future there will be no more change of motion . Change in the topography of the Moon has long since ceased . The pictures that accompany this paper show the features of our satellite as they have existed for countless ages . The active agents of terrestrial change are not present on the Moon ? water , frost , air , The Moonhas been dead to topographical change for millions of years . When Tidal Evolution shall have brought the Earth-Moon system to a state so stable that no change in motions can ever again occur , then , indeed , we may say that death has come . NOTE . ? The accompanying pictures of the Moon are direct copies of glass photographs taken at Mount Hamilton with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ length of this telescope is 471/ , feet , and the image of the moon is therefore about five inches in diameter . The original focal negatives were subsequently enlarged , in a camera , to any desired scale ? usually to a scale of three French feet ( 38.36 English inches ) , to correspond with Maedlees map of the Moon : or to double this scale , to correspond to the great lunar map of Dr. Schmidt . Director of the Observatory of Athens . Special regions of the Moon 's surface were enlarged to different scales for purposes of study , and Professor Weinek . Director of the Observatory of Prague , has employed the Lick Observatory negatives , which were furnished to him , to make a complete Atlas of the Moon on a scale of ten feet to the Moon 's diameter . By the liberality of Mr. Walter Law , of New York , many sheets of a similar atlas , op a smaller and more convenient scale , were published at Mount Hamilton and widely distributed . Fig. 2 is reduced from one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negative taken on October 8 , 1895 , at 15h. 6m. 8s. to 18s . The Moon was then 20 days and 14 hours old , and the picture shows a small area near the western edge . At the lower left-hand corner a portion of the Sea of Serenity I Mare Serenitatial shows , bordered by high peaks , with here and there a large crater . Above this sea and extending nearly to the dark border of the Moon is a great cleft ? the ifill of Aridwus -- that may be compared with the Grand Canon of the Colorado River . At the right-hand end of this rill is another in the shape of a very much flattened V ? the Rdu of Hy-gums . In ' the opening of this V is a famous crater in which changes have been reported . The age of the Moon in Fig. 1 is about ten days , and it gives an excellent view of the Moon as a whole . The darker regions are the so-called Meas . Craters of all sizes are shown all over the surface , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the upper half . Two of the craters deserve especial attention . Tycho is the deep crater in the upper ( southern ) half of Fig. 1 . It looks like ale stem of the lunar orange , and from it radiates a wonderful series of brilliant streaks . The huge crater of Copernicus ( shown on the horizontal diameter of Fig. 1 near the dark edge ) is 56 miles in diameter , and is noted for a very complex series of brilliant streaks that radiate from it in all directions for hundreds of miles . Near the lower right-hand border of the same figure is a range of mountains enclosing the Sinus friduin ? the Bay of Rainbows . Fig. 3 shows the smallest of the lunar seas ? Mare Crisium ? and the rugged regions surrounding it . Fig.4 shows the range of Lunar Apennines with the crater Eretosthenes at its end , and the three craters A rchimedes , Aristinus. and Autolycua symmetrically ranged below . Fig. 5 is a view of the great crater ( Univ. -9 , showing the extremely rugged regions near the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor and on the walls of C/avius , and the sharp border between the illuminated edge of the wall and the neighboring darkness .
