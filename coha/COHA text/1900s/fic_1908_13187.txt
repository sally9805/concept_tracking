Scene : The market-place of Hamelin . Right , the Minster , with an open shrine ( right centre ) containing a large sculptured figure of the Christ . Right , farther front , the house of Kurt ; and other narrow house-fronts . Left , the Rathaus , and ( down ) the home of Jacobus . Front , to left and right , are corner-houses with projecting stories and casement windows . At the centre rear , a narrow street leads away between houses whose gables all but meet overhead . It is late summer afternoon , with a holiday crowd . In the open casements , front ( right and left , opposite each other ) , sit Old Ursula and Old Claus , looking on at men and things .  --  In the centre of the place now stands a rude wooden Ark with a tented top : and out of the openings ( right and left ) appear the artificial heads of animals , worn by the players inside . One is a Bear ( inhabited by Michael-the-Sword-Eater ) ; one is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by is the medival piece of stage-property known as Hell-Mouth , i. e. a red painted cave with a jaw-like opening , into which a mountebank dressed in scarlet ( Cheat-the-Devil ) is poking Lost Souls with a pitchfork . Barbara loiters by the tent . Veronika , the sad young wife of Kurt , watches from the house steps , left , keeping her little lame boy , Jan , close beside her . Shouts of delight greet the end of the show ,  --  a Noah 's Ark miracle-play of the rudest ; and the Children continue to scream with joy whenever an Animal looks out of the Ark . Men and women pay scant attention either to Jacobus , when he speaks ( himself none too sober )  --  from his doorstep , prompted by the frowning Kurt ,  --  or yet to Anselm , the priest , who stands forth with lifted hands , at the close of the miracle-play . ANSELM AND you , who heed the colors of this show , Look to your laughter !  --  It doth body forth A Judgment that may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unto chattering leaves Some wind of wrath shall scourge to nothingness . p. 3 HANS , AXEL , AND OTHERS Hurrah , Hurrah !

And now , ye wit , it will be full three days Since we beheld  --  our late departed pest .  --  OLD URSULA putting out an ear-trumpet What does he say ? REYNARD from the Ark  --  Oh , how felicitous ! WIFE OF HANS He 's only saying there be no more rats .

HANS THE BUTCHER Hath no man seen the Piper ?  --  Please your worships . OTHERS Ay , ay , so !  --  Ay , where is he ?  --  Ho , the Piper ! JACOBUS Piper , my good man ? HANS THE BUTCHER  --  He that charmed the rats ! OTHERS Yes , yes ,  --  that charmed the rats ! JACOBUS piously Why , no man knows .  --  Which proves him such a random instrument As Heaven doth sometimes send us , to our use ; Or , as I do conceive , no man at all ,  --  A man of air ; or , I would say  --  delusion . He 'll come no more . p. 5 REYNARD from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! JACOBUS ' T is clearest providence . The rats are gone . The man is gone . And there is nought to pay , Save peaceful worship .

KURT Silence ,  --  you strollers there ! Or I will have you Gaoled , one and all . PEOPLE No , Kurt the Syndic , no ! BARBARA to Jacobus No , no ! Ah , father , bid them stay awhile And play it all again .  --  Or , if not all , Do let us see that same good youth again , Who swallowed swords  --  between the Ark Preserved And the Last Judgment ! REYNARD Michael-the-Sword-Eater , Laurels for thee ! The Bear disappears : Michael puts out his own head , and gazes fixedly at Barbara. p. 6 CHILDREN Oh , ca n't we see the animals in the Ark ? Again ? Oh , ca n't we see it all again ? ILSE Oh , leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dromedaries , and the other ones !  --  General confusion . KURT Silence ! JACOBUS Good people  --  you have had your shows ; And it is meet , that having held due feast , Both with our market and this Miracle , We bring our holiday to close with prayer And public thanks unto Saint Willibald ,  --  Upon whose day the rats departed thence . REYNARD loudly Saint Willibald ! BEAR  --  Saint Willibald ! OTHER ANIMALS looking out Saint Willibald ! Saint ! Oh ! CROWD Saint Willibald !  --  And what had he to do With ridding us o ' rats ? HANS THE BUTCHER ' T was the Piping Man Who came and stood here in the market-places And swore to do it for one thousand guilders ! p. 7 PETER THE COBBLER Ay , and he did it , too !  --  Saint Willibald !

But cry him , if you will .  --  Peace to your lungs !  --  He will not come . Kurt wrathfully consults with Jacobus , then signals to Crier . TOWN CRIER Oyez ! Oyez ! Oyez ! Whereas , now three days gone , our Plague of Rats Was wholly driven hence , our City cleansed , Our peace restored after sore threat of famine , By a Strange Man who came not back again , Now , therefore , if this Man have ears to hear , Let him stand forth .  --  Oyez !

KURT AND JACOBUS The Devil !  --  ' T is  --  ALL  --  The Piper ! The Piper regards them all with debonair satisfaction ; then reverses his head-piece and holds it out upside-down , with a confident smile . PIPER Three days of rest , your worships , you have had . I see no signs of famine hereabout . The rats are gone , even to the nethermost tail : And I 've fulfilled my bargain . Is it granted ? Murmurs , then cheers of " Ay , Ay , Piper ! " from the crowd .

Michael comes down , bear-head in hand . BARBARA regarding him sadly That goodly sword-eater ! PIPER defiantly So , Michael , so .  --  These be two friends of mine . Pay now an even third to each of us . Or , to content your doubts , to each of these Do you pay here and now , five hundred guilders . Who gets it matters little , for us friends . But you will pay the sum , friend . You will pay !  --  p. 13 HANS , AXEL , AND CROWD Come , there 's an honest fellow .

MICHAEL-THE-SWORD-EATER sullenly No , no more glass , to-day ! PIPER Then fire and sword ! They back away . So !  --  And there 's not one man In Hamelin , here , so honest of his word . Stroller ! A pretty choice you leave us.  --  Quit This strolling life , or stroll into a cage ! What do you offer him ? A man eats fire  --  Swords , glass , young April frogs  --  p. 14 CHILDREN Do it again !

Nor do I. But for the something he has seen of life , Making men merry , he 'd know something more ! The gentlest devil ever spiked Lost Souls Into Hell-mouth ,  --  for nothing-by-the-day ! OLD URSULA with her ear-trumpet Piper , why do you call him Cheat-the-Devil ? PIPER Because his deviltry is all a cheat :  --  He is no devil ,  --  but a gentle heart !  --  Friend Michael here hath played the Devil , betimes , Because he can so bravely breathe out fire . He plied the pitchfork so we yelped for mercy ,  --  He reckoned not the stoutness of his arm !  --  But Cheat-the-Devil here ,  --  he would not hurt Why  --  Kurt the Syndic  --  thrusting him in hell . Laughter. p. 15 CHEAT-THE-DEVIL unhappily No , no  --  I will not hurt him ! PIPER soothingly to him Merry , boy !

Wife ,  --  now that would smack o ' pride ! PETER THE COBBLER I 'll take this fellow that can swallow fire . He 's somewhat old for me . But he can learn My trade .  --  A pretty fellow ! PIPER And your trade ? PETER THE COBBLER Peter the cobbler.  --  MICHAEL-THE-SWORD-EATER I ? What , I ? Make shoes ? Proudly I swallow fire . PIPER Enough . p. 16 BARBARA aside , bitterly I 'll not believe it . PIPER to Hans Your trade ? HANS THE BUTCHER I 'm Hans the Butcher . MICHAEL-THE-SWORD-EATER Butcher ?

The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following join the other player-folk , strike their tent , pack their bundles , and wheel off the barrows that have served them for an Ark , leaving the space clear before the Shrine . Exeunt Strollers , all but Michael , who hangs about , still gazing at Barbara . JACOBUS Good people , we have wasted time enow . You see this fellow , that he has no writ  --  PIPER Why not , then ? ' T was a bargain . If your word Hold only when ' t is writ  --  KURT We can not spend Clerkship on them that neither write nor read . What good would parchment do thee ? p. 17 JACOBUS My good man  --  PIPER Who says I can not read ?  --  Who says I can not ? OLD CLAUS Piper , do n't tell me you can read in books ! PIPER at bay Books ! Where 's a book ? Shew me a book , I say ! OLD URSULA The Holy Book ! Bring that  --  or he 'll bewitch you . PIPER Oh , never fear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rats are gone .  --  Bring me a Book : A big one !  --  Murmurs . The Piper defiant . The crowd moves towards the Minster . Enter Anselm the priest , with a little acolyte ,  --  the two bearing a large illuminated Gospel-book . Anselm , eyeing the Piper gravely , opens the book , which the boy supports on his head and shoulders . PIPER Ho , ' t is too heavy ! Come , you cherub-head , Here 's too much laid upon one guardian angel ! Beckons another small boy , and sets the book on their two backs . Well ?  --  well ? What now ? He looks in frank bewilderment at the eager crowd. p. 18 CROWD Read , read ! KURT He can not read . PIPER to Anselm Turn  --  turn  --  there 's nothing there . Anselm turns pages . Piper looks on blankly . . . . Ah , turn again ! The big red Letter .  --  He takes his pipe from his belt . No , the green ! The green one . So . Starts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' t is a mad-man ! But hear him piping ! What is he doing ? PIPER puzzled at their mirth What the green one says .  --  A burst of laughter from the crowd . Jan , the little lame boy on the steps , reaches his arms out suddenly and gives a cry of delight . JAN Oh , I love the Man ! He goes , with his crutch , to the Piper , who turns and gathers him close . JACOBUS to the People Leave off this argument . KURT In ,  --  to the minster . p. 19 JACOBUS Saint Willibald ! PIPER in a rage That Saint !  --  KURT Hence , wandering dog ! PIPER Oho !  --  Well , every Saint may have his day . But there are dog-days coming .  --  Eh , your worship ? To Anselm , suddenly You , there ! You  --  Brother  --  Father  --  Uncle  --  You ! Speak ! Will you let them in , to say their prayers And mock me through their fingers ?  --  Tell these men To settle it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then will I go . KURT savagely Away with you !  --  ANSELM The Piper should be heard ; Ye know it well . Render to Csar , therefore , That which is Csar 's . PIPER  --  Give the Devil his due ! JACOBUS warily We must take counsel over such a sum . Beckoning others , he and Kurt go into the Rathaus , followed by all the men . Exit Anselm with the Holy Book into the Minster .  --  The children play Mouse , to and fro , round about the Piper .  --  The women , some of them , spin on the doorsteps , with little hand distaffs , or stand about , gossiping . The Piper wipes his forehead and goes up slowly ( centre ) to drink from the fountain at the foot of the Shrine .  --  Michael , like one in a dream , comes down towards Barbara , who gazes back at him , fascinated , through her laughter. p. 20 BARBARA Is it for pay you loiter , Master Player ? Were you not paid enough ? MICHAEL-THE-SWORD-EATER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  --  Still not enough ? MICHAEL-THE-SWORD-EATER No ! One more smile . BARBARA agitated Why would you have me smile ? MICHAEL-THE-SWORD-EATER passionately Oh , when you smiled , It was  --  it was like sunlight coming through Some window there , Pointing to the Minster  --  some vision of Our Lady . She drops her flowers .  --  He picks them up and gives them back slowly . BARBARA Who are you ? You are some one in disguise . MICHAEL-THE-SWORD-EATER bitterly A man  --  that passes for a mountebank . BARBARA eagerly I knew ! MICHAEL-THE-SWORD-EATER What then ? p. 21 BARBARA Thou art of noble birth . ' T is some disguise , this playing with the fire ! MICHAEL-THE-SWORD-EATER Yes .  --  For to-day , I lord it with the fire . But it hath burned me , here . Touching his breast . Overcome for the moment , she draws away .  --  The Piper , coming down , speaks stealthily to Michael , who is still gazing . PIPER For all our sakes ! There is bad weather breeding .  --  Take to thy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and throws a rose to him with sudden gayety . BARBARA Farewell to you , Sword-Swallower !  --  farewell ! MICHAEL-THE-SWORD-EATER looking back Farewell to you , my Lady , in-the-Moon . Exit . Jan clings once more to the Piper , while the other children hang about . Enter Veronika from her house . She goes towards her boy . VERONIKA Darling .  --  PIPER drawing nearer Is this your Boy ? p. 22 VERONIKA Ay , he is mine ; My only one . He loved thy piping so . PIPER And I loved his . WIFE OF HANS stridently Poor little boy ! He 's lame ! PIPER ' T is all of us are lame ! But he , he flies . VERONIKA Jan , stay here if you will , and hear the pipe , At Church-time . PIPER to him Wilt thou ? JAN softly Mother lets me stay Here with the Lonely Man . PIPER The Lonely Man ? Jan points to the Christ in the Shrine . Veronika crosses herself . The Piper looks long at the little boy . VERONIKA He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VERONIKA It grieves him that the Head is always bowed , And stricken . But he loves more to be here Than yonder in the church . PIPER And so do I. p. 23 VERONIKA What would you , darling , with the Lonely Man ? What do you wait to see ? JAN shyly To see Him smile . The women murmur . The Piper comes down further to speak to Veronika . PIPER You are some foreign woman . Are you not ? Never from Hamelin ! VERONIKA No . WIFE OF AXEL to her child Then run along . And ask the Piper if he 'll play again The tune that charmed the rats . ANOTHER They might come back ! OLD URSULA calling from her window Piper ! I want the tune that charmed the rats ! If they come back , I 'll have my grandson play it . PIPER I pipe but for the children . ILSE dropping her doll and picking it up Oh , do pipe Something for Fridolin ! HANSEL Oh , pipe at me ! Now I 'm a mouse ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  p. 24 CHILDREN Oh , pipe ! Oh , play ! Oh , play and make us dance ! Oh , play , and make us run away from school ! PIPER Why , what are these ?

La , what will the neighbors say ? ILSE Waving her doll Oh , please do play something for Fridolin ! WIFE OF AXEL Do hear the child . She 's quite the little mother ! PIPER A little mother ? Ugh ! How horrible . That fairy thing , that princess ,  --  no , that Child ! A little mother ? To her Drop the ugly thing ! WIFE OF MARTIN Now , on my word ! and what 's amiss with mothers ? Are mothers horrible ? The Piper is struck with painful memories . PIPER No , no . But  --  care And want and pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bitter change of voice And penny-wealth ,  --  And penny-counting.  --  Penny prides and fears  --  Of what the neighbors say the neighbors say !  --  p. 25 WIFE OF MARTIN And were you born without a mother , then ? ALL Yes , you there ! Ah , I told you ! He 's no man . He 's of the devil . WIFE OF MARTIN Who was your mother , then ? PIPER fiercely Mine !  --  Nay , I do not know . For when I saw her , She was a thing so trodden , lost and sad , I can not think that she was ever young , Save in the cherishing voice .  --  She was a stroller . The women draw aside furtively , two by two , and listen unwillingly from the doorsteps with looks of dread and aversion , as the Piper continues with growing passion . She was a stroller.  --  And she starved and sang ; And like the wind , she wandered , and was cold , Outside your lighted windows , and fled by , Storm-hunted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and homeless as a broken bird ,  --  Limping and hiding !  --  And she fled , and laughed , And kept me warm ; and died To you , a Nothing ; Nothing , forever , oh , you well-housed mothers ! As always , always for the lighted windows Of all the world , the Dark outside is nothing ; And all that limps and hides there in the dark ; Famishing ,  --  broken ,  --  lost ! And I have sworn For her sake and for all , that I will have Some justice , all so late , for wretched men , Out of these same smug towns that drive us forth After the show !  --  Or scheme to cage us up Out of the sunlight ; like a squirrel 's heart Torn out and drying in the market-place . My mother ! Do you know what mothers are ?  --  Your children ! Do you know them ? Ah , not you ! There 's not one here but it would follow me , For all your bleating ! p. 26 WIFE OF AXEL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He smiles down triumphantly . PIPER Oho , Oho ! Look you ?  --  You preach  --  I pipe ! Renter the men , with Kurt and Jacobus , from the Rathaus , murmuring dubiously . The Piper sets down Jan and stands forth , smiling . JACOBUS smoothly H 'm ! My good man , we have faithfully debated Whether your vision of so great a sum Might be fulfilled ,  --  as by some miracle . But no . The moneys we administer Will not allow it ; nor the common weal . Therefore , for your late service , here you have Full fifteen guilders , Holding forth a purse and a pretty sum Indeed , for piping ! KURT ominously Take them ! JACOBUS Either that , Or , to speak truly , nothing ! The Piper is motionless Come , come . Nay , count them , if you will . KURT Time goes ! PIPER Ay . And your oath ? p. 27 KURT No more ; Enough . There is a sound of organ music from the Minster . VERONIKA beseechingly Ah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mewling of this fellow 's rights ? He hath none !  --  Wit ye well , he is a stroller , A wastrel , and the shadow of a man ! Ye waste the day and dally with the law . Such have no rights ; not in their life nor body ! We are in no wise bound . Nothing is his . He may not carry arms ; nor have redress For any harm that men should put on him , Saving to strike a shadow on the wall ! He is a Nothing , by the statute-book ; And , by the book , so let him live or die , Like to a masterless dog ! The Piper stands motionless with head upraised , not looking at Kurt . The people , half-cowed , half-doubting , murmur and draw back . Lights appear in the Minster ; the music continues . Kurt and Jacobus lead in the people . Jacobus picks up the money-purse and takes it with him . VOICES laughing , drunkenly One thousand guilders to a masterless dog ! Others laugh too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and echoes of Masterless Dog Exeunt Women and Men to the Minster . Only the children are left , dancing round the motionless figure of the Piper. p. 28 CHILDREN Oh , pipe again ! Oh , pipe and make us dance ! Oh , pipe and make us run away from school ! Oh , pipe and make believe we are the mice ! He looks down at them . He looks up at the houses . Then he signs to them , with his finger on his lips ; and begins , very softly , to pipe the Kinder-spell . The old Claus and Ursula in the windows seem to doze . The children stop first , and look at him , fascinated ; then they laugh , drowsily , and creep closer ,  --  Jan always near . They crowd around him . He pipes louder , moving backwards , slowly , with magical gestures , towards the little by-streets and the closed doors . The doors open , everywhere . Out come the children : little ones in nightgowns ; bigger ones , with playthings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ louder . They pour in , right and left . Motion and music fill the air . The Piper lifts Jan to his shoulder ( dropping the little crutch ) and marches off , up the street at the rear , piping , in the midst of them all . Last , out of the Minister come tumbling two little acolytes in red , and after them , Peter the Sacristan . He trips over them in his amazement and terror ; and they are gone after the vanishing children before the church-people come out . The old folks lean from their windows. p. 29 OLD URSULA The bell , the bell ! the church bell ! They 're bewitched ! Peter rushes to the bell-rope and pulls it . The bell sounds heavily . Renter , from the church , the citizens by twos and threes and scores . OLD URSULA I told ye all ,  --  I told ye !  --  Devils ' bargains ! The bell . Kurt , Jacobus , and the others appear .

OLD CLAUS  --  I saw it with these eyes ! He piped away the children . Horror in the crowd . They bring out lanterns and candles . Veronika holds up the forgotten crutch. p. 30 VERONIKA Jan  --  my Jan ! KURT to her Thy boy ! But mine , my three , all fair and straight .  --  WIFE OF AXEL furiously to him ' T was thy false bargain , thine ; who would not pay The Piper .  --  But we pay ! PETER THE SACRISTAN Bewitched , bewitched ! The boys ran out  --  and I ran after them , And something red did trip me  --  ' t was the Devil , The Devil ! OLD URSULA Ah , ring on , and crack the bell : Ye 'll never have them back .  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Curtain @x Scene I : Inside the Hollow Hill. A great , dim-lighted , cavernous place , which shows signs of masonry . It is part cavern and part cellerage of a ruined , burned-down and forgotten old monastery in the hills .  --  The only entrance ( at the centre rear ) , a ramshackle wooden door , closes against a flight of rocky steps .  --  Light comes from an opening in the roof , and from the right , where a faggot-fire glows under an iron pot .  --  The scene reaches ( right and left ) into dim corners , where sleeping children lie curled up together like kittens . By the fire sits the Piper , on a tree-stump seat , stitching at a bit of red leather . At his feet is a row of bright-colored small shoes , set two and two . He looks up now and then , to recount the children , and goes back to work , with quizzical despair . Left , sits a group of three forlorn Strollers . One nurses a lame knee ; one , evidently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is munching bread and cheese out of a wallet . All have the look of hunted and hungry men . They speak only in whispers to each other throughout the scene ; but their hoarse laughter breaks out now and then over the bird-like ignorance of the children .

The place is wild and overgrown , like the haunted spot it is reputed to be . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in a mass of weeds and vines . Opposite , left , tall trees and dense thickets . Where the roads cross ( to left of centre ) , stands a large , neglected shrine , with a weather-worn figure of Christ ,  --  again the Lonely Man ,  --  facing toward Hamelin .  --  The stage is empty , at rise of the curtain ; but the sound of chanting from burghers just gone by fades slowly , on the road to Rudersheim . From the hillside at the rear comes the Piper , wrapped in a long green cloak , his pipe in his hand . He looks after the procession , and back to Hamelin .  --  Enter , springing from the bushes to the right , Michael , who seizes him . Their speech goes breathlessly .

The music whirls them irresistibly into a rhythmic pace of time , and jogs their words , when they try to speak , into the same dance-measure . One by one ,  --  two and two they go ,  --  round and round like corks at first , with every sign of struggle and protest , then off , on the long road to Rudersheim .

Pease in your shoes , an if you must !  --  But out and away , before you 're dust : Scribe and Stay-at-home , Saint and Sage , Out of your cage , Out of your cage !  --  He feigns to be terror-struck at sight of the pipe in Michael 's hands . Ho , help ! Good Michael , Michael , loose the charm ! Michael , have mercy ! I 'm bewitched !  --  MICHAEL-THE-SWORD-EATER giving him the pipe Cock 's faith !

We have saved her , look you ; We save them all ! No prison walls again , For anything so young , in Hamelin there . Wake her , and see . MICHAEL-THE-SWORD-EATER Ay , wake her . But for me , Her sleep is gentler . PIPER comfortingly Nay , but wait .  --  Good faith , Wait . We have broke the bars of iron now ; Still there are golden !  --  ' T is her very self Is caged within herself . Once coax her out , Once set her own heart free !  --  MICHAEL-THE-SWORD-EATER Wake her , and see ! The Piper crosses , humming . PIPER Mind your eyes , tune your tongue ! Let it never be said , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of your cage ! Maiden , maiden ,  --  He wakes her gently .

PIPER ruefully No , no  --  I  --  No ! BARBARA You  --  you are robbers ? Her hands go to the pearls about her neck . PIPER indignant No ! Blood on the Moon ! This is the maddest world I ever blinked at .  --  Fear nothing , maiden . I will tell you all . Come , sit you down ; and Michael shall keep watch From yonder hillock , lest that any pass . Fear nothing . None will pass : they are too sure The Devil hath this cross-ways !  --  Sit you down . Michael watches , with jealous wistfulness , from the road ( left rear ) .  --  Barbara half fearfully sits up , on the bank by the well . BARBARA Not love ? And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Then why  --  PIPER For why should all be love or money ? Money ! Oho ,  --  that mouldy thousand guilders You think of !  --  But it was your Hamelin friends That loved the guilders , and not I. p. 64 BARBARA Then why  --  Why did you steal me hence ? PIPER Why did yourself Long to be stolen ? BARBARA shuddering Ah ! to be shut up . . . Forever ,  --  young  --  alive ! PIPER Alive and singing ; Young ,  --  young ;  --  and four thick walls and no more sun , No music , and no wandering , and no life ! Think you , I would not steal all things alive Out of such doom ?  --  How can I breathe and laugh While there are things in cages ?  --  You are free ; And you shall never more go back again .

He watches her But there 's a man ,  --  Sky-true , sword-strong , and brave to look upon ; One that would thrust his hand in dragon 's mouth For your bright sake ; one that would face the Devil , Would swallow fire  --  p. 65 BARBARA You would ? PIPER desperately I ?  --  No , not I ! Michael ,  --  yon goodman Michael . BARBARA bitterly A stroller !  --  oh , nought but a wandering man . PIPER Well , would you have a man take root , I ask ?

BARBARA So you bewitched me , then . PIPER wildly How do I know ? BARBARA Where are the children ? p. 66 PIPER I 'll not tell you that . You are too much of Hamelin . BARBARA You bewitched them ! PIPER Yes , so it seems . But how ?  --  Upon my life , ' T is more than I know ,  --  yes , a little more . Rapidly : half in earnest and half in whimsy Sometimes it works , and sometimes no . There are Some things upon my soul , I can not do . Watching her . BARBARA expectantly Not even with thy pipe ?

PIPER touching his heart Here . BARBARA Where are they ? PIPER How do I know ? If I knew all , why should I care to live ? No , no ! The game is What-Will-Happen-Next ? p. 67 BARBARA And what will happen ? PIPER tantalizingly Ah ! how do I know ? It keeps me searching .

There is one very charm  --  BARBARA Oh ! PIPER Are you brave ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ philter ? BARBARA ' T is . . . some enchantment ? p. 68 PIPER mysteriously ' T is a love philter . BARBARA Oh , tell me first  --  PIPER Why , sooth , the only charm In it , is Love . It is clear well-water . BARBARA disappointed Only well-water ? PIPER Love is only Love . It must be philters , then ? He comes down smiling and beckons to Michael , who draws near , bewildered . This lady thirsts For magic ! He ties a long green scarf that he has over his shoulder , to a water-jar , and lowers it down the old well ; while Barbara watches , awe-struck . He continues to sing softly . Mind your eyes , Tune your tongue ; Let it never be said , But sung ,  --  sung !  --  MICHAEL-THE-SWORD-EATER to Barbara , timidly I am glad at least , fair lady , To think how my poor show did give you pleasure That day  --  that day when  --  BARBARA Ah ! that day of doom ! p. 69 MICHAEL-THE-SWORD-EATER What is your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care not ! Apart Oh , it is true .  --  And he a sword-eater ! The Piper hauls up the jar , full of water . PIPER Michael , your cup . Michael gives him a drinking-horn from his belt . The Piper fills it with water , solemnly , and turns to Barbara , who is at first defiant , then fascinated . Maiden , your ears . So :  --  hearken . Before you drink of this , is it your will Forever to be gone from Hamelin ? BARBARA I must ,  --  I must . PIPER Your mother ? BARBARA piteously I have no mother ; Nor any father , more . He gave me up . PIPER That did he !  --  For a round one thousand guilders ! Weep not , I say ! First , loose you , heart and shoes , From Hamelin . Put off now , the dust , the mould , The cobble-stones , the little prying windows ; The streets that dream o ' What the Neighbors Say . Think you were never born there . Think some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deep in a Garden ( but you knew not whose ) , Where voices of wild waters bubbling ran , Shaking down music from glad mountain-tops ,  --  Where the still peaks were burning in the dawn , Like fiery snow ,  --  down to the listening valleys , That do off their blue mist only to show Some deeper blue , some haunt of violets . No voice you heard , nothing you felt or saw , Save in your heart , the tumult of young birds , A nestful of wet wings and morning-cries , Throbbing for flight ! . . . Then ,  --  for your Soul , new wakened , felt athirst , You turned to where that call of water led , Laughing for truth ,  --  all truth and star-like laughter ! Beautiful water , that will never stay , But runs and laughs and sparkles in the heart , And sends live laughter trickling everywhere , And knows the thousand longings of the Earth ! And as you drank it then , so now , drink here ; He reaches her the horn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her eyes fixed and wide , as if she were sleep-walking . She drinks . Michael stands near , also motionless . When she speaks , it is in a younger voice , shy , sweet , and full of wonder . And tell me ,  --  tell me , you ,  --  what happened then ? What do you see ? p. 70 BARBARA Ah !  --  She looks before her with wide , new eyes . PIPER Do you see  --  a  --  BARBARA . . . Michael ! PIPER So !  --  And a good one . And you call him ?  --  BARBARA . . . Michael . PIPER So .  --  ' T is a world of wonders , by my faith !  --  What is the fairest thing you see but  --  BARBARA Michael . PIPER And is he comely as a man should be ? And strong ?  --  And wears good promise in his eyes , And keeps it with his heart and with his hands ? She nods like a child And would you fear to go with him ?  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that little hand of yours . Michael , wonder-struck , runs to the jar , pours water upon his hand , rubs it off with haste , and falls on his knees before her , taking her hand fearfully . BARBARA timidly And can he talk ?  --  p. 71 PIPER Yes , yes .  --  The maid 's bewildered . Fear nothing . Thou'rt so dumb , man !  --  Yes , yes , yes . Only he kneels ; he can not yet believe . Speak roundly to him .  --  Will you go with him ? He will be gentler to you than a father : He would be brothers five , and dearest friend , And sweetheart ,  --  ay , and knight and serving-man ! BARBARA Yes , yes , I know he will . And can he talk , too ? PIPER Lady , you have bewitched him . MICHAEL-THE-SWORD-EATER Oh ! dear Lady , With you  --  with you , I dare not ope my mouth Saving to sing , or pray ! PIPER Let it be singing ! Lad , ' t is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and she is more a child Than yesterday . MICHAEL-THE-SWORD-EATER Oh , lordly , wondrous world !  --  How is it , Sweet , you smile upon me now ? BARBARA Sure I have ever smiled on thee . How not ? Art thou not Michael ?  --  And thou lovest me . And I love thee !  --  If I unloved thee ever , It was some spell .  --  Rapturously But this ,  --  ah , This is I ! Michael , on his knees , winds his arms about her. p. 72 PIPER softly It is all true ,  --  all true . Lad , do not doubt ; The golden cage is broken . MICHAEL-THE-SWORD-EATER Oh ! more strange Than morning dreams ! I am like one new-born ; I am a speechless babe .  --  And this is she , My Moon I cried for ,  --  here ,  --  PIPER It is thy bride . MICHAEL-THE-SWORD-EATER Thou wilt not fear to come with me ? BARBARA With thee ? With thee ! Ah , look ! What have I more than thee ? And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now Right happily that I am pranked so fair ! She touches her fineries , her long pearl-strings , joyously And all this came so near to burying ; This ! MICHAEL-THE-SWORD-EATER And this dearer gold . Kissing her hair . BARBARA All , all for thee !  --  She leans over in a playful rapture and binds her hair about him Look ,  --  I will be thy garden that we lost , Yea , everywhere ,  --  in every wilderness . There shall none fright us with a flaming sword ! But I will be thy garden ! There is the sound of a herd-bell approaching. p. 73 PIPER See ,  --  how the sunlight soon shall pour red wine To make your marriage-feast !  --  And do you hear That faery bell ?  --  No fear !  --  ' T is some white creature , Seeking her whiter lamb .  --  Go ; find our hermit ; And he shall bless you ,  --  as a hermit can ! And be your pledge for shelter . There 's the path .  --  To Michael Follow each other , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon ,  --  and all is well ! He gives Michael his cloak to wrap round Barbara . They go , hand in hand , up into the hills . The herd-bell sounds softly .  --  The Piper cocks his head like a squirrel , and listens with delight . He watches the two till they disappear ; then comes down joyously . PIPER If you can only catch them while they 're young ! The herd-bell sounds nearer . He lets down a water-jar into the well again . The nearness of the bell startles him . He becomes watchful as a wild creature . It sounds nearer and nearer . A woman 's voice calls like the wind : Jan ! Jan !  --  The Piper , tense and cautious , moves softly down into the shrubbery by the well. p. 74 VERONIKA 'S VOICE Jan ! PIPER Hist ! Who dared ? VERONIKA 'S VOICE . . . Jan ! . PIPER Who dared , I say ? A woman .  --  ' T is a woman ! Enter Veronika , on the road from Hamelin . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , clutching in her hand a herd-bell . She looks about her , holds up the bell and shakes it once softly , covering it with her fingers again ; then she sits wearily down at the foot of the ruined shrine , and covers her face , with a sharp breath . VERONIKA . . . Ah ,  --  ah ,  --  ah ! The Piper watches with breathless wonder and fascination . It seems to horrify him . PIPER under breath That woman ! Veronika lifts her head suddenly and sees the motion of the bushes . VERONIKA He is coming !  --  He is here ! She darts towards the well .  --  The Piper springs up . Oh , God of Mercy ! . . . It is only you ! Where is he ?  --  Where ?  --  Where are you hiding him ? p. 75 PIPER confusedly Woman . . . what do you , wandering , with that bell ? That herd-bell ?

To her Sit you down here . You can not go away While you are yet so pale . Why are you thus ? She looks at him distractedly . VERONIKA You , who have torn the hearts out of our bodies And left the city like a place of graves ,  --  Why am I spent ?  --  Ah , ah !  --  But he 's alive ! PIPER fiercely Alive ? What else ?  --  Why would he not be living ? p. 76 VERONIKA I do not know . PIPER Do you take me for the Devil ? VERONIKA I do not know . PIPER Yet you were not afraid ?

PIPER like a wounded animal Let be . You hurt me  --  VERONIKA You !  --  A man of air ? PIPER I am no man of air . VERONIKA  --  What are you then ? Give them to me , I say . You have them hid , Under a spell . PIPER struggling with pity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . VERONIKA But they all . . . are living ? On thy soul ? PIPER  --  Wilt thou believe me ?

PIPER No , never VERONIKA Half to herself , distraught between suspense and hope . I must be patient . PIPER Woman , they all are mine . I hold them in my hands ; they bide with me . What 's breath and blood ,  --  what are the hearts of children , To Hamelin ,  --  while it heaps its money-bags ? VERONIKA You cared not for the money . PIPER No ?  --  You seem A foreign woman ,  --  come from very far , That you should know . VERONIKA I know . I was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet a few Who would have dealt with you more honestly Than this Jacobus , or  --  PIPER Or Kurt the Syndic ! Believe it not . Those two be tongue and brain For the whole town ! I know them . And that town Stands as the will of other towns , a score , That make us wandering poor the things we are ! It stands for all , unto the end of time , That turns this bright world black and the Sun cold , With hate , and hoarding ;  --  all-triumphant Greed That spreads above the roots of all despair , And misery , and rotting of the soul ! Now shall they learn  --  if money-bags can learn  --  What turns the bright world black , and the Sun cold ; And what 's that creature that they call a child !  --  And what this wingd thing men name a heart , Never to bind , never to bid be still ; And what this hunger and this thirst to sing , To laugh , to fight ,  --  to hope , to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make the stars ?

I ,  --  I !  --  At last . p. 79 VERONIKA Ah , me ! How can I say : Yet make them happier than they let you be ? PIPER Woman , you could !  --  They know not how to be Happy ! They turn to darkness and to grief All that is made for joy . They deal with men As , far across the mountains , in the south , Men trap a singing thrush , put out his eyes ,  --  And cage him up and bid him then to sing  --  Sing before God that made him ,  --  yes , to sing ! I save the children . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them forever , who shall save the world !  --  Yes , even Hamelin .  --  But for only you , What do they know of Children ?  --  Pfui , their own ! Who knows a treasure , when it is his own ? Do they not whine : Five mouths around the table ; And a poor harvest . And now comes one more ! God chastens us !  --  Pfui !  --  VERONIKA apart , dully . . . But I must be patient . PIPER You know , you know , that not one dared , save you ,  --  Dared all alone , to search this devil 's haunt . p. 80 VERONIKA They would have died  --  PIPER But never risked their souls ! That knew I also . VERONIKA Ah ! PIPER Young faces , sooth , The old ones prate of !  --  Bah , what is't they want ? Some one to work for me , when I am old ; Some one to follow me unto my grave ; Some one  --  for me ! Yes , yes . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold corner , if it might bring back All of the Children in one shower of light ! VERONIKA The old , ah , yes ! But not  --  PIPER The younger men ? Aha ! Their pride to keep the name alive ; The name , the name , the little Hamelin name , Tied to the trade ;  --  carved plain upon his gravestone ! Wonderful ! If your name must chain you , live , To your gaol of a house , your trade you hate  --  why then , Best go without a name , like me !  --  How now ? Woman ,  --  you suffer ? VERONIKA Ah , yet could I laugh , Piper , yet could I laugh , for one true word ,  --  But not of all men . p. 81 PIPER Then of whom ? VERONIKA Of Kurt . PIPER Bah , Kurt the Councillor ! a man to curse . VERONIKA He is my husband . PIPER shortly Thine ? I knew it not . Thine ? But it can not be . He could not father That little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then you love him ? You will give him back ? PIPER The son of Kurt ? VERONIKA No , not his son ! No , no . He is all mine , all mine . Kurt 's sons are straight , And ruddy , like Kurt 's wife of Hamelin there , Who died before . PIPER And you were wed . . . VERONIKA So young , It is all like some dream before the sunrise , That left me but that little shipwrecked Star . PIPER Why did you marry Kurt the Councillor ? VERONIKA humbly He wanted me . Once I was beautiful . p. 82 PIPER wonderingly What , more than now ? VERONIKA Mock if you will . PIPER I mock you ! O Woman , . . . you are very beautiful . VERONIKA I meant , with my poor self , to buy him house And warmth , and softness for his little feet . Oh , then I knew not ,  --  when we sell our hearts , We buy us nothing . PIPER Now you know . VERONIKA I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart Alone and beautiful , and clear and still ; And to keep all the gladness in my heart , That bubbled from nowhere !  --  for him to drink ;  --  And to be houseless of all other things , Even as the Lonely Man . The Piper starts Where is the child ? PIPER No ; that I will not tell . Only thus much : I love thy child . Trust me ,  --  I love them , all . They are the brightest miracle I know . Wherever I go , I search the eyes of men To find such clearness ;  --  and it is not there . Lies , greed and cruelty , and dreadful dark ! And all that makes Him sad these thousand years , And keeps His forehead bleeding .  --  Ah , you know ! p. 83 VERONIKA Whom do you think on ? PIPER Why , the Lonely Man .  --  But now I have the children safe with me ; And men shall never teach them what men know ;  --  Those radiant things that have no wish at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , The Running Water , and the Moon , the Moon ! The only things worth having ! VERONIKA  --  Oh , you will not Give him to me ? PIPER How give you yours again , And not the others ? What a life for him ! She hides her face And Kurt the Syndic , left without his sons ? Bah , do not dream of it ! What would Kurt do ?  --  And hearken here ! Should any hunt me down , Take care . Who then could bring the children back ? VERONIKA Jan ! Jan ! PIPER He loves me . He is happy . VERONIKA passionately No ! Without me ?  --  No . PIPER He has not even once Called you . VERONIKA staggering Ah , ah ! . . . The spell .  --  p. 84 PIPER startled Nay , now ;  --  rise up now , foreign woman . Would you not have him cheered ? VERONIKA  --  O far-off God !

VERONIKA passionately My longing will bring back my Own . PIPER Ah , long not so . VERONIKA Yes , it will bring him back ! He breathes . And I will wish him home to me , Till my heart break ! PIPER Hearts never break in Hamelin . Go , then ; and teach those other ones to long ; Wake up those dead ! p. 85 VERONIKA Peace . I shall draw him home . PIPER Not till he cries for thee . VERONIKA Oh , that will be Soon ,  --  soon . PIPER gently Remember ,  --  if one word of thine Set on the hounds to track me down and slay me , They would be lost forever ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my keeping . VERONIKA Yea , I hear . But he will come . . . oh , he will come to me , Soon ,  --  soon . She goes , haltingly , and disappears along the road to Hamelin .  --  The Piper , alone , stands spell-bound , breathing hard , and looking after her . Then he turns his head and comes down , doggedly . Again he pauses . With a sudden sharp effort he turns , and crosses with passionate appeal to the shrine , his arm uplifted towards the carven Christ as if he warded off some accusation . His speech comes in a torrent . PIPER I will not , no , I will not , Lonely Man ! I have them in my hand . I have them all  --  All  --  all ! And I have lived unto this day . You understand . . . He waits as if for some reply You know what men they are . And what have they to do with such as these ? Think of those old as death , in body and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of moth and rust !  --  While these miraculous ones , Like golden creatures made of sunset-cloud , Go out forever ,  --  every day , fade by With music and wild stars !  --  Ah , but You know .

Oh , listen , Lonely Man !  --  Oh , let me keep them ! I will bring them to You , Still nights , and breathless mornings ; they shall touch Your hands and feet with all their swarming hands , Like showering petals warm on furrowed ground ,  --  All sweetness ! They will make Thee whole again , With love . Thou wilt look up and smile on us ! Why not ? I know  --  the half  --  You will be saying . You will be thinking of Your Mother .  --  Ah , But she was different . She was not as they . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Kurt ! Of Kurt ! No , no ; ask me not this , not this ! Here is some dawn of day for Hamelin ,  --  now ! ' T is hearts of men You want .  --  Not greed and carven tombs , not misers ' candles ; No offerings , more , from men that feed on men ; Eternal psalms and endless cruelties ! . . . Even from now , there may be hearts in Hamelin , Once stabbed awake ! He pleads , defends , excuses passionately ; before his will gives way , as the arrow flies from the bow-string.  --  I will not give them back ! And Jan ,  --  for Jan , that little one , that dearest To Thee and me , hark ,  --  he is wonderful . Ask it not of me . Thou dost know I can not ! Look , Lonely Man !

No , no , I will not . . . . . . . . . . . Have Thy way .  --  I will ! Curtain @x Scene : Hamelin market-place . It is early morning ; so dark that only a bleak twilight glimmers in the square ; the little streets are dim . Everywhere gloom and stillness . In the house of Kurt , beside the Minster , there is one window-light behind a curtain in the second story . At the casements , down right and left , sit Old Claus and Old Ursula , wan and motionless as the dead . The church-bell , which likewise seems to have aged , croaks softly , twice . Peter the Sacristan stands by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll never come . I told ye so . They all are gone . There will be nothing young To follow us to the grave . OLD CLAUS No , no ,  --  not one ! The Minster-door opens , and out come certain of the townsfolk from early mass . They look unnaturally old and colorless . Their steps lag drearily.  --  Hans the Butcher and his wife ; Axel the Smith with his wife , and Peter the Cobbler , meet , on their way to the little street , left , and greet one another with painstaking , stricken kindness . They speak in broken voices . HANS THE BUTCHER Well , well  --  p. 88 AXEL THE SMITH God knows ! The bell sounds HANS THE BUTCHER Neighbor , how fare your knees ? Axel smooths his right leg and gives a jerk of pain . They all move stiffly . AXEL THE SMITH I 'm a changed man . HANS THE BUTCHER Peter the Sacristan , Give by the bell !

AXEL THE SMITH It does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PETER THE COBBLER Rather , I do believe it mads the demons ; And I have given much thought  --  AXEL THE SMITH Over thy shoes !

Now were we not proceeding soberly , Singing a godly hymn , and all in tune , But yesterday , when we passed by  --  WIFE OF HANS Do n't say it ! Do n't name the curseful place . p. 89 HANS THE BUTCHER  --  And my poor head , It goes round yet ;  --  around , around , around , As I were new ashore from the high seas ; Still dancing  --  dancing  --  AXEL THE SMITH Neighbor , say no more .
