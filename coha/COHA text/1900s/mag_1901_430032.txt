 | THE political victory of the Liberal party in Denmark that ended the bitter fight of more than thirty years between the old Denmark ? that rooted in landlordism ? and " the new Denmark " ? that loving nature ? is the crowning historical event of an evolution of a hundred years which has modernized the Danish people in a higher degree than most of the other peoples . THE AGRARIAN REVOLUTION OF 1788 . In 1788 , the state of Denmark was very much like that of Ireland to-day . Great landlords owned the whole country , and the peasants were considered silly , lazy , and so forth . In 1788 , a series of great land reforms began , with the result that Denmark almost realized the three acres and a cow " ideal ; and , indeed , the great landlords now own only 8 per cent . of the country , while all the farmers are freehold proprietors of farms from fifty to one hundred acres in extent , and three-fourths of the workingmen in the villages are likewise freehold owners of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reforms soon brought great prosperity to the peasantry , and with the prosperity came interest in public affairs and a demand for political influence and power . In 1831 , Denmark obtained a degree of representative government ? political bodies in each province ? but only with consultative power . But the political activity of the peasantry had already begun , and we find " Bonder " peasants among the active agitators and great national orators . Ten years later , the powerful ' ' League of the Peasants ' Friends " was formed , and the question of the rights of the peasantry naturally dominated all others . THE POLITICAL REVOLUTION OF 1848 . In 1848 , the people of Copenhagen went en masse in a great procession , headed by the Council of Copenhagen , to the King 's palace , and claimed a constitution under threat of taking to the self-help of despair . " The King gave way , and a Liberal ministry entered office . While the small nation , of only 1,400,000 , sent 60,000 men and a large fleet to the three years ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victories of Fredericia and Ested , in which latter 40,000 Danes won a two days ' fight with a loss of nearly 4,000 killed and wounded , the constitutional parliament was giving the country a new constitution , with full power for the people and universal suffrage . The constitution dates from June 5 , 1849 . In the new parliament the left wing was formed by the ' ' Bondevenner " ( Friends of the Peasants ) , most of them farmers or agricultural laborers , the party numbering about one-third of the lower house , the other two-thirds being the ' ' National Liberale , " or men of constitutional views , but of a more academic and bureaucratic character . The war of 1864 brought about the failure of the foreign policy of the ' ' National Liberale " party , which , presaging the coming to power of the democratic peasantry , patched up a hurried alliance with the great landlords and other relics of the anciea regime . THE TRIUMPH OF REACTION-1866 . In August , 1864 , before the conclusion of peace , they began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , after a two years ' struggle , ended in the law of 1866 , which altered the character of the upper house so much that  | the conservative elements of the nation now have vast influence . At the eleventh hour , the Conservatives struck this treacherous blow at the people whose sons they by a foolish policy had led to war against desperate odds with Germany and Austria at once . As soon as the war was over , the people 's energy , stung by the disasters of the war , rose as never before . The motto of the hour was , " What has been lost without must be won within . " A succession of popular progressive movements was begun ? for instance , that for the cultivation of the heaths in Jutland , where in the last thirty-five years an area of land equal to onetenth of the whole of Denmark has been won for agriculture or planted with trees . The peasants rose in a body against those responsible for the policy of 1864 , and in 1872 the left wing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the lower house . A free constitution already existed on paper , but freedom in practice means power for the people in all public matters , and of that freedom there was but little in Denmark . There were but few Democratic papers then in Denmark , and none in Copenhagen , which , like almost all the towns , was either simply Conservative or politically asleep . In nearly all municipal and other bodies the Conservative element preponderated . Conservatives owned all banks and insurance companies ; all trade was in their hands , ? in fact , all power belonged to them , except that the Democrats had a majority of two votes in the lower house . A THIRTY YEARS ' WAR . The Conservatives actually violated their own principles so far as to refuse to hand over the government to the majority , and a bitter political struggle began between the old and the new Denmark . This struggle lasted nearly thirty years . Its causes were fourfold . The Democratic party had to rouse the entire peasantry in order to win the cities and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete their right of self-government by enforcing its principles in all departments of social life . Open rebellion , which might have brought about an armed insurrection from the south , was precluded by the nearness of Germany . Also , the less stalwart members of the Democratic party could not be depended upon at first , and faced about at the critical moment . That the Democratic party has been able to hold fast to the same policy and force it through by dint of thirty years ' bitter struggle and many reverses is due to the peculiar character of the Danish people ? to their stubbornness and persistence , that know no giving in . The Danish press has , in proportion to the number of inhabitants , almost twice as large a circulation as that of any other country . Fourfifths of the newspapers are Democratic and entirely under the influence of the Liberal element in the community . Of the sixteen seats in the capital , the Conservatives only hold one , with a majority of twenty-three votes ; and nearly all the cities are won for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How the peasantry vote is shown by the fact that many constituencies have brought 98 per cent . of the electors in an area of from twenty to thirty miles around to the polling-place . HOW THE BATTLE WAS FOUGHT OUT . The Conservatives have been shut out from every municipal body or important committee all over the country when the Democrats could bring a majority to the poll . The latter have organized hundreds of banks , which collect their own money . When , during an economic crisis , the Conservative papers proposed to ruin the peasantry by calling up the capital lent on mortgage on farms , these banks were able to give  | their clients a guarantee for new mortgages ; and the Conservatives were completely foiled . Farmers and workingmen have formed large cooperative and trade-union associations , which have made the Danes more independent of capital than any other nation . They are now a selfgoverning people in every sense of the word . The main features of the struggle are as follows : The Conservatives , who had lost their majority of two at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by raising the standard of militarism and proposing heavy expenditure on fortifications . The Democrats won a great victory in 1876 against these laws , reducing the Conservatives to some thirty-five , members out of 102 in the lower house . THE COUP D'ETAT OF 1885 . In 1877 , the Conservative ministry ( Estrup ministry ) , which came into power in 1875 , got into difficulties over the budget , and at the critical moment some " pseudo-Democrats , " under the lead of Mr. Bojesen , gave way , and made a compromise with the government . The Radicals , reduced to about thirty-five , were up in arms against the Moderates . At the elections of 1879 and the two elections of 1881 they reduced the recreant minority to submission , and formed a new Radical majority , which in 1884 rose to 83 . Mr. Estrup , a remarkably strong man , but unprincipled , now took the most extravagant measures . In the spring of 1885 he exceeded the budget ( " bursted the budget , " he said ) , and called for provisional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The government maintained that when the two houses did not agree about the budget , and in consequence no budget was voted , the constitution gave the government a right to give provisional budgets , or , as they are called in Denmark , ' ' provisional financial laws . " Several university professors of law supported this theory , which , however , found one strong opponent . PREPARING FOR CIVIL WAR . The people considered this a coup d'etat , and the crisis became acute . The government meanwhile took strong military measures . A supply of Maxims and other guns , to last for six months or more , was got in . These were manned by officers only , as they dared not trust the conscript soldiers , and were ready for use at any moment , while hundreds of young Conservatives enrolled and armed in order to fight the Democrats . The Democrats , however , were careful to avoid giving any pretext for the use of the guns . But the agitation was very serious . Many peasants refused to pay taxes ; they cheered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the towns , and furirtus demonstrations against the government took place , and even against the King when he appeared in the country districts . The present King has always been unpopular among the Democrats . Of this , most striking proofs could be given from speeches in Parliament , the complete indifference of the people , as a whole , to any royal festivities , and from the speeches of peasants who formed deputations to the King which were frequently the occasion for much plain speaking . The government , on their side , tried to arouse their adherents by a strong agitation for more fortifications . The army officers actually held as many as 1,100 public meetings about the country ; and a League of National Defense was formed , which raised by private subscriptions enough money to build two forts outside Copenhagen . THE REIGN OF THE MODERATES . After five years , when the government was almost tired out , a split came in the Democratic party . It was again Mr. Bojesen who formed a new " Moderate party " of forty Democrats . He would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government , but only try to carry out some  | reforms . But the Radicals knew better , and again appealed to the people to force a new majority . Mr. Bojesen , however , managed fairly well at the elections of 1892 , and in 1894 he made a sort of compromise with the Conservatives , in consequence of which Mr. Estrup resigned and a more moderate Conservative government came into power . But the people , who would have none of a compromise with a government that had , as they thought , broken the constitution , mistrusted Mr. Bojesen , and the entry to power of the Radicals was assured . At the election of 1895 , the allied Moderates and Conservatives were thoroughly defeated , and the Radicals rose to 73 votes out of 114 in the lower house . In 1897 , the new government resigned , and a " business government " was formed of Conservatives . But the 1898 election was still more crushing for the Conservatives , and in the spring of 1900 they resigned . The Conservatives made a last effort with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ derision on all sides and has been nothing but a farce . THE VICTORY OF LAST APRIL . The crown prince made two public speeches in its favor , but without avail , and at the elections of April , 1901 , out of 114 members in the lower house only 5 were won by the Conservatives , with small majorities , and even the strong Conservative majority in the upper house was reduced to one vote through the rebellion of the Conservatives . The Danes are now a thoroughly radical and democratic people , with a more perfect system of self-government in politics and . business than perhaps any other nation . The population has increased so much that it is now as large as the whole population of the kingdom and duchies before 1864 . After England , it is also the richest country in the world per head of the population , and the excellence of its educational system is matter of common knowledge . Denmark , therefore , enters the new century steaming full speed ahead , and with the best hopes for the future . THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as complete over the Moderates as over the government . Before the poll the Moderates were twenty-two strong , but Mr. Bojesen , the evil genius of the democracy , withdrew his candidature and retired into private life , while several of his supposed adherents declared during the campaign that , if reelected , they would join the Radicals . Mr. Bojesen 's constituency , which he had represented since 1869 , was taken by the Radicals , and the Moderates , now reduced to twelve or thirteen ? of whom about half will join the Radicals if allowed ? have lost all their former importance . The premier and minister of justice is M. Deuntzer , professor of law at the university , an old Radical who in 1885 publicly opposed the government . The minister of agriculture is Mons. Ole Hansen . He is a common farmer from a village in Seeland , owner of a farm of about one hundred acres ; M. P. since 1890 . In 1885 , he was a member of several municipal councils which refused to publish the government laws or follow its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without any result . He also refused to pay taxes after the ' ' provisional laws . " The law officer of the crown is Mons. Alberti , who is a leader of many cooperative undertakings of the peasantry ; M.P . since 1892 . Mr. Christensen is the most important member of the new cabinet . He was born in West Jutland , in 1856 , the son of a farmer , and earned his living when a boy as a shepherd . He passed the examination for village schoolmaster in Jutland , and taught till recently in the little village of Stadil , in West Jutland . In 1890 he  | was returned for Parliament , and in 1895 became leader of the opposition . Of late years , the Conservative government being so utterly weak , he practically ruled the country in his capacity of president of the finance committee of the Folkething . A. few months ago he resigned his post as schoolmaster , succeeded in being elected a " revisor of the state , " and is now minister of religion and education . After Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Democrats . Born in 1841 , the son of a schoolmaster in an Iceland village , he became a law student , taking his degree in 1867 at the university . In his youth , he wrote a great deal of poetry , but never had any of it printed . From poetry he turned to journalism , and worked on the staff of a new Democratic paper in Copenhagen , the Morgen Bladet . He is one of the most brilliant and best known of Danish journalists ? the most brilliant , according to George Brandes . In 1876 , he was returned for Parliament , and it was he and two others who , between 1877 and 1891 , broke down the Moderates and brought the Radical majority to power . In 1884 , he founded the Politiken , now the most important paper in Scandinavia . He is now minister of public works and communications . Mr. Sorensen was born in 1850 , the son of a small ship 's captain . He passed his examination as a village schoolmaster , and when Berg , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Democracy in 1370 , began his agitation and founded papers in many towns , Sorensen became editor of the principal paper in his own district . He was first returned for Parliament in 1887 . He is now president of the Liberal Press Union of Denmark . In the new ministry all sides of the former opposition are so equally and evenly represented that the ministry can hardly fail to be very strong . The appointments are highly popular all over the country . All the ministers , except Mr. Hage , are sons of the people in every sense . For the first time since 1866 , there is a Danish ministry in which not a single large landowner has a portfolio . It is also the first in which a simple farmer has a portfolio . The personnel of the cabinet , indeed , affords the most striking demonstration of the way in which the Danish masses have defeated the Danish classes . Several members of the new cabinet , especially Mr. Christensen , hold prominent positions in the Danish peace societies .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
