" The Republican party has gone to tire devil , " an Ohio office-holder in Washington is represented to have exclaimed , on hearing of Secretary Taft 's speech in Akson , Ohio , on Saturday night . The Secretary has , indeed , given cause for dismay among maChine Republicans everywhere by coming out openly against Boss Cox , the Murphy of Cincinnati , and declaring that , if he were able to , he would vote against Cox 's municipal ticket . This is pure and unadulterated treason and rank disloyalty , and Will , in the eyes of the paa-ty-henciamen , very nearly insure the defeat of Gov . Herrick , if only because it will induce Cox to sell out the State ticket to elect the city slate . " I wish to coins as near telling What I believe to be the truth as I can on this subject , " said Secretary Taft in his straightforward and honest way before proceeding to defend Gov . Herrick against the charge that he has been subservient to the boss . Mr. Taft did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his assistants " has undoubtedly inured to their pecuniary benefit , and it is seen in the large fortunes which they now have " A more direct charge of " honest " or of dishonest graft could hardly have been made , and it leaves Cox flat on his back " outside the breastworks " to-day . With the national Administration squarely against him , he has on his hands the fight of his political lifetime . Secretary ' Daft was , of course , careful to say that - neither Gov . Herrick nor President Roosevelt was to be condemned because he received the support of the Cox machine . But Secretary Hay last fall condemned Judge Parker because he had the support of Tammany Hall . Waiving this little inconsistency and Secretary Taft 's weak appeal for Gov . Herrick's.reelection on the ground that his defeat would strengthen the hands of Bryan and " Tom " Johnson in national politics , the salient fact is that the Roosevelt Administration appears to be on the war-path against party bosses in Ohio , Pennsylvania , and Maryland . Mr. Roosevelt spoke a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he declared that he was doing all he could do to mitigate the harshness of the Chinese exclusion law , and insisted that every Chinese business or professional man , traveller or student , should have the same right to enter and be treated decently as the similar representatives of any other nation . Against theall , he stated that this new policy of treating Chinese as human beings was due them as a matter of right and justice , and . not because of the boycott . Unfortunately , Mr. Roosevelt thought it necessary to couple with this a threat that China " must beware of persisting in a course of conduct to which we can not honorably submit . " Would not China have to submit if we were to boycott her goods as well as her men ? On his Southern tour the President found a new phrase for his Dominican policy in his speech at Richmond October 18 . It seems that we are simply carrying out our duty of " policing the ends of the Panama Canal . " Now , as San Domingo is about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a : queer sort of " end . " And a radius swept round the circle of which San Domingo is on the circumference , would take in . Hayti , Cuba , Jamaica , and a part of the Bahama Islands , as well as Venezuela , Colombia , Costa Rica , Nicaragua , Honduras , and Mexico ? quite a collection of " ends . " But the whole argument is really at loose ends . As well might Commissioner McAdoo announce that he was going to police the ends of the Brooklyn Bridge by operating the traction companies in Chicago , running the subway in Boston , and taking possession of the custom house in Baltimore . Moreover , as the canal is not dug , and will not be within eight years , it looks as if Mr. Roosevelt were unduly anticipating his assignment to that beat . But let not the dwellers in or upon the Caribbean Sea think they will have a respite until the canal is completed . The President has his eye upon them ; and whenever he perceives that they do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " stable " as they ought to lie , he will interfere in order to set all right . For he takes pains to relieve any fears they may have , to assuage their sense of injured national pride , to dissipate any lurking notion they may have that they know better than he does what is good for them , by kindly assuring them that his meddling in their affairs will always be beneficial to them . We observe that the European press is giving more attention to these amiable remarks of our touring President than are the newspapers of his own land The latter , perhaps , are a little hardened to Mr Roosevelt 's public declarations of intention , and a little skeptical about their execution . They remember how olently he was reforming the tariff in his trip of 1902 , and- how conveniently he has forgotten all about it ever since . They recall his announcement in 1903 , which so alarmed Europe , that the Pacific Ocean was to become an American lake ; but the countless laughter of the waves is all that has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power to dismiss summarily employees - whom they personally know to be inefficient or guilty of misconduct , might easily be abused . The head of a department who was unprincipled , or who was a devotee of the old spoils system , might employ this ' short-cut to clear away men whose places he or his party bosses desired . Thus much is obvious at first glance . On the other hand , we know that the departments at Washington are stuffed with incompetents and malingerers , men who , having once got snug berths behind the wall of the civil-service rules , do just enough work to escape written charges , a formal hearing , and a discharge . They neglect their duties so skilfully that a superior officer finds it hard to put down their delinquencies in black and white . ' The new order will , we hope , serve notice on the loafers that they must either earn their salaries or get out This power of summary d.smissal is lodged in the hands of very few men , who in all other matters have large discretion ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by drawing , as usual , from the civil-service list . But the chief safeguard against abuse of this authority must , after all , lie in the press . The correspondents at Washington must watch sharply the practical operation of the rule , and warn the country if it is prostituted to partisan ends . Senator Isidor Rayner of Maryland has rendered a valuable service to his State by joining Gov . Warfield , Attorney-General Bryan , and other Democrats in attacking Senator Gorman , the party machine , and the iniquitous disfranchising amendment it Us fathered . He declares himself " utterly opposed " to the amendment , points out that its adoption " would bind the chains of political slavery around this State , would sound the death-knell of our political hopes and aspirations in Maryland , and would be as great a calamity as could possibly be inflicted upon our people . " His declaration of independence fills nearly a page in the newspapers , and has hit the Gorman ' ring so hard that it has found it necessary to retort at length . No summary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of Mr. Rayner : " It absolutely placs within the despotic power of one body of men , namely , the registration officials of this State , the right to disfranchise at their unlimited discretion any white man -- -make no mistake , now , not negro , but any white man ? who comes within the interdicted class , as a punishment for the crime of not be- Dag born upon Amerfican soil And then , worse than all , with a spirit of insatiate revenge , it visits the sins of the forefathers upon their future generations to the remotest degree . " Senator - Rayner points out that if his own father , an immigrant from Bavaria , had arrived here after 1869 ; he could be disfranchised under this amendment , and the Senator himself would be disfranchised unless he passed " a satisfactory constitutional examination conducted , perhaps , by some unconvicted-felon in a register 's box . " This- utterance stamps Senator Rayner as a man of ability , , courage , and independence . - The collapse of the Enterprise National Bank of Allegheny , Pa. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to the political scandals which have stirred Philadelphia to its depths , on the other to the life-insurance disclosures in New York city . No secret is made , since its cashier 's suicide , of the fact that State of Pennsylvania money was deposited with the bank at the peremptory demand of Senator Penrose , and that the money thus deposited was distributed , to the extent of probably $780,000 , in loans on worthless notes of politicians of the Penrose ring . " This will wreck the Republican Machine . This bank has been robbed by a lot of politicians , " the president of the collapsed institution is reported to have declared , and , indeed , in any other State than Pennsylvania such an affair would shatter a political machine ; but the people of Pennsylvania have been steeped so long in corruption that they seem actually to prefer misgovernment Neither the State authorities , nor Pittsburgh banking circles , nor the Pennsylvania people have been without warning in this matter . The use Penrose and his gang were making'of this State depository has been exposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , quite so bad as the facts discovered when the bank had ' to close its doors The banking view of the case will simply he that the greed of these political vultures was so insatiable that they threw to the winds all care for solvency They simply wrecked the bank while plundering it . If the voters of Pennsylvania have any self-respect remaining , their lesson will begin with the downfall of the Penrose cabal . Mr. Jerome 's debut at Carnegie Hall evoked an enthusiasm as spontaneous as it was vast : His speech was more measured than many of his public utterances . This was befitting the occasion , since he was deliberately marking out the broad lines of the political battle which he proposes to wage . His speech was his platform , and no one can read it without being persuaded that it presents an issue which is moral in its essence , and which is pressed home by a man of the clearest courage and of a will neither to be bent nor broken . His heart has long brooded over the iniquities of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of slavery , and he appears to have resolved , as Lincoln did ? " If I ever get a chance to hit that thing , I will hit it hard " As District Attorney , the diffused misery born of political dictatorship has been thrust in his face every day No part of his speech fell more solemnly from his lips than that in which he spoke of the " pleadings and intercessions of mothers , of unfortunates , of the wives , of children , " which had filled his ears month after month , Next to that stood his crushing retort upon those who had dragged out the corpse of Armitage Mathews to make a point against him Mr. Jerome showed who were the real undoers and murderers of that unhappy man . They were the Grubers and men of that kidney , who took the pleasant but weak young fellow and " put him into that dirty political game " of theirs , which gradually destroyed his morals and finally drove him to suicide in order not to " expose the criminal infamy of that particular gang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morals , nothing does . If Murphy 's " foul hand , " as Mr. Jerome called it , upon the judiciary does not show that fundamental justice is imperilled among us , nothing could . Mr. Ivins thinks that Jerome is a courageous and able man , but " unnecessarily belligerent . " But Odell must think the same of Mr. Twins . The latter lends a distinctly comic air to his depreciation of Mr. Jerome 's pugnacity by himself hitting heads right and left with such ' a delightful abandon that one almost suspects with the old lady in the play , " Irish extraction . " Mr. .0dell 's fine sensibilities are now daily trampled upon- by his candidate . " Odell ? Odell ? Who is he ? I doubt if I Should know him if I saw him He has not asked to see me , and certainly I have no desire to meet him " This sort of thing sounds to us as if Mr. Ivins were himself applying for a recognition of his rights as a belligerent And he rapped his own campaign ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine and impartial freedom . So it is really a droll stroke on his part to purse up his lips over Jerome 's imprudences . But Mr. Ivms is clearly on the right track in his disrespectful handling of bosses and their machines If he will stick to that , and promise us a millennium of simple independence and honesty , instead of one where all our expenses are to be paid by the city , he will flutter the Tammany dovecotes mightily Mayor McClellan made a dignified speech in defending his Administration and appealing for reelection . He made no pledge , however , that he would serve out his term , if reelected . In. fact , the explicit intimation of the chairman of the meeting was that ? the Mayor is to be . a candidate for Governor next year , turning the city over to the tender mercies of Murphy and IVIaGowan for three years . Mr. MCClellan must know that this consideration is seriously troubling the minds of many ; and hence , if he maintains silence , he will lend color to the view that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really intending to serve them as Mayor . A word from him - Would set this straight ; and the stress of the-canvass may yet compel him to utter it . On the subject of municipal ownership , his speech contained more sound sense than we have had from any other candidate . His general principle , that the Government should keep its hands off any business . which can be well done privately , is simply the principle which has run through all our history It is precisely the same as that enunciated by President Roosevelt in his speech at Raleigh the same day . We are too much governed , rather than too little . The work already put upon our governments is proving a serious strain upon both their efficiency and their character . When it is proposed that any new public utility should be municipalized , a very clear case has . got to be made out . It is not a matter to be decided in a hurrah , but only after looking before and after , like reasonable men , and especially counting the cost thereof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolutely conclusive . We have not the money , and can not get it , ' to enter upon all these vast new mun  --  principal enterprises . Those who are clamoring for public , ownership and operation of the new subways are really saying that they do not want the subways , since It is at present a financial impossibility for the city to build and run them . Gen. Francis V. Greene 's frank testimony last week gave what should be the deathblow to the movement to induce President Roosevelt to interfere in Venezuela in behalf of the Bermudez Asphalt Company . He admitted that the company had aided and abetted a revolution against President Castro . Within his knowledge , $100,000 had been spent to finance Matos in his fight to oust Castro . So flagrant a violation of law and decency ? did General Greene consider this , when he was told of the plan of his subordinates to foment an insurrection in order to " protect their interests in Venezuela , " that he immediately said it would be " impossible for him to make further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partment . " In. fact , he " never went to the Department again . " How could he ? The company was alleging injustice on the part of Castro ; meanwhile , it was making itself guilty of treason , and its officers , if they had been caught , liable to be shot or hanged . We are quite aware that the Bermudez Company has some show of right to redress for the seizure of its property in Venezuela . To invoke , however , the intervention of this Government requires it absolutely to come with ' clean hands . How can Secretary Root , or the President , think after this of shaking the Big Stick at Castro ? The proposal is that this should be done on account of money damages to a company which confesses itself to have been a party to a treasonable conspiracy against the very life of the Van , ezuelan Government ! The amazing testimony of Gen. Avery D. Andrews , vice-president of the General Asphalt Com- pany , on Thursday , confirmed General Greene 's . The Asphalt Trust was uneasy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " threatened with the certain destruction of its rights . " Regarding Castro exactly as Messrs . McCall and McCurdy regarded Bryan , the officers of the Trust decided that their simplest and cheapest way out of the difficulty was to pay $130,000 to Matos , who , in the role of saviour of his country and the Asphalt Trust , promised to combine the virtues of Hanna , and McKinley . The whole story , with variations in minor detail , is closely parallel to that told by Joseph Conrad in ' Nostromo . ' Below all the revolutions and counter-revolutions , the ' magniloquent appeals to patriotism , the pomp , and the cruel waste of life , ran a network of sordid intrigue for money " Picketing " is declared unlawful in a recent decision of the Appellate Court of Illinois . Several Chicago printers , whose employees were striking , appealed for legal protection against agents of the union who were interfering with the business . The decision of the court , delivered by Mr. Presiding Justice Smith , is published in the last issue of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that " the union and its ' members had the legal right to demand higher wages of complainants , either with- or without good reason . The members of the union also had the legal right to quit work as individuals or collectively , as a means of enforcing their demand . " On the other hand , " the union or its members had no legal right to interfere with the business of complainants or to disturb them in their lawful business . " As to interference , the ruling of the court is perfectly explicit : " The picket system once established , the intimidation , assaults , slugging , and bloodshed followed as naturally and inevitably as night follows day . There can be no ? such thing as peaceful , ' polite , and gentlemanly ' picketing , any more than there can be chaste , ' polite , and gentlemanly ' vulgarity , or peaceful mobbing , or lawful lynching . " This is strong language , but every one who has observed the course of any strike must admit the truth of it . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is idle to talk of picketing for lawful ' persuasive purposes . Men do not ? form picket lines dor the purpose of conversation and lawful persuasion . Such picketing as is established ' by the evidence in the case at bar is intended to annoy and intimidate , whether physical violence is resorted to or not , and is unlawful in either case " So far as Illinois is concerned , this disposes of that abstract conception and metaphysical sophistry , peaceful picketing . Both houses of the Federal Parliament of Australia on Thursday adopted resolutions in favor of Home Rule for Ireland . The incident will pass almost unperceived in this country , and probably with very little comment in England . Yet suppose the resolutions had been in favor of Chamberlain 's fiscal policy , the welkin would have rung " Listen to the majestic voice of our great colony ! Here is a statesmanlike suggestion looking to the federating of the Empire . Englishmen , will you be foolish enough to spurn these wise counsels ?

It is unofficially announced at Paris that Russia is undertaking to borrow $360,000,000 from outside markets . As to the necessity for such a loan , it is to be observed that all Russia 's borrowings during the recent war were in the form of short-term loans ; the last one , indeed  --  some $50,000,000 , placed at Berlin  --  being merely a nine-months ' note , maturing some time this winter . Within the next few years , then , all of this war debt , footing up nearly $300,000,000 , must in any case be refunded ; the proposed new loan would no doubt provide for that process in advance and for the closing expenses of the war . But the more interesting question is , Who will lend Russia the money ? It appears to be assumed that the French investor , under the guidance of the great Paris banking houses which manage his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ savings . The intimation , however , that Germany , England , Holland , and the United States will participate , provokes some doubts . English financial writers have been suggesting that London may take , a block of the Russian bonds for political reasons  --  to show , in short , that no hard feeling need be left over from recent controversies . A similar argument is proposed for German participation . But underwriting bankers are not altruists ; they have been known to take a loan because their Government urged it , but they did not do so until they could see where the bonds could be resold to investors . It is scarcely conceivable that the British investor will show any great appetite for Russian Government securities , and while matters might be somewhat flitferent with the-German public , the.fact that Germany is just now in the throes of a collapsing stock speculation does not entirely favor an operation of this nature . The inference would seem to be that if Berlin and London bankers take up at first hand a portion of the Russian loan , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " at will on Paris , the home market of Russian securities . - The Japanese achievement in raising the sunken Russian warships at Chem-ulna and Port Arthur has not received due recognition The Setentafie Amenean points out that this salving of vessels universally believed to have been hopelessly ruined " is one of the most astonishing feats of the many astonishing things ? . . . done during the late - war . " The ships were not only innired in the attacks on Port Arthur and the sortie of August , but they were finally sunk by the firing of Nogi 's guns More than that , the night ' before the surrender , the Russian officers sought to make complete wrecks of them by exploding submarine mines under them .

Leaving out the two coast-defence monitors captured , the Sentavin and Aprax-9 , n , the Japanese have increased the total of their battleships from six at the beginning of the conflict to ten , despite the two lost during the war . When the two new battleships now building in England are completed , the Japanese will have a dozen battleships , two fine coast-defence vessels , and nine fine ar , nosed cruisers , which in their hands are practically as valuable as battleshipS :
