 |p538  For good or ill , fiction is the most widely read form of literature in the present day . It , therefore , affords the best gauge of the tastes of the general community . We can understand the mind of the public more correctly by watching its preferences in the matter of novels than by any other test ? except perhaps the newspapers and magazines , and even in these , fiction supplies no inconsiderable element . In an inquiry of this kind it is obviously to the younger writers that most attention should be paid . The work of the seniors may be intrinsically of higher literary quality , and may enchain the interest of the critic , if not of the average reader , to a greater degree than that of less experienced craftsmen ; but it is not so instructive as an index of tendency . A new novel by Mr. Howells or Mr. Meredith would almost certainly be more valuable in itself than any of the books to be considered in this article , but it would have less to tell us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men of observation and sympathy , they are , of course , not insensitive to contemporary feeling ; yet , after all , both their style and their outlook show mainly the influence of antecedent generations . The literature which impressed them in their formative years was the product of earlier periods , and the constituency to which they have been accustomed to address their appeal was confronted by problems and inspired by ideals differing in many respects from those of to-day . In deciding that , for the specific purpose above mentioned , we must eliminate all writers over fifty years of age , we are by no means suggesting that they are to be regarded as " on the shelf . " It is rather their books that we delight in placing there , as having won the right to a permanent foothold in our libraries . The juniors , while more directly representative of the life of the twentieth century , have still to make good their claim to inscription on the roll of honor . Meanwhile , their books are " on the table " for inspection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held a high place in the regard of readers of fiction . It might therefore appear at a first glance that she should rightfully be exempted from the inquisition to which those writers are subject who are still in the experimental stage . It  |p539  is , however , by her short stories that she has gained her distinguished reputation throughout the English-speaking world . At one time and another she has tempted fortune with a long novel , but she has not yet achieved anything like an equal success by the work she has done outside of her accustomed metier . " By the Light of the Soul " ' confirms once more the accepted critical opinion that the qualities required in these two varieties of fiction are by no means identical . Standing in the very front rank as a painter of literary miniatures , Mrs. Freeman declines to a position of disappointing mediocrity when she uses her brush upon a large canvas . Certain passages in the book , it is true , give some hint of her real strength . In her detailed analysis of the emotions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former skill . For example , Maria Edgham 's state of mind on her mother 's death , on her father 's remarriage , and on her first day of teaching at Amity is portrayed in each case with convincing faithfulness to life . But a long novel is not to be estimated as the sum of a number of situations considered as detached items . Its quality is mainly gauged by one or both of two things ? the plot and the development of character . Now in this instance the plot is little short of grotesque , and the development of character is confused and almost bewildering . The absurdity of the central improbability of the story , the New York marriage , is too obivous to need to be dwelt upon . A further objection is that the story has no real ending . The last chapter is no denouement at all , but simply adds another coil to the problem . If Maria had drowned herself in Fisher 's Pond , the solution might have appeared hackneyed and inartistic , but it would at any rate have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the book wondering what will happen to Maria when she returns to Miss Blair : whether the possibilities of coincidence , in which the author has evidently a generous belief , will never expose her to the risk of meeting her Edgham or Amity friends ; whether she is henceforth to dwell in a society so remote from the other sex that no further appeal will be made to her affection ; and whether with her sensitive conscience she will live quite happy ever after , undisturbed by the recollections that her own lack of courage has condemned her ardently-beloved sister to a lawless union . As to the people involved in this drama , it is plain that Mrs. Freeman herself has not reached a clear conception of either their personal appearance or their character . Aunt Maria , who on page 40 is a " stout , elderly , woman , " has shrunk eight pages later to a woman with a " thin body , " and the qualities of mind and heart she reveals during the greater part of the story differ widely from those of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Evelyn Edgham 's fluff of yellow hair suddenly changes , with no reason assigned , to a head of dark curls . The principal figure , Maria Edgham , is an irritating puzzle . We are even denied the necessary data for a knowledge of her age at some of the most important turning-points in her history . The author appears to have two minds on the subject , and is still describing her as a mere child when fellow-passengers in a street-car speak of her as a " young woman . " The representation of Maria 's character is of a piece with the other vaguenesses and self-contradictions . Special emphasis is laid on the New England strain in her heredity , and we are expected to regard her as almost a miracle of self-control . At the same time , she completely loses her head in every emergency . Her unthinking impulsiveness comes out not only in the freaks of her childhood , but in several incidents of her adult years ? in her rude and hysterical outburst at the Ramsey house , in her extraordinary trick of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disfigurement , and especially in her two wild and aimless flights first to Ridgewood and later to New York . The New-England conscience may possibly be deficient in a sense of proportion ? a characteristic which must be taken for granted in order to explain Maria 's repeated distress at the thought of any discovery of the New York marriage ? but it is flatly inconceivable that in disappearing from Amity so scrupulous a woman should have suffered no twinges at the ingratitude she was thus showing toward her aunt , to say nothing of her strange contentment , as already remarked , with the position in which she left her sister . The principal effect of this book is one which , it may be presumed , was very far from the author 's own intention . As a story it is naught and as a study of character it is muddled and unmeaning , but as a picture of school life it leaves a distinct impression on the mind of the reader . American teachers might well draw up a petition to Mrs. Freeman praying her to leave them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pen . I have read much that has been written in criticism of American educational ideals and methods , but I have seldom come across anything as damaging as this unconscious accusation by an American writer . The conditions herein described are such as to amaze foreign readers . " If Miss Wilkins 's description is true , " comments Dr. Robertson Nicoll , in " The British Weekly , " " the results of mixed education in America must be very bad . " A critic in another influential English paper sums up the book as " a tragedy of co-education . " This novel not only represents the life of the co-educational academy as vitiated by an unhealthy and constant emotionalism , but also brings into strong  |p541  relief the evil side of the mixing of all sorts and conditions of children in the common school . Quiet and undistinguished surroundings also form the setting of " A Blind Bird 's Nest , " ' in which Miss Mary Findlater has skilfully depicted the commonplace every-day routine of a Devonshire village . Its general atmosphere is restful but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attractiveness that is often wanting in books of greater vigor . Here , too , the heroine is a girl whose early life is darkened by melancholy , and whose craving for sympathy and love is the source of her chief perplexities . Agnes Sorel lies under the shadow of an evil inheritance not because of any taint in the blood , but because her father has had to expiate by a long imprisonment the sudden passion which led him to take the life of his sister 's betrayer . For a time this family disgrace seems destined to wreck Agnes 's own future , but the issue is in accordance both with our natural desires and with the requirements of artistic effect . The series of events which brings her to the happy betrothal with which the book closes makes no strain upon our credulity and the development of her nature under trial is sketched with unusual insight . The minor characters are interesting and consistent ? if anything , too consistent . The writer lets some of them run away with her until they are in danger of becoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we feel sure would have been intolerable and would therefore not have been tolerated . Miss Ellen Briggs is an entertaining . specimen of the habitual invalid ; but her hypochondriacal anxiety about diet reaches an unimaginable point when she gravely remarks , as a gull snatches away a piece of the cocoanut cake she has herself declined , that the morsel will be " bad for the poor bird . " Miss Maria Briggs , her cheerful , kindly , blundering niece , is well drawn until she is overdrawn . When she observes on page 136 that " of course , misfortunes will happen in the best regulated families , as Matthew Arnold says , " the collocation is as funny as it was meant to be . But when , on page 211 , she remarks that " circumstances alter cases , as Matthew Arnold says , " the sensation of amusement refuses to return . Within the next twenty-five pages we find similar banalities ascribed to Matthew Arnold again , to Heine , and to Swinburne , and at each repetition our annoyance waxes . You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A similar objection does not lie against the representation of Mr. and Mrs. Lascelles , the vicar and his wife , who " belonged to the class of old people who have acquired the prejudices of age without its wisdom and who live like children in a world of their own , " of Agnes 's grandmother ,  |p542  and of the two American families . The introduction of the last-mentioned into the story gives an opportunity for interesting descriptions of the impression made by American visitors upon Devonshire villagers , and vice versa , as well as of the effect of New York in simultaneously bewildering the girl just arrived from England and awakening into fresh activity the American girl returning from a sojourn abroad . It should be added that the marriage in prospect at the end is an international one , but differs from the conventional type in the bride elect being English and the bridegroom American . In " Paul , " Mr. E. F. Benson shows himself one of the most daring of modern novelists . I do not use this epithet in the cant sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subjects that it would be more wholesome to leave alone , for we have here no example of tainted or neurotic fiction . He is a daring writer because of his extraordinary presumption upon the confidence and good-will of his readers . He deliberately constructs the first half of his plot in such a way as to produce the maximum of irritation , not to say resentment . Our natural impulse at the end of this section of the book is to throw the whole thing aside and refuse to allow our patience to be abused any longer . The picture of the physically puny but intellectually formidable Theodore Beckwith is too cleverly wrought to be incredible and too subtle to be disgusting , but we feel as though the writer were taking an unfair advantage of us in compelling us to make the acquaintance of so abnormal a creature . If he had not established a claim upon our attention by his previous work , we should ask indignantly whether our imaginations were given us to conceive such a ghoulish figure as this , and should joyfully accept the killing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exempting us from the necessity of pursuing the fate of the other characters any further . But Mr. Benson goes placidly on with his story in the conviction that we shall hear him out , and we do . We then find that the grewsome Beckwith episodes are the fitting and necessary background for a character study of remarkable power and thrilling interest . At first we had thought that the book should properly have been entitled " Theodore , " for until the end of the thirteenth chapter he was the outstanding figure and Paul Norris merely one of many victims of his ingenious cruelty ; but from this point onward we recognize that what has gone before is preparing the way for the great conflict between inclination and duty that has been fought out in the soul of Paul . @#  |p543  A young man of much personal charm and of habitual gayety of spirit is suddenly staggered by a tragedy in which his own share is so strangely complicated that it is impossible for us who know all to pronounce him either innocent or guilty . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul even risked his own life to save that of his enemy ; yet , paradox though it may be , there was in the deed a sufficient element of murderous intent to plant a sting of ceaseless self-reproach in the conscience of the unhappy cause of it . This agony of the man who can not acquit himself , though the world holds him blameless and even admires his magnanimity , presents to the novelist a much more intricate problem than that familiar subject , the inexorable remorse of the undetected criminal . The terror of Paul Norris is not that of Bill Sikes . But the alleviation which is open to the most brutal offender against the laws of society tempts him also . There is one unfailing means of expunging the sense of evil and of removing what its victim persuades himself is a morbid sense of responsibility . The alternate exhilaration and despair , the comfort and the burden , the valorous resolutions and the ingenious self-deceptions of the secret drinker are here portrayed with graphic power . The steady degradation of character that we are watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not drink for drink 's sake ? but of an almost panic-stricken impulse to snatch at anything that promises an anodyne for the poison of remembrance . Until within a few pages of the close , we are kept in suspense as to whether Paul 's enemy and persecutor , by the mere memory of the tragedy that cut him off , is to work more havoc after death than in life and is to drive him to utter collapse , body and soul . It is no small triumph for a writer to make us admit , when so near the denouement , that we have not the least idea how it will all end and that whether Paul goes to the bad or pulls himself together the conclusion will in either case be entirely credible . The passage in which the crisis is reached and Paul is delivered at one stroke both from his mental obsession and from his debasing habit is , for its dramatic interest , the culmination of the whole story . If we laid the book aside now it would be with the satisfaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yet the two chapters that remain by no means produce the effect of an anti-climax . For one moment we apprehend that we were over-hasty in our anticipation of a " happy ending , " and that though Paul has been saved from the curse that has been dogging him , he is to have but a brief enjoyment of the expected boon . The apprehension passes and the incident that has caused it is found to be the one thing that was needed to complete and assure the happiness that it threatened .  |p544  A book which appeals so strongly to the deepest emotions requires a considerable intermingling of lighter elements if it is not to produce at times a sense of unbearable strain . This need is supplied by the cleverness of the dialogue , the variety of the minor characters , and the artistic quality of the descriptions of Italian and English scenery . The figure of Mrs. Mundy shows that a cheerful contribution to the general effect of a story may be made by the introduction of a person who is incurably pessimistic . Such is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a watercolor of the Bay of Salerno she manages to infuse into the radiant Italian sunshine something of her own melancholy . " One felt that it might begin to rain any minute . " The Archdeacon 's wife also adds much to our pleasure , as does Lady Ravenscroft , who " did not like money in the least ? she only disliked the absence of it , which is a far different matter . " In " The Fighting Chance , " 1 Mr. Robert W. Chambers advances what on the face of it is a novel prescription for inherited moral disease . Stephen Siward has so far given way to the hereditary vice of drunkenness that most of his intimates regard him as already doomed . Sylvia . Landis is alarmed by the knowledge that , in her own words , " in three generations every woman of my race has gone wrong . " The means of the salvation of both Stephen and Sylvia is their union to one another . It must be admitted that this is a crude statement of the motive of the book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two cases are really not parallel , for while Stephen has again and again been mastered by his besetting curse , Sylvia can not reproach herself with more than a few impulsive indiscretions stimulated by the mere joy of living . Then the author himself suggests , in his final paragraph , that Stephen 's fight is not entirely over . " Deep in his body , as he stood there , he heard the low challenge of his soul on guard ; and he knew that the Enemy listened . " But these qualifications do much to impair the effectiveness of the story . The first of them practically eliminates from the problem any special risk attaching to Sylvia beyond that to which any attractive girl of high spirits , whatever her family history , is exposed amid the temptations of modern society . The author , desiring to win our sympathies in her behalf , has hesitated to picture her as a woman corrupt in grain , and by this hesitation he has made it easy for us to believe that marriage with the man who attracts both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If he had put in Sylvia 's place a woman with Agatha Caithness 's characteristics , he would have been actually face to face with the difficulty which he now evades . As to @#  |p545  Stephen , the most that can be said is that he receives powerful help in his struggle with the fiend from the devotion of one who calls out the best that is in him . We are not quite convinced that Beverly Plank 's support , which has sustained him through part of the conflict , might not have been equally efficacious if it could have been ministered to him as constantly as that of a wife . The net result is that the apparent solution has little practical significance . Mr. Chambers offers only an inconclusive answer to the question of tainted heredity in the case of the man , and does not tackle it at all in the case of the woman . The various phases of Stephen Siward 's fight against his temptation suggest a comparison with the similar struggles recorded in " Paul . " Paul Norris , it will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but flies to drink as a relief from unpleasant meditations . In his case we are more poignantly affected than in Stephen 's , for we have here nothing of equal power to the representation of Paul 's gradual weakening of will and the insidious overgrowth of deceitful tendencies only half recognized by their victim . But while Mr. Chambers 's analysis is not as masterly as Mr. Benson 's and does not so deeply stir our emotion , it is well proportioned to the scale of the book as a whole . Up to the crisis , Stephen Siward shows stronger traits than Paul Norris ; but somehow the tragic note seems less in keeping with the characters of " The Fighting Chance , " in spite of the seriousness of its central theme , than with those of " Paul , " and a more affecting pathos would have been discordant with the general tone of the society described . Considered apart from its main theme , " The Fighting Chance " has much to recommend it . One of its principal merits is the admirable study of Beverly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our interest to such a degree that we are in danger of forgetting that he is meant to be only a subordinate character . He is , indeed , the least conventional of all the types herein portrayed and stands out prominently against the background of selfish and giddy society folk . How far Mr. Chambers is correct in his representation of the ways and manners of wealthy and " exclusive " New Yorkers , especially of those who contrive to combine business with pleasure , must be left to the judgment of critics equipped with expert knowledge ; but at any rate it is brisk and credible . There are a few delightful side-hits which can be appreciated by any reader of the daily papers , and some of the epigrams , in dialogue and otherwise , are not easily forgotten . That " in New York nothing is really very old except the faces of the young men " is a cynical but memorable saying ; and the description of one of the characters as a man who would squeeze a dollar bill till the eagle screams will doubtless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p546  Elaborate precautions have been taken by Mr. Arthur Stringer lest " The Wire Tappers ' ' ' should be left unread . He has remembered most of the demands that can be made upon the modern novelist by various types of readers and has provided within one volume speculations upon moral problems , studies of character , descriptions of some of the most absorbing phases of life in New York , and an exciting plot with a considerable number of adventurous incidents . In the event of the general public failing to respond to this combination of attractions , there remains as a last resort an appeal to the interest of that special class which likes a book well sprinkled with references to box-relays , Bunnell sounders and rheostats , and appreciates a solid block of two pages giving full details of a new electrical invention . One of the leading features of the book would therefore be more fittingly dealt with in the section of " Applied Science " than in that of " Literature . " But there is sufficient movement in the story to carry non-professional readers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggle in which Jim Durkin , the former railway telegraphist , and Frances Candler , the ex-governess , are pitted against the resources of the New York detective police is depicted with a style admirably suited to vivid narration . Mr. Stringer 's descriptive ability is further shown in his account of the panic in the cotton pit and in other scenes laid in a region of higher respectability than that with which Mulberry Street is ordinarily concerned . As a psychologist Mr. Stringer is less successful . Both Jim and Frances are intended to appear to us as persons who were not born with especially evil tendencies , but who are prevented by circumstances from being as honest and decent as they would like to be . Frances , in particular , is an incredible character . This associate of the enemies of society , who is compelled to maintain herself by fraud because she has tried in vain to earn a living otherwise , possesses intellectual and educational qualifications which would easily have insured her a professor 's chair . When she sees C17H19NO3 on a bottle , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquainted with the literature of modern science , and incidently mentions in a letter that , in order to discover whether she has the traits of the female offender , she has just been taking her cephalic index , testing her chromatic perceptions and her tactile sensitiveness , and making sure that it corresponds normally to a Faraday current ; and as to practical electricity , she knows all that is to be known . Her partner describes her as " unyielding , staunch , clean of mind and life , a woman of stern honor ? and through it all an adventuress and a robber ! "  |p547  Our difficulty in conceiving such a blend is not removed by the detailed exposition of her attitude at the critical moments of her career . It is obvious that both she and Jim Durkin have been hardly used , but the deliberate choice of evil plays such an important part in the misfortunes of both of them that our sympathy is not greatly aroused . We rather think them lucky in escaping jail and getting clear of the country , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start life afresh in England will carry them very far . For sheer ability there are few recent novels to compare with Mr. Jack London 's " White Fang . " ' In this book he returns to the sphere . in which he won distinction as author of " The Call of the Wild . " Now , however , the development he is tracing is of the opposite type . Instead of picturing the reversion of a dog to the instincts of the ancestral wolf , he shows how a wolf cub with but a small proportion of the dog in its breed may , under civilizing influences , lose its ferocity except for such modicum as is necessary to insure its being worth its keep as a trustworthy protection against burglars . The response is no longer to " the call of the open " but to " the call of the fire and of man ? the call which has been given alone of all animals to the wolf to answer , to the wolf and the wild-dog who are brothers . " As an exercise of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notable advance on " The Call of the Wild . " There is something almost uncanny in Mr. London 's representation of the successive stages in the cub 's education from the moment that it discovers in the " white wall " of its native cave , through which its father has mysteriously disappeared , an opening into the wide world . So brilliant a study in animal psychology might well tempt a reader of superstitious inclinations to wonder whether there may not after all be some truth in the doctrine of metempsychosis , for the easiest theory to account for Mr. London 's wonderful knowledge of the inside of a young wolf 's mind is that he must be drawing upon recollections of a previous vulpine period in his own existence . Mr. London 's success in this part of the book is so manifest that it has already encouraged some critics to approve the heresy that human characters are unnecessary to the novelist ; and the adventures of animals supply an adequate motive for a thrilling story . Actually it affords a strong argument to the contrary . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind that is aroused by the masterpieces of fiction . It is rather to be compared to the impression left upon us by a first-class  |p548  popular scientific lecture . Let any reader try to envisage the tale as it would be left if the human complications were cut out of it , and he will understand how utterly incapable it would then be of standing alone , from the novelist 's as distinct from the scientist 's point of view . Its real dramatic power is confined to those passages in which the adventures of wolves and dogs are clearly subordinate to those of human beings . In the whole book there is nothing else so effective as the introductory chapter ? the picture of the two men carrying the body of their dead companion in a dog-sled across the frozen wild , their pursuit by a pack of hungry and almost maddened wolves , the tension of their nerves as their resources of defence and escape lessen day by day , the collapse of one of them in his desperate attempt at release and rescue of his partner at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , creating a sense of tragic horror without repulsiveness , would be perfect of its kind . As the beginning of a long novel it turns all that follows into anti-climax . Throughout the next sections the story moves on a different plane . We are no longer thrilled by that essential element in vital dramatic interest ? the feeling that we are reading of something , which , if our own lot had been cast otherwise , might conceivably have happened to ourselves ? but we listen with gratified attention while the accomplished lecturer expounds to us the mysterious operations of animal instincts . Just when the exposition is in danger of becoming monotonous , it is relieved by the appearance of prominent human actors . The brutalities of Beauty Smith and the interposition of Weedon Scott bring us once more into touch with our own kind , and as a result the story immediately tightens its grip upon our imaginations . Further , even the animal-psychology section owes some of its interest to an unspoken suggestion of a larger application . In his record of White Fang 's history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One is the law which he expresses , in full capitals , by the formula " Eat or be eaten . " He shows us that in any conflict between wild animals ? wolves , lynxes , porcupines , hawks , or whatever they may be ? " the way of life for one lies in the eating of the other , and the way of life for the other lies in not being eaten . " His other theme is the supreme importance of environment in deciding which out of various inherited tendencies shall prevail . Had White Fang never come into the fires of man , the Wild would have moulded him into a true wolf . But the gods had given him a different environment and he was moulded into a dog that was rather wolfish , but that was a dog and not a wolf . But we have a suspicion throughout that Mr. London has a wider sm.  |p549  intention than appears on the surface . He does not deliberately tell us that his story has a parabolic significance , but he gives an easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Jim Hall , the convict . This man , like the creatures of the Wild , can only escape from being killed by killing , and he , too , " a human beast , it is true , but nevertheless so terrible a beast that he can best be characterized as carnivorous , " derives his enmity to his fellows in large measure from " the moulding he had received at the hands of society . " It would be an exaggeration to call this novel a Socialistic tract in disguise , but it is certainly not the least clever stroke of its author 's that he has succeeded in interweaving into a dog-and-wolf story so subtle a reminder of the pressure of feral conditions in the midst of civilized human society . The publication of " The Dust of Conflict " ' by Mr. Harold Bindloss shows that there is still a public for the conventional novel of adventure containing a generous allowance of sharp fighting and hair-breadth escapes . The type may be as old-fashioned as the writer pleases , provided that the setting is of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the insurrection in Cuba immediately preceding the Spanish-American War . First as a blockade-runner and later as a member and leader of the band of the Sin Verguenza , Bernard Appleby runs enough risks and performs enough exploits to earn the right of settling down quietly ever after . If , for a moment , we think it strange that a New York merchant travelling in the heart of the disturbed district should have been accompanied by his daughter ? and her presence at the capture of a Cuban town by the insurgents is essential to the story ? the improbability is soon forgotten in the prevailing turmoil . Coincidences offer their assistance to Mr. Bindloss just at the point where they can be of most service , and he escapes the difficulty of working out the characters of his leading figures by frankly describing them to us in detail in the first chapter . But the book , though of little artistic merit , is exhilarating reading . Any one who wishes a fresh and sparkling tale combining a lovestory with exciting but not improbable adventure will be hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which Mr. Eden Phillpotts and Mr. Arnold Bennett have recently collaborated , and which has been published in England and America under the titles of " The Sinews of Wars ' and " Doubloons " ' respectively . The familiar compliment that " there is  |p550  not a dull page in it " would really be its most appropriate characterization . The sub-title , " A Romance of London and the Sea , " suggests the range it covers . The London described is the London of the residential mansion and the sixpenny lodging-house , of the maitre-d'hotel and the navvy , of the West-end automobile and the Poplar Street car . Its contrasts are foreshadowed on the second page , where Philip Masters is surprised to find himself , in the midst of a city that spends ? 12,000 a day on cab-fares , with only a sixpenny-piece in his pocket and no prospect of adding to it . Before the book closes he has won ? 37,500 and the heart of one of the most charming women in England . He reaches this goal by an extraordinary route @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a succession of thrilling incidents connected with such apparently unrelated matters as the merits of jiu-jitsu , the elevation of a sensational journalist to the peerage , the science of dactylography , the popularization of the Encyclopaedia Britannica , the dependence of a steam-yacht upon its propeller , the superstitions of West Indian negroes , and the Battle of Tsushima . Surprise follows fast upon surprise with a stimulating influence upon the reader 's wits , which strive in vain to anticipate the next step . The villain of the story is one of the cleverest criminals one might hope to meet in a long course of detective fiction , and his twistings and turnings would do credit to a Prof. Moriarty . And the effect of such a skilful and enthralling plot is heightened by the other features of the story , especially by its delightful vein of satire . After all , I had better withdraw my previous opinion that the qualities of this novel are satisfying : on the contrary , they are so appetizing that we eagerly beseech Messrs . Phillpotts and Bennett for more of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the culminating grievance of Magister Udal against Thomas Cromwell is thus expressed . " Me , the first learned man in Britain , he did force to write a play in the vulgar tongue . Me , a master of Latin , to write in English ! " One is tempted to say that Mr. Ford Madox Hueffer , the author of this novel of the time of Henry VIII , has set down Udal 's complaint with sincere sympathy , for he appears himself to entertain a strong prejudice against the use of a commonly intelligible speech as the vehicle for his ideas . He would no doubt explain that the pedantry of his style is necessarily assumed in order to reproduce the atmosphere of the sixteenth century . The one fact that what is pedantic now would not have been pedantic then is fatal to the success of any such device . The conversation not of Udal only but of the King himself , of Katharine @#  |p551  Howard , and even of Culpepper and Hogben , makes hard reading . The very effort to understand it destroys the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was certainly not hard hearing . Mr. Hueffer 's imaginative reproduction of Tudor dialogue is a brilliant tour-de-force , and little more . It is an accomplishment of the same type as the writing of clever Latin verses , and deserves the same praise that is due to skill in such exercises . The book , though not a long one , grows tedious by reason of both the difficulty of its style and the large proportion of details of political and ecclesiastical intrigue . These may have been necessary to a faithful representation of the situation ; but if so the natural conclusion is that the subject , however important to the historical student , is not suitable for fiction . Both the merits and the defects of " Privy Seal " are characteristic of a recent development of the historical novel .

Anachronism has become an almost unpardonable offence . It is certainly reasonable to expect that the gains of modern historical study should in some measure enrich historical fiction also ; that the novelist should benefit by the new light thrown by research upon the motives of great men and upon the conditions with which they had to deal , and especially that he should not misrepresent , through carelessness or ignorance , the main significance of the periods he professes to depict . There is a level of general accuracy which the writer of historical fiction should be required to reach before being taken into account at all ? a qualifying entrance examination , so to speak , to meet him at the threshold of his enterprise .

That no contemporary writer is as yet in danger of being mistaken for a second Scott may readily be admitted ; but if there should be latent anywhere a genius of this type , he need not stay in hiding from the fear that the achievements of more scientific writers will have spoiled his welcome .  |p552  The last and sprightliest book on my table is " A Midsummer Day 's Dream " ' by Mr. H. B. Marriott Watson . It points no moral and grapples with no problem . Written evidently as an ebullition of high spirits , it will promote in the minds of readers the temper from which it sprang . Its humor keeps well on the right side of buffoonery , although the scene of the tale is laid at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regard as inseparable from practical joking and horseplay . The central idea is the anticipated performance of " A Midsummer Night 's Dream " by members of this party for the benefit of a local charity . Actually we do not get beyond the raising of the curtain ; but the rehearsals , which take place by moonlight in the glades of Temple Park , supply occasions for the most diverting episodes . One of the happiest strokes is the notion of securing the village cobbler to play the part of Bottom . His nazf satisfaction at the compliment and his eager desire to utilize the opportunity for the display of his musical talents are very entertaining . The spirit of Puck seems to regulate almost all that happens . Scarcely anything is what it appears to be . " I seem bound to be a mock hero , " exclaims Philip Bannatyne ; " I save people from all kinds of absurdities ? Miss Arden from a bull that 's a cow , Miss Latham from a bee that would n't bite , and Lady Cynthia from water that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audacity " and his " delicate masterfulness " is an entirely delightful person , and we are really somewhat disappointed at the close to learn that he intends to go into Parliament . One of- the great merits of this extravaganza is the cleverness of the dialogue , which is not so uniformly smart as to become monotonous but ingeniously expresses the variety of characters . Altogether , as a provocative of clean and wholesome gayety , " A Midsummer Day 's Dream " would be hard to beat . If the novels discussed in this article are a fair sample of the output of the contemporary press ? and they have been chosen without bias from the list of such recent publications as seemed most likely to repay attention ? it is clear that the old types bid fair to persist in slightly varied forms . One thing is especially notable in the case of the modern " problem novel . " The question with which it is mainly occupied to-day is that of heredity and environment . In one instance , we have even found this subject considered in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From a philosophical point of view , the general presentation of heredity in such novels as these is , perhaps , rather one-sided . There is a tendency  |p553  to take for granted that it transmits evil qualities only , and to neglect its part in the communication of desirable traits also . But in any case one recognizes with satisfaction that the main drift of recent fiction is not pessimistic . The inheriting of evil is not conceived as equivalent to an inevitable doom : by one means or another it may be fought and overcome . So , too , in " Paul , " where the trouble is not hereditary but is none the less degrading , it is shown that what is most to be feared is an attitude of hopeless acquiescence . The literary style of these novels reaches a higher standard than the average of popular fiction a generation ago . There is little slovenly writing in them and little affectation of " fine language . " The most carelessly constructed book in this respect is Mrs. Wilkins Freeman 's . Here is a breathless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seventh page of " By the Light of the Soul " : Harry Edgham came of perhaps the best old family in that vicinity . Edgham itself had been named for it , and while he partook of that degeneracy which comes to the descendants of the large old families , while it is as inevitable that they should run out , so to speak , as flowers which have flourished too many years in a garden , whose soil they have exhausted , he had not lost the habit of rectitude of his ancestors . In " White Fang , " Mr. London unintentionally supplies a warning to writers who are tempted to an ultra-realistic style . He has occasion to describe many sanguinary fights , and in each case he insists on giving full details . At first this graphic manner makes the painful impression desired ; but by the time we reach the tenth fight or so we have grown so accustomed to reading of torn throats , split skulls , crunched bones , ripped-up flesh , and the like that these terms become scarcely more significant than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We accept them as belonging to the conventional formulas of conflict and they cease any longer to arouse a sense of either disgust or horror . Mr. London 's excess of realism thus defeats its own end . It will have been noted that in writing one of these books two authors have cooperated with excellent results . It is a pity that the practice of collaboration is so seldom followed in fiction . In reading " By the Light of the Soul , " for example , one can not help reflecting that if Mrs. Wilkins Freeman were to take into partnership some writer of skill and experience in working on a large scale , the combination of talents might be expected to produce a series of novels of much higher rank than anything she is likely to achieve by her independent efforts .
