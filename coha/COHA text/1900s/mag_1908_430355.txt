MEN and women expect more of marriage than there is in it , and much of the unhappiness of married life is due to the romantically exaggerated view of this institution which most people hold . Marriage has two sides ? the sentimental , and the practical ? and the only people who succeed in the holy and difficult estate of matrimony are the ones who carry their common sense away from the altar with them , instead of leaving it bound as a sacrifice . Marriage is a partnership of the most intimate and perplexing kind between two adults of different heredity , different upbringing , different ideals , different points of view regarding every known subject , from religion to cotton sheets . This is not to mention the inherent difference of the eternal masculine and the everlasting feminine . The destined victims meet . The man is full of sentiment . He has thought out , if he be of the normal type , just what he expects and desires of a wife . He has woven a garment of dreams in which are blended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his most exalted moods . The man is the lonely , sentimental dreamer ? be sure of that . When he meets the woman to whom he feels drawn in nature 's old primal , unchanging fashion , he is not capable of seeing her as she is because he has promptly enveloped her in his beautiful garment of dreams , and she has at once become his ideal woman . He eulogizes the creature of his own imagination , and pours out upon her a wealth of boyish adoration , which is just as boyish at fifty as at twenty , provided he has not  | spent all his treasure in small change . This is one factor expectations of the future husband . In her early years she takes it for granted that there will be one , and she thrills in response to the eyes or hand of every hero she meets in poetry or fiction . Her lover must conform to literary standards . She does not look for him for a long time among creatures of flesh and blood ; they repel her a little , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elaine dreamed ? " dark -- splendid , speaking in the silence , f ull of noble things . " Their manners are not to be compared with the Bayards whom she loves , and neither do they make up in masterfulness what they lack in courtesy , like Rochester . In fact , if a girl reads at all , she dreams through her teens of a lordly creature who calls her " little girl , " who wisely and with easy strength carries all her burdens for her , who loves her , asking no return ? an essential part of her subconscious ideal ? and who will praise unceasingly her efforts to please him , chiefly in the direction of music and clothes . Nobody will admit either of these pictures in their gallery of candidates for matrimony , but they are true nevertheless . This romantic young woman ? or middle-aged one for that matter ? offers another factor in the problem . The third factor is the colossal ignorance of both the man and the woman regarding the practical details of this sentimentalromantic partnership . They are fit for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go envying , as did the remarkable Annabel Lee and her lover . They are equipped for paradise before the fall or for earth in the millennium . If they did not have to eat or drink or be sheltered or clothed or bring up children or earn a. living or cook a meal , life would be one grand sweet song . In fact , they are prepared for a condition of things that does not exist , and are absolutely unprepared for things as they are . Now , given the sentimental man , the romantic woman , and a twofold ignorance of what is needed in the most practical relationship in life , the only wonder is that as many people struggle out into the light as we see wresting happiness every day from unfavorable conditions . These people who succeed , after they come home from their wedding trip , have made a secret pilgrimage to that shrine where they had left their common sense as an offering , and have quickly and with much laughter installed it as the ruling deity of the new home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abcut them . For others , those who think it treachery to trust to anything but Love with a large L , the period of Disenchantment sets in with the waning honeymoon . Sentiment suffers because through the torn robe of dreams it beholds a woman 's soul that is not quite yet as the angels in heaven ; romance is ruffled because Bayard and Rochester have become hopelessly confused with plain John Smith ? a good man , but neither a cavalier nor a brute . Moreover , the forest of ignorance is slowly giving place for standing ground on the level plain of **43;176;TOOLONG . This is the proper time for the man to discover that business is still of some importance , that home is not a divine institution presented by a watchful Providence to the newly wedded that they may be " happy ever after , " and that " women are queer . " This is the proper time for the woman to discover that she is left much alone and that her husband seems quite unaware of the fact ; that there are plain everyday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasanter if she only understood about them ? which she does n't ; that books and music and calling and " going down town " " lack a gracious somewhat " ? to put it mildly ; in fact , that it is a woman 's lot to be misunderstood and unhappy , and that " men are selfish . " Here are two propositions which many a man and woman , if they are truthful , will recognize . Marriage , the very necessary and the very beautiful partnership which forms the basis of all rational life and society , can not be abandoned . It must be understood and developed and ennobled in accordance with its everyday earthly limitations . It is the great glory of love that it once in a lifetime pushes back the gates of heaven ; it ought to be the glory . of men and women thereafter to live their plain earthly lives with that memory in their hearts . Most of them try to crowd through these doors ajar and set up housekeeping on the wrong side of the portals . Matrimony is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be used aright . It is a - school of life wherein all may ' attain to the higher education .  | But how ? Here are given such factors for the solution of the problem as to make happiness or peace as a result seem impossible of attainment . Here are conditions which have little of aught save earthliness . And yet from this union of two people , imperfect in the very nature of things , home must come , with its sanctities of love and trust and forgiveness , its ennobling experiences of birth and death , sickness and pain ; its trials of wealth and poverty , its farreaching influences of truth and ' honor , and the service that counts no task too lowly for love 's offering . Who is sufficient for these things ? What wonder that we see shipwreck and havoc and imperfect accomplishment ! But how to make the best of it ? This is a temple made with hands , stone by stone quarried and laid with labor and patience ? perhaps with tears . It is by a recognition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not by wistful expectation , but by the doing of lowly tasks . Suppose two people begin their married life on the plane of sanity and reasonableness . They say ? marriage is not heaven , nor hell : it is our chance to tutor our spirits in the great lessons of the soul , patience , charity , faith , hope . These things are to be learned by accepting life as it is and adjusting ourselves to it . Imperfections must be overlooked , blunders must be forgiven ? aye , and sins ; the man must be man enough to provide , to guard , to shield , to aid . Providing is not all . A full pocket book is a poor substitute for a full heart . He must have a great store of courage and cheerfulness . These two virtues ought to blossom in the home from the man 's planting . The woman must be woman enough to learn in its small details her business as manager and administrator of the home . It is not only behind the age , but , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ages , " to say what is now to be said . She must know how to cook and sew and spend money and care for children . That sentence does not read " must spend money " ? she must know how to spend money . And she must have endless patience with her imperfect husband , her imperfect children , her imperfect self ; patience with the failures and blunders and mistakes and sins of everybody in that home ; the unaggressive patience that does not say , " You are all very trying , and I am behaving like a saint ; " the patience that is a woman 's first and middle and last qualification for a happy married life , the patience that takes even ill health and weakness with a smile , that does not play the martyr , or call attention to the flames on which the family in its ignorance usually pours oil instead of water . Most necessary point of all , these two who are to build a home must have confidence in each other , must say " we , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be shared . The sharing of joy and grief , the mingling of smiles and tears , the bits of humor that wake double laughter and make those trivial " home jokes " which are the signs by which you shall declare a happy family life ? these are all so many ways of strengthening the walls . Everything must be shared . Those four words ought to take the place of the old " God Bless Our Home " motto . Time must be shared , toils must be shared ; play , opportunity , money , anxiety , loss , vigils , prayers ? all these must be not for one , but for both . Take time to share everything , be worthy to share everything , be willing to bear the contact of body , mind and spirit without emphasis on self , and there is no longer any problem to solve . Once more the soul of a woman wears the garment of a man 's dreams ; and a woman sees in her husband no hero perhaps , but an infinitely lovable human being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of tenderness that she bears toward her children , and the tenderness that springs from her deep love and gratitude toward the man who has never failed her need , who has shared her laughter , and dried her tears . The process of growth and change in the married relation are seldom rightly estimated by women . They want everything as it has been . As someone wittily said , " they prefer an embalmed youth to a green maturity . " In this regard a man sees more clearly . He recognizes , sometimes unwillingly , that there comes an evolution of feeling . Those people are happy who take the natural emotional changes as part of the development ; who learn that one relationship has neither swallowed up nor set aside all other relationships , but offers to them a background of content and repose ; who no longer make great emotional demands , but who see with joy that love has grown broad-shouldered and cleareyed , and that the name he bears in the sacred circle of home is content .  |      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
