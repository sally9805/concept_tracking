txt A Wise Cat , Indeed . I have been much interested in the letters published in your paper regarding the ability of animals to reason . All the letters seem to be about dogs . Here is one about a cat : When I was a little girl I had a pet cat named Daisy , and we all considered Daisy a very wise cat . When she was outside and wanted to get in , or when she Was in the house and wanted to be let out , she would stand on her hind legs and rattle the knob of the door with one of her front paws , and if not waited upon very promptly would rattle the knob more vigorously . One day I was reading a very interesting book when Daisy rattled the knob to be let out of the back door , which was often bolted . With my eyes still on my book I tried to open the door , forgetting that it was bolted . I pulled at it impatiently , still reading my book , when Daisy stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bolt , looking up into my face . She had noticed that we often pulled the bolt back before opening the door for her . Of course , I told my parents about it , thinking it very clever of my cat . They could scarcely believe it at first , thinking it a mere chance that she had put her paw on the bolt , so on several occasions they tried her , pretending not to notice that the door was bolted when they wanted to let her out , and she always did the same thing , standing up on her hind legs and placing her paw on the bolt .
