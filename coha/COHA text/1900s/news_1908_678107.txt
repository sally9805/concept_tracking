The Sherman boom came on with more enthusiasm than has been shown over any matter that has come before the convention . vn every hand the question was heard , " What is the Administration going to do ? " or " What does Washington say ? " That was the only thing that held any of the delegates back from definite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once to get into communication with the President and Secretary , and a conference Was called in rooms of Frank H.

The Indications were that the discussion will continue until a very late hour , but the trend was unquestionably toward Sherman . New Yorkers Choose Sherman . Meantime the New York delegation was more than busy . The first thing it did was to hold a caucus and get solidly behind the Sherman candidacy . It was decided that Sherman 's name should be prosented to the convention this morning by State Chairman Woodruff , and that he should have the 78 votes of the Empire State . Gen. Woodford and Seth Low both declared themselves in favor of Sherman , and the united delegation set out to round up all the strength it eould collect . The Sherman boom was helped by a tip which was industriously spread by ex-Congressman Lucius N.

It was the first sureenough spontaneous enthusiasm seen In the convention . While the shouters were hard at this kind of work some of the leaders in the Sherman management were hustling with the delegations from other States and consulting with Frank Hitchcock . Mr. LIttauer , - Sereno Payne , and Representative Bennet called on Hitchcock and put up a strong argument for the support of the Taft forces . They were very confident in the assurances of other States . They claimed the solid delegations from Illinois , Pennsylvania , Michigan , Indiana , Kansas , Oklahoma , Colorado , Vermont , and Texas They declared that they would have more New England support just as soon as Massachusetts had made a little more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was evident , however , that with all ' the enthusiasm the Sherman boom was creating the Administration men were not disposed to commit themselves until they had the straight tip from Washington .
