txt USED THE LOST COLUMN And Found Something That Had n't Been Lost , After All . I beg leave to compliment you on the excellence and efficiency of your Lost and Found Department from my recent experience . Tuesday last , while dressing for dinner . I could not find my seal ring , which ought to haVe been on my dressing table . I looked everywhere for it , in the drawers , on the floor , all around and about , but in vain . I remembered that I had my hands wet in a shower , and it might have slipped off then . Sadly I went and dined , then immediately went and put a lost advertisement in THE TIMES . At midnight I went home , wondering whether I should ever again see my ring , which I have worn for forty years , or not . I went to the drawer again , took out everything piecemeal , and in an old sock ( which had no right to be there ) found my ring . Verb . Sap .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
