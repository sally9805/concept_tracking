yEARS ago I was one of the one hundred and twelve million subjects of the Czar of Russia ? as a matter of fact , little better than a slave . A slave ? Nay , worse than that , a slave of slaves . I was one of the thousands of political exiles that are buried . alive in the arctic deserts of Eastern Siberia . Now I am a free citizen of the United States . What a marvellous transformation Russia and the United States are antipodal . They belong not only to different hemispheres , but to different ages of history , culture , and civilization . Among all the nations of Christendom , Russia alone is governed by an absolute autocrat . The will of one man is the source of all law in Russia . I was suspected by the government of the Czar of being one who wrote to outaids newspapers against the Russian system of managing national affairs . was accused and sentenced to exile in Siberia , ? not by a jury of my peers , not by a regular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judge , but by the personal ukase or order of the Czar Alexander III. ? that is , by the so-called administrative process . It took about a year to bring me to the place of my destination , a quarter of a degree beyond the arctic circle . I escaped after four years of death in life in Siberia . " Does Mr. I , adoff live here ? " asked a suspicious-looking man , entering the house of my parents one evening in August , 1884 . " Yes , sir ; my name is Ladoff , " replied I. " What do you wish ? " The man coughed in obvious embarrassment , and vanished without making an answer . At the same moment a body of armed policemen and gendarmes surrounded the house . Gendarmes stationed themselves at the outer doors of the house , with swords in hands , allowing no one to enter or to go out . Half a dozen other gendarmes escorted theircaptain and the assistants of the city attorney . The appearance of the captain was exceedingly military ? his chest was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and his hair closely trimmed . The features of his handsome face were utterly expressionless and insignificant . His new uniform , and everything else about him , was neat , trim , and dashing . Ho was a typical Don Juan of the streets , and seemed to have just stepped out of the pages of a fashion journal . " Excuse me , my dear sir , " said the captain to me , entering my room . " I have a very disagreeable duty to perform , as I have been ordered by my chief to make you a domiciliary visit . . . . I am sure I shall not find anything politically compromising , but there have been some suspicions directed against you . Will you kindly assist me in my task ? " He smiled as he made this request , and began to search the house . This official visit took me as much by surprise as would a thunderbolt from a clear sky . My old father , suffering at that time from acute pneumonia , summoned up his Lai strength and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the melancholy proceedings made the scene , if possible , more intensely painful . My poor mother lost her self-control entirely , and tried to persuade the captain of the gendarmes of my innocence . The gendarmes rummaged through all the belongings of my parents as well as of myself in the most unfeeling way . They paid especial attention to my books , letters , and papers . The assistant of the city attorney neither helped nor hindered the gendarmes in their work . He walked absent-mindedly through the rooms , as if the whole proceeding was none of his affair . The gendarmes read carefully all my letters and papers and examined all my hooks thoroughly , but found very little compromising or suspicious from a political point of view . At . the conclusion of the visit the captain showed inc the written order of the chief of the gendarmes of the Livland district to arrest me . " You see , " said the captain to me , " I have strict orders , but if you acknowledge your crime , I will leave you unmolested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state 's witness in the case against your former accomplices . Choose for yourself . " I did not hesitate to make a total denial of all the charges preferred against me . My motives were simply these : First , I did not feel any remorse of conscience on account of my relations with the " free press , " and did not want to play the part of hypocrite . Secondly , nothing could induce me to compromise any one politically . Thirdly , I did not put any faith in the assertions and promises of the captain . My preparations were necessarily very short . It was late in the evening when I took leave of my parents and was thrown into the local dungeon . The gendarmes conducted me through a labyrinth of dark , low , narrow , and chilly passages to the so-called " Secret Corridor , " where political offenders are usually incarcerated . The warden took me to a massive iron-clad door . His bunch of rusty keys rattled and clattered dismally as he opened the lock . I stepped into the cell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Once more the bunch of keys rattled and clattered dismally , once more the lock turned ; then the heavy steps of the warden died gradually away , and T was left alone . The deathlike silence of the prison at night ; the deep Egyptian darkness ; the damp , thick , pestilential air surrounding me ; the filthiness of everything I touched in the room ? all reminded me vividly of the grave . It took considerable time to accommodate my eyes to the dark sufficiently to get my bearings . The cell was nine feet long , seven feet wide , and about eleven feet high . But a faint light penetrated it through a little cleft near the ceiling . There was neither bed nor bench ? nothing to lie or sit upon , except the slimy , filthy stone floor , until the warden brought in a bag of straw . The crumbling plaster covering the walls was ornamented with inscriptions , engraved by my unhappy predeceasors . Lightinga match , I proceeded to decipher them . One inscription made a deep impression upon my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You will never regain your freedom . " The next morning two armed gendarmes took me to the railroad depot and placed me in an empty car . They watched me closely all the way . At some stations , where the train stopped an hour or more , they conducted me to separate rooms , where I found telegraphic messages had preceded me , designating me as a " political criminal , " although there was no proof whatever of my guilt . On my arrival at Riga , the metropolis of the Livland district , I was at once brought before the chief of the gendarmes of the district , General Bets . He proved to be a very shrewd but exceedingly polite old gentleman of low stature . He invited me to take a chair , inquired how I had stood the journey , and offered me refreshments ; I politely declined , being anxious to know of what crime I was accused and the general condition of affairs appertaining to my case . The general , eying me closely , sent the gendarmes out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crime . He advised me to plead guilty at once . Said he : " The sailor Mensel , who recently brought you prohibited literature , has been captured , and is here in our local prison . He confessed everything , and told us all about you and your relations to the clandestine press . You see , Mr. Ladoff , there is no use denying facts . We know about your ennnectiona with the London press also . I have sent for Mensel , and expect him here every moment . Take a sheet of paper and write out a full declaration ; otherwise you will only unnecessarily make things worse for yourself . " I accepted the proposition gladly . Now that I knew the actual condition of affairs , my way was clear before me . I wrote down quickly my deposition . I acknowledged everything that had been learned through the Statements of Mensel , but was silent about everything else . The general followed me with great interest , looking over my shoulder as I wrote . Sometimes he interrupted with a question or remark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time he care- Years passed . The general made mc believe that my case would have no serious consequences . The time approached for me to serve as a soldier . I preferred the privileges and advantages of a volunteer to the chances of a common recruit , but my political untrustworthiness was in the way . I consulted the advice of the general , who kindly helped me to evade the law in this instance by his personal intervention . served my few months as a volunteer , and came at last to the conclusion that my " crime " was entirely forgotten or ignored by the high authorities in St. Petersburg . How could I differently explain the four years of perfect silence ? We are so ready to believe what we desire ! I was often assured of my safety by the general as we met on the street at the bathing resorts on the shore of the Baltic . " Do you think I could let you go around free if your case were considered a grave one by the authorities ? " said he , time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sincere , or whether he deceived me intentionally , but he treated me so well that I believed I was safe . In May , 1886 , I married and was happy . One cold January day I came later than usual from the chemical laboratory where I worked . Before I was through with my supper , a police officer rang the bell , came in , and invited me to appear before the local chief of police . Since 1 had complained to the chief of police a few days before on account of some trouble caused us by our landlord , I went , thinking this was the reason of the summons . My wife was nevertheless troubled by a vague presentiment of threatening disaster . The officer led me up a narrow , steep , and dark staircase to the dingy and filthy office of the police , located in the old City Hall . The scantily furnished room was full of supplicants , patiently awaiting the arrival of the chief . I asked a lean and elderly Pole , acting as secretary of the police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will find it out early enough , " he replied , dryly , not deigning mc even a look . Soon I was called into the private office of the police master . Without any preliminaries the latter read to me an official paper , the contents of which , in spite of my best endeavors , I could not grasp in their full meaning . I understood , however , that by personal ukase of the Czar I had been arrested and was to be sent into exile to Siberia . In my despair I could only ask the officer to let my wife know about my fate . This was promised ; I was taken down into the basement , where the dungeon was located . After the usual questions as to my name , age , standing , business , religion , and so on , I was searched , and everything found on me , among them my wedding-ring and watch , was taken . I will not relate how I spent the rest of that day and night . The next morning I was called to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What a meeting was that ! She was soon to give birth to our first and only child , The thought that she would be left alone and that I would perhaps never see my child was too much for her shattered nerves . She fainted . The captain of the " Atape " soldiers gave his command , and the party of prisoners to which I belonged was surrounded . We were counted and marched to the railroad station . There we were counted once more and placed in special cars . The thick iron bars in the windows , the armed sentinels in the ear , the seemingly homogeneous gray mass of my fellow travellers ? everything reminded me that I was a prisoner . I said " the seemingly homogeneous . " On the contrary , after a short period of careful observation the prisoners proved to be a rather mottled body of people , belonging to different nationalities , different classes , and different occupations . Beside a gray veteran of the great army of professional criminals , who had spent nearly all his life in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consisted in not having rendered his passport in due time . A little farther I noticed a degraded Polish nobleman , a picturesque Caucasian , a Tartar in his Oriental garb , a Polish Jew , a gipsy , and some individuals of doubtful extraction . They did not seem to be at all distressed by their fate . The force of habit and the change from the dead monotony of everyday prison life to the comparatively more diversified life of travel were the causes of their high spirits , They conversed constantly with each other , cracked jokes , and behaved themselves very much like ordinary travellers of the lower class of people . Only the ugly prison garments and the chains that fastened their hands and feet reminded me of their real conditions . The prisoners did not carry any food , and from the start had to buy bread and herrings from the soldiers that guarded them , which they ate with the appetite of wolves . In spite of the strict prohibition , brandy was smuggled into the wagons by some of the guards , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prison . Our real pilgrimage , our weary march of two thousand miles , began at one of the ancient cities ? Tomsk . Happily itwas spring ? reviving spring in the virgin Siberian forest , or " taiga . " The green meadows and blooming bushes , the transparent , quietly flowing waters of the mighty rivers , the halsamlike air , and the clear skies , all had the effect of making the plodding journey bearable nay , sometimes even pleasant . One thing was undeniably tiresome ? the little " mothka , " or gray marsh-fly , which filled the air in myriads , and attacked both man and beast in a most bloodthirsty way . The pest of higher latitudes , the mosquito , is by far preferable . The train of prisoners formed a dreary contrast to surrounding nature : on the one hand the azure of the sky , the emerald green of the vegetable world , the harmoniously variegated mosaic of the flowers , the silvery springs and brooks ; on the other , the ugly , shapeless , gray capuches and clanking chains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deeply degraded , physically and morally crippled by unjust and unnatural conditions of life . The men marched in front of the train in an irregular crowd , raising clouds of dust , with their rude slippers and long capuches . Behind them followed rude wagons , crowded with the children and women of the party . The children and the women ! More miserable beings than these poor creatures the vivid fancy of a Dante Alighieri could hardly create . The wagons loaded with the baggage of the prisoners closed the train . An armed body of soldiers surrounded all . The train reminded me sometimes of a funeral procession . It moved very slowly , and very often stopped altogether , because of the irregular motion of the different parts of the train . Sometimes the cause was of a more serious nature , as the death of a sick child . The unhappy mothers expressed their grief by loud crying , while the men bore their affliction in morbid silence . The rest of the company showed no sympathy whatever . They were too much used to such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to average eighteen miles a day , walking two days in succession and resting the third . I might describe a typical scene , which repeated itself nearly every second day with trifling variations . At the end of each day 's travel we stopped at the improvised barracks called " ( Rapes . " These barracks are built all along the great Siberian road , usually at the farther end of a village , and surrounded by a wooden wall forming a yard . The captain in charge of the ( tape and his soldiers had their quarters in one of the buildings . As the party approached the &tape,; it was divided into rows , containing an equal number of prisoners , and counted . When the last row was finished and nobody found missing , the gates of the yard were opened and the prisoners rushed forward , ? pushing each other violently each trying to get ahead of the rest , some trampling their fellow sufferers under their feet , all acting as if the salvation of their souls depended upon their speedy entrance into the prison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of room in the &ape; and buildings . Every one was bent on securing for himself the iiIR primes occupandi to one of the benches of the barracks . Woe to him who came too late , or had the misfortune to fall under the feet of the surging crowd 1 My journey from Irkutsk , aid Jakutsk and Verehojansk , to middle Nolyinsk , the place of ray final destination , was accomplished on reindeers and dogs , and lasted about three months . My life in exile in " Darkest Siberia , " a quarter of a degree beyond the arctic circle , may serve as a subject of a separate paper . After four and a half years of " death in life " in the arctic wilderness of the least populated and most distant part . of Eastern Siberia , I left Russia for good . On my escape in 1891 from exile in the remotest part of arctic Siberia , and while on . my way to the United States , I crossed clandestinely the Russo-Prussian frontier with a party of fugitive Poles , Jews , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ? the Czar . I met the party on a bright August morning in the small town of Skudy in the province Minsk . The outward appearance of the exiles bore witness to their past sufferings , especially that of the women and children ; but they were full of hope : it could be read in their pale and haggard faces , which seemed to me to express at the same time feelings of sadness and of joy , to mingle tears and smiles . VOL . Cx. - 15o. 659 ? 95 In the crowd of small burghers , traders , and working-men I found three belonging to the higher class , , so far as I could judge by their clothing and manners , and 1 hastened to make their acquaintance . One of them was the professor of natural science in the Riga high school ( or gymnasium , as it is called in Russia ) ; another , a Polish nobleman and landowner in the Witebsk government ; the third , a contractor of Jewish extraction . They seemed at first glance to be so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have been born and reared in the same country . The German professor was of medium stature . His rosy-cheeked round face and bright blue eyes were in peculiar contrast with his short gray hair . The Pole was tall , and his pale physiognomy showed the traits peculiar to the descendants of old families . His grey eyes and almost colorless lips were witnesses to a life of privation , suffering , and strife . The contractor was a tall old man , with his back slightly bent . His open and fine features , peculiar to Oriental princes , and his deep , dark , exceedingly sad eyes could not fail to make a striking impression . I joined the party at a small inn ? a dirty , noisy place , full of people of questionable appearance and of all kinds . and all the other emigrants were besieged with propositions from local " agents " " to lead us across the frontier safely . " These smugglers paid especial attention to the professor , the landowner , the contractor , and myself , for obvious reasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but we wisely preferred to make our escape with the whole party . The competition between the- local smugglers was so strong that they quarrelled among themselves , the quarrel resulting at last in hand-tohand fighting , . The bargaining of the agents with the party of emigrants lasted a whole day . The amount of money each emigrant had to pay to the smugglers for their services varied according to the ' number of the members of his family and the quantity of his baggage , but did not exceed five rubles ( about three dollars ) . At nine o'clock in the morning the luggage of the party was put upon the wagons and we left for the last village on the frontier ? Krettingen . We moved op very slowly , as if by stealth , through the barren country . In Krettingen we found another party of emigrants , that came on the previous day , but for some unknown reason could not pass the frontier the same night . Late . in the evening of the next day about one hundred and fifty emigrants left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not unlike a funeral procession . The smugglers seemed to grow more and more restless as we approached the frontier . Horsemen came and went in the darkness of the night , bringing or taking messages . The sky was overcast , and it began to rain as we reached the last Russian settlement . The smugglers disappeared , leaving their wards in charge of a Lithuanian peasant , who acted as a guide . He was a robust young fellow , with a rich crown of fisixy , unkempt hair on his round head , was clad in a gray , broad cloak , and was barefooted . The guide ordered the party to proceed in a regular column , the men ahead , the women next , the children behind . We marched en alternately over marshes , across ditches , and through underbrush , over roads that had been washed by the rain . The clayey soil formed a slippery , sticky mass , clinging to the feet , and making progress a difficult task for the weary and excited travellers . The children , on the arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was impossible to quiet them . In spite of all the endeavors of the wretched women , the shrill cry of the wretched babes sounded in the dead silence of the night . The guide marched in the first line and tried to keep the party in military order , but in vain . Each constantly attempted to break from the line and get ahead of his fellow travellers , as if pursued by some evil spirit . The guide unceremoniously struck the too impatient refugees with his mighty fists , but it restrained them only for a moment . The fugitives kept running ahead of each other like a confused flock of sheep , as if their lives depended on gaining a few more steps . The tracks being narrow and hardly passable for five persons abreast , the mad throng assumed the aspect of a struggle for life . The violence seemedhardly to be noticed by the fugitives , whose minds seemed altogether absorbed by one fixed idea ? to gain as quickly as possible the coveted frontier and be beyond the reach of the Russian guard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped and laid ourselves Oat on the muddy soil . The guide kicked down those of the party that , in their unreasoning torpor , did not at once realize the full meaning of his command . In a moment all was quiet . Even the children and babes seemed to instinctively feel that danger was at hand , and were quiet for a moment . The sound of a horse 's hoofs was distinctly heard , and soon a mounted sergeant of the Russian guard of the frontier appeared like a ghost on the scene . " Good evening , fellows ! " greeted the soldier , good-naturedly , and rode forward , paying no further attention to the refugees . He was obviously used to such encounters and preferred not to meddle in them . Was he paid by the smugglers , or was he too humane to attack unfortunate , unarmed fugitives ? There was no time to solve such problems , and we marched on with renewed and vigorous energy . We were only a few steps from the frontier . The Prussian Krettingen was already dimly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moment we prepared to take the last steps on the soil of the Czar , a thundering " Halt , you fellows , or I shall shoot ! " made us arrest our steps . Before us was standing , as if sprung miraculously from the soil , a soldier from the Russian guard , holding a short rifle and ready to fire , To describe our feelings is almost impossible . We were petrified with despair . The guard alone preserved some presence of mind , as was shown by an attempt to run away . But the officer caught him by the collar . " How much were yen paid ? Tell me quick and do not lie about it . " " God forbid ! " muttered the guide , well-nigh frightened to death ; " only three rubl . " And he crossed himself in testimony of the truthfulness of his assertion . The soldier pushed him away contemptuously , and the peasant took to his heels , heeded by no one . " Each of you , you cursed ? , has to pay me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summon the guards , " said the soldier , still keeping the gun in readiness . The money was collected rapidly and handed to him . The sight of the heap of greasy paper money only increased the greediness of the faithful servant of the Czar . He asked for a collection of double the amount he had already received . This time the collection went on much more slowly . The emigrants were poor , and many a ruble was borrowed from a richer fellow sufferer in order to escape the clutches of the guard . After placing the money in his capacious pocket , the villain made preparation to shoot and alarm the rest of the guards . A woman with a baby on her arm , standing near , noticed it first . She fell on her knees , and covering the hands of the Roldier with kisses and tears , asked him piteously : " Little Father , do not do it ! Have mercy ! Look at me ! Look at the baby ! We are harmless , unfortunate people ! " The guard pushed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surrounded by an armed force and driven back like cattle . Overnight we were placed in a barn . There was no place to sleep , none even to sit down ; we had no protection from the cold , no protection from the rain that incessantly fell . The next morning I was called before the chief of the guard . I appeared in his office covered with mud , as unkempt and dirty as a savage . The officer excused himself politely . " I am sorry the boys treated you as the rest , " he said . " I did not know anything about the affair until now . The fools did not wake me up in the night . How did you get into this somewhat mixed society ? " I tried to explain my illegal way of crossing the frontier by business motives , and stated briefly the proceedings of the foregoing night , denouncing the conduct of his subordinate who took bribery . " The soldier can not be punished for taking the bribe , " replied the officer . " According to our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he only does his duty in spite of it , and he did so . You know , " he added , " we soldiers do not make the laws ; we obey them even if we do not approve . " The party was sent to Xrettingen . The Polish nobleman , the professor , thecontractor , and myself were sent separately from the rest and quartered in a clean room connected with the local police station . We had clean beds , plenty of air , and good food . We enjoyed even the privilege of a walk in the company of a good-natured policeman . The other emigrants were locked up with common criminals in the filthy , dark , and cold local jail until the return of the chief of police from his vacation . The reason why my friends and I were treated so leniently was explained by the talkative police clerk . He said that we were supposed to be officers of the government , sent to investigate the condition of affairs on the frontier . It was not to our interest to deny it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elerk was in the confidence of the chief of police , and at the same time our friend . He told us all about his chief and his talk with him about us . The worthy chief was perfectly willing to send the crowd of emigrants away after having taken from them as much money as possible , but he had some doubts about inc and my friends . The greed for money , however , overweighed all other considerations ; the chief took our bribes and let us go free . The other emigrants , robbed of their last copeck , wretched and discouraged , dispersed in different directions . Very few of them had the courage and means to once more try their luck in crossing the frontier . Most of them tramped home with their destitute , sick wives and children , to their cold hearths , living during their journey on the contributions of charitable people . The professor , the Polish nobleman , the contractor , and I managed to bribe the commander of the custom-house and pass the frontier unmolested , lifting the iron chains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was my first and last bribe . It was a strange feeling that overwhelmed me when I first stepped upon foreign soil . Nobody asked my name , age , religion , business , passport , or anything else . No policeman , gendarme , or other officer took notice of me . Behind me was Russia , with her corrupt and tyrannical government , with her prisons and her Siberia . Before me was the beautiful free world .
