WITH all our boasted intricacy of machinery , and our study and mastery of craftsmanship , we have been unable to produce rugs that are at all comparable with those made in the orient . It is true we are turning out artistic machine-me de floor coverings of a high degree of excellence ; but when we endeavor to make with our machines rugs like the hand-woven ones from Persia , Turkey , southern Russia , the western frontier of China , India , Turkestan and Arabia , the result stands in the same relation to the eastern article as does a paste diamond to the true gem . At the very beginning the oriental has the advantage of us in that the wool of his rug is superior to what can be obtained in western countries . The sheep of the east have a peculiar silkiness , fineness , and length of wool not to be found elsewhere . In certain parts of Persia the wool is of a dazzling white , to which is due the effectiveness of the white designs in rugs from certain sections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characteristic feature of the rug called the Kirman , after the province or city of that name . Rugs commonly bear the . name of the city or province in which they are made . In some parts of the east there are sheep of a rich brown color and of a glossy black . Their wool , in its natural state , forms striking and pleasing effects , especially in outline designs . Besides this superior quality of wool , the oriental has the advantage of us in dyes . With marvelous patience has he studied , brooded over and experimented with colors extracted from vegetables , until he has obtained wonderful hues which time only mellows . We depend upon aniline dyes that fade and corrode  | the wool , while a rug thus colored will be ruined if wet , for the colors " run . " In antique oriental rugs we behold tints that sometimes seem opalescent , while others glow with a beauty that reminds one of twelfth century glass . We stand some distance from an antique rug and study it in an effective light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combinations of colors and delicate grada- tions that stamp upon the fabric the individuality of the worker . We recognize that inspiration and the secret of blending are here combined to do what no methodical machine can be hoped to accomplish . The oriental weaver possesses a dexterity that has been handed down through many generations . Some- times the secret of how a certain tint has been produced has been lost with the extinction of the family that possessed it . Not only this wool of fine quality and this mastery of color and design , but the patience that enables a weaver to spend from two to several years on one rug , tying by hand every bit of wool into the woof , sometimes putting two hundred of these knots to the square inch , and the fact that sentiment and religion enter deeply into the task , make the oriental rug superior to those from other countries . Oriental rugs are made for divers  | purposes , and the special use of each may be instantly known by the pattern and size . The prayer rug has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at one end of the rug , sometimes at both ends . The rug must be laid down so that the apex points in the direction of the holy city of Mecca . Then the owner of the rug kneels upon it , bends over so that he may place his forehead on the apex , and thus he prays . When the prayer is finished , the rug is rolled up and put carefully away . The hearth rug is spread out before the fire when a guest is to be entertained or when some celebration of special significance in the family is to take place . A somewhat gruesome affair is the burial rug , woven of somber tints , to express grief ; but there are also bright colors introduced to show belief in resurrection . Each member of the family , even to the very little child , ties knots in this burial rug which will be used to carry the dead to the grave . Long narrow rugs , from two and a half to four feet wide and from ten to eighteen feet long , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in every room of an eastern house . In Europe and America these are sold for hall or stair and are called " runners . " Any rug eight by ten feet or larger is properly a carpet . Mats are the small rugs commonly placed on the floor in front of a door . The saddle bags from the east , made in the same manner as rugs , we use for sofa pillow covers . Then there are rugs made purposely for hangings and called " khilims . " The secret of the orientals ' success in rug making has been their patience , with no thought of time , an inherited love for their work , and that same art sense which makes the painter of pictures or the sculptor linger over his creation .  | Unfortunately , the western demand has become so great that the quality of the work from oriental rug making centers has deteriorated . Feverish haste , the result of American commercialism , has permeated even the almost inaccessible mountain regions of the east , and , unless something is done to impress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what this deterioration means , the oriental art of rug making will soon be lost . Therefore it behooves us to cherish the oriental rugs now in our possession . The antiques are rapidly growing more valuable and more scarce , and the moderns can not now be purchased with entire certainty that years will add to their value and luster . The wily dealer may assure you that the rug he is offering you and that is silky in texture and pleasing in tint , is made by the old method ; but it is well to rub it over with a wet cloth . If the colors stain the cloth then you may be sure the wool is aniline dyed , and that in four or five years you will have not a rug , but a rag ! At least seventy-five per cent of the moderately-priced oriental rugs of to-day are so colored . Twenty years ago one could buy a genuine antique woolen rug for twenty-five or thirty dollars ; but a rug offered at so low a price to-day should be regarded with suspicion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the surface is freshly dyed . This is easily detected by separating the pile and looking down close to the woof ; for when a rug is properly dyed , tuft by tuft , before weaving , the color is , of course , uniform throughout the tuft . Rugs from Persia may still be depended upon to a considerable extent , for the government has a way of punishing the dyer who has succumbed to the temptation of using aniline dyes instead of the more expensive vegetable ones by chopping off his right hand . If the western purchasers were more intelligent in their buying it would put a stop to the making of inferior rugs ; but , unfortunately , a large class of people who can afford to buy rugs are as  | ignorant as the woman who said , as she looked complacently at her drawing room floor on which lay a dozen oriental rugs of loose weave , and proclaiming loudly their harsh aniline dyes : " Turkish rugs are so stylish , and the more you have the more fashionable you are . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightest compunction , put silk rugs on the floor instead of on the wall or over divans , where they belong . One of the evidences of the present careless workmanship is the lax weaving . The knots are less compact , there are fewer to the square inch than there should be . One can test a rug by spreading it out flat and then pulling it up in the center . If it will " stand  | alone , " just as a piece of good silk will , then it is compactly woven and will wear well . In antique rugs it is fairly easy to tell from what country or even province or city they came ; but now , races are intermingling , religions are impressing one another , dealers are carrying rugs and ideas from country to country , so that it is no longer always possible to be sure where a rug is made , either from the pattern or the material used . Not only the wool , but the woof , used to give testimony . In some sections it was always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or of both hemp and wool . Sometimes a rug could be " placed " because of the finding of silk in the woof . Now it is often only the connoisseur who is able to detect some obscure peculiarity yet characteristic of a certain region and can thus accurately state where the rug was made ; and there are many rugs that puzzle even an expert judge . Dealers sometimes misrepresent the age of antique rugs , stating that they are a hundred or even two hundred years old , when really it is difficult to obtain a rug made a hundred years ago . One fifty years old may be considered an antique . The western dealer is not always to blame for this misrepresentation , for the native eastern dealer , from whom he got his information , is nearly always a glib and accomplished liar . There is a popular idea that an oriental rug will never wear out and that the harder it is used the silkier it will grow . But the fact is it must be cared for as tenderly as a piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its beauty enhanced by age . It must be guarded against the attacks of moths and other insects , and there are various ways of doing this . It is better to leave rugs on the floor all through the summer , cleaning them often , and frequently exposing them to the sunlight . But if the house is to be closed for any length of time there must be one of the several excellent means employed to preserve the rugs from insect attacks . One very good method is to wrap up pieces of camphor gum in tissue paper and scatter them over the rugs , that are then piled one above another with several layers of newspaper wrapped about each rug . Another way is to put the rugs in a closet with an uncorked quart bottle of chloroform , and , closing the door , stuff paper into the keyhole and cracks to make the closet air-tight . When they are to be removed from the closet , the windows in the room should first be opened . A foolish , because dangerous , practice is to cover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has caused damaging fires and loss of life . A rug should never be hung over a clothesline ; for , being exceedingly heavy , its own weight , if it is suspended im properly , will break the cords here and there in the woof , letting the knots slip and spread apart . It is very important that the long cord , forming the selvedge , does not break . If it does , the weft ( threads that run crosswise ) spreads , and the rug becomes so crooked that it will not lie smoothly upon the floor ; and often a three-cornered piece has to be cut out and the cut edges sewn together . This , of course , damages the appearance of the rug very much . Sometimes , even if the cords have not broken , they will stretch until the rug is very crooked . In this ease it may be restored to its original shape by turning it wrong side up , tacking it down in the proper shape , and , after thoroughly wetting it , leaving it fastened down until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obvious that only a practiced hand can safely do this , and also , if it is aniline-dyed , that the colors will run and the rug be ruined . The proper way to clean a rug is to turn it upside down on the grass or snow if possible , and if not , then on a clean floor , and gently beat it . Then turn it right side up , spread it out ' flat , and with a not too stiff broom , sweep it from side to side , across the nap . After the dust is well out , dampen a clean white cloth in water to which a little alcohol has been added , and wipe over the entire rug in the direction in which the nap lies . The illustrations accompanying this article are reproduced from photographs of rugs belonging to the collection of Mrs Allison L. Pease of Hartford , Connecticut . Mrs Pease has had the good taste to avoid buying rugs that have been " improved . " Hers are exactly as they came from the hands of the weavers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be appreciated . Their silky luster and wonderful colors are lost in the black and white reproductions . These are , however , far more satisfactory than colored illustrations , which give very erroneous ideas of the  | soft , mellow tints of a vegetable-dyed rug . The large Bergamo ( see illustration ) is an exceedingly choice rug of its sort , and although five feet seven inches by seven feet in size , it is a prayer rug , a " double prayer rug , " for there is an apex at either end . Bergamo is the , capital of Anatolia , and the difference between a Bergamo and an Anatolian rug is simply that the city-made one has its pile trimmed closer to the woof . In this Bergamo the design shows well the symbolism belonging to that part of Turkey . The stars scattered throughout it stand for hope ; and the hexagonal figures represent the sun , about which these people have many strange beliefs . In the center are curious figures meant for the scales of Justice . The little three-cornered designs represent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Such a piece of paper is pinned upon the sleeve and kept there until the prayer is answered . Thus each figure in the rug has its significance . In many rugs , especially Persian and Indian , is found the lotus flower , that sacred emblem of the east . Another pattern , called by some the pear , by others the palm leaf , is frequently seen , and there are various legends in connection with it , the most interesting being that the pattern represents a pool of clear water , upon which the traveler in the desert suddenly comes when perhaps well-nigh crazed with thirst . This pool begins in a tiny stream , springing up  | from the ground and running a short distance in a narrow rivulet , then spreading out into a round pool . The pattern is popular with Persian rug weavers . Among these illustrations , the choicest Turkish rug shown is the Bokhara . The knots in this are compact and the pile is trimmed very closely , as in all Bokharas . Some years ago the pattern most common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scattered at regular intervals over a rich dark red ground . But that pattern is not coming to us any more , and it is well for those who have rugs in which it is woven to cherish them , for it is not likely that they can ever be replaced and they are constantly increasing in value . Beware of what is known as a " brown Bokhara " , ; for these are quite likely to be " doctored " rugs . Many people buy them , fancying they are showing great refinement of taste to choose these dull-colored rugs , and the dealers laugh in their sleeves . There are those so ignorant of what constitutes the value of a rug , and so oblivious to the wonder of the glowing colors , that they actually have rare antiques of exquisite color dyed to match the furnishings of their rooms . And others are so wicked as to have priceless antiques cut up for mantel draperies and furniture upholstery . Others will have so many rugs about , of all sorts and tints , that there is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is well to buy one high-priced rug rather than to invest the same amount of money iii several cheap rugs , and then one should give it the same advantages that are accorded a choice painting : considerate handling , a careful study of its harmonious relationship to its surroundings , and above all , its proper placing , either on the wall , the floor , as a portiere , or a  | divan cover , with great regard as to how the light falls upon it . But to return to the Bokhara here illustrated : it will be observed that it has not the familiar hexagonal figure . The design is most unusual , and the colors so dark that they do not photograph well . Besides the deep wine color , characteristic of Bokharas , it has exquisite shades of rose pink , deep blue , and a little white and yellow . Sometimes one finds a Bokhara with a blue instead of a red background . If it is a " real blue " ? that is , not a faded , dyed rug ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One can easily be deceived in regard to blue Bokharas . Mrs Pease has some interesting Russian rugs . Among them is a fragment of an antique Soumak , only a section of a " runner " ; but the tints in it are beyond description . Nor is it easy to analyze these colors on close inspection even . They are curiously interblended and remind one of nothing so much as the play of colors in an opal . The Russian rugs known as the Kazak are always brilliant in color and bold in design ; for the people that make them are a wild , restless , roving tribe . This is also true of the rugs made by the Yuruks , mountaineers in southern Russia . Both sorts of rugs are splendidly barbaric . In Mrs Pease 's collection there is a Yuruk that is exceptional because its colors are light instead of , the usual dark tints employed . The queer , sprawling figure on the Kazak in the illustration is supposed to represent a tarantula , a favorite design among the Kazaks . It is difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show deterioration in weave and dye . They are always rather loosely woven , however , and the pile is long and shaggy . They have a wonderful softness . The half of the Shirvan , Persian , here illustrated has some very beautiful borders , the narrow external one being specially commented upon by connoisseurs because of its marvel of fine workmanship . This rug has a background of rich blue , and the figures are in delicate tints , exquisite old rose , pale yellow , and so on . The knots are compact and the pile very closely trimmed . In certain lights one can liken this Shirvan only to a sapphire . If one is sure he is getting a vegetable-dyed rug , a Shirvan is an excellent investment . It is often a rich blue in background . A Sehna rug nearly always displays quantities of tiny figures and it has many knots to the square inch , sometimes as many as two hundred . The one in the illustration is rather light in tone , having a great deal of white and light red in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes of Persian rugs , that is , woolen rugs . And , by the way , only woolen rugs have been written on in this article , because the silk rug is hardly fit for a floor covering and is so high priced as to be beyond the means of people in moderate circumstances . Reliable woolen rugs may be purohase ? d for as little as fifty dollars ; but it is well not to buy a very large rug for that price . Of course a Sehna or Kirman or other choice weaves , may be worth several hundred or even over a thousand dollars . The Kirman in the illustration is veiy beautiful and an exceedingly choice rug . It hangs on the wall and is a picture to delight the colorist . Would that the velvety softness of its closely clipped pile , its fineness of texture , its radiant flowers and birds , might be reproduced ! Its center is a great medallion , deep ivory in tone , and interwoven are lotus flowers in various and exquisite shades of pink . The whole rug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in entirety reminds one of those wonderful creations of the jeweler , where sapphires , rubies , topazes and pearls are held in a mesh of filigree gold . In strong contrast to this rich Persian splendor is the severely plain Chinese rug of white and blue , its border showing the Greek influence . The rug is properly a carpet . In texture and color it is a delight . All of the rugs illustrated are antiques , and some of them undoubtedly have romantic histories . Away back into the very dawn of civilization stretch the traditions of wondrous rugs . To-day we read glowing descriptions of those that delighted the heart of man a thousand years ago . An oriental rug , " made beautiful by age , " seems to bring us closely in touch with the personality of that woman ? the weavers , as well as the designers , are almost always women ? whose mind , filled with poetic feeling , directed her hands in the creation of the beautiful work ; those skillful , patient hands that so long ago were folded over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
