txt The morning Session in the Senate passed in a debate I ' on the Philippine reciprocity clauses Of I ' the Tariff bill and in the rejection by large , C. : ; : ireie-e of amendments offered by insurgents . In behalf of the committee , however , Senator Smoot broughtt in a redraft of the Philippine provisions containing several modifications of the original Senate proposition . About the only change In the new Clause of any importance is the imposition on articles imported into the Philippines from foreign countries of the Philippine internal tax in addition to the import duty . Articles from the i ? nited States subject to a Philippine internal tax pay that tax instead of the American levy , and the proposed change will provide that American articles subject to any internal tax shall still retain the full benefit of free trade with the islands . Senator Bristow fought to do away with the proviso fixing the ' duty on foreign sugar coming into the islands at the same rate charged on sugar coming into this country . Senator Aldrich and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though Mr. Lodge admitted that it was merely a compromise . In reply to the charge made by Senator Bristow that the free importation of Philippine sugar would have the simple effect of giving the Trust a cheaper raw product Mr. Aldrich replied that the full advantage would go either directly to the insular farmers or to middlemen , as the price is , fixed by Hamburg and Would not vary in any effort to get the Philippine article at reduced prices . Senator Clapp took the view that the admission of free sugar would benefit the American Sugar Refining Company . When , he said , the time comes to vote for free hides it will not be argued that it is to benefit the cattle raisers of the Argentine Republic or any one else except the American purchaser . The two cases , he said , were similar . " It is well understood and an open secret that this proposition is here at the request of the President of the United States , " said Mr. Aldrich , " and that he desires it for a people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I am glad to hear that , " Interposed Mr. Clapp , in a tone of doubt . " I think the Senator from Minnesota knew that before I said it , " retorted the Rhode Island Senator . If the , President 's wishes were so carefully regarded , Mr. Clapp said . the Committee on Finance should have considered his words favoring lower tariff duties . So far as he knew , the Senate had had no direct communication from the President . " This is simply ahother instance of the bunco game that is being played upon the Filipino people in the course of our benevolent policy of assimilation , " declared Senator Stone , after declaring that the committee amendment would at once deprive the Filipino of the right to purchase refined sugar in the world 's market without the payment of a duty . The Finance Committee at last came to a practical agreement to-day in regard to wood pulp and print paper . Wood pulp , which was under a duty of $1.66 2-3 a ton in the House bill , is put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduced from the first Senate amendment , carrying a tax of $6 to $5 . The House tax on print paper is $4 , and it is thought that the Senate may consent in conference to take off the added dollar in. view of the removal of the duty on pulp .
