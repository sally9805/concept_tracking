txt The behavior of the bond market during the past week was by far the most interesting development not merely of that week but of the entire year in the domain of finance . It would appear that some , at least , of the " undigested securities " which have for the past two years been a source of discomfort are being distributed . The total transactions in Government , railway , and miscellaneous bonds on the New York Stock Exchange during the past week reached a total of $29,080,900 , par value , being an average of nearly $6,000,000 a day for the five-day market . How this compares with the previous week and with the corresponding week in the last three years may be seen from the following table : deleted table After a period of depression in trade and in the securities markets there is no weather sign which experienced observers study more attentively or with a deeper interest than the buying of bonds and the tendency of bond-market prices . The range of quotations during the past week has carried Many leading railroad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Compared with 1903 , prices are in the majority of cases somewhat I higher . These phenomena are , of course , not conclusive as to the immediate or the more distant future . They are signifieant , however . They indicate a re-turn of confidence and a resumption of investment buying . Something over two years ago invest-ors stopped buying bonds . Since that time neither bonds nor shares have had a good market . Stock Exchange shares indeed have been the mere plaything of the traders of the Street ; the public has pretty much let them alone . But the present bond buying indicates a changed sentiment . As a season of depression approaches its close , when money has accumulated in the hands of investors -- as it does in the hands of many investors accumulate , even in the worst times and when little by little confidence has been regained , the first stir is observed , in the buying of gilt-edged bonds . As the demand forces up the price of these securities the market broadens to include a somewhat lower grade , and so on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The next thing to bu looked for usually is , as rising bond quotations reduce the annual return on the investment , a shifting of the demand to the share market . By that time the Street knows that the public is " back , " and everybody rejoices in the return of " good times . " London is still skeptical about the return of business activity in the United States . There are two theories here . It Is insisted on the one hand that the tremendous losses due to over-speculation which culminated in 1901 and in the painful liquidation of 1902 must be recouped before the public will have any money to invest in securities . This class of theorists defers the return of good times to next Year , or possibly later , when another great crop shall have added to the National wealth . There seem to be doubts whether the crop of the present year is sufficient to bring about anything resembling a " The other class of theorists is fond of pointing out that . the ' losses of 1901-02 were largely paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that a restoration of confidence , not an accumulation of cash , will be the condition of revived interest in securities . So far as the Street plungers are concerned this theory may be true , but notoriously the general public throughout the country , the public which includes persons of the most moderate means , did lose actual money , in the aggregate a. great many millions of actual money , partly through unfortunate investment , but largely through pure bucket-shop and Stock Exchange* gambling in the boom days and the ensuing black days . Whether the public is or is not about to return to the " Street " is not a matter of so much consequence as the visible signs of some improvement in general business . Notwithstanding a few discouraging decreases in net railroad earnings reported during the past week , the August tendency of the leading railroads is in the direction of improvement , and bank clearings in the country for the month of August show an increase for the first time since June , 1903.          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
