txt Every morning from a little room of a great white house on the eastern shore of the Nile , at Assouan , is clicked by telegraph to Cairo the question , " How much water ? " The answer comes , so many thousand gallons more , or so many thousand gallons less .. A button is pressed , the water which flows under the iron bridge at Cairo is increased or diminished some ten days later in accordance with the telegraphic answer , and the intervening valley between Assouan and Cairo has a little more or a little less water on Its surface . The man at the button may bring joy or sorrow to thousands of little farms  --  It is all according to the message he receives . From the great white house there tends across the river a granite wall or dam 150 feet high . Half way up this wall , and stretching its entire length , a line of shutters opens or closes by a pressure of the button : In the Winter months a huge lake expands to the southward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for , in certain places , the tops of palm trees are discernible above its surface , and the summits of inundated ruins apparently mark the sites of sunken cities . As the days go by , and Cairo demands more and more water , the palm trees and the ruins seem to rise from their watery beds , ... until , in June and early July , the river flows freely with all its historic indolence . Still the cry for water is insatiable , and now the 150 feet of granite wall will be lengthened by 23 feet , which will double the power of the man at the button , and after that no more palms or ruins will unfold themselves , as the hot months come , from the surface of the lake . The palm trees will not be missed , but what of the ruins ? That is the tribute ' of the past which modern agricultural Egypt is called upon to pay . Just south of the granite wall is the island which holds the amphibious ruins . Twenty-three feet of granite now stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is the burial place of Osnas . A temple of fourteen columns rises on its eastern bank , and on its western is the great Temple of Isle , beI grin by PT0LIDIAZ PECILADELPHIIS and I added to by the Roman Emperors . Its front is in the form of a. propylon , be-. fore which Is an expansive court bound , ed by two galleries , the column sides of which'skirt the shore for 250 feet . Be- ' - hindthe propylon are many halls and chambers of curious and fantastic ? da &law*; Rt the Wm ? ter months have already begun their work . Floors have sunken , columns fallen , and walls crumbled . The twenty-three additional feet of granite will complete the work of devastation . Philae and its ruins will never again feel the sun of Egypt . It was thought that the granite wall across the Nile at Assouan , 150 feet high , would provide perpetual irrigation for the desert to the north . That was a mistake . But will the twenty-three additional feet to the summit of the wall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work ? Will the man at the button in the great white house ever have the power that . TosEPH had to direct , increase , or diminish tee flow of the river ? JOSEPH had no Assouan dam , and no shutters to manipulate by the pressure of a , button . In what , therefore , did his power to make Egypt perennially fertile consist ?
