Lucas ( London Methuen &; Co , New York G. P. Putnam 's Sons ) Certainly , if such republication be ever justified , it should be so in the case of Lamb , everything from whose pen has some flavor of his quaintness and whimsicality . While the present edition includes all his work previously published , the editor has spared no pains in tracking his author ( often by scent rather than by sight ) through files of forgotten journals and other dust-heaps of literature , and has perhaps given even more labor to the elucidation of obscure allusions to persons and happenings of the time , embodying the results of these researches in a mass of notes . The inclusion of Mary Lamb 's writings gives this edition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acceptable adornment of these handsome volumes . With volume seven the sumptuous Macmillan edition of the ' Letters and Literary Remains of Edward FitzGerald ' - is brought to a close  --  deliberate , we might call it , in view of the protracted publication covering many months The miscellaneous character of the present volume , which begins with Omar in all his glory of four versions , and all but ends with the Chronology of Charles Lamb , reflects many phases of FitzGerald . Here are translations from the Persian and from Petrarch , his own short flights of poesy , a letter to Professor Cowell ; his preface to ' Polonius ' and introduction to ' Readings from Crabbe ' ; and the admirably prosed obituary notices of Crabbe and of Bernard Barton . His Greek and Spanish sides are indeed wanting , and still ' the medley contains all of the man if not of the poet . Those who can afford this edition will seek it , it represents , we think , the last word unless the Letters should be reprinted by themselves , as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chronologically . One of the happiest selections for the Miniature Temple Classics was Sebastian Evans 's translation of ' The High History of the Holy Grail . ' It has seemed good to the publishers , Dent-Dutton , to offer his excellent version in more stately form . The result is an immaculate reprint in octavo , in which nothing but the illustrations may be cavilled at . Jessie M. King has unhappily taken as her exemplar the morbid mysticism of Aubrey Beardsley in his illustrations for the ' Monte d'Arthur , ' but she has little of his perverse ability in the management of the pounced line and the solid spot . Three editions of W. H Hudson 's ' The Naturalist in La Plata ' followed rapidly upon its first appearance in 1872 , when we judged it a work of rare originality and authority , delightful to read . The demand , it appears , has continued unsatisfied , and now the treatise ( for it is not quite a narrative ) is once more handsomely produced , with some changes in the illustrations , by J. M @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henry Harland 's sprightly story of ' The ' Cardinal 's Snuff-box ' has been freshly brought out by John Lane in very attractive , Print , paper , and binding , and with clever and graceful pen-drawings in illustration , by G C Wilmshurt , and is sure of a prolonged vogue . - A fourth , enlarged edition of Dr. Benjamin Rand 's ' Selections Illustrating Economic History since the Seven Years ' War ' is being brought out by Macmillan First issued in 1888 , and very favorably received , this compilation at once took its place as a text-book in our leading universities , was much improved in the second edition , and is now brought down to the end of the last century . Room has been saved by making a separate volume of the select bibliography of economics which was a feature of the third edition . The third edition of ' Who 's Who in America ' ( Chicago : A. N. Marquis &; Co ) shows an increase , during the two years , of approximately 4,000 names . By so much is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brief , authentic biography , the list of authors ' works ; the present address  --  sum up information nowhere else to be had between one pair of covers . This little world of nearly 14,500 names is curiously analyzed by the editor in his prefatory remarks , respecting place of birth and residence and age . " Examination of the tables will show that more of the men were born in 1856 than in any other year , and that over one-half of the entire number were born between 1840 and 1860 Of the women , more were born in 1860 than in any other year , and more than half were born between 1840 and 1865 . " These benchmarks are like the westward-shifting centre of gravity of population in our decennial census . The seventeenth volume of the English ' Book-Prices Current ' ( London : Elliot Stock ) records the prices fetched at auction from October , 1902 , to July , 1903 , with the customary scrupulousness and the invaluable index , in which the several entries are still further differentiated by bracketing the date of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his analytic preface , points to the growing demand for Old English Classics ; the unchecked appearance in the auction room of early editions of Shakspere 's plays , even of the first four folios , more or less defective , the scarcity of Americana , etc . One work , Alexander Callus 's ' Doctr male , ' a hitherto unknown publication of Pynson 's and the first of his dated issues ( 1492 ) , had for nearly three and a half centuries lain on the shelves of the Appleby Grammar School . Another rarity was Bacon 's autograph in Luther 's Commentary on St. Paul . Horace Walpole 's autograph copy of Chaloner 's translation of Erasmus 's ' Praise of Folly ' also fell under the hammer . In more senses than one  --  so far as New England is concerned ? Mr Bradford Torrey may be called the ' Clerk of the Woods , ' conformably to the title of his new volume ( Houghton , Mifflin &; Co ) By his long tenantry of the aisles of the forest , by his devotion to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his journal , he well deserves such appellation . It is no small undertaking to make a calendar of a year spent in the woods ( and this one begins with May and closes with April ) , taking daily note of the coming and the going of the birds , of the blowing and the fading of the flowers , and of the multitudinous inuta- trans of nature . Mr. Torrey has done this with admirable patience , and those who have followed his work know what to expect in his lines , for his quality is as certain to manifest itself as the birds are to come with the sun . His quiet humor and his happy faculty of discovering analogies between things in the worlds human and material , it is needless to dwell upon . He reports here that the chicory plant is not marked in Gray 's ' Manual of Botany ' as bearing white flowers , nor in Britton and Brown 's ' Illustrated Flora ' as having pink ones ; yet , as Mr. Torrey shows , it has both . There are thirty-two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noted In the Cambridge Swamp , Wood Silence ; A Day in Franconia ; A Text from Thoreau , Signs of Spring , Birds at the Window ; Under April Clouds . It can not be said that Mr W Salt Brassington has made a readable book of his volume on ' Shakespeare 's Homeland ' ( London : J. M Dent &; Co. ; New York Dutton ) , but doubtless visitors to Stratford of exceptional leisure may find many hints in it for interesting excursions , though the connection of the things seen with Shakspere is often of the slightest . There is a chapter also on the " Home of the Washingtons , " and several on Shaksperian celebrations , Shaksperian relics , and the portraits of Shakspere  --  the last of no especial value or authority The illustrations , in pen and ink , are from two hands , and some of them are attractive . The frontispiece is a reproduction , in color and said to be " in facsimile , " though the process is not named , of the so-called " Droeshout Original . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but rather like a poor lithograph Certainly the portrait is no more convincing in this form than in the black-andwhite reproductions we have seen hitherto The book is well printed on good paper , and may serve for an acceptable holiday gift to the sort of person who likes books for their appearance rather than for their matter . Lord Ronald Sutherland Gower 's ' Michael Angelo Buonarroti , ' in the Bell-Macmillan . " Great Masters " series , will add neither to the reputation of the writer nor to the usefulness of the series . It is not to be expected that such a book should contribute anything to our knowledge of the life of the great Florentine , but the common and accessible facts might be given in clearer and more attractive form ; and if really original criticism is more than we have a right to demand , yet something more discriminating than a constant repetition of superlatives might be afforded us . The chapter on " Michael Angelo as Draughtsman " was made antiquated before it was published , by the appearance of Berenson 's studies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but in both painting and sculpture Lord Ronald is apparently inclined to accept all the doubtful works , and an extraordinary number of these are included in the illustrations  --  a procedure which might be justified in a larger and fuller work where an argument on their authenticity was undertaken , but which is in the present case entirely misleading . The ' " short bibliography " fails , singularly enough , to mention Grimm . In short , the only thing in the volume that seems worth printing , at this date , is Mr. G. F. Watts 's high estimate of Michelangelo as a colorist , as well as a draughtsman , in his frescoes on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel This is to be found - in a fragment of a letter from the veteran artist which Lord Ronald includes in his preface , and is so interesting that one wishes Mr Watts had been entrusted with the writing of the book In her ' Greek History for Young Readers ' ( Longmans , Green &; Co . ) Miss Alice Zimmern 's aim has been to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tales of Greece with which most children early . become familiar and the more advanced histories . In this she has succeeded admirably , she uses the most simple language , and conveys all the essential facts of Greek history from what we know ( or , rather , do n't know ) of the prehistoric dwellers in the .1Egean , down to the death of Alexander The numerous colored and plain maps and the illustrations of Greek antiquities and modern photographs of Greek sites greatly enrich the volume , which is well printed . Miss Zinumern 's archmological introduction conveys in language that ought to interest any child the most recent theory about Troy and the earliest encounters of Europe and Asia An occasional anecdote helps along the information , and a young student who should be led to read carefully through this little volume of 373 pages would acquire , as painlessly as one may , an excellent background of Greek history , together with a , smattering of archaeology , in these days indispensable A novel experiment has been made with the Herodotean story of King Crmsus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writer of one or two plays , has constructed a short dramatic piece published by Brimley Johnson ( Adelphi , London ) , with a view to school performances The first act conveys the glory and greatness of Crmsus along with the wisdom and warnings of Bias and Solon . The second act brings in the oracle from Delphi , the declaration of war , and the death of Atys The third act begins with the sacking of Sardis , and ends with Apollo 's deliverance of Crmsus , who bethinks him of the wisdom of Solon . The contriver of this play has not wandered far from the simple story of Herodotus , and indeed has been well inspired to use as far as might be the very words employed in Mr. G C Macaulay 's well-approved translation of Herodotus . For the cleverer boys and the older ones in a school of fair size , there are six parts , requiring a good deal of-memorizing . There are four parts which require no more than a younger boy could learn to do and say , and eleven- parts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To these performers add the necessary supernumeraries , and twenty-five or thirty could take part , though the play might be staged with twenty . Here is a new means suggested for popularizing the substance of things Greek quite apart from the study of the Greek language The Rev. R F. Weymouth , well-known for his scholarly work in preparing the ' Resultant Greek Testament , ' completed before his death ' The Modern Speech New Testament ' ( New York . ' Baker &; Taylor Co . ) . The title indicates the character of the version . Similar translations have been made , and , while this is one of the best , it is , as the author suggests , " a succinct and compressed . running commentary " rather than an exact rendering Such a work encounters , even more constantly than the Revised Version , the prejudices in favor of the old familiar phraseology . There are some " modern " improvements in the arrangement : the paragraphs are shorter than in the Revised Version , and the " headings " are let into each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the page , as is done in the American Revised Version . The Financial Directory Association publish ' The Financial Red Book of America , ' which is supposed to contain the names of all men and women worth upwards of 8300 , - 000 , with some indications of the affiliations of individuals with different corporations as directors , etc Such a book would have a certain value if it were absolutely correct , but a cursory examination shows that the present volume is ludicrously untrustworthy . The veteran astronomer Senator Giovanni Schlaparelli has turned from the canals of Mars long enough to give us a most lucid and interesting sketch of the astronomy , cosmography , and calendar of the Hebrews ( L'Astronomia nell ' Antico Testamento ' ) It is one of the little " Manuell Hoepli . " Another is a quite admirable outline of Assyro-Babylonian literature ( ' Letteratura As-sire ' ) by Prof. Bruto Teloni of the Royal Institute of Higher Studies at Florence It unites- a French lucidity and simplicity in the text with a German detail and exactness in the notes , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( John Lane ) publishes , in an ' Art Portfolio ' with illuminated cover , sixteen of the more important colored plates which have appeared in that magazine . They are mounted each in a heavy mat , occasionally of startling color , and provided with brass rings for hanging They are well executed , and some of them are of good quality , but eccentricity seems more characteristic of the series than beauty , and it is difficult to take as seriously as the Studio does the kind of art in which it is most interested . We do not often concern ourselves with the fashion magazines , but the publishers of our higher-class monthlies may profitably notice the quality of decorative art and of reproduction reached in some of the covers of the Delineator  --  notably in the design , by W.

Such a modest and workmanlike production , though not faultless , contrasts most refreshingly with the straining for novelty of the contributors to the Studio 's Portfolio In the Geographical Journal for October , a number of exceptional value , Prof. W M Ramsay describes the Great Taurus Pass through the Cilician Gates , with many allusions to the ancient history of this region Referring to the present condition of this part of the . Turkish Empire , he states that he was struck with the obvious signs of prosperity and increase in the population , due to a great extent to the administration of the present Grand Vizier , Fend Pasha , at that time Vali of Konia . He is " a man who possesses the governing instinct and capacity , who has learned much from modern European method , but applies what he has learned , not with the rigidity of a mere . official trying to force European ways on an trained , undeveloped , and unresponsive Oriental race , but with the free , rough-and-ready natural power of one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done in a way that the people are fit for . Hence , on the one hand , as I was told , he has greatly increased the revenues which the Vila-yet sends to Constantinople , and , on the other hand , I can vouch from personal experience for the fact that the increase is accompanied by obvious signs of increased prosperity among ' them , and by the most perfect order and quiet . During the last two years we travelled widely in the Vila-yet , and found not the slightest trace of disorder , such as we have often observed In previous years in that and in other parts of the country " Ina " Scheme of Geography , " Prof. W M. Davis discusses , with the help of diagrams , a method for taking a comprehensive view of geography as a whole  --  a department of learning concerned with the inorganic conditions that constitute the physical environment of living forms , or physiography , and the response made by all living forms to their environment , or ontography , and the correlation of the facts which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Chukchis and Koryaks , " the title of the principal article in Petermann 's Mitteilungen , number eight , is an account of the ethnographic expedition sent out by the American Museum of Natural History in New York in 1900 to study , the hyperborean tribes of extreme northeastern Asia The facts are said to have been obtained from a member of the expedition , but his name is withheld . In this instalment , Vladivostok , the convict isle of Sakhalin and Okhotsk are briefly described A settlement of the Koryaks was visited , and a remarkably vivid picture is drawn of the dwellings , manner of life , and customs , and especially of a drunken orgy of these savages Phonographic records of a hundred of their songs and melodies , it is said , were obtained .

It has now one hundred and fifty-six agencies  --  thirty-nine more than last year  --  for the delivery or reading of books . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there has been hardly an appreciable increase in the home use , while the number of borrowers has decreased . This is due largely , in our opinion , to the fact that newspapers and magazines are gradually driving the book from the homes of the middle classes , and partly to the decrease in the purchase of fiction . Of 702 stories reported on by the appointed readers , only112were bought . The school-libraries , intended primarily to aid the children in their studies and stimulate their taste for wholesome reading , are now sixty-six , including six in parochial schools . This last is a new departure , and it might be instructive to print in one of the monthly bulletins a complete list of the books chosen for parochial pupils . So far as Prussia , whose leadership in matters of education is almost always followed by the other German States , is concerned , a uniform system of orthography is at last a fait accompli , The Ministry of State has recently published a decree regulating for the schools of that country the spelling of such words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached some months ago by . the authorities of the German States , Austria and Switzerland . These orthographical ultimata have already been introduced in the new and second edition of ' Worterbuch fur eine deutsche Einheitsschreibung , ' by Sarrazin , chairman of the Deutscher Sprachverein and the recognized leader and protagonist of uniform orthography in Germany . The Ministry itself declares in its decree that the press and the writers of the country , as also the other German States , ought to adopt these conclusions . Bavaria has already done so Sarrazin 's work is an excellent handbook , and furnishes particulars as to the whole movement and its history . The Russian bibliograph P Draganoff has compiled a list of the translations made of Tolstoy 's works , according to which he is the most international literary celebrity of the times .

Pliny succeeded in getting Minerva and Diana to work together in his hunting expeditions about Comum , but the editor of the Century has accomplished the feat of harnessing Minerva with Mercury in securing a description of the New York Stock Exchange from the pen of Edmund Clarence Stedman The paper Is illustrated from drawings by Ernest L Blumenschein . H Addington Bruce gives a somewhat sensational story of critical difficulties encountered last winter in the construction of the Hudson River tunnel . The progress of the tunnel was stopped temporarily by encountering stone , and the gradual escape of compressed air finally disintegrated the mud above until a portion of the roof was denuded " At once the river , infuriated , " we are told , " began to bombard the unprotected roof with boulders , ice , and the force of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of marine ammunition . " As all this was at the bottom of sixty-five feet of water , with but little current , the careful reader will add the traditional grain of salt to this lively bombardment . Andrew D.

It is a very ingenious defence which Senator Lodge puts up for the Senate in the current Screbner 's . The only difficulty is , that we have before us not merely the Senate as he describes it , but also the Senate as we see it constantly with our own eyes , and the two views are not in harmony . Our own eyes show us ; for instance , a senatorial interference with appointments which is constantly bringing disgrace upon the Government by forcing unfit men into office and retaining them there for personal and partisan reasons , while Senator Lodge sees in the same set of facts merely the only practical way by which the Senate can exercise its Constitutional duty of advising the President with regard to appointments . A few such palpable fallacies as this do not leave the reader in the best mood to appreciate the really valid argument , that the framers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exceptionally strong position , in order to safeguard the standing of the States as indestructible entities in the new Government . It is the abuse , not the mere use , of the Constitutional powers of the Senate to which people rightly object . The Senator actually cites the case of the Wilson Tariff bill as illustrating the great Constitutional power of the Senate . The fact was simply that several Senators insisted that no bill which did not favor interests in which they were deeply concerned should pass It is easy enough to show that the action of the Senate in such matters as those mentioned , and in much of its dealing with treaties , does not technically violate the letter of the Constitution , and may in this negative sense be said to fall within the limits of Constitutional prerogative , but it ought to be just as easy for an intelligent man , even an intelligent Senator , to realize that there may be intolerable usurpation in fact without going to the point of technical usurpation in law .

In the twenty feet of- debris on the early site of Abydos lie such records as were left of a civilization reaching , apparently , about 4,700 years back of the Christian era Dr. Petrie is especially pleased with the recovery of two ivory images , the first Supposed to represent a king or the first dynasty , about 4,500 n. c. , and the second marked with the name Of Khufu , the great Cheops of Herodotus , whose date was about 600 years later . The head of the latter was accidentally broken off by the spade of the workman who unearthed its and it took three weeks of patient dirt sifting to recover the loss The head , reproduced in double the actual size , strikes one immediately as indicative of great will power and executive ability .

Brander Matthews undertakes the defence of American literature against the silence of Mr. Dodd , whose extensive collection of the " Epigrammatists " includes not a single specimen from any American author . The American epigrams cited by Professor Matthews show a fair degree of merit , though he does not make it appear that the form has been a distinguishing characteristic of any of our authors The attempts of Lowell and Aldrich in this field he regards as the most successful , Lowell showing the more vigor , and Aldrich the more ingenious delicacy . Admitting the general inferiority which Mr. Dodd 's exclusion suggests , Professor Matthews explains it tentatively on the theory that the epigram calls for wit rather than humor , while the American author is apt to be endowed with humor rather than wit . ? That prolific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably wrong in assuming that people do not want to be told when Isaac Watts was born Mr Julian 's ' Dictionary of Hymnology , ' which might be supposed to have exhausted its subject , seems scarcely to have abated the demand for scrappy and accidental gleanings from this field Such works of this sort as appeared thirty or forty years ago had the attraction of novelty , and might claim the praise due to pioneers , for their late successors less can be said Some of them are gossipy and sketchy , others are lifeless and commonplace , most of them do little but draw from sources already sucked dry . That ' Famous Hymns and their Authors , ' by Francis Arthur Jones ( London Hodder , fs Stoughton , New York Edwin S Gorham ) , reaches us in a second edition , proves it the kind of book which many people like , yet it has no graces of style and the feeblest pretence at criticism , and it adds hardly anything to our knowledge beyond the death at Quebec in 1893 of Matthew Bridges , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond the ken of hymnologists . It le not even strong in sentiment and pretty stories to tell at prayer meeting . Not all the 230 hymns it cites are ' - 'famous " ; of the 200 authors ( and composers ) - indexed , some are little , if at all , known in America , though the range of selection is up to modern standards of catholicity , extending from Romanists to Mrs. Emily H. Miller , and even condescending to heresy in Sir John Bowring . More interesting than the text are the portraits , barring a few familiar from infancy . It is doubtless not Mr. Jones 's fault that even here disappointment smites us , since poets are not always poetical to the eye of flesh ; but several of these Anglican dignitaries look like Hardshell Baptists from East Tennessee , and the corrugated and awful visage of Bishop Wordsworth ( p. 248 ) suggests manhandling by unconverted savages .

The latter says in his preface : " There are many sensational events recorded in these pages , but I trust that nothing will be discovered in the way of intemperate comment . The facts against the Jesuits are so strong that they do not need the aid of abuse " This is a fair profession , but as we proceed we discover that Mr. Walsh must use language in a very Pickwickian sense if he does not intend to abuse the Order whose history he has set out to write . For example , as he draws near the close , he observes .

His conclusions are possibly true , but we can not consider them justified by his narrative He prides himself on having drawn very largely from Roman Catholic sources . We must point out , however , that his treatment of evidence is wholly polemical and inconsistent with true historical methods , We quote a single passage to show how , Mr. Walsh generalizes at random . " All through his reign Charles II helped forward the interests of the Church of Rome in his dominions to the utmost of his power , never hesitating to practise every possible deception in order that he might accomplish his evil purpose .

Shakespeare 's Garden ' is the title of a closely-printed little book of 250 pages by J II Bloom ( London Methuen , Philadelphia .

The idea of such a descriptive catalogue of the trees , shrubs , flowers , and fruits mentioned in the plays is not new . Ellacombe 's ' The Plant Lore and Garden Craft of Shakespeare , ' reprinted in 1896 , is Mr Bloom 's chief rival The present work is arranged in the form of a calendar , the flowers , shrubs , etc. , proper to each month being named in no particular order , except as they fall in each month An appendix of more than eighty pages gives a complete collection of all the passages in the plays in which there is the slightest hint of a vegetable , from a nutshell to stewed prunes , for which Shakspere seems to have had no particular aversion .

The book is , in the end , neither a readable popular account nor a trustworthy reference book , still less is it a concordance Like many works of the kind , written in the seclusion of the English country rectory , it must have been interesting to write , unfortunately that does not make it interesting to read . Who cares to know that there are thirteen references in Shakspere to the common nettle , or that in his day the walnut tree preferred a chalky soil ' Only that passionate lover of statistics who rejoices in the knowledge that , last year , we imported eight million bushels of potatoes . The type of mind is peculiarly common to the British Isles , where the purely disinterested craving for unrelated facts is fed by such papers as Scraps or Tit-Bits Mr. Bloom 's book was written for such a public , one might make up a very readable number of Pearson 's Weekly or answers from its pages . ?

" But the one capital and supreme record of life at St Helena is the private journal of Gourgaud , written , in the main at least , for his own eye and conscience alone , without flattery or even prejudice , almost brutal in its raw realism " Gourgaud was a brave and active soldier who had only reached the age of thirty-two at the time of Napoleon 's second exile . Unlike the other members of the Emperor 's staff , he was unmarried , and at St Helena time hung heavily upon his hands . He loved the Emperor , but could not help chafing under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his own journal he was petulant , jealous , and abrupt The singular thing is that Napoleon should have shown so much indulgence toward a subordinate who was so young that he had barely reached the grade of general at the opening of the Waterloo campaign We certainly think that Lord Rosebery presses these memoirs too far when he makes them support a theory that Napoleon had a well-developed bump of benevolence On the other hand , they are more trustworthy than most of the St. Helena reminiscences Mrs. Latimer has cut down the bulky original to a fraction of its size and extracted frOm it Napoleon 's own observations . These are arranged for the most part in chronological order , although conversations on miscellaneous subjects like the art of war , great generals , and religion are digested Binder separate headings at the close of the volume . The editor supplies an apparatus of footnotes which suffices to explain most of the allusions in the text . ADMIRAL PORTER . Admiral Porter . By James Russell Soley , formerly Assistant Secretary of the Navy . Great Commanders . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ David Dixon Porter ( 1813-1891 ) was a great commander will be generally conceded . Unfortunately for his fame , he exhibited traits that provoked in some quarters a bitter personal enmity ; and there were those whose prejudices drove them even to the verge of denying to him the qualities of courage and leadership . But Porter 's place in history is assured He will wear the honors of a naval hero . He will be known as an officer who took a broad view of duties to be performed , who was tireless in preparation , quick to move , and brave in action ; who kept steadily on , undismayed by threatened disaster , and who showed wonderful endurance under the strain of constant exposure in the face of the enemy . This work , whose publication has long been looked for , is of more than ordinary importance . The author has had it in hand for many years . Admiral Porter died in February , 1891 . He had asked his friend to write a Life , and Professor Soley ( then of the navy ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly necessary to state , has performed his task with marked skill and ability , and has made a valuable contribution to naval biography . Perhaps no writer could have been found better equipped to deal with the subject . As librarian of the Navy Department he created the Naval War Record Office His thorough knowledge of naval routine , as well as his perfect familiarity with the official records of the war , gave him an advantage that has been wisely availed of for the preparation of this volume . Moreover , as regards many of the events narrated , he had the benefit of conversation and discussion with the Admiral himself . The army has been more fortunate than the navy , in one respect . Grant , Sherman , and Sheridan have left behind them memoirs from their own pens Admiral Porter , in his later years of leisure , turned to literary composition ; but Mr Soley seems to think that the less said about this line of effort the better . Besides other works , the Admiral wrote a ' History of the Navy during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarks ? " It is unfortunately inaccurate in- many essential particulars , including both dates and events . The book is rambling in style , and hastily and carelessly put together . Its value lies chiefly in its professional comments and its narratives of personal experience " ( p 463 ) . The inaccuracy of statement which Mr. Soley speaks of as prevalent in the ' History , ' seems to have proceeded from an infirmity that beset the Admiral at various times when he took up the pen . Even inofficial reports there are instances where either the Admiral or his brother officers must have been mistaken as to- what actually had occurred . To construct a narrative of what Admiral Porter really accomplished requires considerable research , a keen intelligence , and some experience in weighing conflicting testimony . Possibly this fact may account for the delay that has attended the publication of the present Life Mr. Soley appears to have met the difficulty , however , and to have surmounted it in a creditable manner . Still , on one or two points which have given rise to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explicit . For example , Gen. Butler , it may be recalled , attacked Vice-Admiral Porter savagely in Congress , when Farragut died and it was proposed not to continue the grade of admiral . He carried the House with him on the first vote Afterwards , Butler published a pamphlet charging Porter with " running away " from his position , just below Fort Jackson , after Farragut 's fleet had passed the forts and gone up to New Orleans . He submitted proof that Porter , on the morning of April 24 , with his mortar boats , went twenty-five miles down the river , and that he stayed at Pilot Town till the 27th for fear of the Louisiana . As a matter of fact , Porter may have deemed it prudent to go down the river , though he denied that he had done so Butler charged Porter with " falsehood , " and brought forward a mass of testimony , partly made up of Porter 's own contradictory statements , that leaves little room for doubt as to what was the actual fact . The logbook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to show just where Porter was on these days ; but this particular logbook , it seems , disappeared from the Department , and , when Butler called to examine it , was not to be found . The question is , perhaps , of no great moment to-day ; at all events , it is not worth while to revive ancient feuds Nevertheless , a public controversy of this nature interests many people , some of whom desire to get at the bottom of the facts , if possible Hence , one would like to find a little clearer description of the situation than this statement of the text affords : " Although the mortar flotilla desisted from bombardment , Porter was by no means idle . A portion of the schooners were sent below to refit and prepare for sea as well as to take a position of greater security Several were moved to the network of waterways in the rear of Fort Jackson to blockade the bayous on that side , and to prevent the introduction of supplies The Miami took Gen. Butler and his staff to Pilot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she went around outside to the rear of Fort St. Philip and took on board a regiment of Butler 's force , which she landed near Quarantine , on the left bank of the river above the forts . The Sachem was also sent to assist in this duty , all of which was so efficiently performed that by Saturday , the 26th , the people in the forts found the lines gradually drawing around them by movements which they could see but were powerless to prevent Meanwhile , Porter with his remaining gunboats was engaged in patrolling the river , clearing it of boats by which information could be given to the enemy , and assisting the movements of the army , but above all keeping a close watch upon the enemy 's fleet lying under the forts Each day the gunboats , or some of them , took up a position below Fort Jackson where they could both see and be seen So matters remained for two days " ( p. 200 ) .
