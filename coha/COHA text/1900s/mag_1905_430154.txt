No one thing in Japan is source of such such unfailing curiosity and criticism from foreigners as the national bath . National it certainly is , for there everybody , high and low , rich and poor , expects to take , and as a matter of fact does take , at least one hot bath a day . With western nations a bath is an evidence of luxury , and only the well-to-do and leisure classes have the habit of bathing daily , and many of these consider a weekly hot tub all that cleanliness requires , while to thousands of the poorest people a bath is utterly undesired and unknown unless by chance they may be forced to take one at a hospital . The climate of Japan is such that , be it winter or summer , a hot bath is a delightful stimulant , and seems to have no had after effect , while a cold tub is positively injurious . Even the hidebound Englishman relinquishes his lifelong cold tub habit while in this dainty kingdom , and follows the native example in taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traveled foreigner has a preconceived idea of the Japanese bath that is only partially correct . He tells you glibly : " The Japanese are a great people for bathing , yes , indeed , great , but their way of bathing is simply disgusting ; the whole family take their bath in the same water , in the same tub , you know , and you ca n't call that clean . " There is just enough truth in this to make it the worst kind of a falsehood . Poor indeed is the household , and hard to find , which does not own a bath tub . The tubs are all made of wood , and a good one that would last a lifetime will cost two or three dollars . They are round like a barrel , and are about as large as a sugar cask , but not so high . The Japanese always sit in a kneeling position , and so in one of their tubs in this position it is large enough for then to use their arms comfortably , and the water comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charcoal burned in a funnel-like iron pipe which goes up inside the tub close to the edge , and being several inches higher than the top of it , the water does not leak inside . A board , perhaps ten inches wide , fits into a groove in the bottom of the tub , and is held in place by strips of wood that slip into sockets , and this forms a shield , protecting the bather from contact with the hot pipe . At the base of the pipe inside is an iron grating on which are placed pieces of lighted charcoal , and other small unlighted pieces are crisscrossed above , and then two or three larger pieces are stood up on top . The draft through  | the pipe soon ignites all the charcoal , and the intense heat thus generated warms the water . It takes about three-quarters of an hour to heat a bath to the temperature pleasing to a Japanese , a hundred and ten to a hundred and twenty-five degrees , and as the heated water constantly rises to the top , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big dipper made from a section of bamboo fitted with a handle , stirs the water from the bottom every ten minutes or so , and thus keeps it all at an even temperature . In some large households and in hotels the bath is a square wooden tank sunk two or three feet into the floor . As a rule , a well-to-do Japanese takes great pride in his bathroom , and the woodwork will be as dainty as a cabinet . No paint or varnish is allowed to conceal or gloss over the grain of the wood , and as no soap or greasy substance comes in contact with it , it retains its natural color , and only grows darker with years of use . The floor will be of tiles or of wood , as the taste of the owner prefers , but it is always laid sloping toward a drain that carries off the water . The walls may be entirely of wood , as is the ceiling , or they may be wainscoted , with the upper part tiled or covered with a hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walls , for then they could not have the daily washing down that keeps them so scrupulously clean . When the tub , or more properly speaking , the tank , is let into the floor , it is usually about six feet square , but at hotels one often finds it much larger . The bottom of the tank being twentyfive or thirty inches below the floor level , a plank for a seat is fastened about a foot from the bottom , extending around two or three sides . On the fourth side is the metal against which the fire is laid outside of the bathroom , and so none of the charcoal fumes penetrate through . To make clear the truth and the falseness of the foreigners ' statement , I will describe my first bath taken in true Japanese style . It was at the time of the world 's fair at Osaka last summer , and I had been in Japan long enough to know what a sociable people they were and how they liked nothing less than being a 1 o n e . Their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they preferred ferred to take them in company and not privately as was our custom , and I also knew that the sight of the human body unclothed was as natural to them as is the sight of the bare face to us . My traveling companions were three Japanese ladies , and a flood of the rainy season had driven us from the grounds of the exhibition to our hotel , early in the afternoon . The first thing a Japanese does  | on arriving at a hotel , no matter what the hour of day or night , is to ask for a bath , and in a short time one is made ready . The bathroom is arranged with . the idea that from three to six people will bathe at the same time , and in that way all at the hotel may get one or two baths a day without trouble . While I was removing my rain-spattered clothes , I noticed my friends talking together as though some serious matter was at stake , so I asked what was the difficulty . It appears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much demand that the bath maid had said I could not have one alone but must take my bath in company with my three companions . This they hated to tell me , as they knew I had always previously had my bath to myself . Much to : heir surprise , I said : he maid was quite right , it would be unfair for me to take the bathroom all to myself , and so we four would bathe together . Relief and pleasure showed in their faces , and they replied it would be a great honor to bathe with me . We then made ready for the bath by removing all our clothes and putting on the pretty , clean cotton kimonos that are brought to each guest as soon as he arrives at the hotel , and slipping our feet into the straw sandals also provided . Picking up our towels , for a guest in Japan always provides his own towels even though his bath and sleeping garment are furnished by the hotel , down the long corridor we trotted in  | Indian file @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room , brightly lighted and spotlessly clean , about twelve feet square , with a big tank filled with fresh water . Outside was an anteroom or closet , with several shelves and a washstand on which were ranged half a dozen shining brass basins , about a foot in diameter , and as many small wooden stools stood on the floor below . Each one of us took off her kimono , folded it . and laid it on a shelf by itself and placed the sandals side by side on the floor . I let my friends go first , and , watching closely , did just as they did . Next , each one picked up a basin and a stool and walked into the bathroom , the last one shutting the door but not locking it , so the bath maid might come in if we needed her and called her by clapping our hands . Setting the stools on the floor , my friends took their basins to the tank , filled them with the hot water , and then sitting down on their stools began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never seen before , even though a Turkish bath was an old friend and I had flattered myself that I was more than ordinarily cleanly . To an arni alone they gave full five minutes ' steady work , rubbing it round and round and up and down and inside and outside , and then rinsing it all off most carefully and thoroughly with cold water , which they drew from a nearby faucet . I , having followed their example as far as the stool and basin of hot water , had settled myself to the usual wash cloth scrub , and after completing the task to my satisfaction and having rinsed my body as my companions had done , was about to step into the tank when I observed that they were scarcely more than one-third through , and at that very moment were discussing the utter impossibility of decent people taking a bath in less than one full hour 's time . Meekly again I sat down on my stool , refilled my brass basin , and a second time I went over my entire body with snap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my friends had completed their preliminary wash ? Not at all . They were then perhaps two-thirds through , so again my basin was freshly filled and I began on a third wash . Before I had quite completed this , one of the ladies got up from her stool , came over to me , and saying : " Excuse me , " took my wash cloth , soaped it , and gave my back such a rubbing that I felt sure she had left not even the skin . We four being thoroughly washed and perfectly rinsed , now stepped into the tank , the water of which was so hot it made my flesh sting . Here we sat and gossiped cozily for at least a quarter of an hour , and when we got out I noticed the water was not even clouded . And why should it be , when we all had washed ourselves so immaculately clean before we went in ? It is true that in a household the whole family , servants included , get into the same tub for their hot soak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the oldest member . But when you realize that each one has washed himself to a state of scrupulous cleanliness before he enters the bath , and that such a washing is a daily occurrence , our ideas of the lack of cleanliness undergo a change . The love of cleanliness is inborn with the Japanese , and the government recognizing that fact , and being paternal , has established in all cities and  | large towns bath houses which are frequented by both rich and poor . The actual cost of a bath at a public house is only a cent or two , so it may be within the reach of the poorest coolie , but the well-to-do and middle class , who also patronize them , leave some small fee for the attendants . The bath tub in a private house is often exceedingly pretty , and is made from specially selected wood , the staves being held in place by bands of braided bamboo splits . The owners take as much pride in it as we do in a handsome porcelain-lined tub . Open spaces for ventilation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the upper part of the walls of a Japanese bathroom , so the current of air may carry off the poisonous fumes of the charcoal . When foreigners first went to Japan , there were sad tales of their being overcome by the fumes of the charcoal and being scalded by getting into a tub without previously trying the water . Such calamities are easily understood , f o r many thoughtless people had the tub placed in a closed room in a foreign house , where there was no outlet for the fumes or opening for fresh air , so the rooms would quickly fill with the poisonous gas that after a few inhalations would render one unconscious . The fire burns as long as any charcoal remains in the pipe , so the water grows hotter and hotter , and can easily become sufficiently hot to scald the flesh . A pail of cold water with a dipper is placed beside the tub , and with this it is customary to cool the water before getting in , for a Japanese prefers his bath from ten to twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a source of surprise when taking the first few Japanese baths to find the water growing constantly warmer instead of cooler ; as it does with us the longer it stays in the tub . If it is an agreeable temperature at the beginning of the bath , one emerges from the tub looking and feeling like a boiled lobster , but this is just the sensation a Japanese likes , and that very parboiling makes his skin like velvet . Soap is beginning to be used by natives who are in touch with foreigners or have lived in foreign countries , but bags of rice bran are usually the only accompaniment of the Japanese bath . Foreigners are not desired and often are n o t permitted to take baths in the public bath houses , but it took inc a long time to discover the reason for this . An American lady visiting at a Japanese family on the west coast was the only foreigner in the country . Some repairs b e i n g needed in the bathroom of the residence , t h e head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself to the public bath house to make arrangements for the entire household to take their baths there for a few days . The hour and price being easily agreed upon with the general bath manager , the old gentleman was much perturbed to be notified a couple of hours later  | that the bath man had found he could not allow the family the use of the baths . No reason was given , but the message , extraordinary as it seemed , was quite clear . Concealing his anger and mortification , the old gentleman went again to the manager , and after a long talk found the foreign visitor had been the occasion of the refusal . The bath man said if it was known that a dirty foreigner who did not take a hot bath oftener than once a week , and then washed herself in the very water of the tank , defiling it with soap and the soil from her skin , was frequenting the bath house , all his regular patrons - would stay away and his business would be ruined . So the poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to the bath , and as the whole community knew she could not take a hot tub there , she felt her reputation for u n c 1 eanliness was established forever . A bath to a Japanese is such a vital necessity that if he must choose between food and a bath he will choose the bath . When he reaches home tired and hungry , it is not food he first asks for , but his bath ; and after the bath , which he takes in a leisurely manner , he takes his food . It is said the greatest hardship the soldiers and sailors of Japan endure when in active service is the deprivation of their daily bath .  |
