 | The principle of international arbitration has received wide recognition in the past few years . In spite of recent wars there has developed among the peoples of the earth a strong undercurrent of sentiment in favor of peace , and during the past twelve months this sentiment has manifested itself to an extrardinary degree in what is now commonly called the world 's peace movement . From pulpit and press , from philanthropic associations , from conferences of lawyers and publicists , national and international , the demand has come for the peaceful adjustment of international disputes , and this demand has been met by the negotiation of arbitration treaties , a score or more of which have already been entered into by the leading powers of the world . This subject is of special interest to Americans on account of the frequent recourse that has been had to arbitration by the nations on this continent . No country has done more to encourage this method of procedure in the settlement of international differences than the United States . The greatest triumph of the principle was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war of the so-called Alabama Claims to a special court of arbitration convened at Geneva . The award of the Geneva tribunal , though galling to England , was accepted without question , and the two great branches of the English-speaking race thus set an example of incalculable value . It is rather difficult to determine the exact number of cases that have been submitted to arbitration before specially constituted courts during the past hundred years , but a recent writer on the subject gives the following interesting data , which seem to be approximately correct : * Between 1794 and 1820 there were 15 cases of arbitration ; between 1821 and 1840 , 8 ; between 1841 and 1860 , 20 ; between 1861 and 1880 , 44 ; and between 1881 and 1900 , 90 . By states the record is as follows : Great Britain  | has been a party to 70 arbitrations , the United States to 56 , Chili to 26 , France to 26 , Peru to 14 , Portugal to 12 , Brazil to 11 , Argentina to 10 , Spain to 10 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smaller number of instances . It is interesting to note that Russia has been a party to only four arbitrations , Austria to only two , and Germany to none until the recent Venezuelan case . All these cases have been submitted to special courts of arbitration organized for the occasion , each resting on a special treaty of a temporary character , and each tribunal adopting its own rules of procedure . The organization of temporary special tribunals under special treaties involves unnecessary delay and expense , and it has long been held by the friends and advocates of arbitration that the ever-increasing number of cases submitted to this method of settlement justified some more permanent arrangement . It was with this view that a permanent arbitration treaty between England and the United States was negotiated by Mr. Olney and Lord Pauncefote and submitted by President Cleveland to the Senate in January , 1897 . But the Senate unfortunately rejected the treaty , it lacking only two of the necessary two-thirds vote . A year later , however , the Czar of Russia issued his call for the Peace Conference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powers represented of the Convention for the Peaceful Adjustment of International Differences . This treaty is afundamental code or constitution creating apermanent court and making definite provision for the procedure in any cases that the signatory powers may see fit to bring before it . Few events of modern times have been the subject of greater misapprehension on the part of the general public than the Peace Conference which met at the Hague in 1899 . Even at this time comparatively few people are intelligently informed as to what was actually accomplished there . The Czar 's note calling the Conference defined its objects as the promotion of international peace and the possible limitation of excessive armaments . The press of Europe at once characterized the proposed gathering of diplomats as the " Disarmament Conference , " and its attitude was anything but friendly and helpful . This attitude was not changed even after the Conference met and settled down to serious work . In a meeting of European diplomats it was unfortunately  | considered necessary to rigidly exclude all press representatives , but the disadvantages of this situation might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Conference displayed a distinctly hostile spirit toward the press . The result was that when it became evident that the subject of disarmament could not even be discussed by the Conference , the majority of the press representatives left The Hague and declared the Conference a failure . Henceforth the public was furnished with vague or inaccurate reports from unreliable sources . The misapprehension thus arising as to the real object of the Conference was further strengthened by the fact that several of the powers represented were soon engaged in bloody wars . The public not unnaturally adopted the view that the whole movement was afailure . Many newspapers continue to hold this view , and the subject still affords a wide target for the derisive shafts of cartoonists . It would be difficult to find an illustrated paper in which the Peace Conference is not continually held up to ridicule . The question as to what powers should be invited to participate in the Conference was a difficult one for the Russian Government to decide , but invitations were finally extended to all governments having regular diplomatic representation at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the embarrassing question as to their status then pending with England , as well as the Pope with his claim to temporal power . An unfortunate omission was that of the South and Central American states , but no exception could be made in their case . The United States and Mexico were thus the only American states represented . This does not mean that the other American republics are debarred from access to The Hague Court . The Venezuelan case was carried there in 1903 , and it is probable that at the next conference the other American states will be admitted as signatory powers . At the Pan-American Conference of 1901 , held in the City of Mexico , a resolution was adopted declaring that the three conventions adopted at The Hague should be regarded as American public law . There were twenty-five states represented at The Hague Conference and the total number of delegates happened to be one hundred , all of whom were present at the opening exercises . The seats were allotted to the powers in alphabetical order in the  | French language , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " shared with Germany ( Allemagne ) the seats of honor directly in front of the chair . Mr. Rolls , the historian of the Conference , tells us that Count Munster jokingly referred to this arrangement as a part of the new . " imperialistic " policy of the United States . On being assured by the American representatives that they were innocent of all complicity in this matter , he shook his head and smilingly replied , " American innocence is generally your excuse , and has always been a drawing card in diplomacy . " The United States was represented at the Conference by Andrew D. White , Seth Low , Stanford Newel , Captain A. T. Mahan , Captain William Crozier , and Frederick William Rolls , as Secretary and Counsel . The other nations sent men of equal standing , statesmen , diplomats , jurists , and soldiers . Throughout its sittings the proceedings of the Conference were marked by straightforwardness and simplicity . There was an entire absence of ostentatious display . While the Conference discussed a number of questions of grave international import and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of maritime warfare , its great work was the establishment of a permanent international court of arbitration . The Convention making provision for this Court is the Magna Charta of International Law . " The Convention for the Peaceful Adjustment of International Differences offers three methods of settlement without resort to war : ( 1 ) Through good offices and mediation ; ( 2 ) Through International Commissions of Inquiry , and ( 3 ) By submission to the Permanent Court of Arbitration . The tender and use of good offices and mediation is nothing new in international relations , but hitherto powers who have not been directly concerned in a a dispute have usually refrained from offering mediatiation unless they had received some intimation that it would be acceptable . The Hague Convention gives the signatory powers the right to make the offer and declares that the exercise of the right shall never be regarded as an unfriendly act . Good offices and mediation have exclusively the  | page deleted  | page deleted  | page deleted  | The United States Senate ratified it unanimously , February 5 , 1900 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ratifications took place in the Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs at The Hague , and the powers soon announced their appointments to the Court . President McKinley appointed as the American members , November 24 , 1900 : Ex-President Benjamin Harrison , Chief Justice Melville Fuller , Attorney-General John W. Griggs , and Justice George Gray . Ex-President Cleveland was offered a place , but declined . After the death of ex-President Harrison , Mr. Oscar S. Straus , former minister to Constantinople , was appointed a member of the Court . On October 7 , 1903 , Andrew Carnegie gave the sum of $1,500 , - 000 for the purpose of building , establishing , and maintaining at The Hague a Court House and Library ( Temple of Peace ) as a permanent home for the Court . It is to be hoped that this building will stand for ages as the donor 's most enduring monument . Already the Court has surpassed the most sanguine expectations of its advocates . When the Conference adjourned the opinion was expressed in many quarters that the treaty was visionary and utopian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lapse for want of litigants , but this view proved erroneous . The Court opened its first session September 15 , 1902 , to hear the case of the United States vs . Mexico in the matter of the Pious Fund of the Californias . A longer time than this elapsed after the organization of the Supreme Court of the United States before it was resorted to by litigants . Eighteen months later the Venezuelan case was heard , and the third case is now in process of submission . No better idea of the efficiency and value of the Court can be obtained than by a review of these cases . ' ' The so-called " Pious Fund of the Californias " dates back to the year 1697 , when members of the Jesuit order undertook the conversion of the Indians of the Californias and began to collect contributions for this purpose . In the course of a century this sum grew to over a million dollars . After the expulsion of the Jesuits from his dominions the King of Spain acted as trustee ,  | and when Mexico declared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the fund for the pious uses intended by its founders . In 1842 the real estate and other property of the fund was sold by decree of the Mexican government and the proceeds paid into the national treasury , the government at the same time acknowledging an indebtedness of 6 per cent . per annum on the total proceeds of the sale . After the purchase of Upper California by the United States in 1848 , Mexico failed to pay any part of the income to the bishops of Upper California , who finally brought their case before the claims commission organized under the treaty of 1868 . The umpire , Sir Edward Thornton , to whom the case was finally referred , gave judgment in favor of the claimants , and Mexico paid the amount of the award , but failed to keep up the interest for the future . In 1891 the State Department finally took up the matter of the claim for interest which had accrued since 1869 , and on May 22 , 1902 , Mexico signed an agreement with the United States submitting the question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was given power to determine : " 1 . If said claim , as a consequence of the former decision , is within the governing principle of res judicata , and " 2 . If not , whether the same be just ; and to render such judgment and award as may be meet and proper under all the circumstances of the case . " The United States selected from the general list of judges as its nominees for the special tribunal Prof. F. de Martens , of Russia , and Right Hon. Sir Edward Fry , of England ; while Mexico named Mr. T. M. C. Asser and Jonkheer A. F. de Savornin Lohman , both of Holland . These four gentlemen met at The Hague September 1 , 1902 , and chose as the fifth member and president of the tribunal Prof. Henning Matzen , of Copenhagen . The United States was represented by the following counsel : William L. Penfield , Solicitor of the State Department ; Senator Stewart , Chevalier Deschamps , a Senator of Belgium ; Charles J. Kappler , W. T. S. Doyle , Garett @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The official language of the tribunal was French ? that is , the minutes of the proceedings and the award are in that language ; but as all of the arbitrators were familiar with both French and English , the right was extended to the  | representatives of the United States to address the court in English . The main point argued was as to whether the decision of the mixed commission organized under the treaty of 1868 should be given the effect of res judicata . The Mexican Government took the position that under the terms of that treaty the mixed commission was to determine claims that had arisen between 1848 and 1868 ; that the interest which had accrued since 1868 was in the nature of a new claim and therefore could not be considered to have been adjudicated upon in the former decision . Of course , Mexico 's object was to secure a rehearing of the whole case on its merits . The merits of the case were discussed at some length , Mexico maintaining that the fund had been nationalized and was subject to the laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside of the courts of Mexico ; that the right to claim further payment of the interest had expired by Mexican statute of limitations . They further claimed that the fund was established for the conversion of the Indians and that there were no longer any Indians to be converted in California . The tribunal decided the case in favor of the United States . The judges ruled that the principle of res judicata applies not only to the judgments of tribunals created by the state , but equally to arbitral sentences rendered within the limits of the jurisdiction fixed by the agreement ; that in the case before them there was not only identity of parties to the suit , but also identity of subject matter , compared with the sentence of Sir Edward Thornton . The claim of the United States for payment in gold was , however , disallowed . The Court held that the decision of Sir Edward Thornton on this point did not have the force of res judicata except for the twenty-one years ' interest due at that time . The final award was as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United Mexican States shall pay to the Government of the United States of America on February 2 , 1903 , and each year following on the same date of February 2 , perpetually , the annuity of $43,050.99 Mexican , in money having legal currency in Mexico . " The sessions of the Court for the hearing of arguments in this case extended over ten days , and the printed report of the American agent fills 891 pages . The decision was rendered Octo- page deleted  | were entitled to preferential treatment . These three powers maintained the affirmative of this proposition , while the others , Holland , Belgium , Norway and Sweden , Denmark , Spain , Mexico , France , and the United States claimed equal rights with the powers which had resorted to force . The court decided that the three allied powers were entitled to preferential treatment ; that Venezuela had recognized in principle the justice of their claims in the protocols she had signed , while she had not recognized in principle the justice of the claims of the pacific powers ; that the neutral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the allies , and that their rights remained for the future absolutely intact . This decision , emanating from a peace court , and endorsing the principle of armed coercion , was received with no small degree of criticism . Attention was called to the fact that the judges were from countries which had always recognized droit de force as the principal modus vivendi . The choice of judges was necessarily limited where thirteen powers ( counting Venezuela ) were parties to the suit . The decision was rendered at The Hague February 22 , 1904 . The third case , in which England , Germany and France are parties on the one hand , and Japan on the other , is now in process of submission to The Hague Court . The peace movement has made rapid progress during the past few months , and President Roosevelt has recently addressed a circular note to the powers with reference to calling a second conference . This call has been the subject of gross misrepresentation , coming as it did on the eve of the Presidential election . The idea , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note was issued in response to a resolution of the Interparliamentary Union at its session in St. Louis in September , 1904 . Similar action was taken by the International Congress of Lawyers and Jurists which met at St. Louis the same month , and a week later by the International Peace Congress at Boston . The Hague Convention does not bind any power to submit any dispute to arbitration . Resort to the Court is purely optional . But during the past year a score or more of treaties have been  | concluded between the nations of Europe , binding themselves to submit certain classes of disputes , not affecting their independence , honor , or vital interests , to The Hague Court for arbitration . The most important of these treaties are the Anglo-French , the Anglo-Italian , the Franco-Italian , a treaty between Denmark and Holland , the Franco-Spanish , the Franco-Dutch , the AngloSpanish , the Anglo-German , and treaties between England and the Scandinavian powers , and between Spain and Portugal . A number of people think that these treaties are not worth the paper they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of publicists . " To settle disputes by arbitration is a very good habit to get into ; and once the habit is formed as to minor matters , it is only a step farther to settlement of the major differences by the same means . " Meanwhile the United States has not been idle in this matter of negotiating arbitration treaties . On November 1 , 1904 , Secretary Hay and the French ambassador signed a treaty along the lines of the Anglo-French agreement . This was followed by treaties of the same tenor with Germany , Switzerland , Portugal , and Great Britain , and it was announced that assurances had been received from Italy , Russia , Mexico , and other powers , that they were ready to negotiate similar treaties . The arbitration treaties were submitted to the Senate in December last , but were amended in such a way as to render them unacceptable to the President . The first protest against them came from certain Southern Senators , who feared that under their terms the foreign holders of the repudiated bonds of some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was therefore proposed to amend the treaties so as to preclude any such possibility . Such an amendment might have been agreed upon , but opposition of a wholly different character soon developed . The interpretation put by the executive upon one clause of the treaties seemed to strike a blow at the constitutional prerogatives of the Senate . The difficulty arose as to the meaning of the word " agreement " in the second article , which reads as follows : " In each individual case the high contracting parties , before appealing to the Permanent Court of Arbitration , shall conclude a special agreement defining clearly the matter in dispute , the scope of the powers of the arbitrators , and the  | periods to be fixed for the formation of the arbitral tribunal and the several stages of the procedure . " The question was raised as to whether the term " agreement " meant the same as treaty and required the concurrence of the Senate , or whether the President could make such an agreement without the consent of the Senate . When it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view , an amendment was proposed substituting the word " treaty " for " agreement " in the article quoted above . This amendment not only met the objection raised by the Southern Senators , but further safeguarded the constitutional prerogatives of the Senate , that body holding that the passage of the treaties in the original form would amount to a practical delegation of the treaty-making powers of the Senate to the President . From a constitutional point of view this position was undoubtedly sound . The President showed no small degree of impatience and even of irritation at this proposed action of the Senate , and in a letter to Senator Cullom , chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations , dated February 10 , stated his views at length . He said : " If the word " agreement " were retained it would be possible for the Department of State to do as , for instance , it has already done under the Hague treaty in the Pious Fund arbitration case with Mexico , and submit to arbitration such subordinate matters as by treaty the Senate had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a jurisdiction limited by the general treaty of arbitration . If the word " treaty " be substituted , the result is that every such agreement must be submitted to the Senate ; and these general arbitration treaties would then cease to be such , and , indeed , in their amended form they amount to a specific pronouncement against the whole principle of a general arbitration treaty . " The President added that if the proposed amendment were adopted he would not refer the treaties back to the other powers for ratification , for in the amended form " then probably represent not a step forward , but a slight step backward as regards the question of international arbitration . " The President 's protest was of no avail . On February 11 the Senate ratified the treaties in the amended form , the amendment being adopted by a vote of 50 to 9 . The nine votes sustaining the President were cast by the members of the Committee on  | page deleted                  @ @ @
