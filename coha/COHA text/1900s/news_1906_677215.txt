txt Mayor McClellan gave out to the newspapers last night a letter he has sent to Senator Horace White , at Albany , in which he declares his opposition to the Elsberg Rapid Transit bill , and gives his reasons for opposing it . The Mayor says , in brief , that while he is in favor of legislation which permits ( he italicizes the word in his letter ) the city to resort to municipal operation of rapid transit lines in case of need , he is opposed to having the city compelled to embark on municipal operation . Aside from the general objections to this , New York is in no financial condition to un- , dertake such operation , and , moreover , such an act will delay the building of more subways , now sadly needed . The Mayor seems to indicate that he would favor the City Club 's substitute for the Elsberg bill . He cites in support of his attitude the city 's experience in the electric ILThting contracts . In his letter the Mayor incidentally advocates a change in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be filled by appointment by the Mayor , and Commissionersluips shall not be for life , thus changing the self-perpetuating character of the board . He asks further that the powers of city authorities for dealing with city railroads be increased . " If the Legislature will thus strengthen the hand of the city , " he says , " I believe that many of the present difficulties in dealing with these corporations and most of the dangers resulting from the concentration of the control of the transit facilities of the city will disappear . " Here is the Mayor 's letter in full : THE MAYOR 'S LETTER . Feb. 26 , 1906 . Hon. Horace White , Chairman Committee on Cities , The Senate , Albany , N. Y. Sir : I have the honor to offer for the consideration of your Committee the following statement of my views regarding certain questions involved in Senate Bill No. 8 , introduced by Senator Elsberg , commonly known as the " Elsberg Rapid Transit Bill . " The exceptional gravity of these questions is my justification for departing from my usual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in advance of their siThinission to me for action as Mayor . , As I understand it , the basic feature of the proposed legislation , which has been present in the Elsberg Rapid Transit bill in every form which it has taken , is the repeal of the provision of the Rapid Transit act which requires that no rapid transit line shall be constructed except under a contract which provides not only for its construction , but for its equipment and operation . Stated in other words the:proposition is that the Rapid Transit Commission shall be relieved from its present . disability of not being able to use the funds of the city for the construction of a new rapid transit line until it has secured a tenant who is willing to equip and operate it upon terms acceptable to the city . Equally important is the question whether the Rapid Transit Commission , having been relieved from the disability above mentioned , should be free , acting with the approval of the Board of Estimate and Apportionment , to determine in each case as it arises , whether the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and operation of a new subway line , or whether the separation of the contract for equipment and operation from the contract for construction shall be compulsory . The advocates of the latter view apparently concede that its adoption by the Legislature will almost inevitably lead to the municipal operation of rapid transit lines ; indeed , that ultimate result seems to be the chief object which they have in view in advocating what may be termed the extreme form of the Elsberg bilL The discussion of this legislation , accordingly , involves the subject of municipal operation in its most concrete form . City 's Finances inadequate . I am In favor of all legislation which increases the powers of the local authorities , which , in other words , extends the principle of home rule . I am opposed to all legislation which either directly or indirectly seeks to limit the powers of the local authorities . I am in favor of legislation which permits the city to resort to municipal operation of rapid transit lines in case of need . I am opposed to legislation intended to compel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have stated publicly on more than one occasion , I do not favor extending the field of municipal operation of public utilities in New York City , except in oases where private capital will not meet the reasonable needs of the people of the city upon fair terms . I accordingly regard as objectionable legislation which either compels the city to engage in the municipal operation of rapid transit lines or which so hampers the public authorities in securing the investment of private capital in rapid transit lines that municipal operation will become the only practical means of meeting the city 's needs for additional rapid transit facilities . Apart from the general objections to the radical extension of municipal operation to public utilities of large cities , which are too familiar to call for restatement at this time , there are objections , // MAYOR OPPOSES ELSBER6 RAPID TRANSIT BILL jurisdiction , not of the Rapid Transit Commission , but of the proper department of the city government . I take this opportunity of again reverting to the propriety of a change in the constitution of the Rapid Transit Commission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acting independently of the city administration , and as such is contrary to our ideas of municipal government . Fortunately for the city , the members of the board from the outset have been chosen from our ablest and most public-spirited citizens , and no words of mine are needed to express the public commendation of the members of the board for their fidelity and the ability with which they have discharged their duties . While I believe that the present members of the board should be permitted to continue in office , so that the city may have the benefit of their wisdom and experience in dealing with the grave problems now pending before them , I suggest that after some date in the future , say Jan. 1 , 1910 , every vacancy among the members of the board who are not . officers/Of the city should be filled by appointment by the Mayor . The terms of office of- the members of the board who are not officers of the city should be of long duration and for varying periods , so that but one member should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would retain its present qualities of non-partisanship , independence , and immunity from any sudden change in its personnel , while at the same time it would be a branch of the City Government , and as such directly responsible to the people of the city . I also believe that the Legislature should confer upon the City Government enlarged powers of dealing with and regulating the corporations operating elevated , surface , and underground lines within its limits . Not only is the control over these corporations now vested in the public authorities entirely Inadequate , but the present division of power between the local authorities and the State Railroad Commission is each year becoming more unsatisfactory to the pepple of the city . All powers of regulation and control in respect of these corporations which the Legislature Is willing to confer upon public authorities should be concentrated either in the Rapid Transit Commission and the Board of Estimate and Apportionment , or in a special board or officer of the City Government constituted for the purpose . If the Legislature will thus strengthen the hand of the city I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these corporations and most of the dangers resulting from the concentration of the control of the transit facilities of the city will disappear . I may add that whatever action may be taken by the Legislature upon this recommendation the municipal authorities should be allowed to retain their present control over contracts which involve franchises or leases involving the use of the streets and other property of the city . Respectfully . GEORGE B. McCLELLAN , Mayor . BOTH FOR ELSBERG BILL . Republican Club and Citizens ' Union City Committee Indorse It . Both the Republican Club and the Citizens ' Union City Committee indorsed the Elsberg Rapid Transit bill last night at meetings of their respective organizations . William M. Ivins and Frank Hendrick led the fight for the measure in the Republican Club meeting . Both of them go to Albany to-day as part of a delegation to urge the passage of the measure . James L. Wells of the Bronx , who also goes to Albany to-day at the heed of a Bronx delegation , but in opposition to the bill , spoke against it and urged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Elsberg bill in its present form would delay the building of further subways to the Bronx for ten years . Mr. Hendrick criticised Edward M. Shepard for representing the . Pennsylvania Railroad and other traction interests , when he recently had been attorney for the Rapid Transit Board . At the meeting of the Citizens ' Union City Committee the bill was favored by the Committee on Legislation and was indorsed . The Ballot Reform bill was also indorsed . The Union 's County Committee was organized by the election of James Eustis as Chairman and James Allen as Secretary . The Manhattan Borough Committee organized by selecting Augustus H. Stebbins as Chairman and William J. Verplanck Secretary . CATALO WAS MIGHTY TOUGH . But It Was Nine Years Old , " Buffalo " Jones Told Canadian Camp . Catalo was served at the fourth annual dinner of the Canadian Camp in the Hotel Astor last night . Rhinoceros , bear , and polar mice were the offerings on the three former occasions . Last night 's piece de resistance was supplied by " Buffalo " Jones of wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escaped unhurt . Indeed , he spoke and showed moving pictures of a mountain lion hunt . Catalo Is said to be a cross between buffalo and cattle . The first three letters come from " cattle , " and the last three from " buffalo . " There 's no getting around the fact that last night 's catalo was tough . Was it with design that " Buffalo " Jones waited till after it was eaten to tell the diners that it was nine years old when killed on Dec. 13 , and had not had a thing to eat for the month previous , except what it could root up out of snow a foot deep ? " Buffalo " Jones , who was Warden in Yellowstone Park when President Roosevelt went out there , says he is responsible for the catalo hybrid . Once a wholesale slaughterer of buffalo , he made up his mind that the breed had to be saved . To save it he crossed it with cattle . President Roosevelt wrapped himself up in a catalo skin when he was in the West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 've got something that beats a buffalo robe ! " the President told the Warden . There were 300 men and women at the feast last night . At the bottom of the menu card were sketches of three " antiquities "  --  " Prince Henry 's Bcirnean rhinoceros , " " Grover 's bear , " and " Peary 's polar mice .

Wise , and Charles Hallock. // peculiar to New York City , to legislation compelling the extension of municipal operation to rapid transit lines which are , in my judgment , controlling .. Favors All Home Rule Measures . The city is not financially in a position to enter upon a policy of municipal operation . While there seems to be a wide difference of opinion as to the amount of money which the city could expend in the next few years for purposes of rapid transit without exceeding the present constitutional debt limit , one thing is - certain  --  that any investment of the city 's funds in municipally operated subways would practically exhaust the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funds for many other improvements which are imperatively needed . I am reliably informed that one completely equipped four-track rapid transit subway from the Battery to proper terminal in the Borough of the Bronx would cost at least $35,000,000 , and that adequate subway connections between the Borough of Manhattan and the Boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens would cost $75,000,000 more . The estimated cost of the three longitudinal subway lines on Manhattan Island , recently approved by the Rapid Transit Commission and now before the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court for the First Department , is between $95 , - 000,000 and $100,000,000 . No municipally operated rapid transit system would be of material advantage to the public unless it were sufficiently comprehensive to meet the requirements of the districts intended to be served . For instance , any longitudinal subway in Manhattan would have to extend the entire length of the island and have appropriate feeders north of the Harlem , in order to be of substantial service to the Boroughs of Manhattan and the Bronx , and any subway system connecting the Borough of Manhattan with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distance in the latter boroughs in order to meet the needs of their inhabitants . It is , therefore , evident that if the city embarks at all upon the construction of municipally operated subways it will find itself committed to an enormous expenditure . It is urged by the advocates of municipal operation of rapid , transit lines that the Constitution should be amended so that the city 's obligations issued far rapid transit purposes should not count against the debt limit . Regarding that suggestion , it is sufficient to say that it is the duty of the present administration of the city to make its plans with a view to the existing limitations upon the city 's sorrowing capacity , and that the question affecting the city 's credit involved in any proposition for a constitutional amendment radically increasing the city 's borrowing power are too important to oe decided without the ' fullest public discussion of the possible consequences of such a step . The objections against legislation compelling the municipal operation of rapid transit lines exist with almost equal force against amendments to the Rapid Transit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Rapid Transit Commission and the Board of Estimate and Apportionment with respect to the terms of leases and other features of contracts made under the Rapid Transit act , that it would be difficult , if not impossible , to secure an adequate extension of the city 's rapid transit facilities by means of private capital . The Rapid Transit Commission and the Board of Estimate and Apportionment should ' have substantially the same liberty of action with respect to the terms of contracts as is conferred by the present law , to the end that in the case of each proposed new rapid transit line they may fix such terms as may be necessary to secure its construction and operation by private capital with due regard to the protection of the interests of the city . Too sharp a limitation upon the maximum duration of operating leases of new rapid transit lines might make It impossible to secure any additional rapid transit lines , especially in the outlying and less thickly populated portions of the city in which rapid transit lines , while imperatively needed by the residents of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as lines in the more densely populated portions of the city . The city authorities should be free to deal with each situation as it arises , and to vary the terms of the contracts in accordance with - the requirements of each case . All recognize that additional rapid transit facilities are urgently needed . Whether they can be secured upon fair terms to the city by means of private capital can soon be ascertained if the Rapid Transit Commission is allowed to continue the efforts which it now has in hand , while to abandon those efforts at this time and embark upon the experiment of constructing subways for municipal operation would almost certainly postpone the clay of relief for several years . Having pointed out some of my reasons for believing that the city should not be placed in a position which would compel it to resort to municipal operation of rapid transit lines . I wish to say that I am heartily in favor of legislation which would confer upon the city the power to construct additional rapid transit lines on its own account and to provide for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ municipal operation , in case it is found impossible to secure the construction and operation of necessary rapid transit lines by private capital upon terms which are fair to the city . The city should not be left to the mercy of the corporations which control the existing elevated , surface , and Subway lines of the city , nor to the mercy of private capital in any other form . I firmly believe that if the city is given the power to equip and operate rapid transit lines , in case other means fail , private capital will be forthcoming for the construction and operation of the needed extension of our rapid transit facilities upon terms which will be advantageous to the city , and which in the end will yield the city greater revenue than could be secured from municipal operation . In this connection it must be remembered that any rapid transit lines constructed under the Rapid Transit act must be constructed for , and owned by , the city , and that the contract of their operation by private corporations must be limited to a term of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city during the period of the lease . An excellent illustration of the efficacy of municipal operation as a weapon against corporate aggression is furnished by the recent experience of the city in dealing with the gas and electric light companies . Within a few months after the city planned to erect a municipal lighting plant the corporations which for years had imposed their own terms upon the city reversed their attitude and offered to do the municipal lighting at prices which a few years before would have been treated almost as a public benefaction . I have confined myself to the discussion of the underlying principles involved in the pending rapid transit legislation and have purposely avoided a number of important subsidiary questions the consideration of which more properly falls upon the law officer of the city , I may add , however , that I am heartily in favor of such legislation as will permit , whenever the streets are opened for " the construction of additional subway lines , the construction of underground conduits and Pipe galleries . Such conduits and pipe galleries should , however , be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
