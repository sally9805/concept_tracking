I feel sure that every careful thinker will agree with me in regretting the proposed policy of the city authorities in postponing action in regard to a number of small parks which were just about to be added to the map of the city . Take any pleasant afternoon . Where do the countless children of this vast metropolis love to throng ? In the public parks . Look at the elevated road , the Subway , the trolley system on a glorious day like last Sunday . Where are the multitudes of pleasure-seekers going ? To the vast areas of our city 's parks -- Bronx , crotona , Van Cortlandt . What does the city dweller demand almost as his right ? That the authorities will give him and his family breathing space on hot nights , leafy trees to rest under , public playgrounds that will keep his little ones off from the streets and away from under the cruel wheels of the raging automobile .
