txt The famous old Gilsey House , at Broadway and Twenty-ninth Street . for more than thirty years the temporary home of visitors from all over the United States loud distinguished guests from abroad and a New York landmark , closed its  --  doors to the public last night at 8:30 o'clock , after having dismissed the 180 guests gathered under its roof . The dining rooms were minus waiters and the halls divested of bellboys . The bar was closed , its stock having been carted away , and the cigar stand was only a reminiscence . The big hostelry that had been dwarfed by the towering hotels which have sprung up all over the city in its neighborhood was deserted save by the few men who were busy slacking up things tbbe removed , w and a band of old-time guests who objected . even the watchman ? seemeti overcome with the general depression . ' The closing of the hotel came ffi.s a complete surprise to the guests of the old house . The first they knew that they were to seek other quarters was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guests must leave by 8:30 in the evening , taking their effects with them . Bellboys were sent , with similar messages , to the people who happened to be in their rooms . It was snowing outdoors ; and the prospect was not inviting . A. R. Keene who , with P. J. Lancaster , as the Seaboard Hotel Company , conducted the hotel under a lease with the Gilsey estate , telephoned to neighboring hotels asking them to shelter his guests , as he had received a dispossess notice . In less time than it takes to tell it there were invitations from hotels for blocks around , one of the hotels going 's ? far as to offer reduced rates to the Gilsey guests . An old gentleman with the gout , who lived on the third floor , had two of the bellboys and a porter getting his belongings together , . while he indulged in the joy of swearing at them for their clumsiness , and later paid them handsomely for their service . The chambermaids were equally busy , aiding women ( guests in packing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the /Nip of the hotel , eighty-five in nuipber , were losing their places , they seemed to feel that Christmas with its gifts had come early and at a time when there was more than the usual number of guests in the house . They seemed to regard the exodus rather as a holiday affair . The real trouble came about 6 o'clock , as people were returning ' to the hotel for dinner . ' They learned that there was to be no dinner , and that instead of preparing to go to the theatre they must pack up their belongings and find beds elsewhere . Twenty porters from other hotels , loaned for the occasion , and  --  rewarded ? ' wth extra wages , helped in getting the guests of the Gilsey away with their belongings . A few minutes after a o'clock the ? clerks ruled off the blotter of the hotel and announced that the hotel was closed . The lights were then put out and preparations were made to vacate the hostelry . Gathering in groups in the corridor were many old guests who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were Henry Crickmore , the clerk at the weighing scales at Morris-Park : Major Sat J. Dougherty , Judge S. S. Thomas , J. E. Humfreyvile , and Henry Van Syckell . They talked about the closing up , and then David Newmeyer , lawyer , approached them and said he desired it to be known that Mr. Keene had said his connection with the hotel was in no way responsible for the affair . Louis 0 . Van Doren , lawyer , then approached and stated that he represented the Seaboard Hotel Company . He said that they had peen served  --  with a notice to vacate . He said that the company had done their best . Several hints about leaving were then made to those standing about , and then " Al " Smith , who acted as spokesman , said : " You can turn out all the lights . I own the furniture in my room . This hotel has always been my home . I do not expect to have you look me in here , and if any one attempts to lock the doors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and they will do it at their own peril . " Mr. Humfreyville then spoke up and said : " There will be war if they try to put me out . " Others spoke the same way , and the lawyers and clerks were at a loss as to what to do . A visit was made to the offices of the Gilsey estate , at 1,193 Broadway , and they were found dark . When they returned . George Barrett , the engineer who has been in charge since the hotel was opened , stated that he had been authorized by th Gilsey estate to assume charge of the machinery . The lawyers then turned over to him the keys of the hotel and left , first turning out every light in the hotel . The men who had been sitting around on the chairs were left in darkness , and finally one of them discovered a small gas jet which was used for lighting cigars . This was lighted , and then they found several gas jets which were lighted , and they sat around in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Street Station heard of the abandonment of the hotel and sent two detectives to investigate . Policeman Serenin was sent then to the hotel , with orders to allow nothing to be disturbed . The men who had made plans to stay in their roans all night discovered that there were no gas jets in their rooms , and they sent messengers to Seventh Avenue and procured lamps . At a late hour no representative of the estate had appeared at the hotel , and preparations were being made by those who remained to go to their rooms . The elevators were also shut down and the lights in the hall had been extinguished , and the men were compelled to walk to their rooms through the dark halls , carry ? mg lamps . The management , as lessees of the hotel , bad for some years been in trouble with the Gilsey estate over the payment of the annual rental of $75,000 . James R.
