 | ON every hand modern woman shows signs of unrest and seems secretly or avowedly dissatisfied with the time-honored , circumscribed sphere of the " womanly woman . " This is true in spite of the fact that the oldtime gentlewoman is still much lauded , and the tentatively progressive woman of almost every sort is much inveighed against . It must be confest , however , that in the voluminous discourses against the " modern woman " little account is usually taken of the deep-rooted , fundamental conditions developed in the course of social evolution , which are responsible for this widespread and growing unrest . Two classes of women generally escape censure : the poverty-pinched drudges who are forced to serve as wives , mothers and bread-winners , because wedded to incompetent or indigent husbands , or to workmen who are unable single-handed to keep the wolf from the door ; and the plain housewife , who strictly attends to household duties without aspiring to have pursuits or interests which overlap those man has long claimed to be exclusively his own . A mere glance over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the plain housewife is rapidly disappearing , and is being superseded by a conspicuous minority of restless , ambitious , half-educated , hobbyriding women on the one hand , and by the submerged majority of sober , dutyloving women on the other , who are nevertheless secretly dissatisfied with the role of mere housewife . And , strange as it may seen , not only the plain housewife , but the privileged " lady " is also become disaffected , and for her there is perhaps least sympathy . Originally " lady " meant the one who baked the bread , but in the course of social evolution it came to mean the one who neither baked nor did any other useful service . Until a very recent period the ideal lady possessed personal charm and beauty ; learned all the subtler arts of consumption and idleness ; had no duties which involved personal service , except to her lord and master ; and was wifely , i. e. , possessed a modicum of the virtue with which tradition endowed the angel . Her mental development was restricted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and if she ventured to reach beyond this intellectual boundary she transgressed the traditional laws of womanliness . In short , while man 's habits and education have tended to give him mental discipline and scientific methods of work . the training of woman still tends to develop her feelings ( the heart ) at the expense of all else . The result is that her natural emotions ? love , hate , envy , jealousy , and temper ? modified by subtlety and subterfuge ( the pre-eminently female characteristics in the animal as well as human world ) are highly developed along with self-sacrifice , patience , longsufferance and timidity . And the inveterate claim of man has been , and still is largely true , that woman is an instinctive and intuitive being , and is not vet become a thinking , reasoning one . Clearly the role of " lady " has developed a code of morals which are strictly domestic , and woman 's primary impulsion ? even exceeding that of motherhood ? is to win , please , cajole and minister to the hus band ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now if women had persistently been educated in convents , and taught nothing beyond the refinements of life , they might perhaps have remained docile and content . But the average young American woman , especially if college bred leads a life of mental unfolding and progression abreast with young men , up to the time of marriage . Many of the higher occupations have been thrown open to her ; and if she does not find a congenial mate early in life , she avails herself of these opportunities and finds much satisfaction in useful employment and pecuniary independence . But such women , who abound in America , are often nevertheless restive and acquire all sorts of idiosyncrasies , and physicians  | tell us in time dewlap organic and nervous diseases or become apathetically unsexed , largely because they lead abnormal , unnatural lives , repressing their reproductive impulses . After marriage the man 's course in life is continued aggression , acquisition and competition , involving a thousand public and industrial issues , which absorb his chief interests ; while the course of the married woman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally one of social and mental inhibitions . Forthwith she must lock-step with all other respectable married women ; sink or conceal her talents , unless they be in the nature of accomplishments ; and short-chain her interests to meet the requirements of conventional , domestic or decorative life . This doubtless is why after a lapse of years , when the glow of love has cooled , mental incompatibility often develops , and marriage rarely fulfils the hopes of youthful enthusiasm and passion , although married couples are usually eager to screen their incompatibility . Discontent is especially prevalent among women who have tasted economic independence and the satisfaction of financial acquisition . To many such women their cup is not without gall , when suddenly they become dependent upon the bounty or niggardliness , as the case may be , of the husband . How many of us have heard the modern bourgeois husband , drunken with the consciousness of his possessions , vaunting his generosity and magnanimity by declaring that his wife and daughters may buy anything they wish ? as tho buying , or possessing things bought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decreeing that ' hey restrict their activities to domestic and ornamental life . And , again , we have all known the husband who draws he purse-stirngs so tight that the wife has been driven to pick his pocket for a little pin-money . The desire to participate in what men call " the game of life " has fastened itself upon many modern women , and their appetites are whetted for more abundant and diverting interests than the mere humdrum of household duties . Probably the fact that the churches offer opportunities for the feeble indulgence of these tastes , more than religious zeal , explains why women have monopolized most of the church work , and dote upon fairs , bazars , rummage sales , church suppers , and musical and histrionic entertainments . And in all likelihood this also accounts for their flocking to women 's clubs and collectively dabbling in all the arts and sciences , acquiring still more superficial habits of mind to add to a preliminary impractical and unassimilated education . Yet none are more keenly aware of the vapidity of these semi-social-intellectual diversions than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sophistry is " It is better than nothing , and what else can we do ? " Doubtless , moreover , this is why the modern society woman , altho often pampered and permitted to fritter her time in luxurious indulgences and gaieties , while her husband may be working from dawn until dark to keep her abreast of her compeers , is nevertheless complaining and dissatisfied . Only recently a distinguished professor ? who , I infer , believes that in order to solve the woman question , women must learn to emulate their grandmothers , be more content , and bear more children gave me an excellent illustration of the lamentable refractory tendencies and secret discontent of present-day young women : Two excellent student girls , after graduating from college , returned to a home of luxury , where every material desire could be gratified . They had social position , and , after leading brilliant ornamental lives for several years , and no satisfactory opportunity of marriage having come to either of them , they became extremely discontented . Indeed , the learned professor was much shocked when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vapidity of their lives , and declared that they would gladly abandon all their luxuries for the privilege of leading really useful , active lives . The professor remonstrated with them kindly and recommended that they do a little genteel charity work in their community . Very likely , however , these same young women had previously been taught by one of the professor 's colleagues that the indiscriminate charity of well-meaning ladies is today considered a great detriment to society . The present conditions among modern  | women are perhaps best summarized by Professor Thomas in Sex and Society " " The American woman of the better class 's has superior rights and no duties , and yet she is worrying herself to death ? not over specific troubles , but because she has lost her connection with reality . Many women , mutt ' Intl agent and energetic than their husbands and brothers , have no more serious occupation than to play the house-cat , with or without ornament ; that more of them do not break with the system entirely is due solely to the inhibitive effects of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to boast of the " freedom " and advancement of their women ! If they restricted their boasting to the indulgence of young , unmarried women and children , the world would unquestionably agree that none are so privileged and pampered , and doubtless , if frank , would add that none , as a class , are so ill-bred . Because of romantic love as the basis of American marriage as against European property marriage , the American wife generally becomes pecuniarily dependent . And , inasmuch as there are no hide-bound class distinctions to prevent her from leaping suddenly from the lowest to the highest social ranks , there are consequently a very large proportion of them restricted to conventional , refined living , i. e. , they may not reach out and participate in any industrial pursuit , and remain highly respectable . In Europe the upper class women are provided with dowries . They have therefore the satisfaction of pecuniary independence and of contributing directly to the support of the family . Among the middle and lower classes we find a very large percentage co-operating with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general , as well or better trained and cared for than American children . Recall , for example , the myriad of irresistible little shops all over Europe , with the dwellings above or in the rear , which are managed conjointly by man and wife . Again , consider the European small restaurants ? those charming , little , spotless establishments where one almost invariably finds well-cooked and inexpensive food , the like of which is not to be found in America . During the hours of serving meals the wife , dressed modestly but faultlessly , is at the desk , while the husband is supervising the seating and servrug of the guests . During the intervening hours they plan and advise win ' tile head cook and head waiter , and the wornan never falls to land time to look after their private apartment and flock . I n the smaller village inns , the wife ticrscli does the cooking and the husband serves the guests . There is , of course , greater economic stress in the Old World which often forces wives to a burdensome cooperation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with that of the opprest lower classes . It is , however , unquestionable that the wife , who by reasonable collaboration obtains more or less domestic and economic independence , is better satisfied than the one whose activities are restricted , and who is economically independent , even tho surrounded by luxury . The average middle class American wife of the village or city ? thanks to modern labor-saving inventions ? has a varying amount of leisure which she devotes vicariously to self-adornment , fancy work , the amateur practice of music or painting , church industrial or dramatic enterprises , or to a hodge-podge study and entertainment in woman 's clubs . Yet her leisure occupations do not satisfy her . If this ability and enterprise were scientifically and systematically trained and applied to worthy , practical achievement and social usefulness , it would doubtless improve the condition of woman , and would contribute to the betterment of society , and to the care and welfare of the family . Two of the best mothers I have ever known were women who combined outside labors with their domestic duties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without the aid of a servant . She is a faultless housekeeper , and has by common consent of her community accomplished more , in a quiet way , toward the civic housecleaning and improvement of a dirty , corrupt , MiddleWestern town than any other citizen in it . The other woman has creditably reared a family of eight . Besides housekeeping , sewing and supervising the school work of each of her children , this woman , during twelve years , supplemented her husband 's modest earnings by managing the village post office , and later transferred her outside activities to managing a small  | farm on the outskirts of the village . Of course , two hands and one head were not able to accomplish all this unaided . Her brood was a lively household regiment of trained workers and economists . Each from five years on was assigned certain duties , and in compensation received ample time for play and a small graduated salary with which to pay and manage in the main his personal expenses . Certainly in the work which belongs pre-eminently and indisputably to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and colleges are doing almost nothing to educate and fit women to perform the tasks for which they are fundamentally destined . Children are born and bred generally in a primitive , haphazard , burdensome fashion . Indeed , there is no more grievous protest than that of the so-called educated young woman , who , upon the coming of her first child , searches in vain amid the knowledge she has acquired for light and guidance to aid her in the supreme task of her life . From the moment when her child is born she is continuously , and usually blindly , experimenting ; rarely certain she is doing the right or best thing for her child . Moreover , in the ceaseless , unremitting watchfulness of the mother during the first years of the child 's life , which so frequently saps her strength and nervous energy , there is much waste . If every child could be deposited a few hours daily in a well-equipped community or co-operative nursery in charge of a trained nurse , who could give the mother expert advice and assistance , doubtless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the child would be infinitely more satisfactory than under present methods , and mothers would not so frequently be careworn and nerve-shattered . Indeed , when one realizes how great is the ceaseless strain and anxiety forced upon average mothers , one ceases to wonder why the bearing and rearing of children is become so unpopular alike with men and women . The solution of the harrowing servant problem ought also to belong to woman . Unquestionably as time goes on there will be fewer servants ; and , except for a limited number of labor-saving household improvements , little advancement has been made in methods of housekeeping . The farmer sows and reaps his grain riding on a two-horse machine ; but the farmer 's wife cooks , sews , keeps house and raises children about in the same haphazard , primitive fashion as her great-grandmother did , with no time or energy left to think of improved method or co-operation . The average town woman , however , has leisure , and , while common prejudice and case-hardened conservatism permit her to co-operate with other women in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not permit her unchallenged to co-operate with other women in practical , remunerative effort , or experiment with community nurseries , kitchens , kitchen gardens or cooking shops . We have had in America no sustained effort at reproducing the great cooking plant of Berlin , where food is prepared scientifically and attractively , and delivered promptly and systematically from heated wagons , to hundreds of people daily , at a minimum cost . Yet perhaps no other people is today suffering so much from lack of private cooks or good public eating places . Of course , the widening of all privileges , social , industrial and political , for women in America , must be made slowly , for not only is the bulwark of our prejudice great , but women in general are not ready for them ; and they themselves are most active in policing the traditional restricted conventions . There is still a commonly prevalent notion that women who reach beyond a strictly household or ornamental life necessarily become freakish or unfeminine ; also that with widened social and industrial activities for women , the charm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of marriage , would soon be eliminated . Indeed , the average man still clings tenaciously to the concept of woman as little physically and mentally weak and dependent , and fitted primarily to fill his play hours , at least until after courtship . This conviction has become as ingrained in him as the taste for adornment and coquetry in woman , and may not be wholly ignored . Nevertheless , the youthful ideal of woman eventually becomes shattered for nearly every man after marriage ; and most frequently he turns  | to the society of other men for relaxation and satisfactory diversion . In spite of the common extolling of American women , the average American man in his moments of candor laments that lie finds married women , in general , dull and uninteresting , after the charm of girlish coquetry has worn off , inasmuch as their mentality seems rarely developed beyond the high-school stage , and their tastes and interests are confined to household routine , dress , bridge , small social and literary functions , and puerile business enterprises in the churches . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which men are mainly concerned , American women rarely have any insight or interest . As for the growing body of modern thinking women , they are not asking to break radically with their past ; for of course the traditions and institutions of ages can not he ignored . Nor do they wish to cease to become wives , mothers and housekeepers . It is merely that they chafe under the present system of semisocial , industrial and political freedom , and find the shackles of half brokendown conservative ideals of feminine respectability dull , heavy and a great stumbling block to worthy progress . And it seems clear that only when men , who are still the masters and dictators , abandon their conventional prejudices and angel ideals , and treat women like natural , capable beings , will women in turn measure up to the standards required of them and become vastly more useful , interesting and companionable for the lifelong stretch . Then also will the institution of marriage become more stable and more generally satisfactory .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
