 | I WAS a sensitive , high-spirited woman of twenty-five , employed by one of the most prominent corporations in the United States , drawing a salary of fifteen hundred dollars a year , dressing and living well , when I married a clerk whose hours were long and whose income was fifteen dollars a week ; a man good and true as steel , who would have made a splendid husband for the right woman ; but we had not been married a week , when we each realized we had nothing in common , we were most uncongenial , our very natures seemed to clash . I loved Walter in a selfish way ; I realize that now . I wanted to be a good wife , but it seemed I could not . We boarded the first year , while I retained my position , then I resigned and we moved into a little , five-room apartment , paying thirty dollars per month . My husband was a man of quiet tastes , exquisitely neat , who craved a little , well-cared for corner which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , presided over by a systematic , cheerful and contented little woman who would have made it and him her pride . Such a woman would have been his queen and would have been treated as one ; but I hated domestic duties of any kind ; I was accustomed to being looked up to as a clever , brainy woman , and I could not gracefully come down to being , as I termed it then , a mere household drudge . I felt as though the very work was degrading , consequently I took no pride in my home and had no system or order . I would get up in the morning , get Walter 's breakfast , which would frequently be spoiled in the making , and it never occurred to me how much more appetizing things would be if daintily served . Many a time I would forget the butter or milk , but instead of troubling me he would quietly go and get them . I , myself , would usually go around with hair uncombed , shoes unbuttoned , and clad in a wrapper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reproach but a good-bye kiss and a " Take care of yourself , dear , " I would be alone at quarter to 8 in the morning . Instead of getting through my work , making myself neat and clean , and going out to do my marketing and for a breath of pure , fresh air , I would get a problem novel or a book on some occult subject and spend the whole morning deep in its perusal , often filling my brain full of morbid fancies . By 1 or 2 o'clock , perhaps , I would feel faint and would go to the icebox and take a cold bite of anything I might happen to find there , and it would frequently be 3 or 4 o'clock when our few breakfast dishes would be washed up and put away in a pantry that was never in order ; then I 'd make up the bed that had not been aired , and if it was Saturday I 'd take the carpetsweeper and clean ( ? ) the flat , forgetting the cobwebs on the ceiling , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the range that was never blacked , but I would make a pretense of dusting . I never thought to remove the newspapers until the pile covered a period of say three . weeks . At quarter past 6 Walter would be back , I would be tired and languid with doing nothing ; I might have combed my hair and buttoned my shoes , but still the same old wrapper . Yet I 'd be greeted with a kiss and a cheery " Heigho , , dear . " Then I would start to tell about the way the butcher 's boy had failed to bring the ribroast in time to be cooked for supper , and now we 'd have to have fried eggs ? would that do ? " Why , yes , that 's all right , anything . I 'm sorry you worried about it . " I 'd go and fry some eggs and with them serve hard , salt bacon , greasy Saratoga potatoes , and muddy coffee or something of the kind . Not a word of complaint . While supper was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about some trifling thing ; after the meal was over Walter would help me clear the table and would wash the dishes while I dried them ; it never entered my mind that having been on his feet all day , he might be tired and need rest . Instead of getting his smoking jacket and slippers and drawing a comfortable chair close to a good light that he might rest and read his evening paper , I accepted his helps and petting as a matter of course . I craved admiration and love , but never thought of exerting myself in an effort to become more lovable or attractive . After the supper things were put away , my husband would say : " Grace , dear , put on a neat little dress and let 's call @#  | on the Blanks . " And I , instead of cheery response would make some such reply as this : " 0 , dear me , I should think you 'd want to stay at home once in a while ; you 're away all day . " Perhaps he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in three months or more . " Besides , the Blanks are such stupid people ; they bore me dreadfully ; I feel this way : if we can not go with clever people we had better spend the time with books and in the company of our own thoughts . " So we would stay at home . Walter would read the p ' per , while I sat gazing at the ceiling ; after an hour or so we would go to bed . Sunday morning Walter would be up early and give the little place a thorough cleaning ; it was his only time , and we could n't afford to have it done . Instead of being grateful , I resented his doing it and told him he was interfering with my affairs . He would simply reply , " I want to help you , dear " and go ahead . I would thereupon sulk the whole day . One morning Walter said to me : " Grace , wo n't you put on a fresh wrapper , clean your teeth , and comb your hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you how I crave a clean , neat little home and a neat , cheery little wife at its head . " Then with a kiss he left me for work . It was riot much , I know , but it was the first bit of censure he had given me in the two years we had been married . I felt the rebuke , it stung to the quick . I cried and cried until nearly 11 o'clock ; by that time I had planned my campaign : I started in to clean . I cleaned the ceilings , the walls , the floors ; I washed the windows , put up fresh curtains . I blacked the range , scoured the sink and the icebox , rearranged the pantries , put clean linen on the table and bed , and did what I had never done before-sewed a button on the band of his shirt and darned a pair of socks . By this time it was late , so I bathed , combed my hair , cleaned my teeth and my nails and put on a gown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clean white apron . Then I prepared the daintiest supper I knew how . I soon heard the click of a key , and Walter came in with a whistle . I went and met him . He put his arms around me and said : " How sweet you are tonight ! The little place looks fine ? a home a man can feel proud of . " Here might have been the beginning of happier days , had I acted rightly . " I am glad things suit you , for once , I nearly killed myself doing it ; " this I said to the man who had really never uttered a complaint . His face fell . " I am disappointed ; I never wanted you to do more than your strength would allow ? all I ask is , that you do what you can and what you feel like doing , and that you are clean and neat when I come home at night . " I felt as if I had been terribly abused , and my heart was broken , and also another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse for another year . A baby boy came to us , but even he did n't have the effect of drawing us closer together , though we idolized little Charley . Two years later came a little girl , Edith ; still we were drifting farther apart . Walter came and went with seldom a word to me , he ate his meals in silence , played with the babies until they were put to bed , then he would light a cigar and would go out for an hour or two , come in and silently go to bed . No matter how untidy I might happen to look , he never seemed to notice it any more , and the very indifference was crushing me . I realized that we were becoming almost strangers , yet I made no effort to . correct matters , not understanding that I held the power in my own hands . My husband now got a position in another establishment at just double his former salary , and for the babies ' sake we moved to the suburbs . Soon Walter had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was never at home save to eat and sleep , and he seemed far happier than formerly ; I had lost the power to annoy him . I noticed the growing indifference and began to realize that his love for me was dying . The awakening was a terrible ordeal . I saw the end not far off if things were not changed at once ; divorce had ever been a disgrace in my mind , but I saw that was more than likely to be the climax , if radical measures were not taken at once . I spent the most of a day trying to grasp Walter 's idea of the ideal wife and mother . That night , neat and tidy , I met him at the door with a smile and a kiss . He looked surprised , but said nothing . I had a nice little supper waiting . He ate it quietly , then went out . I choked back a sob as I saw him go without proffering a kiss , but I had formed my plans and I was determined to stick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came  | back at 11 o'clock , I looked up from the book I was reading and said : " What , back so early , dear ? " One cold , rainy Saturday night , I felt sure Walter would not want to go out , so I warmed his slippers and smoking jacket and drew a comfortable arm chair up before the grate , but said nothing . After supper he noticed them and remarked : " Did you put these here for me ? Thank you , dear . And say , do you know you look awfully sweet to-night " ? I had-picked a sprig of scarlet geranium and had placed it in my hair ? " you are getting to be more like your old self every day . " I laughed : " I am glad , Walter . " I could not say another word , I , was so happy . My reward had come . From that day , every little household duty became a pleasure . I had learned the way , and my every move became a labor of love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our home and neatness and order followed . Laughter and joy crowded out whining and gloom ; gradually my husband began to stay in nights . When he did go out I would say : " Have a good time , honey . " When he stayed at home I would be jolly and there would be music or some other pleasant diversion . Soon he remained at home altogether , except when he took me with him : The old love had returned and no happier woman could be found . @# The last two years have been a continuous honeymoon , It was hard at first ; I had been petulant , irritable and disagreeable so long that it had become my very nature , and it was slow work . Many a secret cry I had while waiting for the results that it seemed would never come , but I had determined upon my course and stuck to it , knowing that it was the only way , and my reward is even greater than I had dared hope for . We are chums together now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward making us each appreciate our new-found happiness the more . If by this recital I can start even one little bride aright I shall not regret the past . I know you who have always been good wives and homemakers are sitting in severe condemnation upon me , but it is not for you I am laying my heart bare , but for the thousands who , like me , have married with high ideals and the best of intentions , but who have failed through the want of knowing how , and from not realizing how great a factor is neatness and order in the home and cleanliness and neatness of person , in the average husband 's mind . Let me add : do n't put him to the test for eight years , for ere then you may have lost him from your hearthstone forever . All men are not as patient or as true to their marriage vows as Walter .
