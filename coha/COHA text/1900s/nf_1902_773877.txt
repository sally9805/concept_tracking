In London he married a lady of great attractions , and became very much in request as a teacher . After eleven years ' residence in England he returned to his native land and bought some property , but he continued to be more or less active in musical matters until his death in 1838 . His compositions numbered about one hundred and eighty , but though they are modelled after Beethoven they lack the inspiration which distinguished that great master 's works . Frederick William Michael Kalkbrenner was a talented and fashionable pianist and teacher at the early part of the nineteenth century . His father was a musician of some reputation , who , in the fulfilment of his engagements , was obliged to travel a great deal . During one of these journeys our pianist was born , in a post-chaise , and apparently a considerable portion of his infancy was spent in Beethoven and His Contemporaries . 61 similar conveyances , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him through Italy , a tour which lasted two years . Kalkbrenner was talented as a child , and at five years of age played a concerto of Haydn 's before the Queen of Prussia , while at thirteen he completed his course of three years at the Paris Conservatoire , taking the prize for pianoforte playing . He was also an accomplished linguist , speaking four languages when he was eight years old . In his career Haydn took a great deal of interest , and it was on his advice that Kalkbrenner 's father sent the young man to Vienna , at a time when he had associated himself in Paris with some of the gayest youths in the city , and had given himself up to a career of dissipation . Here he settled down to hard work , and spent much of his leisure time in the company of Haydn , Beethoven , Hummel , and Clementi .

In Paris he lived for ten years , and was mar ried to a wealthy and high-born lady . He lived in grand style and associated with the foremost people in the world of art . His concert tours in Germany , Holland , and Belgium brought him applause and honours , and he was considered a great artist . Not-withstanding this reputation , it is certain that he was vain , and somewhat unscrupulous in his methods . For instance , he is said to have spoken of himself as the only great improviser of the day , and to have given , as improvisations , compositions of his own which were already published . He proposed Beethoven and His Contemporaries . 63 to Chopin , who was then a young man , that Chopin should bind himself to him for three years , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Chopin was even then far superior to Kalkbrenner as a pianist and a musician . Kalkbrenner died of cholera , at Enghien , in 1849 . His compositions are not very numerous , and are well written , but dull in spite of their showiness . An amusing anecdote is told at the expense of Kalkbrenner , who was very conceited and patronising , and given to aping the perfect gentleman . Mendelssohn , Hiller , Chopin , and Liszt dressed themselves in beggarly style and waited for him in front of a cafe just before the hour at which he would visit the place . Presently he came strutting along , and as soon as he reached the place at which they stood , they surrounded him and greeted him in the most unceremonious and boisterous manner . Although he was evidently disgusted at being so familiarly ad64 Famous Pianists . dressed by such a group of tatterdemalions they kept close to him and added to his torture by making a good deal of noise , so that in the course of time a large crowd gathered in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who did not disperse until they had enjoyed his misery for a long time . It is related by Mr. John Edward Cox that the four great pianists , Hummel , Kalkbrenner , Moscheles and Cramer , once met at the house of a mutual friend . Hummel , being asked to play , improvised at some length , but without his usual facility of invention or execution . When he had finished , Kalkbrenner and Moscheles were requested to give some touch of their quality , but having refused to do so , Cramer was asked to play . For some time he declined to do so , but being earnestly pressed by Hummel he sat down to the pianoforte in his usual unpretending manner and began one of BeetBeethoven and His Contemporaries . 65 hoven 's sonatas . In a few minutes his whole audience was literally entranced , and sat breathlessly listening to every note and phrase of the composition , which seemed to reveal some new inspiration at every turn . When he had concluded , Hummel rushed to him , seized him in his arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Never till now have I heard Beethoven , " Mr. Cox also says of Kalkbrenner that he never by any chance touched the feelings , or gave an indication of being anything else than a mere brilliant mechanist . His execution was indeed prodigious , but he could play scarcely any other compositions than his own with anything like grace or proficiency , and the almost total absence of genuine method or phrasing therein caused a repetition to be both tedious and wearisome . Incomparably superior to Kalkbrenner was Cipriani Potter , a really sound musician and a genuine artist . He was somewhat ridiculed // in the profession for his devotion to Beet hoven , and later , also , for his admiration of Schumann , but lived long enough to find his opinions justified . Philip Cipriani Hambly Potter was born in London in 1792 , and was a pupil of his father and of Woclffl . He attained high rank as a pianist , touring in Germany and Italy . He was appointed professor of pianoforte at the Royal Academy of Music ten years later , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Czerny is a name familiar to the majority of pianoforte students , although Czerny 's exercises are to-day much less used than a few years ago . Carl Czerny was for many years the most successful , and consequently important , teacher in Vienna , and was in the enviable position which enabled him to select his pupils and teach only those who possessed undoubted talent . Czerny was born at Vienna in 1791 , and Beethoven and His Contemporaries . 67 was the son of a musician , who taught him the piano in his early youth . Such was his ability at the age of ten that he could play by heart the best compositions of the great masters . Beethoven , to whom he was introduced , was so pleased with him that he took him as a pupil , and always showed great interest in his welfare . Some years later , when Czerny had musical performances by his pupils at the home of his parents on Sunday afternoons , Beethoven was so pleased with the family picture of peace and contentment that he proposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried into effect because of the illness of the parents . Czerny was always averse to playing in public , and he very seldom travelled . His work was confined almost entirely to Vienna , and he became famous through his pupils and his compositions . Liszt , Dohler , Thalberg , Jaell , and Madame Belleville-Oury were his most celebrated pupils . Czerny never // married . He was a man of gentle disposition , modest and simple in his mode of life , courteous and friendly in his behaviour . His compositions number more than one thousand . He died in 1857 , after a busy and successful career . During a long period Ignaz Moscheles was considered the foremost pianist . He was born at Prague in 1794 , and became a pupil of Dyonis Weber , who educated him on Mozart , Clementi , and Bach . When fourteen years old he gave a concert at which he played some of his own compositions . Going shortly afterward to Vienna , he speedily made the acquaintance of the most prominent musicians and the leaders of society . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studying with the former as much as three years . Here , also , he became acquainted with Beethoven and wrote for him the pianoforte score of " Fidelio . " The immediate cause of the elevation of Beethoven and His Contemporaries . 69 Moscheles to the ranks of the first pianists is said to have been a performance of some original variations on the " Alexander March " at a charity concert . After this he was considered as one of the principal virtuosos of the day , and was ranked with Hummel , who was said to excel in pianissimo effects , though Moscheles was superior in the matter of bravura . Fortunately the rival pianists were very good friends , and Hummel , when for a time he had to leave Vienna , turned over his favourite pupils to Moscheles . At the age of twenty-two Moscheles left Vienna and proceeded to England , visiting , on his way , Leipzig , Dresden , Berlin , and so on through North Germany and Holland . In Berlin he taught Mendelssohn , for whom he ever retained the warmest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love with and married , all in the short space of a month , the daughter of a wealthy merchant , Charlotte Embden , with whom he passed the remaining forty-five years of his life in great happiness . After his marriage he made London his place of residence , but frequently made flying visits to other places for the purpose of giving concerts . In London he became identified with the best musical life , and was welcomed by Clementi and Cramer . In 1832 he was elected a director of the Phil-harmonic Society , and in 1837 and 1838 he conducted Beethoven 's Ninth Symphony at the society 's concerts . Moscheles was no admirer of the music of Chopin and Liszt , who were now coming forward , but it is said that he somewhat modified his opinion after hearing Chopin play . He was distinguished in his playing by a crisp , incisive touch , clear and precise phrasing , and minute accentuation . He played octaves with a stiff wrist , and used the pedal sparingly . When Mendelssohn established the conBeethoven and His Contemporaries . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of professor of pianoforte , which was accepted , and for some twenty years the success of the institution was in a great degree owing to the reputation and zeal of this most painstaking and exemplary teacher . After accepting this position , in 1846 , he practically retired from the field as a virtuoso , and only appeared at rare intervals . In some biographies of Moscheles the statement is made that " for a long time , from the death of Hummel till the advent of Chopin , Moscheles was considered the foremost pianist . " Hummel died in 1837 . Of Chopin 's advent we are told by Liszt : " With the exception of some concerts given at his debut in 1831 , in Vienna and Munich , he gave no more , except in Paris , " to which might be added " and in England . " Chopin was , therefore , firmly established in Paris some years previous to the death of Hummel , whose star was at its zenith about // 1818 , at which time Moscheles was just beginning to be known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time at which Moscheles was in his prime . This period includes the last twelve years of 1lummel 's life and brings us almost to the death of Chopin also , which occurred in 1849 . Moscheles was a man of lofty aims and of self-effacing modesty . His influence was always used in the interests of refined musical taste . During the period of his life spent in England he was instrumental in bringing forward many celebrated musicians . That he was a man of amiable disposition is proved by the fact that he remained on the best of terms with his colleagues , and by the long list of celebrities who visited his home . His death took place at Leipzig in 1870 . Karl Maria von Weber , born at Eutin in Holstein , contributed much to the development of pianoforte technique , but is better Beethoven and His Contemporaries . 73 known by his compositions than by his record as a virtuoso . Yet Weber always exerted an electrifying effect upon his audience by his perfect control of the crescendo , from the softest piano to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pianist well known in Germany from 1808 to 1820 , during which time he travelled about playing his own compositions . He was an original character , and during his later years led a nomadic life in Thuringia , in very restricted circumstances . IN the old days of pianoforte playing , previous to the advent of Liszt , Chopin , and the players of their school , the chief objects sought to be obtained were silkiness of touch , exquisite finish with respect to the details of execution , flexibility of hand and wrist , independence of each individual finger , a certain rigidity of arm , so far as attitude was concerned , and extreme self-restraint in the use of the pedal . Pianists of those days were not in the habit of smiting their instruments , but rather of tickling them tenderly , and coaxing them into discoursing excellent music . Calm , neat , technically accurate playing was the rule , and nobody attempted 74 Mendelssohn , Chopin , Henselt , Liszt. 75 to elicit from the piano the tones of any other instrument , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technical brilliancy , ? more dazzling execution , instead of technical accuracy . A new school arose , of which Liszt was the leader and the model , the Romantic school , of which Schubert , Schumann , etc. , were the evangelists . Pianoforte playing received a tremendous , impulse , and in its progress brought to the surface much that was shallow and meretricious . For that reason it has been thought best to group together the four greatest men of the period , Mendelssohn , Chopin , Henselt , and Liszt , and to leave for a future chapter the lesser lights , who , however , fill an important part in the history of the musical progress of the world . Mendelssohn , who was better known as a composer and conductor than as a pianist , was regarded as a mature artist at the age of fifteen . When he went to Moscheles for les76 Famous Pianists . sons , that teacher said , " He has no need of lessons . If he wishes to take a hint from me as to anything new to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mendelssohn did not pursue a career as a virtuoso , he played in public many times , and his playing was always highly admired . Henry F. Chorley , the celebrated critic , in *his book on " Music and Manners in France and Germany , " writes thus of Mendelssohn 's pianoforte playing as he heard it at Leipzig , and he compares it with the playing of other celebrities of the time . " It would have been absurd to expect much pianism , as distinct from music , in the performance of one writing so straightforwardly , and without the coquetries of embroidery , as Mendelssohn . Accordingly , his performance has none of the exquisite finesses of Moscheles , on the score of which it has been elsewhere said that there is , within his playing , none of the delicate and Mendelssohn , Chopin , Henselt , Liszt. 77 plaintive and spiritual seductions of Chopin , who sweeps the keys with so insinuating and gossamer a touch that the crudest and most chromatic harmonies of his music float away under his hand , indistinct , yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the aeolian harp ; ? none of the brilliant extravagances of Liszt , by which he illuminates every composition he undertakes , with a living but lightening fire , and imparts to it a soul of passion , or a dazzling vivacity , the interpretation never contradicting the author 's intention , but more poignant , more intense , more glowing than the author ever dreamed of . And yet , no one that has heard Mendelssohn 's pianoforte playing can call it dry ? can fail to be excited and fascinated by it , despite its want of all the caprices and colourings of his contemporaries . Solidity , in which the organ touch is given to the piano without the organ ponderosity , ? spirit ( witness his execution to the finale of the D // minor concerto ) animating , but never intoxicating to the ear , ? expression which , making every tone sink deep , requires not the garnish of trills and appogiaturi , or the aid of changes of time , ? are among its outward and salient characteristics ; but within and beyond all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is to be felt a mind clear and deep , an appreciation of character and form which refers to the inner spirit rather than the outward details : the same which gives so exquisitely Southern a character to the barcarole and gondola tune in Mendelssohn 's " Lieder ohne Worte , " and its fresh , Ossianic , seas-wildness to his overture to the Hebriden ; " ? the same which enabled him when a boy , in the happiest piece of descriptive music of our time , to illustrate Shakespeare 's exquisite fairy scenes neither feebly nor unworthily . Execution without grimace ? fancy cheerful and excursive , but never morbid ? feeling under the control of Mendelssohn , Chopin , Henselt , Liszt. 79 a serene , not sluggish spirit ; ?

Scarcely had he touched the keyboard than something , that can only be explained as similar to a pleasurable electric shock , passed through his hearers and held them spellbound , ? a sensation that was only dissolved as the last chord was struck , and when one 's pent-up breath seemed as if able to recover its usual action only by means of a gulp or a sob . " 8o Famous Pianists . Frederick Francis Chopin was born at Zelazowa-Wola , near Warsaw , and was the son of a Frenchman who had settled in Poland , and had married a Polish lady , Justine Kryzanowska . Frederick was a frail and delicate child , quiet and thoughtful , with a sweet disposition . He began his musical studies with Zwing , a Bohemian , and it is said that he played in public at the age of nine , when he also improvised . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the college at Warsaw , where he received an excellent education and where his musical powers came prominently into notice . At the age of sixteen he became a pupil of Joseph Elsner , director of the conservatory at Warsaw , and from him acquired the habits of serious study which in later years gave him so complete a mastery over his subtle and dreamy creations . At college he made many friends amongst the nobility , and thus gained the position in society which Mendelssohn , Chopin , Henselt , Liszt. 81 he ever afterward retained , and for which his gentle nature fitted him . In fact the name of Chopin is always connected with the idea of refinement . At the age of nineteen he was considered a finished virtuoso , and he set forth upon a journey to England , which , however , was not completed until shortly before his death . On his way he visited Vienna , where he played frequently in public , and , notwithstanding the impression recently created by Liszt , was soon recognised as a master of the first rank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Paris , where his playing met with great favour amongst the musical community . He gave a recital at Pleyel 's concert room , where a select gathering of musical connoisseurs heard him . Liszt , Pleyel , Kalkbrenner and many others were present , and Chopin played his own First Concerto and several other smaller compositions . In a short time his reputation was thoroughly established . // He was received into the best society of Paris , and became the rage . He gave up public performances and devoted himself to teaching , and to playing only in salons amongst his own friends . His pupils were of his own selection , and included in their number some of the most beautiful and distinguished women of the capital . Chopin met Madame George Sand , and became a victim to her influence , and her views on social matters . In 1837 , he was attacked with the lung disease which had threatened him since childhood , and he settled with Madame Sand in the island of Majorca , where under her care he regained his health . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this intimacy came to an end ; he became despondent and was again seized with his complaint , from which , however , he rallied . After the Revolution of 1848 , he desired to go to England , and , in spite of the entreaties of his friends , he set out on Mendelssohn , Chopin , Henselt , Liszt. 83 his journey during the most inclement season of the year . In London he was received with open arms , for his fame had preceded him . He was presented to the Queen by the Duchess of Sutherland , played twice in public and many times at private concerts . He went much into society , sat up late at night , and constantly exposed himself to fatigue in spite of the precarious state of his health . Against the advice of his physician he decided to visit Scotland ; but his tour was cut short by illness , and he returned to London in the last stages of consumption . Although advised to go back to Paris , he lingered on in order to give one last concert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in aid of his exiled countrymen , the Poles . On his return to Paris he found that his favourite physician , the only one in whom he had confidence , was dead . He gave way to lassitude and dejection , took to his bed , and shortly died . // Notwithstanding the elegance in which Chopin lived , he was in meagre circumstances previous to his death , but his last days were made as comfortable as possible , by a gift of 25,000 francs from a wealthy pupil , Miss Sterling , who after his death bought all his belongings . Some articles she gave as mementos to his pupils and admirers , but the bulk of them she left to the mother of the pianist . Madame Chopin in turn left them to her only surviving daughter , Madame Isabella Barcinska , who lived in Warsaw , and whose house was sacked during the troubles of 1863 , when the infuriated soldiers made a bonfire of the collection . Of Chopin 's playing Von Lenz writes as follows : " That which particularly characterised Chopin 's playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole remained accurate . ' The left hand , ' I often heard him say , ' is the conductor ; it must not waver , or lose ground , Mendelssohn , Chopin , Hensel ' , Liszt. 85 do with the right hand what you can and will . ' In the fluctuation of the tempo , Chopin was ravishing ; every note stood on the highest degree of taste , in the noblest sense of that term . When he embellished , ? which he very rarely did , ? it was always a species of miracle of good taste . In his entire make-up , Chopin was not fitted to interpret Beethoven or Weber , who paint along great lines with great brushes . Chopin was a painter of pastels , but an unrivalled one . Contrasted with Listz , he might stand on an honourable equality with him ? as his wife . . . . Chopin 's tone-colour is like that of Raphael ! He is the Raphael of the piano ? though one must not seek his Madonnas in the churches ? but in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chopin stands among musicians , in his faultless vesture , a noble from head to foot . The sublimest emotions , toward whose refinement whole generations had tended , the last things in // our soul , whose foreboding is interwoven with the mystery of the Judgment Day have , in his music , found their form . . . . Chopin 's playing was light and airy , his fingers seemed to glide sideways , as if all technique were a glissando ; even the forte was in him not an absolute , but a relative , forte ? relative , that is , to the gentle voice of the rest . " Adolf Henselt was noted as an accomplished virtuoso , and for many years as an eminent teacher . Born in Swabach he studied music in his childhood with Frau von Fladt at Munich . In his seventeenth year , he was sent by King Ludwig of Bavaria to Weimar . Here he was placed under Hummel against whose methods he openly rebelled , and in eight months the connection was severed . Henselt went to Vienna and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while studying composition under Sechter . In the discipline which he imposed upon himself he was Mendelssohn , Chopin , Henselt , Liszt. 87 unmerciful , and he attained his virtuosity through the most assiduous labour . In 1836 he played privately in Berlin , Dresden , and Weimar , and the following year gave public concerts in the chief cities of Germany , after which he journeyed to St. Petersburg , where he remained for the rest of his life , gaining the reputation of a teacher of high standing . He was a man of strong personality , outwardly gruff and plain-spoken , but with much kindness of heart . His influence over pianoforte playing in Russia was very great , for he held the position of inspector of all the imperial schools of music , the duties of which office took him all over the country . When playing with an orchestra , he insisted upon remaining behind the scenes until it was time for him to begin , and then he would rush in and literally pounce upon the piano . Once , on a state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rushing on to the // stage , cigar in mouth , smoked away through out his performance , much to the amusement of the Czar , who applauded him generously . It is said , as a proof of Henselt 's devotion to music , that his last conscious act before death was to hum a melody . Von Lenz , who was intimate with Henselt , has given the following vivid picture of him : " If we speak of Adolf Henselt as the most unique phenomenon of the keyboard , we now have to justify this designation by means of internal evidence . " In absolute power over every resource of the keyboard , and therefore over every style , Liszt is to be understood as cosmic ? i. e. universal . Tausig , who treated the apparatus , the medium , as an art in itself , leaned thereby more toward universality than individuality . Chopin was too individual in production to be capable to express his entire individuality in reproduction , as an artist deficient in physical command of the medium . . . . Midway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Liszt ? in a way the connecting link between their contrasting natures ? stands Henselt , a primitive German phenomenon , a Germania at the piano . Henselt is German in everything , in production and in reproduction . German for us is synonymous with faithful , honest , real ! . . . If one dared to calculate and classify , one might name Henselt as the only artist among the great pianists who is Liszt 's equal ? although in the specifically subjective domain he belongs to a more specialised sphere . Henselt alone has first of all the same command over the resources in fullness of tone and the same finish of execution . . . . He has his own peculiar polish , his own peculiar finish , he is a law and end unto himself . By this law he departs from the good old school , but arrives at very individual results . . . . We shall call Henselt 's mode of expression , taken as a whole , romantic , in feeling and spirit like Weber , whom he much resembles in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple carriage , in his self-poised manner combined with the sincerest modesty , because he never is or will be satisfied with his achievement ? a fact which the keen observer easily recognises , and only the vulgar misjudges . Henselt pursues an ideal of perfection , which never permits him a moment of unalloyed delight . Hence it comes that Henselt is the only artist to exhibit the phenomenon ? remarkable indeed , but grounded in his innermost nature ? that immediately on finishing a given piece or movement , to the utmost astonishment and rapture of his audience , he would play it over , and even over again , as though at the command of some higher power , quite unconscious of his surroundings ! Those were moments of supreme ecstasy , of entire isolation from the outer world ? in which the man is no longer master of himself , in which the artist approaches nearer to his ideal , which he longs Mendelssohn , Chopin , Henselt , Liszt. 91 with such passionate yearning to reach , that the outer world , his own self , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . One does not experience mere enjoyment in hearing Henselt , ? one is intoxicated and elevated at the same moment . Another distinctive trait in Henselt is that , in the midst of compositions , whenever his enthusiasm seizes him , when he soars toward his ideal , he doubles the singing melody that quite fills his heart , by humming it himself ! The artist 's voice is anything but lovely , and injures the effect , as he knows right well when he is told that he has been singing again , for he himself does not know it or suspect it . Never have I heard such a magical cantilena flow from the pianoforte as in those moments when Henselt 's voice joined in his playing . " Henselt 's coming to us marked the obsolescence of the Hummel-Field school , and // brought the piano into quite another channel . Hummel was but a starting-point for Henselt . " Such a study of Bach as Henselt made every day of his life has never before been heard of ! He played the fugues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the only sound heard was the dry beat of the hammers against the muffled strings ; it was like the bones of a skeleton rattled by the wind . In this manner the artist spared his nerves and ears , for he reads at the same time , on the music-rack , a very thick , good book , ? the Bible , ? truly the most appropriate companion for Bach . After he has played Bach and the Bible quite through he begins again . The few people whom Henselt allows to approach him during those hallowed evening hours , he requests to continue their conversation , ? that does not disturb him in the least ; but the rattle of the skeleton in the piano disMendelssohn , Chopin , Henselt , Liszt. 93 turbs them , and tortures their nerves instead of quieting them . Seated at a dumb piano , with Bach and the Bible for company , the composer of many love-songs , of the Poeme &; Amour , the most keen-eared tone-reveller among virtuosi , earned his daily artistic bread ! " The effect Henselt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all at once the all-engrossing topic of conversation at the pianoforte ; he concentrated in his own person the function of instructor of all the most influential circles , and at court , where the empress immediately appointed him court pianist . He kept open house , gave no more concerts , and limited his consuming activity to composition and teaching , ? his lessons he gave with almost unheard-of punctuality and energy . . . . The mere thought of giving a concert made him ill . After his first appearance no amount of persuasion would induce him to give another // concert . In thirty-three years he gave but three . Henselt married a lady of Silesia who was refined and accomplished , and to whom he was much devoted . He died in 1889 at his country residence at Warmbrunn . " All playing sounds barren by the side of Liszt , for his is the living , breathing impersonation of poetry , passion , grace , wit , coquetry , daring , tenderness , and every other fascinating attribute that you can think of . IIe is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these words Liszt has been described by one of his pupils , and they may be supplemented by the remark of Tausig : " Oh , compared with Liszt , we other artists are blockheads . " He was called the Paganini of the piano , so completely did he master difficulties , most of them invented by himself , which to other pianists seemed insuperable , and his career was most successful from his earliest days . Mendelssohn , Chopin , Hensel ? , Liszt. 95 Unlike Paganini , he was a man of most generous disposition . Franz Liszt was born at Raiding , Hungary , on October 21 , 181 I. A comet of unusual brilliancy was visible at that time , and on the night of Liszt 's birth it seemed to light upon the very roof of the house in which he was born , and to have been regarded as an omen of his destiny . He was a delicate child , and at one time he suffered a long illness from which he did not recover until rumours of his death had been circulated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ played in his first concert , at Oldenburg , where he gave the concerto in E sharp by Ferdinand Ries and a free fantasia of his own composition , with orchestral accompaniment . From this time on he was received everywhere with the greatest enthusiasm , and such was his talent that six noblemen agreed to contribute jointly for six years an annual sum of six hundred Austrian gulden , to be // paid to his father toward the expenses of his musical education . Adam Liszt , the father , wrote to Hummel , who asked a louis d'or for each lesson , a sum which was entirely beyond the means of the young musician , and the result was that Liszt was placed under Czerny and Salieri . Czerny not only stipulated for a very small price , but at the end of the twelfth lesson , when Adam Liszt desired to pay for the lessons already given , most generously refused any compensation , and during the whole of the eighteen months that Franz was his pupil he continued to instruct him gratis . On the first of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before a Vienna audience , and his performance exceeded the expectations of his most sanguine admirers . He was now eagerly sought for at the best concerts , and was considered equal to the most talented virtuosi of the day . Such was his renown that Beethoven came to one of Mendelssohn , Chopin , Henselt , Liszt. 97 his concerts to hear him play , and the presence of the great master , who had been an object of adoration to the child , stimulated him and filled him with pride and joy . Beethoven could not restrain his admiration , and at the end of the concert ascended the platform and kissed the boy repeatedly . Adam Liszt now set out for Paris with his talented son , but arranged for concerts at the various cities through which they passed on their way . At Paris Adam Liszt applied for his son 's admission to the Conservatoire , but Cherubini , who was then director , refused to grant him admission because he was a foreigner . All the salons of the aristocracy in Paris were , nevertheless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were well provided with letters of introduction from the Austrian capital , and little Franz became the fashion . He was considered superior to Moscheles , // was called the " eighth wonder of the world , " and stood at the head of the list of virtuosi . His mental culture raised him far above all his contemporaries in his profession , Chopin alone being worthy to be placed at his side . When he played in Paris with Thalberg the verdict was : " Thalberg is the first pianist in the world , ? Liszt is the only one . " A few years passed , and people grew tired of Thalberg 's playing ; but Liszt lived to a great age and was able to delight immense audi ences to the last . Liszt , in 1839 , gave the first pure piano recital ever given , and not only was he able to fill up a whole evening with performances on his instrument alone , but he gave twenty-one recitals in a little over two months , at Berlin , in 1842 . Paganini exercised a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the pianoforte similar to those which Paganini had developed for the violin . He Mendelssohn , Chopin , Henselt , Liszt. 99 transcribed Paganini 's capriccios , which contained almost impossibilities , and the immense technical difficulties of his compositions retarded their popularity for many years . Adam Liszt , who had been the constant companion and guide of his son , died in 1827 at the age of forty-seven . This was a most severe blow to the young pianist . Finding himself in debt , owing to the expenses of his father 's illness , he sold his piano and went to Paris , where he was joined by his mother . He began to take pupils , and such was his fame as a virtuoso that his youth proved to be no obstacle to his success in securing a large class . He fell in love with one of his pupils , Caroline de Saint-Cricq , but the affair was stopped by the father of the lady , and she became the wife of a country nobleman , M. d'Artignan . Liszt now sank into a state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was deterred from taking this step by his mother , but he soon became so ill too Famous Pianists . that his life was despaired of , and in the winter of 1828 it was again rumoured that he was dead . Pictures of him were exhibited in many places in Paris , with the date of his birth and death . His recovery was slow , and it was not until 1830 that he resumed his activity . It was in the following year that he heard Paganini , and determined to improve his powers of execution until he could reach the same perfection on the piano that was exhibited by Paganini on the violin . He became an admirer of Berlioz , and of Chopin , who exercised considerable influence over him . Liszt at the age of twenty-three came under the influence of George Sand , and was soon reckoned among her best friends . Her doctrines were not calculated to elevate the moral standard of such a man .

Certain it is that his love-affairs were numerous , that he was never married , and that he had three children . Of these , one , a boy , died in infancy ; the oldest girl , Blandine , became the wife of M. Emile 011ivier , the prime minister of France at the time of the declaration of war against Prussia . The other , Cosima , became the wife of Liszt 's pupil , Hans von Billow , and later of Richard Wagner . They were the children of the Comtesse d'Agoult , who was Liszt 's companion for several years , and who became celebrated , also , as a writer , under the name of Daniel Stern . These entanglements continued during almost the whole of Liszt 's virtuoso period , but in 1865 he gave up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joining the // church , after which he devoted himself to composition , and to conducting performances of great works . In 1862 the Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar appointed him to the office of Court Chamberlain , and the Grand Duchess had a beautiful residence built and furnished for him within the grounds of the castle at Weimar . The Emperor Napoleon appointed him to be a Commandeur of the Legion of Honour , and in 1871 the Hungarian Cabinet created him a noble of Hungary , with a yearly pension of fifteen thousand francs . He was also appointed director of the Academy of Music at Budapest . During his old age he lived at Weimar , surrounded by pupils , but in 1885 he spent a few weeks in Paris , and visited London after an absence of nearly half a century . He was most enthusiastically received whereever he went , and was requested by the Queen to visit her at Windsor Castle . Mendelssohn , Chopin , Henselt , Liszt. 103 It has been said that Liszt passed through six " lives " in the various parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life of a precocious and much-loved child . In Paris he penetrated into the depths of a romantic idealism , which drew closely together the men of that fruitful epoch . Next , with the Comtesse d'Agoult he lived for five years the free and productive life of a wandering artist . Then he experienced the glories of European renown as a virtuoso . Then he exerted himself in Weimar as the pioneer of the modern style , and finally in Rome , Budapest , and Weimar he lived the peaceful life of a ruler , having attained the heights of worldly honour and equally those of that conquest of the world which found its symbol in his priestly robe . In 1886 Liszt went , as usual , to Bayreuth , to superintend the production of one of Wagner 's masterpieces . His health had been poor for some time . On the fourth of I04 Famous Pianists . June he attended the wedding of his granddaughter , Damila von Billow , with Doctor Tode , and after that he went , on the advice of his physician , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to Bayreuth in order to be present at the performance of " Tristan and Isolde , " which took place on Sunday , July 25 . He insisted upon being carried to his daughter 's box in an armchair , and was afterward taken home in a very weak state . On the following Tuesday pneumonia set in , and on the Sunday he died shortly before midnight . He was one of the most remarkable men of the century , and though his faults were great , they were far outweighed by his noble and generous nature . There are numerous stories extant about rebukes administered to loquacious royalties by eminent musicians , more particularly violinists , but there is one regarding Liszt which seems as much more magnificent than Mendelssohn , Chopin , Henselt , Liszt. toy the rest as Liszt himself towered above all performers . It was during Liszt 's second visit to St. Petersburg that the Czar Nicholas invited him to a soiree at the Winter Palace , and in the course of the evening personally invited him to play . Liszt accordingly sat down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rhapsodies . The Czar , as soon as the music was well started , entered into an animated conversation with one of his generals , talking in anything but a subdued voice . Liszt had always exacted exclusive attention from his audiences , no matter of what exalted social elements they might be composed , and noticing the conversation , he played on for a minute or so , when he suddenly came to a full stop and rose from his seat at the instrument . Although he had paid no heed to Liszt 's performance , the Czar missed the sound of the piano , and sent one of his chamberlains to ask the artist why he had ceased playing , ? was he indisio6 Famous Pianists . posed , or was not the piano properly tuned ? Liszt 's steely gray eyes flashed with righteous indignation as he replied , " The Czar well knows that whilst he is speaking every other voice ? even that of music ? is bound to be mute ! " He then turned his back on the official and left the room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent Liszt a valuable present the next day . Moreover , the incident seems to have made a lasting impression , for whenever Liszt 's name was mentioned , the Czar spoke of him with cordial admiration as a musician who not only respected himself , but had the courage to insist upon respect being paid to his art . The wonderful power of Liszt 's personality over all with whom he came in contact is well illustrated by the following anecdote , related to the writer by one who was present . Von Billow was conducting an orchestral concert at a provincial city in Germany , and a symphony by Bronsart was being played . Mendelssohn , Chopin , Henselt , Liszt. 107 A part was reached which was intended to give one an impression of the awakening of nature in early spring . It was pianissimo . In the midst of this delicate part the door of the hall was pushed open and two ladies entered . They walked down the aisle , causing some disturbance , and made still more noise by moving some chairs in order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife of the governor . Von Billow stopped the orchestra , and , addressing the ladies , told them , not in the most gentle manner , that if they wished to enter during the performance , they must come while the orchestra was playing loud , ? he could not put up with the disturbance they had made . Then calling an official he told him to get those ladies out of the way . " But Doctor Von Billow , " the official remonstrated , " one of them is the governor 's wife . " " Then put her out first , " was the brusque reply . In the meantime Liszt , who was present , motioned majesticIo8 Famous Pianists . ally to Von Bulow , who , on noticing the gestures of the great man , became immediately obsequious , and , bowing low to him , turned around and continued the performance . An incident , which showed his marvellous power of grasping musical ideas , occurred in Vienna , when Liszt and Rubinstein once met , having not seen one another for some time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , meeting him afterward , asked him if he had anything new . " Yes , " Rubinstein replied , " I have a fantasia for two pianofortes . " " Let us play it together , " said Liszt . They were both invited to be present at the salon of a music-loving prince on the next night , and they agreed to play it then . When the time arrived for them to play , Rubinstein handed to Liszt the manuscript of the fantasia . Liszt glanced over it for a few minutes while conversing with some of the people who were present , and then sat down to the piano . The two instruMendelssohn , Chopin , Hensel ? , Liszt. 109 ments were placed facing each other , and half the company grouped themselves around Rubinstein while the remainder gathered around Liszt . By the end of the performance the whole of the company were grouped around Liszt .

" as he went around to Liszt and kissed his hand reverently . CHAPTER IV . THE EARLY INTERNATIONAL VIRTUOSI . THE mania for rapidity of execution which came through the exhibition of virtuosity , toward the middle of the nineteenth century , brought with it some remarkable feats . One of these was performed by an organist who undertook , for a wager , to play one million notes on the piano in less than twelve hours . He succeeded in doing this at the average rate of about 125,000 notes an hour . The actual time consumed in the playing was eight hours and twenty minutes , which , with the periods of rest which he allowed himself , amounted to a few minutes less than the twelve hours . The extreme of the virtuoso type of this IIO The Early International Virtuosi. i i i period is to be found in the international geniuses , who continued the traditions of Thalberg rather than of Liszt . The earliest and the greatest traveller of these was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the sake of his health , toured and gave concerts through Australia , New Zealand , India , South America , the United States , and Mexico . The United States began to be regularly recognised as a field for the virtuoso after the year 184o , when pianists , violinists , and singers began to appear . In 1852 a Polish gentleman , who had suffered in the cause of his country , came to America and endeavoured to mend his fortune by giving performances upon two pianos at once . However much this proceeding may have appealed to the sympathies of his hearers , it can not be regarded otherwise than as a piece of reckless extravagance , for not only are pianos expensive instruments , but any II2 Famous Pianists . performer can do much better on one than on two at a time . Mr. Wolowski , for that was the gentleman 's name , did not entirely confine himself to the performance on two pianos , but he also played against time , and undertook to execute four hundred notes in a single measure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that nobody could pretend to count the notes . It is recorded that Mr. Wolowski secured small audiences , and that , as a performer , he did not compare with Jaell , Goldschmidt , and others who had recently been heard . Henri Herz , who at one time enjoyed an immense reputation in Paris , is interesting as being one of the first pianists of European renown who toured the United States . He was followed by Thalberg , Jaell , L. von Meyer , etc. , and may be looked upon as the pioneer of the stream of much-advertised virtuosi who seek these shores in yearly increasing numbers . His tour in the United States took The Early International Virtuosi. 113 place in 1845 , and continuing through California , Mexico , the West Indies , and South America , did not return to Europe until 1851 . Herz was born at Vienna in 18o6 , and entering the Paris Conservatoire at the age of ten , carried off the first prize for pianoforte playing in a year . He remained in Paris , acquiring great prominence as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a tour of Germany with the violinist Lafont , and in 1835 visited London , where he gave a concert of his own , and played duets with Moscheles and J. B. Cramer . He proceeded also to Dublin and Edinburgh . After a successful career Herz lost most of his earnings by entering into the manufacture of pianofortes , and in order to replenish his exchequer he decided upon his great tour in the Western Hemisphere . Concerning his playing in London , Mr. Cox says : " For my part , I have always regarded Herz as one of the most unsatisfacrt4 Famous Pianists . tory players and frivolous composers for his instrument that the world has ever met with . If at any time the saying was realised of ' a man going up like a rocket and down like a stick , ' it assuredly was so in his case . I really believe that Herz could play no other music than his own . If he at any time tried the experiment , it must have been a miserable fiasco . He had neither the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Nevertheless Herz had dazzled the Parisians , and now he set forth to exercise his blandishments upon the music-loving public of the United States . Possibly he was the best man that could be found for that arduous and not altogether enviable undertaking . While there were good musicians and people who loved and appreciated good music in the larger cities of America , it can not be said that the Americans were in general a musically cultivated people at that time . FortuThe Early International Virtuosi. 115 nately M. Herz has left us an account of his American experiences , some of which are as interesting and unique as those of Jenny Lind or Ole Bull . In fact , P. T. Barnum , who for a short period managed Jenny Lind , approached Herz in New York with a proposition to play the piano at a concert in which that songstress was to appear as an angel descended from Heaven . This proposition staggered even M. Herz and he declined it , but he was destined to be subjected to some original and startling devices by his manager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York he was introduced to the audience in a long and flowery speech , to which he was expected to reply ? but declined . A gentleman was found , however , who made a thrilling speech for him and told the public exactly how he ( Herz ) felt about his enthusiastic reception . In Philadelphia Ullmann concocted a placard , to advertise Herz 's concert , in which z z6 Famous Pianists . the most prominent feature was the announcement that the hall would be illuminated by " one thousand candles . " He tells also how one member of the audience ( which , by the way , packed the hall to suffocation in order to see the one thousand candles ) made a complaint that there were eight candles short of the advertised number , and accordingly demanded his money and left the hall a disappointed and deluded man . The farewell concert in Philadelphia was announced as a " Great Festival in honour of the Declaration of Independence , etc. , etc . " It opened with a cantata for eight voices with soli and chorus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five orchestras and eighteen hundred singers . During the last chords of the cantata the bronze bust of the Father of the Country was crowned with a laurel wreath . Then came a " Concerto de la Constitution , " expressly composed for the occasion The Early International Virtuosi. 117 by M. Herz , and performed by the composer . This was followed by a lecture on the American people and on the rights of women , by a well-known lady orator . The climax was reached in a performance of " Hail , Columbia , " by all the military bands in Philadelphia and the surrounding cities united for the occasion . At Baltimore it was announced that the artist was to improvise on themes suggested by the audience . This led to a scene of confusion , for fifty or sixty themes were given , some members of the audience being so anxious to be the chosen one that they stood on their seats and whistled their contributions . At New Orleans the great attraction for the public consisted of a piece arranged for eight pianos , played by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local artists , and were all of the fair sex . At the last moment one of them broke faith , // and Herz , seeing a stylishly dressed lady in one of the boxes , went around and begged her to take the vacant place . She demurred on the ground that she was unable to play the piano and did not understand a note of music , but being persuaded by the argument that all she need do was to imitate the action of playing , she reluctantly but obligingly consented . Unfortunately there was a rest of several measures in the piece , and this had not been explained to the fair volunteer , so that when all the other pianists ceased playing , she , being absorbed in her own efforts and bent on fulfilling her promise , continued her frantic but silent exertions , and created a decidedly unusual effect . Herz reached California in 1849 , just when the gold mania was at its height . Necessity had not yet become the mother of that celebrated injunction , " Do n't shoot the pianist . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was waited upon by a deputation of miners , The Early International Virtuosi. 119 who wanted him to play at a place called ? Venezia . " He went there and found the house full of men of all colours , styles of dress , and nationalities . His reception was encouraging , but ? there was no piano . Nothing daunted by such a trifle , the audience requested him to sing . When the excitement was subdued he asked if no one had a piano , and after a good deal of discussion , a miner in a red shirt , declared that he knew of a Portuguese ( or Portuguee ? ) who lived four miles away , and who possessed a piano . Ten members of the motley assembly at once set forth to get that piano , and in the course of two hours returned carrying it on their backs . It was an awful old box of six octaves , three of them quite useless . During the interval Herz had chatted pleasantly with the audience and passed a sociable evening , and now he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ According to his // account of the affair , he never made so brilliant a success . Notwithstanding the fact that Herz was shallow and superficial as a musician , he was very successful in Europe as well as in America . He remained a teacher at the Paris Conservatoire until 1874 , though his chief interest was centered in his piano factories . He died in 1888 , but his musical reputation predeceased him by many years . The year 1811 was most productive of celebrated pianists , for we find Louise Dulcken , Camille Stamaty , Marie Pleyel , Wilhelm Taubert , Leopoldine Blahetka , Henri Rosellen , Ferdinand Hiller , and , greatest of all , Franz Liszt , while Thalberg , who was in his day compared with Liszt , was born the following year . Chopin was born in 1810 , and Mendelssohn a year earlier . Liszt attained the highest point that human intelligence and skill can possibly reach . He widened the domain of the piano to an extent The Early International Virtuosi. 121 which seems almost incompatible with the nature of the instrument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the majority of players , are absolutely impossible , and thus made himself responsible for more noise and bad playing by his imitators than was ever before known . Thalberg , on the other hand , was the apostle of brilliant emptiness . He had the art of composing pieces which were much more difficult in appearance than in reality . According to Rubinstein , Liszt was the " god of music , " while Thalberg was " a grocer . " Mendelssohn spoke of Thalberg 's style as more worthy of a virtuoso , while Liszt 's playing he regarded as " a heathen scandal both in the glorious and the reprehensible sense of the word . " Schumann said that to criticise Thalberg would cause a revolt of all the French , German , and foreign girls , ? " he sheds the lustre of his performance on whatever he may play , // Beethoven or Dussek , Chopin or Hummel . . . . He is a god , when seated at the piano . " Thalberg , a perfect aristocrat in look , never moved a muscle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and whatever the difficulties of the piece , he was , or at any rate he appeared , unmoved , calm , master of the keyboard , and , what is more difficult , of himself . Liszt , with his long hair flying about at every arpeggio or scale , not to mention his restlessness when playing rapid octaves , studied his audience unceasingly . He kept them well under his eye , and was not above indulging in little comedies , and encouraging little scenes to be played by the audience . He would , for instance , leave a glove upon the piano so that the ladies might tear it to fragments in the desire for relics . Thalberg disdained such devices , and never encouraged worship of himself in any shape . Sigismond Thalberg was a native of GeThe Early International Virtuosi. 123 neva , and was born in 1812 . He was the son of Prince Dietrichstein and the Baroness Wetzlar , was brought up in luxury , and when prepared for the life of a virtuoso , his father started him off with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggle against poverty which oppressed so many great musicians . He was agreeable in appearance and in manners , rather too much addicted to making puns , kind-hearted , and refined . His brilliant style took the world by storm , and he became a great favourite . He possessed a well-trained mechanism . The smallest details of execution were polished and finished with the utmost care , his scales were marvels of evenness , his arpeggios at times rolled like the waves of the sea , at others resembled the airy and transparent folds of the finest lace , his octaves were thundered forth with never failing accuracy , and his chords seemed to be struck with mallets of steel rather than by fingers . His // tone was grand , delicate , and mellow , and the gradations between forte and piano were exquisitely traced . The feature which rendered Thalberg 's fantasias so celebrated was his method of dividing the melody between the two hands , whilst at the same time the right hand performs in the higher register a brilliant figure and the left hand exhibits a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an accompaniment in chords . Liszt on one occasion is said to have remarked that Thalberg was the only artist who could play the violin on the keyboard ; but later on , when Thalberg was held up as his rival , he said , " I hope to play as Thalberg does if I should happen to be paralysed and limited to the use of one hand . " Thalberg married , in 1843 , Madame Boucher , the daughter of Luigi Lablache , the celebrated singer . He made numerous concert tours throughout Europe , and closed The Early International Virtuosi. 125 his career as a virtuoso with a long tour through South America and the United States in 1855 and 1856 , when he appeared with Vieuxtemps , the violinist . He retired to Posilipo , near Naples , and lived as a landowner and winegrower , and ? there was no piano in his house . He died in 1871 , having only once emerged from his retirement , when , in 1862 , he gave some concerts in Paris and London , and was greeted with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the million rather than gratified the taste of the refined . He adhered wholly to his own compositions , his sole object being to show off his wonderful powers of mechanism . Not a single performance of his , or of any of his pupils and hosts of imitators , ever advanced the true progress of musical art and science one step . Apparently he had no soul for anything else than the sound and fury signifying nothing " which his own hands could produce . // Sir Charles Halle writes of Thalberg as follows : ? " Totally unlike in style to either Chopin or Liszt , he was admirable and unimpeachable in his own way . His performances were wonderfully finished and accurate , giving the impression that a wrong note was an impossibility . His tone was round and beautiful , the clearness of his passage-playing crystal-like , and he had brought to the utmost perfection the method , identified with his name , of making a melody stand out distinctly through a maze of brilliant passages . He did not appeal to the emotions , except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold , but beautiful , and so masterly that it was said of him , with reason , he would play with the same care and finish if roused out of the deepest sleep in the middle of the night . He created a great sensation in Paris , and became the idol of the public , principally , perhaps , because it was felt that he could be imitated , even successThe Early International Virtuosi. 127 fully , which with Chopin and Liszt was out of the question . " Leopold von Meyer was one of the first pianists to come from Europe to America , arriving about the same time or shortly before Herz , and he soon learned to understand the tastes of the Americans of that day . According to some accounts he was an Australian by birth , but others say that he was born at Baden , near Vienna , and that he carried on the good traditions of Czerny and Fischoff . He made long concert tours , beginning at the age of nineteen . An account of his playing is given by Fridburg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and who heard him in Europe , ? probably in Vienna . After describing his personal appearance , and his disregard for conventionalities , ? " He remained seated amongst the audience until his number on the program was reached . Then he stood up and pulled off his overcoat , and ran up on the stage . He sat at the piano , I28 Famous Pianists . then got up , and called to the attendants to move it to a particular spot of his own choosing . He sometimes played with his thumbs alone , " the account continues , " then he smote with his fists , and with his elbows , musical-box effects , bells ringing , thunder-claps , all through one another , and then he took his stick and drummed a variation . How he did all this , with what lightness , with what grace , occasionally interrupted with coquetting with ladies in the parquet , smiling as if these antics amused him , is beyond comparison . The public , too , seemed vastly amused . " Von Meyer was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observation . He could caricature the individualities of leading virtuosi with surprising adroitness , and in such good humor as to disarm the most jealous of that illustrious fellowship . In 1868 Von Meyer reappeared in America , when he was spoken of as " more extravagant The Early International Virtuosi. 129 than ever . " A great change in musical taste had taken place in the interval of twenty or more years since Von Meyer had made his first trip to this country . One who heard him on both occasions wrote an account of his advent , in 1845 or 1846 , to Boston , which is interesting if only for the fact that it shows the manner in which concert pianists managed their business in those days . " No sooner was he established in comfortable quarters , " the story goes , " than the musical cognoscenti were bidden to his rooms to have a preliminary taste of his quality . Some forty gentlemen were assembled , ? the nucleus whose opinion is fame in our little musical world . . . . He seated himself at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short , stout , healthy-looking man of light , flying hair , and full blue German eyes . He congratulates himself that he is the only one of the great pianists who is fat , and this enables // him to bear much physical exertion . . . . He worked up from a soft trill , and most delicate runs , until he seemed to tear up great masses of chords by the roots , and scatter them about with furious joy . . . . His brow seemed almost to lift itself from his head ; his whole body played ; he would straighten back and look around in triumph on his audience ; he would rise from his seat as if upon a race-horse ; and finally , with the instrument vibrating like twenty , he sprang up into the arms , as it were , of his audience , laughing and shouting with as much delight as any of them , at the admirable thing which had been accomplished . Needless to say , he put criticism to flight . No one stopped to consider that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Continuing about his performance in 1867 , the same account says : " As he hastened upon the stage , hat and gloves in hand . . . . He is a remarkable player , if he would only The Early International Virtuosi. 131 play good music . The Steinway piano jingled as if taxed beyond its strength . " Von Meyer took up his residence in Vienna , but he died at Dresden in 1883 . Alexander Dreyschock , born in 1818 , at Zack , in Bohemia , was a pianist of great attainments . He has been called the hero of octaves , sixths and thirds , and possessed such great powers of execution that Cramer , who heard him in Paris , declared that he had two right hands . He was described as a pianist who " did in octaves what all others did in single notes . " He seemed to have even more execution than Thalberg , and was compared with Liszt , in that he was more calmly certain , and manifested a new manner of producing a vibrating and prolonged tone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fantasy of Liszt . Power ranging from the uttermost force to the finest delicacy , sensible , rather than sensitive expression , were the characteristics most // strongly prominent in his performance , and his unpretending modesty won for him general approbation . Dreyschock toured through Europe extensively , from 1836 to 1847 , and then settled clown at Prague as a pianoforte teacher . In 1862 he was called to St. Petersburg as professor of pianoforte at the Conservatoire , but his health failing , in 1868 he was sent to Italy , where he died the following year . Dreyschock did not succeed in maintaining his rapidly earned reputation , and it is related of him that once when he was playing the pupil 's part in some scale duets at the apartments of Moscheles , he made such a poor showing that even Moscheles 's little daughter noticed it and exclaimed to her mother , " Mamma , Mr. Dreyschock has n't learned his scales yet . " An amusing picture of the middle of the century virtuosity is given by W. BeattyThe Early International Virtuosi. 133 Kingston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de Kontski , sometimes called the " Lion of Poland . " " This title of honour , " says the narrator , " I am bound to say , was not altogether lacking in appropriateness ; indeed , it was to a considerable extent justified by his method of dealing with any luckless instrument that fell into his hands professionally . Thus might a vivacious monarch of the desert , with spirits unsubdued and sinews unrelaxed by bondage , play on or with the pianoforte , if that way disposed by nature or accidental impulse . Blows from a playful leonine paw could scarcely , I should think , strike a larger number of notes simultaneously or with greater force of impact than did the vigorous hands of the Sarmatian Lion , to whom I listened in a daze of mingled wonder and consternation .

An eminent Viennese critic wrote a panic-stricken notice of the matinee , on the morrow of the performance , concluding his remarks with the following impressive words , ' From battle , murder , and sudden death , and from the Lion of Poland 's pianoforte playing , good Lord , deliver us ! ' " De Kontski was a native of Cracow , a member of a musical family . Appolinary , his brother , was a celebrated violinist . Both brothers travelled extensively , and Anton lived to a good old age . The name of Litolff is known wherever the pianoforte is played , because of the Litolff publications . Henri Litolff was a concert pianist of considerable talent , and a composer . The Early International Virtuosi. 135 He was the son of a violinist , a French Alsatian , who had been taken prisoner by the English in the Peninsular War , and who married an English woman and settled in London after the declaration of peace . Young Litolff became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a concert player when only twelve years of age . His precocity seems to have developed in other lines besides pianoforte playing , for at seventeen he entered into the bonds of matrimony , and so incurred the displeasure of his parents . He now left England , and started on a tour of the continent with his wife . He did not meet with the success which he had anticipated , and was quite unable to support his wife . The tide of fortune turned , however , when in 184o he met Duprez , the singer , who heard him play and was attracted by his talent . Duprez took him to Paris and arranged for his appearance . In the following year he was appointed conductor at t 36 Famous Pianists . Warsaw , and held his position for four years , when he again started on a tour , and visited several cities , with more or less success . In 1848 he became involved in politics , but was fortunate enough to escape from the scene of the revolution . Litolff seems to have been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used the courts methodically , for he divorced his first wife and married the widow of Meyer , the music publisher , whose business he carried on under his own name , and with much success . Not satisfied with his improved fortune , in 186o he once more sought the divorce court , and gained distinction by marrying the Baroness Larochefoucald . Litolff obtained high rank as a pianist , for his playing was marked by fire , passion , and brilliancy , together with thought and taste , but it fell short of the highest excellence . Among the celebrated pianists who held The Early International Virtuosi. 137 their reputation in England may be mentioned William Sterndale Bennett , Lindsay Sloper , and Sir Charles Halle , but they did not in any way adopt the life of the virtuoso .

For nearly half a century Ernst Pauer was one of the foremost pianists and teachers in England . Born in Vienna , he became a pupil of Mozart 's son , Wolfgang Amadeus . In 185 r he went to London and appeared successfully at the Philharmonic concerts and at the Musical Union , and determined // to remain in England . He became celebrated as a lecturer on musical subjects , and was engaged as pianoforte teacher at the Royal Academy , the National Training School , and the Guildhall School of Music . In the midst of his arduous duties he still found time to travel and give concerts throughout Europe , but he retired from active life about 1895 . Mr. Pauer was a man of gigantic stature and tremendous energy , scrupulously particular as to the smallest details in his work , and of simple , genuine nature . Louis Moreau Gottschalk gained the proud distinction of being the first American pianist of international renown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being an Englishman and his mother a Creole . His birth took place in 1829 , and , according to the custom of virtuosi , he exhibited his musical talent during his infancy in ways peculiarly gratifying to his relations , but of no special The Early International Virtuosi. 139 interest to the world in general . After studying music for some years under the best teachers to be found in his native city , Gottschalk , in 1842 , was sent to Paris , where he became a pupil of Camille Stamaty , who was considered the best French professor at that time . Being a youth of refined manners , he soon became a favourite amongst the elite of Paris . In 1845 he gave a concert at the Salle Pleyel , which secured him a great deal of applause , and encouragement from Chopin , who was present and predicted that he would become the king of the pianists . By 1850 he was fairly launched on the career of a virtuoso , and travelled through France , Germany , and Spain , receiving decorations from royalties and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most touching incidents in his career was the presentation of a sword by Don Jose Redondo , the eminent toreador , // At Valladolid he met with an accident , for the court pianist , presumably consumed with jealousy , took advantage of Gottschalk in an unguarded moment and slammed the door of a carriage on his fingers , causing injuries from which his accurate and conscientious biogra pher declares it took him ninety-one days to recover . There may have been some com pensation for this injury , from the fact that the Infanta of Spain invited him to dinner and " playfully and kindly presented him with a cake made by her royal hands . " Before leaving Spain he complimented the nation by composing a piece called , " Le Siege de Saragosse . " This was written for ten pianos , and was performed for the first time at Madrid . " Gottschalk appeared at the head of his aides-de-camp , all dressed in the same manner . . There is a passage where Gottschalk in a most ingenious manner imi tates a military parade , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a The Early International Virtuosi. 141 sensation that all the people , men and women , rose to their feet , and he was compelled to repeat the entire passage . " At the end of 1852 Gottschalk left Europe , and in January of the following year arrived in New York , where he commenced a brilliant career by giving a concert at the ballroom attached to Niblo 's Theatre . Such was his activity that he gave in one season eighty concerts in New York . He travelled through the West Indies , South America , Mexico , and California , meeting with some thrilling adventures , especially in Peru , where a revolution was in progress and bullets permeated the atmosphere . Returning to the United States in 1862 , he gave more than eleven hundred concerts in three years . In 1869 , during a tour in South America , he was stricken down by yellow fever , but recovered sufficiently to give several concerts at Rio de Janeiro . On November 26 he was again taken ill , but attempted 1 42 Famous Pianists . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playing when he fell unconscious , and was at once taken to his hotel . A few days later he was removed to Tijuca , a plateau about three miles from Rio , where he died on December the eighth . There is no doubt that Gottschalk was a brilliant artist . His record throughout the world shows that to be the case . But in parts of the United States he at first failed to please the public , and sustained large financial losses . A critic in the New York Courier declared , in 1853 , that " we , the public , have begun to regard the pianoforte in the concert room as an intolerable nuisance . " Another wrote : " We could not but regret that so much stupendous and wonderful labour produced so little music , and we could not but smile at seeing the enthusiasm of his audience always rise in direct proportion to the manual exertion which his performance required . " The Early International Virtuosi. 143 Nevertheless he received encouragement in Boston in these words : " He is the only pianist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He has the dexterity of Jaell , the power of Meyer , and the taste of Herz . " erz . " Gottschalk had the misfortune to travel in this country at a time when the majority of the public were unable to appreciate a high class of music , and when the country was distracted by the war of the Rebellion . Once he ventured too near the scene of hostilities and was obliged to make an undignified retreat . In San Francisco he had an experience somewhat similar to that of Herz in New Orleans . There was to be a piece played on fourteen pianos . One of the pianists fell ill , and Gottschalk had to accept the services of an amateur , who was considered a marvellous musician , ? who played Liszt , and Thalberg , and considered them quite easy . A short rehearsal convinced // Gottschalk that this amateur would upset the whole business , but he was unable to decline his services . As an alternative the action of the piano was surreptitiously removed , and the young man was thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has left a very interesting volume of " notes " relating his adventures . Alfred Jaell , born at Trieste in 1832 , was one of the large army of prodigies , and began his career at the age of eleven . In 1844 he was taken to Moscheles , who called him a Wunderknabe . After the revolution of 1848 he made a tour in America . Indeed the revolution of 1848 appears to have been of direct benefit musically to the United States , for many excellent musicians sought these shores and made America their permanent home . Others merely remained until the difficulties had passed , and Jaell was one of those who found the United States a resort convenient and lucrative for a time . The Early International Virtuosi. 145 He is described by one who heard him in the sixties as a short , rotund man , with a countenance beaming with good humour , and , in spite of his unwieldiness , full of life and energy . A drawback to his playing was the constant staccato of short fat hands , which made legato @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Thalberg , and Liszt , impossible to him . But his tone was round , full , yet sweet and penetrating , ? the very biggest , fullest pianoforte tone to be heard at the time . Jaell married in 1866 Mademoiselle Marie Trautman , also a distinguished pianist . He died in Paris in 1882 , after a brilliant career . While there were many pianists of deeper artistic temperament , Jaell was uniformly successful in pleasing the public , especially in Italy and France , where he travelled some-times alone , sometimes accompanied by his wife , who was a good pianist , and later in company with Carlotta Patti. // Dr. William Mason , one of the most widely known pianists of America , born in Boston , was the son of Lowell Mason , through whose influence singing was first taught in the public schools . After some years of study in Boston , William Mason went to Germany , where he became a pupil of Moscheles , Hauptmann , and Richter , and later of Dreyschock . In 1853 and 1854 he was under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pianist in several European cities . He was constantly associated during his student days with Rubinstein , Von Bulow , Pruckner , and Klindworth . In 1854 he returned to his native land , and gave a number of pianoforte recitals , but soon settled in New York , where he became one of the most prominent teachers , and was associated with the best musical life of the city . With Theodore Thomas , Bergmann , Mozenthal , and Matzka he established the " Mason &; Thomas Soirees of Chamber-music , " which The Early International Virtuosi. 147 continued until 1868 . In 1872 Yale College conferred on him the honorary degree of Doctor of Music . Karl Klindworth , a native of Hanover , rose to a high position in the musical world in spite of many difficulties and discouragements . He became a noted pedagogue , conductor , and concert pianist . As a child he was extremely precocious , and taught himself the piano and the violin . At the age of six he appeared in a concert , playing an arrangement for pianoforte of Boieldieu 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favourite instrument , and when he was fifteen years of age he made an effort to go to Spohr and study , but lack of funds prevented him . Soon after this he became conductor of a travelling opera troupe , in which Bilse , who was later famous as an orchestral conductor , played first violin . In 1852 , while on a tour as a pianist , he met Franz Liszt , and by the aid of a Jewish lady he was enabled to go to Weimar for // two years and study with the great pianist . After this he went to London , where he remained four years and gradually made his way , but was called by Rubinstein to Moscow to become pianoforte professor at the Imperial Conservatory . In 1882 he settled in Berlin , where he established a pianoforte school , and devoted much time to orchestral conducting . He has also distinguished himself by his arrangements of Wagner 's and other great works , and by his own compositions . Henri Rosellen , a native of Paris , was distinguished for his superficiality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his performance , and Henri Ravina belonged to the showy but meaningless class , though he was for many years a professor at the Paris Conservatoire . There were , besides these , many pianists of high merit , as , for instance , Ferdinand Hiller , who became director of the ConserThe Early International Virtuosi. 149 vatory at Cologne , Stephen Heller , better known as a composer , Sterndale Bennett , whose sphere lay in England , and Charles Halle , a German who made his home and devoted his life to the cause of music in England . Alkan and Jacob Rosenhain are both mentioned as eminent virtuosi , and Emil Prudent was noted for his smooth and clean playing , but spent most of his life in Paris . Julius Schulhoff and Ignaz Tedesco , pupils of Tomaschek , became favourites amongst the ladies , on account of their elegant execution . CHAPTER V. RUBINSTEIN , VON BULOW , AND TAUSIG . THE two pianists who stand out as giants of the interpretative art , after Liszt , are Anton Rubinstein and Hans von Billow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ untimely death ended a most promising career . Rubinstein 's and Von Billow 's playing represented the difference between the classical and the spiritual interpretation of piano works . Rubinstein was the great subjective artist who gave way to the mood of the moment , while Billow was the objective artist , in whose playing the intellect was gratified by the clear-cut sharpness , while the heart retained the emotion long after the artist left the platform . Both were 15o Rubinstein , Von Billow , and Tausig. 151 complete artists and exercised a wonderful influence on their hearers . It is greatly owing to them that virtuosity as a mere exhibition of technical skill has lost its popularity , and the public taste requires programs of intellectual worth , for the interpretation of which mental power is essential . The mere finger artist has now no place in the concert room . The days of Herz , Thalberg , De Kontski , and all that type are past , and the pianists of modern times must of necessity be people of broad education , apart from their technical ability . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Angelo of music . No pianist , except perhaps Liszt , has achieved greater renown , none has been more distinguished for sincerity , and few , if any , have exerted greater influence in the cause of musical education . Rubinstein was born in 1829 at Vichvatijnetz or Wechwotynuz , a village on the // frontier of Bessarabia . His father was , with other members of the family , a tenant of a tract of land in the village . While Anton was yet very young the family moved , in a covered wagon , to Moscow , where the father established a pin and pencil factory . The mother was a musician and gave him his earliest lessons . Through the influence of some friends , the pianist Villoing was induced to visit the family and hear Anton play , and the result was that he undertook the boy 's musical education without regard to compensation . This was in Anton 's eighth year , and his studies continued until he was thirteen , including a period of travel , during which Anton , with his teacher , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Conservatoire . He was denied admission , and possibly the best reason for this is to be found in the suggestion that Villoing , who was proud of his pupil , did not wish to Rubinstein , Von Billow , and Tausig. 153 part with him , and therefore did not press the case very warmly . Rubinstein 's first concert was given at Moscow , when he was ten years of age , and before setting out on his travels . In Paris he remained about a year , meeting during that time a number of celebrities , among them Liszt , Chopin , Vieuxtemps , etc. , and occasionally playing at concerts . Liszt , who was then in the zenith of his glory , was consulted by Villoing as to the future of his young pupil , and advised taking him to Germany to complete his education , so the route was continued through Holland , England , Norway , and Sweden , and thus into Germany , giving concerts at each large town . In London Rubinstein was received graciously by Queen Victoria , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nicholas , who later showed him much favour . In 1844 Rubinstein went with his mother , his sister Luba , and his brother Nicholas , to // Berlin , where they remained until 1846 , Anton taking lessons in composition with Dehn , and in theory with Marks . Nicholas Rubinstein , with his mother and sister , returned to Moscow in 1846 , when his father died . He entered the University , and became afterward an excellent pianist . In the meantime Anton went to Vienna , because Liszt now lived there , and on his protection and assistance he relied . Liszt dashed his hopes , however , by reminding him that a talented man must win the goal of his ambition by his own unassisted efforts . A hard struggle for subsistence ensued , and Rubinstein taught pupils , and wrote bushels of music of all kinds , from opera and oratorio down to songs , ? also literary articles ; but seldom could he find a market for them , and he was glad if he could get any of them published at all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the device of procuring money by writing Rubinstein , Von Billow , and Tausig. 15 5 to one or two of his pupils before the expiration of the term of lessons , declaring that pressing engagements made it impossible for him to complete them , and asking for settlement at once for the lessons already given . In this way he annoyed many pupils so that they declined to continue with him when he was ready to begin again . One day Liszt paid him a visit , and , shocked with the condition of poverty apparent in the young man 's lodgings , invited him out to dinner , after which they were always on friendly terms . The year 1848 found Rubinstein in Berlin again , and it also witnessed the revolution , which seems to have left its mark indelibly on the musical history both of Europe and America . After this revolution , in which he almost became involved , there was no occupation for musicians , so Rubinstein packed up his belongings , and set off for Moscow , where he found himself con1 5 6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having neglected to provide himself with a passport . He was threatened with Siberia , and various unpleasant things , until at last a bright idea struck one of the officials , ? " Go to my secretary , Chesnakov , and play something to him , so that we may know if you are a real musician ; and bear in mind , " he added , in scornful tones , " bear in mind that he understands music . " Rubinstein was conducted by the secretary to a miserable , worn-out piano , upon which he poured forth the indignation which was boiling in him . The piano shook and seemed in momentary danger of extermination . The secretary listened patiently and then reported to his chief , " Your Excellency 's information is correct . Rubinstein is a musician indeed , ? he can play . " " Then let him have three weeks ' grace , " thundered the official . So Rubinstein was allowed time to communicate with his many Rubinstein , Von Billow , and Tausig. 157 friends and straighten out the difficulty . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They examined them with suspicion , and declared that secret societies sometimes used symbols of a similar nature for their treasonable documents . " Wait patiently , " he was told , " for five or six months , and perhaps your notes may be restored to you . " Rubinstein waited patiently , and in the course of some years a music publisher informed him incidentally that he had just bought some of his autograph compositions . They had been sold at auction as waste paper ! From 1 849 till 1854 Rubinstein was at St. Petersburg , where he supported himself by teaching , and gradually became identified with the best musical life of that city . In 1852 he was appointed accompanist in general to the Palace singers , or " Janitor of Music , " as he called it . From 1854 to 1858 Rubinstein travelled in Germany , France , and England , making a 15 8 Famous Pianists . long concert tour . He spent five or six months at Weimar , living with Liszt , who was at that time regarded as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a composer during this tour , and he played and conducted many of his own works . On his return to St. Petersburg , he became interested in the establishment of the Musical Society , of which the pioneer , according to Rubinstein 's own account , was Kologrivov , who also laboured nobly to establish the conservatories of St. Petersburg , Moscow , and Kiev . The Russian Musical Society became the Imperial Society . In 1862 classes were formed in the Michael Palace , which may be regarded as the nucleus of the St. Petersburg Conservatory . Leschetitzky was the professor of the piano , Wieniawski of violin , and Madame NissenSalomon of voice , while Rubinstein assumed the directorship . Music was then at a low ebb in Russia , and the professional artist was Rubinstein , Von Billow , and Tausig. 159 unknown . The enterprise was supported by many influential people , but there was also bitter opposition , as there always is , and always will be , to such matters . The conservatory flourished in spite of opposition , but in 1867 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and set forth on another triumphal concert tour through Western Europe . In 1872 he visited the United States in company with Wieniawski , the violinist , and this tour may be said to have marked an epoch in the musical history of America . To Rubinstein the tour was the cause of profound dissatisfaction , although it was so successful financially as to ensure his prosperity for the future ; but several years later , when he was offered a very large sum for a second tour , he declined to entertain the proposition . During the tour of 1872 , he played two hundred and fifteen times , frequently giving two concerts a day in as many different cities . i 6o Famous Pianists . This he considered slavery , and he said , " One grows into an automaton , simply performing mechanical work ; no dignity remains to the artist , he is lost . " Rubinstein had a great mission to perform in this country , and he met his responsibilities unwaveringly . Although it was very trying to him to play , as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to understand what he was doing , he never made the slightest alteration in the standard of his programs . He risked his reputation and his financial success in an undertaking that would have ruined any other artist . He proclaimed to the nation , that the art of music is deeper than negro minstrelsy , and that it contains treasures which are unattainable without study . A New York journalist in writing of his concerts called attention to Rubinstein 's mannerisms , and added , " These little details of personal appearance you must notice beRubinstein , Von Billow , and Taaasig. 161 fore he begins to play , for , if you are musical , you will not perceive them afterward . " If Rubinstein was not understood in all parts of the United States , he was at least regarded as a marvel and a great artist . His playing stirred people as they had never been stirred before , and amongst other tributes to his genius there appeared a literary effusion , entitled " How Ruby played , " which had a great circulation , and which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entertainments . During the years 1885 ? 86 Rubinstein executed a long-cherished plan , and celebrated his last years as a virtuoso by giving a series of concerts in the chief cities of Europe . These concerts were designed to illustrate the gradual development of pianoforte music . There were seventeen in the series , and he gave them in Moscow , Vienna , Berlin , London , Paris , and Leipzig . In some of these cities each concert was repeated on the following day for the benefit of music students . In 1887 he resumed the management of the St. Petersburg Conservatory , and in 1889 he retired from the concert platform , his last concert being given in January of that year at Moscow . At the close of the performance , the lid of the grand piano was locked , and Rubinstein , with one pathetic gesture of farewell , disappeared from the concert room for ever . Of the many pages of criticism which have been written on Rubinstein as a pianist , the following from the pen of Brachvogel seems to be the most comprehensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his audience so merciless a front . Both his programs and his attitude are absolutely uncompromising . At first sight , one is conscious of something stern , even inimical , in his bearing toward his audience , as though a chasm were fixed between them , and he stood ready to plunge single-handed into the conflict ; but gradually the sense of hostility vanishes , and Rubinstein , Von Billow , and Tausig. 163 the great artist conquers once and for ever . Rubinstein has no idea of descending to the level of popular taste , he can only raise his audience to his own plane . It is enough to look in his face to understand what it all means . He has the head of an inspired sphinx , upon whose face not even the paroxysms of enthusiasm call forth a smile . Did not the colour of his life illumine it , it might be of stone . Those who have heard his playing will never forget it . " Rubinstein 's passionate temperament often carried him beyond lawful bounds , but at the same time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his audiences . Stephen Heller , in a letter to Halle in 1862 , writes thus : " The great Rubinstein played several ' Waldstiicke ' at my house . What a style ! What exaggeration of the less salient parts , and what negligence in the more important passages ! One felt the boredom of those agile and powerful // fingers that had nothing put into them , as when they give the circus elephant an empty salad-bowl to swallow . He played my Tarantelle in A flat at St. Petersburg , ornamented with octave passages , shakes , etc . If such people only dared , they would do the same to Beethoven . " A writer who frequently met Rubinstein in Vienna , and was on intimate terms with him , declares that he was the most infallible reader and transposer at first sight . He had stood behind Rubinstein whilst the latter rendered a manuscript orchestral score , in sixteen parts , on the piano , with all the freedom and apposite expression of a first-class pianist playing a pianoforte composition with which he was tolerably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the most difficult fugues of the " forty-eight , " from a flat key into a sharp key , the latter not even being one of his own selection , but chosen by a fellow pianist . This he played Rubinstein , Von Billow , and Tausig. 165 without missing a note , or omitting an emphasis . Hans Guido von Bulow was considered to be the foremost pianist of the advanced school of pianoforte playing founded by Chopin , and developed by Liszt . While his repertoire included the master works of all styles and schools , and his technique was prodigious , he was distinguished more particularly for his wonderful memory , and it would be difficult to mention any work of importance which he did not at one time or another play in public , and by heart . He was also a remarkable orchestral conductor , a keen critic , and an excellent editor of musical works . Von Billow was born at Dresden in ' 83o , and exhibited no marked musical talent in his earliest years . Until he grew to manhood , music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profession . In his ninth year he was placed under Friedrich Wieck , the // father of Madame Schumann , under whose guidance he laid the foundation for his future achievements . In 1 848 he went to the University of Leipzig to study law , but he also studied counterpoint under Hauptmann , and became a contributor to a paper called Die Abendpost , in which he adopted the ideas of the revolutionary movement , and upheld the musical doctrines of the new German school led by Liszt and Wagner . The turning-point in his career came about when he witnessed a performance of " Lohengrin " at Weimar in 185o . He threw over his career as a lawyer , and sought the guidance of Wagner at Zurich . In 1851 he went to Liszt at Weimar , and studied pianoforte playing with him , and in 1853 he made his first concert tour through Germany . In 1855 Von Billow became principal pianoforte instructor at the Stern Conservatory in Berlin , and held the position for nine years , during which time he was active in organisRubinstein , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing articles for political and musical papers , and making concert tours through Northern Europe . In 1858 he was appointed pianist at the Prussian Court , and in 1863 the University of Jena conferred upon him the degree of Doctor of Philosophy , in recognition of his services in behalf of musical and literary work . In 1865 he went to Munich as director of the conservatory and conductor of the Royal Opera , and in this city his production of some of Wagner 's operas created a sensation , and greatly enhanced his reputation . In 1866 he was absent from Munich for a time , probably owing to political matters , and in 1869 he went to Florence , where he remained three years , devoting himself to the production of German music in Italy . In 1872 he began his European concert tours , and visited England in 1875 , and America in 1876 . In 1877 he became conductor of the opera at Hanover , remaining there until 188o , when he was made // Intendant at the Court of Meiningen . This post he resigned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to large orchestras in many cities , in which he accomplished wonders . Von Billow married , in 1857 , Liszt 's daughter Cosima , but was divorced from her in 1869 . She then married his friend Richard Wagner . Billow died in 1894 . Von Billow was compared by an American critic with Rubinstein , as a pianist , in the following manner : " While Rubinstein 's playing was of a kind that takes one out of the region of reason and analysis , and leaves him happy but hopeless , Von Billow 's performance sends the student back to his den burning with determination to emulate as far as possible the unsurpassed example of artistic conscientiousness , of genius for hard work . " Von Billow was of strong personality and decided opinions . He entered into many Rubinstein , Von Billow , and Tausig. 169 controversies and created many enemies in the musical world . On one occasion Von Billow met a gentleman to whom he had taken a dislike . The gentleman approached and exclaimed : " Ah ! Doctor Von Billow , I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Billow gazed calmly at him , replied , " Sir , you have won the bet , " raised his hat , and passed on . He became almost more celebrated as a conductor than as a pianist . He conducted without notes , for his memory was marvellous , and his conducting was marked by the greatest eccentricities , and much caprice . He devoted much energy to the production of Wagner 's works . A good anecdote of Billow is told by Mr. Apthorp apropos of the depressing influence of small audiences upon musicians . At one of Von Billow 's recitals in Music Hall , Boston , an auditorium capable of seating nearly three thousand people , the audience amounted to // about forty . There was a driving snowstorm during the day and evening , and the streets were almost impassable . When Von Bulow appeared , he stepped to the front of the platform , and declared that it was the most flattering experience of his artistic career , to find so many people willing to come to hear music on such a night . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he added , " we shall be able to keep one another and the music warm . " He never played better , and the small audience had a little touch of selfish satisfaction at feeling that they had a particularly delightful evening all to themselves . Carl Tausig , who was born at Warsaw in 1841 , was the son of a professional pianist of repute , and therefore received excellent instruction from his earliest days . He was an accomplished musician when , at the age of fourteen , he was taken by his father to Liszt at Weimar . Here he soon became Rubinstein , Von Billow , and Tausig. 171 the favourite pupil of the great master , who spoke of him as the infallible , with fingers of steel . " It is related by Bettina Walker that Liszt one day being enraged with a young pianist who did not come up to his ideas , paced up and down the room , saying as he did so , in a voice calculated to strike terror into the bravest , " Such playing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listened to Tausig ! " In 1858 Tausig made his debut at an orchestral concert given in Berlin by Billow , and it was admitted that his technical powers were phenomenal ; but some seven years later , after he had attained greater breadth and dignity , he was acknowledged to be a master of the first order . His endeavour to give orchestral concerts of an advanced order in Vienna , as Billow did in Berlin , was not successful , and for several years he led the quiet life of a student , until he married and settled at Berlin in 1865 . His arrangements and transcriptions of // many standard works have been and are very generally used , but his compositions are few , as he was cut off in his prime by typhoid fever , at Leipzig , in 1871 . Tausig 's manner of playing was grand , impulsive , and impassioned , yet without a trace of eccentricity . His tone was superb , his touch exquisite , and his dexterity such as to astonish even experts . He made a point of executing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pains to conceal every trace of physical exertion . His repertoire was varied and extensive , and he could play by heart any representative piece by any composer , from Scarlatti to Liszt . He opened a pianoforte school in Berlin and gave many pianoforte recitals , of which his Chopin nights were the most successful , but he played also in many German and Russian cities . Tausig never tolerated frivolities of any kind . It was not in his nature to play anyRubinstein , Von Billow , and Tausig. 173 thing otherwise than as he saw it in black and white , and while he was extraordinarily skilled in the production of " effects , " they had to be distinctly indicated by the composer ; nothing would induce him to supply them on his own responsibility , no matter how forcibly they might be suggested by the character of the composition . In private life he was a delightful companion to those privileged to enjoy his intimacy , for his memory was richly stored with anecdote , and his powers of narration were of no ordinary calibre . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , everything vulgar or trivial was repugnant to him , ? in short , he was one of the elect of mankind . Von Lenz gives the following description of Tausig 's performance : " Tausig 's left hand was a second right . He never appeared to notice difficulties . Anton Rubinstein called him ' the infallible ; ' Liszt spoke of his fingers as ' brazen . ' // 11 His distinguishing characteristic was that he never played for effect , but was always absorbed in the piece itself and its artistic interpretation . This objectivity the general public never understood ; whenever serpents are strangled it always wants to know how big and dangerous they are , and judges of this by the performer 's behaviour . The general public thinks that whatever appears easily surmounted is not really difficult , and that son or daughter at home might do it just as well . But it was this outward calm , this perfect steadiness of Tausig 's attitude , which crowned his virtuosity. l ( Let us sum up the artist , etc . His command of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resided the poetry of a conqueror holding sovereign sway over material and machinery , ? a poetry peculiar and apart . His talent for the strict style ( fugue , the imitative style ) was unique . He played fugues , and the like , with the charm Rubinstein , Von Biilow , and Tausig. 175 of the most charming treatment of the free style . As was once said of him , ( His neatness in every part , the nuances of his touch , made this domain popular , generally intelligible , universally interesting . ' In the fugue we confront the letter , into which we are to breathe the spirit of art , not a subjective personality , an artistic subjectivity , in a narrow sense . Tausig possessed , in a high degree , the power of subordinating his own nature to the necessity of his art , so that in the fugue he was peculiarly at home . He commanded the entire arsenal of the utmost possibilities of the piano as expressed in the compositions of Liszt , and was a finished interpreter of Chopin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the most prominent virtuosi the world has ever known , an infaillibler triumphator at the piano . " CHAPTER VI . THE MODERN PIANISTS . THERE can be no greater proof of the power wielded by Liszt than is shown by a perusal of the list of celebrated pianists who flourished during the latter half of the nineteenth century . From the time of Von Bulow until the advent of Paderewski , it seems that almost every pianist of note was a pupil of Liszt . Indeed , such was the magic of his name that it was used by many who were not entitled to it , and both critics and public became suspicious of the " pupils of Liszt . " Rubinstein , though not a pupil of Liszt , sought his advice , and was guided by it in completing his education . 176 // It must not be supposed that the revolution in pianoforte playing was brought about by Liszt alone . He , like Beethoven , lived in advance of his generation , and the standard set by both has not yet been surpassed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pianist . Liszt came forth from his retirement in 1836 to vanquish his only serious rival , Thalberg , and the doom of empty virtuosity was sealed . It did not die at once , for its apostles flourished for some thirty years more , or even longer , but they were yearly falling into disrepute . A new standard had been raised , and the public was gradually educated to it . Music became more intellectual , and the great apostle of intellectual music was Johannes Brahms , who has been called the lineal successor of Beethoven , and who is , with Schubert , Schumann , and Franz , one of the great figures in the history of the Lied . // The name of Johannes Brahms will always be associated chiefly with his compositions , but in his youth Brahms was a brilliant and versatile player . A native of Hamburg , he was the son of a double-bass player , who gave him his early instruction in music .

A similar anecdote is told of Beethoven and of Woelffl . At Hanover the young men played before the court , through the influence of Joachim . They next proceeded to Altenburg , to see Liszt . Brahms met with little favour from // Liszt , who , however , recognised his talent , and he soon returned to Hanover , where Joachim gave him a letter to Schumann , who gave him an enthusiastic welcome , and proclaimed to the world that a new genius had arisen . Schumann wrote of him : , When at the piano he unveiled wonders to us , we seemed to be in enchanted regions . His playing was like that of an orchestra , at one time pathetic and then again full of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technical perfection , which was , in his estimation , a matter of small moment compared to the conveyance of the true meaning of his musical ideas and poetical conceptions to his hearer . While the inaccuracy of his playing vexed the ear , its descriptiveness and suggestiveness were fruitful in exercise for the intelligence . It left the impression that he never thoroughly studied any work selected by him for performance , but was content
