 |p822  WHO has not been alternately puzzled and fascinated by the curious tale related in the 11th chapter of the Book of Genesis ? Within the compass of nine verses the narrator furnishes his answer to two of the most perplexing problems in mankind 's history ? the dispersion of the human race and the diversity of human speech , and incidental to the solution reveals his view of human progress . Indeed , it would not be difficult from these nine verses to reconstruct the system of philosophy to which the narrator was attached . The tale merits the epithet curious , for while we find parallels among other nations for most of the other stories , legends , traditions and myths that are strung together in the early chapters of Genesis , this one is quite unique . Speculation in regard to the origin of the world led people while still in a state of primitive culture to devise creation myths in abundance . Stories of a lost Paradise and of a golden age placed in the remote past are similarly found among various nations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exceptional to hit upon a quarter of the globe where they do not exist . To be sure , the stories of creation , of a golden age and of a deluge are by no means in all cases original productions . Parallel to the migratory movements of mankind we have the migrations of traditions , which , as they are carried from place to place , undergo manifold transformations in being adapted to different conditions , and in view of the agreement and of the interdependence in the case of so many primitive myths and traditions , it is rather significant that such a tale as the one that follows upon the Biblical account of the deluge was not carried about and that it has not even been found in the one place where we would naturally look for it , Babylonia . The story . however , is far more curious ? it is in its present form one of the most characteristic productions of the religious spirit impressed upon the Hebrews in part by their political experiences , but in large part by the influence of a remarkable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eighth and seventh centuries B. C. and who gave a new direction to the religious and social development of the people in whose midst they lived and taught . Tho the scene of action in the tale is the Euphrates Valley , and the setting is entirely Babylonian , the story is not a Babylonian one , nor based on any Babylonian tradition ; it is an expression in legendary form of the spirit and philosophy of the Hebrew prophets . The story at first glance seems simple enough . All mankind , speaking the same language , dwells together in a valley in the land of Shinar , when a decision is reached to build a city and a high tower . The plan is frustrated by God , who is here designated as Yahweh , who confuses the speech of the people so that , no longer able to understand one another , they abandon the building of the city and scatter over the face of the earth . The story closes with an etymology of Babylon , which it is said was so called because Yahweh there confused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play of words ? the Hebrew verb for confuse being balal , and which comes sufficiently close to Babel ( as tho contracted from balbal ) to warrant the association . The Babylonians explained Babel or Babylon as compounded of two words , bab ? gate , and ilu ? god ; but this may likewise be merely a play upon the name , and have no more etymological value than the Hebrew explanation . Brief as the story is , it does not appear to be of one cloth , but is compounded , as  |p823  so many of the narratives in Genesis , of two tales , or perhaps it would be more correct to say , of two versions of one and the same story . According to the one the story deals with the building of a city undertaken by mankind in order to " make a name " for itself and which was interrupted by Yahweh without any apparent reason . Yahweh in this version simply says : " Behold ! They are a united people and have the same speech . Let us go down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the speech of the other , " and the story closes with the etymology of Babylon as follows : They were obliged therefore to abandon the building of the city . Therefore the place is called Babylon , for there Yahweh confused the speech of mankind . " The other story or version speaks of the building of a tower , and a reasonable motive is assigned for Yahweh 's opposition to it by the express declaration of the builders , represented as mankind in general , that the tower is to reach up to heaven ; and altho this is not done with a view of invading Yahweh 's domain , but , as the builders add , " that we may not be scattered over the face of the earth , " yet Yahweh , who is described in this version also as coming down ( from heaven , where he dwells ) to look at the tower which mankind has built , objects to the ambitions of the human race and fears the further growth of human power . " This is merely the beginning of their work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may plan . " It will be noted that in the one story the building of the city is interrupted , whereas in the other the tower is represented as having been completed . Nor is it implied that Yahweh destroys the tower ? he merely frustrates the desire of mankind not to be dispersed over the earth . The second story , moreover , contains no reference to any confusion of speech , but it agrees again with the first in making Babylon the scene of action , for the end of the ninth verse , which belongs to this version , expressly states , " thence ( i. e. , from Babylon ) Yahweh scattered them over the face of the earth . " Both tales therefore agree in one es sential point ? in manifesting a spirit of opposition toward the achievements and ambitions of the Babylonians . The high tower is the characteristic sacred edifice of Babylonia , as characteristic as the pyramid is of Egypt . Built in imitation of mountains , the erection of such towers ? called zikkurats ? in a flat country like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ origin for the population , or for a portion of it which believed that the gods dwelt on the tops of mountain peaks . Hence at the top of the towers , which consisted of three , four , up to so many as seven stages superimposed one upon the other , and provided with means of ascent either by a winding balustrade or by a direct staircase from one stage to the other , there was the chamber sacred to the god in whose honor the tower was built . Such towers were found , in addition to the temple proper , in every important religious center of Babylonia . They are frequently referred to in the historical inscriptions of Babylonian rulers . The University of Pennsylvania expedition to Nippur unearthed the remains of one which dates back to the third millennium before this era , and it is hoped that the German expedition now conducting excavations in the city of Babylon will succeed in discovering the site of the seven staged tower sacred to Marduk , the chief god of Babylonia , and which is probably the one described @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 189 ) . It bore the proud name of " The Foundation Stone of Heaven and Earth , " and its restorers , after the destruction of Babylon by Sennacherib , Nabopolassar ( 625-605 B. C. ) and his great son , the famous Nebuchadnezzar ( 605-562 B. C. ) , use the same expression , " to make it as high as heaven , ' " that we find in the Old Testament story , to emphasize their ambitious hopes . According to modern standards these towers , ranging from 90 to 15o feet , would not be regarded as particularly high ; but from the point of view of the " Pentateuchal " writers , whose ideal altar was a simple construction of earth , and according to whom Yahweh 's favorite sanctuary was a portable tabernacle of small dimensions and of primitive construction , the Babylonian towers appeared huge indeed . It  |p824  is in all probability the zikkurat of Babylon , " the foundation stone of heaven and earth , " that the narrator in Genesis had in mind , and his protest against such an edifice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achievement in the eyes of the Babylonians ? as not at all pleasing in the sight of God , involved a condemnation of the entire Babylonian civilization . Similarly the city of Babylon , which the latest redactor of the story has in view , was not the older city which was completely destroyed by the Assyrian king Sennacherib in 689 B. C. , but the new Babylon , due again to Nabopolassar and to his son Nebuchadnezzar , and which is the scene of action in the book of Daniel ( 4 : 26 , 27 ) . It is this newer city likewise which classical writers describe in such grandiloquent terms as the pride and wonder of the world and which contained , among other notable structures , the famous Hanging Gardens . All such ambitious undertakings were distasteful to Hebrew writers , who , following in the steps of the prophets , emphasize the simple agricultural life as the ultimate cultural development beyond which it is sinful to pass . In the Pentateuch as in the Prophets , the establishment of a kingdom with an elaborate court , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ royalty , is discountenanced . Yahweh should suffice as the people 's king , and the highest official therefore in the Pentateuchal legislation is the priest as Yahweh 's vicar ? not the warrior or the nobleman . Babylon is chosen as the symbol of all that is distasteful to the pious Yahweh worshipers , and the hostile attitude revealed in the ninth chapter of Genesis against the great city and its huge tower is in keeping with the general spirit of opposition against the ambitions and achievements of ancient civilization . The condemnation of Babylon and of its zikkurat involved an opposition to other seats of culture as well ? of Egypt , for example , and Phoenicia ? but Babylon is chosen as typical for special reasons . In the first place , as a military power Babylonia and Assyria far outstripped the kingdom of the Nile , particularly in later times . Moreover , was it not Assyria that destroyed the kingdom of Israel and was it not the famous Nebuchadnezzar who had applied the torch to Yahweh 's temple at Jerusalem and who had demolished the independence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the prophets , the punishment was amply deserved , for the people had sinned against their God : but , for all that , the patriotic feelings of exilic and post-exilic Hebrew writers were particularly aroused against the power that had worked such dreadful havoc among them . The main purpose of both stories therefore is to utter a protest against ancient civilization as personified in Babylonian achievements . One writer chose the sacred edifices of Babylonia as the point of his attack ; another went still further and condemned the building of the entire city of Babylon as an impious act , prompted by the sinful ambition to " make a name " ? that is , to acquire fame and renown . The glory of the new Babylon proved to be of short duration . Less than sixty-five years after the death of Nebuchadnezzar Cyrus entered Babylon in triumph and put an end to the Babylonian empire . The capital of the new empire became Susa , while the building operations in Babylon , as a matter of fact , ceased , and tho the city continued its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its rank entirely . The post-exilic editor of Genesis saw in this humiliation a confirmation of his view that the entire Babylonian civilization was displeasing to Yahweh . The Biblical writers , however , are not merely pessimists , giving expression to their personal feelings . Closely entwined with their patriotism and their religious fervor is a system of philosophy . According to this system mankind , created by one God , necessarily originated in one place . The extreme age of the settlements in the Euphrates Valley profoundly impressed the Hebrew writers , more particularly as the traditions of the Hebrews pointed likewise to this valley as the home of their own ancestors . It was but a natural step to picture the valley as at one time actually the home of all mankind . The question therefore arose in the mind of a philosophic writer : How came mankind to be separated in all parts of the world , and , furthermore , the writer argued , if all mankind was settled  |p825  in one place , there must have been only one language spoken at that time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great diversity of human speech ? His answer is : Babylonia is responsible for both . The author or compiler , voicing the religious hope of postexilic Judaism that all nations may once more be united in the worship of the one God , singing in tuneful accord the praise of Him whose only legitimate sanctuary is in Jerusalem , views both circumstances , the dispersion of mankind and the diversity of speech , as a temporary punishment which could only have been sent by a just God for some sufficient reason . The philosopher steps forth and justifies the preacher 's protest against the achievements of civilization by advancing the theory that civilization defeats its own aims . " Making a name " ? i. e. , the achieving of fame and renown , which , according to him , is the only motive behind the cultural aims of mankind ? is sinful . Such motives arouse Yahweh 's opposition and the latter therefore decides to frustrate human aims by a simple device ? the confusion of tongues . To build a tower that should reach to heaven is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kind of sanctuary that Yahweh desires ? and just because mankind does not desire to be scattered , Yahweh determines to manifest his superior power by scattering them . Both evils , therefore ? the dispersion and the diversity of speech ? are due to civilization , and the typical example of Babylonia illustrates what the outcome of civilization necessarily is . Such is the purpose of this curious tale , the present form of which belongs to the period after the rise of the Persian empire under Cyrus . In thus bringing the final redaction of the story down to so late a period we must beware of falling into the error of supposing that the tradition to which a writer ( or a school of writers ) has attached his philosophy and his solution of puzzling problems is also of a late date . As in the case of all the myths , legends and traditions embodied in the book of Genesis ? in many respects the most remarkable in the Old Testament collection ? we must distinguish between the original features and such elements as have at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stories into accord with the religious and ethical views of later times and of making them serve as illustrations of religious doctrines , of moral precepts or of the philosophy of life . This task of analysis , which is still engaging the attention of scholars , is an exceedingly difficult and necessarily delicate one , requiring the exercise of sober judgment in combination with the most careful attention to minute variations in phraseology in one and the same story and to a separation of the varying and often conflicting conceptions introduced in the different parts of the tale in question . So the Creation story , as is now admitted practically by all scholars , consists of elements which take us back to primitive conceptions of the universe , and which therefore belong to a very early age , and yet these older elements are combined with such an unsurpassed statement of an advanced monotheistic doctrine as the opening words of the story . The older elements in this process are not rejected , but transformed by the view pervading the whole of the Hebrew Creation story , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spirit , whose fiat is sufficient to change chaos into order and permanently to establish the laws of Nature . Similarly , in the story of the Tower and the City there is abundant evidence that it existed in an older form than the one now at our disposal , told without the purpose that led to its retention in the narrative of the early fortunes of mankind , and it is also clear that in this older form it rested upon very simple and almost childlike ideas of the manner in which Yahweh carried out his purposes . Traces of the older story are to be found in the description of Yahweh coming down to look at the doings of men and in his fear of what might happen if mankind were permitted to go on in their work , implying that they might threaten Yahweh 's own domain . Such a God is far removed from the one of whom the Psalmist ( Ps. 2 : 41 ) says that from his seat in the heavens he laughs at the futile efforts of men to alter the Divine Will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dedication prayer put into Solomon 's  |p826  mouth ( I Kings 8 : 27 ) of a Being whom " even the heaven and the heaven of heavens can not contain . " In its original form the story need not have referred necessarily to the zikkurat of Babylon or to the city of Babylon . Any one of the staged towers in the various religious centers of the Euphrates Valley would have served to impress profoundly the Semitic nomads who regularly poured forth from the Arabian Desert , and who in the course of their wanderings to the north skirted the district of the Euphrates and Tigris and saw with their own eyes the achievements of Babylonian culture . In the minds of untutored Semites the high buildings and extensive cities of Babylonia aroused not only astonishment , but also a sense of horror , and that this view , resting ultimately upon the barbarian 's instinctive protest against culture , still prevails in the East even after centuries of Islamic influence , may be gathered from the attitude of the modern Arabs , who when Layard conducted his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Nimrod , the embodiment of all that is wicked and cruel . The question may be raised , Are we , indeed , justified in ascribing to Hebrew writers such views as are involved in the interpretation here proposed on the basis of modern Biblical research ? In reply one need only point , as already intimated , to the general spirit which pervades the Pentateuch . The happiest state of mankind is pictured in the primitive life led by Adam and Eve . On the " tree of knowledge of good and evil " hangs the forbidden fruit . The phrase , " knowledge of good and evil , " means in Hebrew parlance the " reasoning faculties . " The Hebrew writer consistently carries back the misfortunes of civilization to the first step ? the acquirement of reason . C'est le premier pas qui coute . In the story of Cain and Abel the preference is given to Abel , the pastoral nomad ? representing the simple form of culture ? over Cain , the fratricide who becomes the city builder . The murderer passes over the body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The cultivation of the vine ? another achievement of advancing culture ? brings about the pious Noah 's disgrace . The typical Hebrew ? the patriarch Abraham ? leads the life of a pastoral nomad , whereas his nephew , Lot . abandons this form of . existence to settle in the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah. which because they are cities , are described as hotbeds of vice and corruption . In the Pentateuchal legislation a concession is made to necessary conditions by holding up agricultural life as the proper . ideal , but the protest against culture is quite as forcibly maintained in the opposition to commerce , to royalty and in the approval of the simple altar and of the portable sanctuary , as against more ambitious structures . The simpler life is in every case preferred to the more advanced , the pastoral stage given the preference to the agricultural and the agricultural to the commercial stage . It is in accord with this spirit therefore that the compiler who combined the story of the City with that of the Tower illustrates by this example his view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a curse , leading to divine displeasure and divine punishment . What we would call progress is frankly declared by him to be responsible for the ills and misfortunes of mankind . Strange as this attitude in certain Old Testament writers may at first sight appear , it is not so uncommon among earnest religious minds as one might be led to suppose . The early Christians looked upon Roman civilization in much the same light as the pious post-exilic Hebrews did upon Babylonian culture . Called forth by a recognition of the oppression , misery and moral corruption that so often accompany political aggrandizement and industrial advancement , this attitude finds an exponent even in our own days ? in no less a personage than Tolstoy , who so eloquently pleads the cause of the oppressed and who , like the ancient Hebrew editor of Genesis , holds modern culture and modern science directly responsible for the inequality existing among mankind and for the consequent sacrifice of the weaker for the benefit of the stronger .               @ @ @ @ @ @
