 | ABOVE all things , parents , do not say to your child 's music teacher : " Ca n't you give Minnie some more pieces , instead of all those scales and finger exercises ? " And then add , like a covert threat : " We heard Florence , from next door , play such a lot of pretty things the other day . " It is almost the same as telling him that unless he does as you wish , instead of he , who has made musical instruction his life study , thinks best , you will take your child out of his hands and engage Florence 's teacher for her . It may demoralize him , unless he is a person of strong individuality , and may greatly retard your daughter 's musical progress . Then , too , how unjust it is ! Remember you lie ye not heard " Florence from next door " play C meaty times with her thumb , I ) twenty times with her forefinger ? and so on , up to G. But her parents have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to the other : " Dear , Minnie from next door was here , to-day , and it is surprising how many pretty things she plays . I wish Florence 's teacher would give her more pieces . " There is no royal road to " pieces " ? neither for the beginner , nor for the accomplished musician . Faderewski , the greatest living pianist , practices his scales and finger exercises every day for an hour or longer . Sonetimes he will play over a brief left hand passage a hundred times or more before he is satisfied with it . But , when he steps out on the platform next day , he is sure of that passage . Here is a genius who still drudges ? which may be one reason why no other pianist is able to rival him with the public . Von Buelow used to say that , if he left off his exercises for a day , he noticed the effect on his playing ; if he left them off for two days , the public noticed it ; and then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he left them off three days , the critics began to notice it . Music is a matter of head , heart and fingers ( or voice ) , and the musician who neglects the daily exercises soon will fall off in technical facility . Technique may be only a means to an end , but it is the only means to that end . The foregoing instances one of the mistakes parents are apt to make in their attitude toward their child 's musical development . The subject of musical instruction often has been discussed , and as often the fact has been overlooked that instead of only two parties , teacher and pupil , three are involved ? teacher , pupil and parents . How much devolves upon the parents ! And how few of them realize that , as they can be of the greatest assistance in the musical education that is carried on within the hme , so they can be the greatest stumbling block in its way . Choice of a teacher is the first responsibility resting upon the parents , and at the outset they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mediocre instruction at the beginning may never be overcome . To be started aright is of the utmost importance to the pupils correct development . Too often a teacher is chosen on the score of cheapness alone and under the mistaken idea that " anyone is good enough to begin with " ; whereas , if there is a time when a pupil needs to be taught more carefully than at any other , it is at the beginning . Mind and fingers are plastic , and erroneous ideas and poor form are how easily acquired , but with what difficulty corrected in after years ! That a teacher 's charges are not high is not in itself against him . But it should not be the sole reason he is engaged . Neither should parents who can afford to pay any price jump at a teacher because his charges are high . It is natural , perhaps , that people who have not given sufficient thought to the matter , should believe that a fine player also must be a fine teacher , and pay out a large sum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instruction , however brief , with some distinguished virtuoso . They forget that the pedagogic faculty is something quite by itself , and that great players usually lack the patience required of successful instructors . Rubinstein , for instance , would have ruined any pupil whose natural talents were not  | almost equal to his own . He once told Josef Hofmann , who studied with him , to begin a certain Beethoven sonata softly and in slower time , and , at the next lesson , when Hofmann played it as he had been told , Rubinstein cried out impatiently , " Loud and fast ! " The explanation is that Rubinstein was a virtuoso of varying moods . Fortunately Hofmann was genius enough to appreciate these , strike an average between them , and thus benefit by the instruction . The principle underlying all this is that , when it coipee to instruction , it is not the price , whether high or low , that counts , but the teacher himself . It is entirely possible for parents to find a teacher whose charges are moderate and yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days when Von Buelow , Raft , To ussig and others , who in turn became celebrities , were studying with him , took no fees whatever . His pupils were his disciples , his music room their temple , Weimar the paradise of budding musical genius . We are not ripe yet for such conditions . But they indicate the relationship which should exist between teacher and taught . We can not reproduce Weimar in Squedunk or Bird Center ; but there hardly is in the United States a place so small that there are not in it men and women who are doing the right thing in music and proving their capacity to engage their pupils ' enthusiasm and hold them loyally to their tasks . The likelihood that such men and women will be overlooked is what makes me warn parents against making cheapness the sole consideration in choosing a music teacher . Discriminate between the moderate priced teacher and the cheap one , whose instruction also is " cheap . " In the gradual commercializing of the arts in this country musical instruction has not yet reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is taught by laughing gas or some other " painless " method , but sometimes it seems to me that we are precious near it . Let me throw out a further caution . Never engage as a music teacher anyone who prefixes " professor " to his name , unless you are sure that he has the right to use the title . Ten to one he is a charlatan . Unless the title has been conferred by a college like Harvard , Yale or Columbia , at each of which there is a well established musical department , it is of no value ; and , as likely as not , it is spurious . Some conservatories and colleges of music in this country have secured special charters from their state legislatures giving them the privilege of creating " professors " and of conferring the degree of doctor of music . But I should be sorry to have a child of mine taught by one of these " professors " or " Mus Does , " who is apt to know as much about music as a Kentucky " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fake ? there is no better word for it ? is the teacher with this or that " method . " There are many " methods " ? and in some branches of education methods may go ? but in music there is only one correct method , and that is to have no method , but to consider each pupil as a separate individuality , according to talent , temperament , and flexibility of wrist , hands and fingers . This is what Leschetizky , world-renowned as Paderewski 's teacher , does . IIe has no rule or rote . His teaching varies with the individuality of each pupil . Of course his name is one to conjure with . Consequently there are teachers who never have been out of this country , yet who claim to use , by authority , the " Leschetizky method . " Needless to say they are humbugs , for there is no such thing . One of the few pupils whom Paderewski himself ever has " taken on , " , tells me that the virtuoso , like his teacher , eschews method @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room . Seated at one , the pupil begins playing . If a passage does not go to Paderewski 's liking , he calls a halt and plays it for the pupil on the second piano . This may occur several times with the same passage . Liszt , one of the few great pianists who also was a great teacher , scorned " method . " Often I have heard William Mason , the dean of the American musical faculty , and who spent over a year with Liszt at Weimar , tell how that master imparted instruction . The pupil simply played , Liszt and the other pupils sitting about the salon smoking and listening . Usually Liszt would call out suggestions as to changes in time and expression ; and , occasionally , he would grow excited , gently shove the pupil out of the chair and , seating himself , play the piece as he conceived it should be rendered . This was a lesson by suggestion , not method , and Mr Mason says that from the first time Liszt interrupted him and played a passage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch which distinguishes the virtuoso from the piano pounder . Under  | these ' circumstances Liszt 's American pupil was quite willing to be shoved off the chair . Such lessons sound too good to be true , and so they are unless the master is a Liszt . But the ineidents noted show that the greatest pianist and greatest piano teacher who ever lived , Liszt , and the most famous instructor in music to-day , Leschetizky. and his most famous pupil , Paderewski , regard a cut and dried method as futile . Most parents are obliged to engage teachers for their children in the locality in which they themselves live . But that is no reason why they should not discriminate , and bearing in mind what I have said , avoid the merely " cheap " instructor , the " professor " and the man with a - method . " Some teachers have a system of finger gymnastics in connection with their lessons . But such attempts at securing greater pliability in the cords and muscles used in playing should be countenanced only with the utmost caution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employment by any teacher , however able in other respects , who has charge of your children 's musical education . It was by gymnastics of this kind no less a musical " than Robert Schumann ruined his brilliant prospects as a pianist . lie strained certain essential cords . An apparatus for hand and finger gymnastics was patented under the name of chirogymnast in London in 1842 . I have seen the illustrated hook which describes it , and the pictures remind one of a torture chamber during the inquisition . Still earlier in the last century musical London had been torn by a dispute between one Logier , who had invented a socalled chiroplast , for securing the proper position of the hand in playing , and a committee of the London Philharmonic , which repotted adversely on the inventor 's claims . Now it is regarded simply as a curiosity in musical pedagogics . That the only legitimate dexterity is that acquired by practice on the musical instrument itself may be set down as one of the eternal verities of music . So much for the chief considerations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That choice having been made , however judiciously , there still remains much which parents  | can do ' to make or mar the musical progress of their children . To begin with , there should be discrimination on the part both of parents and teacher between a child who shows promise of achieving celebrity in music and is to be taught accordingly , and one with whom music is to be but an added accomplishment in the circle of home and friends . An abnormally gifted child , thoroughly in earnest , is apt to practice too much , and to be encouraged in it by overambitious parents and teachers until a promising career ma , - be ruined by the strain . Alexander Lambert , w ho has brought forward many concert players , will not allow even his most advanced pupils to practice more than four Lou : s a day . He says significantly that a pupil who will not become a virtuoso on four hours ' daily practice , will not become one on six or eight hours ' . Even the four hours of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between which the pupil is obliged to rest , or preferably , take outdoor exercise . It is true that Paderewski often practices eight hours a day , but he is an artist of many years ' standing and , in , spite of his slender and poetic appearance at the piano , a man of great muscular strength , developed largely through his favorite method of exercise , swimming . The great majority of music pupils are , of course , amateurs , and of these , in turn , the great majority are girls . It hardy seems necessary to point out that their health should be guarded most carefully . and yet the physical development of a child often is overlooked by parents and teachers ambitious to push the pupil unduly . The schedule of instruction and practice always should be arranged with careful consideration for the fact that there are school studies to he attended to and time for outdoor exercise to be provided . In New York many children spend their mornings in school and their afternoons at their music lessons , dancing class , gymnasium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gymnasium and skating are supposed to be systematized exercise , a term which to me seems to have been coined to ease the conscience of parents who are following the prevailing-fashion of unloading the care of their children on others , so that it will not interfere with their own ' society- ' ' engagements . For nothing indoors ever will take the place of outdoor exercise . A young beginner under a good teacher will progress satisfactorily with two or three periods each of three-quarters of an hour , and with an hour 's practice daily between lesson days . Even that hour should be divided into two well separated half hours . There is a tendency nowadays , among people who can afford it , toward brief daily lesson periods and no practice , which amounts to the same thing as having the pupil practice under the supervision of the teacher . On the face of it this seems advantageous , but it is open to the ohjeetion that it prevents the pupil acquiring self-reliance . What is said here is of general application . Music lessons may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , but with a child of five I should have even shorter lesson and practice periods than I have indicated ? say-three instruction periods of half all hour each a week , with from half to three-quarters of nu hour practice on those days when no lesson is given . Parents should not expect of children who are unusually bright at school the same rapid progress in mu-de , Odell is largely a matter of temperament . A child may be quick in general studies , yet lack ear for pitch or tune and limberness of fingers . Often the musical ' sense is latent and does not begin to disclose itself until after a fairly long course of instruction . For this reason , even with the brightest child , too much should not be expected of the teacher . On the other hand progress should be observable . For I maintain that with skill and patience on the part of the teacher every child , even of the most ordinary intelligence , can be taught music and reach the point when his or her performance will be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there any reason why the early steps in music should be harrowing to the soul of the listener ! The great pout is that whatever the child is taught to play it should be taught to play well . This is something upon which parents can not insist too strenuously . In it lies the difference between good playing and sloppy playing . possibly all through life . A finger exercise , a scale , properly delivered , that is , clearly and accurately , is not disagreeable to listen to ; and the little beginner 's pieces , when well taught , may give positive pleasure . To hurry a pupil from one half-learned piece to another , which , ill turn , will be only half learned ,  | is a tendency of mediocre teaching . Nothing is more distressing than the playing of a child , or even of an older pupil , who , having learned much , yet has learned nothing . I have spoken already of a proneness on the part of parents to judge a child 's musical progress by the number of pieces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not mean by this that a pupil should , in the early stages of instruction , be restricted wholly to exereise.s and scales . Aside from the fact that the parents who pay the piper naturally want to hear the tune , it would be- a pedagogic error . Montaigne experienced pleasure in learning Greek as a child because his father persuaded him it was a new game . So pieces awaken a child 's first pleasure in musical instruction . Each set of exercises should lead up to a well written little composition , thus illustrating to the pupil the relation , between technique and the art to which it is a means ? and , as I said before , the only means . The great majority of music pupils take piano lessons , and I have written with this in mind . What I have said cam however , be applied to any instrumental instruction . The voice would u quire an article by itself . But in general boys should not have regular vocal instruction until the voice has definitely changed ; girls not until it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eighteen . Nothing bas a more refining influence on the home circle than music . It is the most ethereal of arts and diffuses an atmosphere all its own . Parents , even if not musical , who have their children properly taught , can have but little idea at the outset , o.f the paradise they are opening up , not only to the children , but to themselves as well . For they , too , will progress with the younger generation , until , so far as concerns taste and appreciation , the beauties of this divine art will lie before them like an open book .
