txt Gov . Roosevelt had an exciting experience today at Victor , a few miles from Cripple Creek , among the mines , where a demonstrative crowd had assembled . The Governor had a narrow escape from serious personal violence . The incident was the only one of the kind that has occurred during the progress of the trip , and it is said that the trouble was occasioned by a small body of roughs who had been organized and paid for the purpose of breaking up the meeting . The men engaged were few in number , but violent in , their attack . Gov . Roosevelt spoke at Armory Hall , which was filled . He . had hardly begun speaking when he was interrupted by noisy demonstrations . He said : " In my State the men who were put on the Committee on Platform to draw up an anti-trust platform at the Kansas City Convention had their ' pockets stuffed at that time with Ice Trust stock . The Democratic leader in New York , Richard Croker , upon whom you base your only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too  --  was another great stockholder , and if , in fact , . you were to read through the list of stockholders in that trust it would sound like reading the roll of the members of Tammany Hall . " ' A voice cried : " What about the rotten beef ? " The Governor replied : " I ate it , and you will never get near enough to be hit with a bullet , or within five miles of it . " Gov . Roosevelt succeeded in finishing his remarks , though there was an evident intention among those present that he should not do so . When the Governor left the hall with his party to go toward the train , he was surrounded by a company of Rough Riders , commanded by Sherman Bell , one ' of his own soldiers in the Spanish war . He was also accompanied by ; Gen. Curtis Guild , Jr. , of- Boston ; John proctor Clarke of New York , Geri : , Irving Hale of Colorado . United ' . States . " Senator Wolcott , Frank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , S. Ryder , candidate for Lieutenant Governcr ; A. M. Stevenson , Lieut . Tice , and several others . Gov . Roosevelt and his party were on foot . A crowd of boys and men began throwing stones and shouting for Bryan . The Rough Riders , mounted and unmounted , closed in around the Governor to protect him from assault by the mob . One made a personal attack upon Gov . Roosevelt and succeeded in striking him a blow in the breast with a stick . The assailant was immediately knocked down by Daniel M. Sullivan . Postmaster of Cripple Creek . A rush was then made by the mob to drag the mounted men in khaki uniforms from their horses . The men on foot , also in khaki , closed around the Governor , making a wedge which pushed through the crowd , and they ' finally succeeded in gaining the train , which was surrounded by the mob . By this time there was probably 1,000 or 1,500 excited people in the vicinity , and fisticuffs were exchanged on all sides . Many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with rotten potatoes , stale eggs and lemons . ' The entire party regained the train , however , without serious injury , and it pulled out of the place with the Rough Riders on ... e rear platform . Gov . Roosevelt . while regretting the occurrence , was not disturbed by the incident , and was ready to proceed to this town . At all the other places where the Governor stopped during the day he was well received . At Colorado Springs a great demonstration was made on the arrival of the Roosevelt train . . The Governor made a short speech in the Temple Theatre and one in the Opera House . Both places were crowded . All business houses along the line of march were decorated with bunting . On leaving Colorado Springs the Roosevelt train was split into two sections , the first stop thereafter being at Colorado City . The entire population appeared to see the New York Governor and shake his hand . Manitou was the next stop . A large crowd was assembled here to listen to the fiveminute talk of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where there was a pause . A call was also made at Gillette and Independence .
