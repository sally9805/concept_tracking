txt William and Henry Fagen of 979 Eighth Avenue and Henry Helmke , who with a boatman named Williams were fishing in the sailboat Hope in the lower bay last Tuesday when they were caught in the ? hurricane , returned to their homes at 2:30 o'clock yesterday morning . Their experience is regarded as one of the most thrilling that ever fell to the lot of local boatmen . The Hope , a flimsy affair about fifteen feet long , was taken in the teeth of a hurricane and carried out into the Atlantic Ocean twenty-five miles from land , and , after being tossed about like a chip on mountainous waves for fifteen hours with her burden of four men , was picked up by a passing fishing smack on Wednesday morning right side up and none the worse for wear . The occupants of the little cockleshell of a craft reached their homes at last little affected by their terrible voyage except for all overmastering aversion for the sport of angling .

" A party of six of us , " said he , " arranged during an evil moment last week to go fishing on Tuesday for flounders off City Island in the Sound . Then some chump , I forget who it was , suggested blackfish in the lower bay . Three of the party could not get away when the day arrived . Helmke , my brother Henry , and I went to South Beach and engaged the Hope , with Capt . Williams , an experienced boatman , to manage her for us . " We left South Beach at 9 o'clock Tuesday morning and made for a 1 ? , int about eight miles off shore and about midway between Sandy Hook and Staten Island . We had a good day 's sport , having pulled in about fifty blackfish .

I hardly know what happened for a moment afterward , for the wind , the blinding dust , and the sea water that was . dashed into our faces shut out everything . We did n't go over , however , but fell right over in the trough of the sea and scurried away before the wind . N. " Williams was : trigging wildly , - at the ropes and ? banvas .

We must have got far out at sea by S or 9 o'clock ' judging by the increase in the height of the waves , which seemed to lift us as high as a skyscraper , then swing us down into a big cafion . The thermometer seemed to go right down to zero , and the wind blowing through our drenched garments was like ice . We were deathly sick , too . " Along toward midnight Capt . Williams sighted the lights of a big steamship running a short distance from us . We shouted in unison . They heard us and slowed up .

" When the dawn finally broke we could see no land anywhere . We were just about to try to rig a distress signal when we sighted a fishing smack bearing down in our direction . They had . already seen us , and soon after lowered ** and picked us up . The smack was the Sunshine ? I 'll never forget that name , and , when we were finally dragged aboard of her , we could scarcely stand for cold and stiffness . The skipper and crew of the smack knew just what to do for us , however , and we were soon all fast asleep in a warm place . " The Captain told us we were twenty miles southeast of Sandy Hook . The smack made slow work of it into port , not getting in until late at night . A tug took us off and landed us at a wharf somewhere in Brooklyn about midnight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As long as I live I will remain content to buy my fish at market prices .
