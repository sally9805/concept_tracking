FIE boy who stated that a vessel going from the Potomac by way of the Suez Canal to Manila would pass through the Gulf of Mexico , plaintively remarks , " I am not real sure of this , for we have n't had maps yet . " He was merely asserting in one way the educational value of illustration . Probably in accordance with this truth the first Grecian map of the universe was drawn by some enthusiastic teacher of literature to illustrate Homer 's very general statements Concerning a great river that encircles the entire earth . Just what conceptions , opinions , and debates were the result of this daring performance history tells us not . But enough thought was given to the subject before the fall of the Roman Empire and the beginning of the Dark Ages for two great books to have been written upon geography . Ptolemy , one of these authors , is particularly interesting to us , since his work , found at the time of the Renaissance , became the standard work for the two centuries during which our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this book procured a scholar to write about the new land and to furnish an illustration for the univer sal conditions as they appeared to him . Ptolemy himself was a knowing man , who lived about 150 A. D. For him the world was round , though its size was much too great . His worst mistakes were to consider Ceylon too large , India not a peninsula , and the Mediterranean one-third too long . The Baltic and the Black seas were placed too near together . Ptolemy also erred in believing that a tropical sea existed with one or two continents to the south . This southern-continent idea is interesting to us , since it explains some of the wonderful shapes given to our Western lands . The philosophers of ancient times considered the question of tropical heat , realized its intensity in the Sahara , and concluded that it must be worse at the equator . If this were so , life would be impossible ; therefore , as water appeared south of all explored lands , surely wise Nature must have placed water everywhere at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , another continent at the south similar to the one at the north . For centuries Europe had no geographical teaching , at least no progressive teaching . The Christian Church seemed to fear that its doctrines and science would prove incompatible ; so its efforts were all bent toward teaching its people contentment . As a result , even Ptolemy 's progress was lost , and people reverted to the Homeric idea . An Italian poet of the early fifteenth century tells us that a T within a circle makes a map of the universe . If we try it ( T ) , we find the circurn-fluent river , the equatorial sea , one large continent to the north , and two to the south . The same idea with one continent to the south is shown on the reverse side of a fifteenth-century medal ( Figure I. ) . The cartographers of the Middle Ages were artists with vivid imaginations , whatever their scientific standing may have been . Chaos , the home of the quarrelsome winds , and the mythical animal supporters of the earth , may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's plane . The rim that prevented the water from flowing over is about , the only improvement that our practical minds can suggest . All else is very plausible ; and we certainly can not wonder , as we look upon the hideous creatures of Chaos , that it was necessary to use force and to accept convicts in order to obtain crews for the early explorations . If we divide our maps into three general classes ? artistic maps , maps to illustrate ideas , and maps to illustrate facts ? we may place the works of Olaus Magnus among the best examples of the first class . His map of Iceland ( Figure II. ) is particularly good . How happy the polar bear on the ice-floe seems ; also his friend who has been fishing . Less fortunate appears a third bear , who is endeavoring to find shelter in a shallow cave . The horseman 's struggle with the wind in the upper part of this map suggests fierce gales from the northwest . Evidences of other conflicts appear in the watch - towers along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few " saxa " about it . Some barrels near the coast may signify commerce , while the chief industry of the region is plainly shown in the n u rn erous forms of fishing . The picture of a huge fish devouring a boat , however , is reserved for another map . Another good illustration of this style of cartography is Ramusio 's map of Lake Mexico ( Figure III . ) . In order to be a little different from the others , or perhaps on account of a belief in the laws of gravitation , Ramusio has placed the south at the top of this map . His view of the city is an extreme instance of the early style that showed a city not by a dot , but by a drawing of its most famous building . The likeness of the drawing to the original structure was not necessarily very exact . Jerusalem is indicated by a church , Rome by a fortress or church . Other cities are represented by fortresses , walls , castles , or churches . Such maps generally give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed to flow . There is a question in may mind as to whether the tublike sources of the three rivers in our Iceland map are not ground springs , and whether the peculiar - rangement of lines at the beginning of the Nile in Verrazano 's map ( Figure IV. ) may not be intended for a mountain spring ? the fountain idea modified to suit an age just learning to distrust myth and fable . From this attractive class of cartography we turn naturally to its near relative , the cartography that owed its being to literature , imagination , and theory , with a few facts of travel as aids , to be regarded if convenient . Here we might place our Italian poet 's primitive mappamondo ; also the Anglo - Saxon map ( Figure IV. ) of the tenth century . Apparently this is the work of a thoughtful student who is endeavoring to illustrate the literature which he has read . One is tempted to undertake a guess concerning the books which the library of this student contained . Evidently the Old Testament was not one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Red Sea 's position would render the miracle of its crossing entirely unnecessary . Perhaps this student , more fortunate than we , had access to Livy 's complete history . He evidently had learned
