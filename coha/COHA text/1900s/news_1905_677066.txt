txt Infernal machines of practically the same design and evidently from the same source were received yesterday through the mall by two of the great houses of the financial district . One of . the machines was addressed to Jacob H. Schiff . care of Kuhn , Loeb &; Co . The other was sent to M. Guggenheim 's Sons , 71 Broadway . Although the packages containing the machines were delivered without having aroused suspicion , and although they were both opened before the police were called in , they failed to do any damage .. The package addressed to Mr. Schiff was opened by one of the employes . It contained an oblong wooden box , with a sliding cover . The employe entertained not the slightest idea that there was anything wrong about it and that the device intended to ignite the powder with which it was filled failed to work when he pulled the cover out , aroused the wonder of the police who were detaitled on the case . The Guggenheim package was regarded with suspicion as soon as it reached the chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This clerk , scenting danger , gave orders to soak it In a washbasin before it was examined . While it was under the water there was a slight explosion , evidently due to the formation of gases . The explosion was not of sufficient force to disarrange the contents of the package . It had the effect , though , of redoubling the caution of the clerk to whom it had been Intrusted , and when he opened it he used such methods as balked the aim of the sender . After the wrappings had been taken off and a box exposed he opened it by prying one of the sides off . Detectives from both the Old Slip and Church Street Police Stations were put to work as soon as the department learned of the receipt of the two machines and men were also detailed from the Detective Bureau to help in the investigation . It was soon established that the same man was in all probability the maker and sender of both machines , but beyond this no progress was made . Both Packages Dangerous . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bureau of Combustibles , where it was said that it was of dangerous construction , and that its ponder had undoubtedly meant to kill or maim the man who opened it . The Guggenheim machine , undoubtedly the more dangerous of the two , did not reach the bureau . Its contents were turned over to the firm 's chief chemist , who took them away with him . The boxes in the packages were evidently of home manufacture . They . each contained a handful of powder , mixed with cotton . Matches , so arranged that they would scrape against emery paper when the boxes were opened , were meant to touch off the powder . There were two 32-calibre cartridges in each box . The fulminating end of these cartridges had been filed through , exposing the powder . In the Schiff machine were two leaden slugs . In the Guggenheim machine was a test tube filled with gasoline . Mr. Schiff is in Bar Harbor , whence he recently went to Portsmouth , N. H. , to consult with M. Witte , the Russian peace envoy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the postman yesterday morning it was turned over to an employe with the rest of the mall . The package was neatly wrapped in brown paper . It was addressed : Jacob H. Schiff . Care Kuhn , Loeb &; Co. , Baret6rs , New York City. ? . The address was stamped upon the wrapper , rubber type having been used . The postmark showed that the package had been mailed in New York City , but it was so indistinct that the location of the station where it had been posted could not be seen . There were two fivecent stamps on the package . Bore Edward VII . ' s Name . When the wrapper had been torn off the box was exposed . It was 61/3 inches in length , 11,4 inches in width , and 13 inches deep . It was covered with green paper , bordered with pink . Across the sliding cover , in letters of gilt , had been pasted the name " Edward VII . " On one end of the box Was the letter " W. " These letters were of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The employe pulled the cover out a little way and peeped under ft . When he saw some cotton , sprinkled with gunpowder , and a long tube of paper he lost all desire to investigate further , and called L. A. Heinsheimer of the firm and Otto K. Kahn , the managing partner : Both Mr. Heinsheimer and Mr. Kahn were inclined to make light of the employe 's discovery , but , to be on the safe side , decided to call in the police . A messenger was sent to the Old Slip Police Station , and Sergt. Tucker sent Detectives McCormick and Redmond to look into the matter . . The detectives brought the box back to the station house . McCormick wanted to take the cover all the way off and open the tube , but was dissuaded , and the contrivance was taken to the Bureau of Combustibles , at Fire Headquarters . There it was examined by Superintendent George E. Murray . Mr. Murray found that the inside of the box was lined with emery paper . Running througli the centre was ' a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper containing stock quotations . At file upper end of the cylinder was a small . niece of cotton . which acted as a stopper , and the cylinder itself was filled with high-grade TIonfInuta on ** 2 .

Beneath the cylinder were the two 32-calibre cartridges , manufactured by the Remington . Arms Company . In placing the cartridges in the box the bullet ends had been turned toward the powder . ' This might Lave prevented their explosion , In case the powder in the cylinder had been ' touched off , but it is doubtful . Beside the cartridges were two slugs of lead . Slugs Added.to Peril . " It was evidently the idea of the sender , " said Superintedent Murray , " that the matches would be ignited by friction . They , in turn , would ignite the loose gunpowder and the cotton plug at the end . of the cylinder , and this would cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant to add to the dangerous qualities of the infernal machine . " The machine was of a dangerous type . It is inconceivable that it should , have been sent as a joke . There were thirty grains of powder in the paper cylinder , which if it had been exploded would probably have blinded the holder of the box , even if the cartridges had not been discharged . " I should say that the box was of German make . It was crudely constructed , evidently built for the purpose for which it was used . The bottom of the box had been saturated with some oily substance , which made the contents all the more inflammable . " Mr. Kahn left the offices oks  --  Kuhn , Loeb &; Co. before the report from the Bureau of Combustibles was ready . When Mr. Heinsheimer learned of the deadly character of the machine he was much disturbed . " When I first heard of the machine I thought it was the work of a practical joker , " he said . " I have notified Mr. Schiff by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harbor . " ? " Is it possible that , owing to Mr. Schiff 's conference with M. Witte , a Japanese sympathizer might have sent him the machine ? " Mr. Heinsheimer was asked . As I told you , I had no other idea than that the affair was meant as a joke , " he replied , " until I was told of the discoveries made at the Bureau of Combustibles . Now , I do n't know what to think . The box would not have been opened by Mr. Schiff even if he had been in the city . It is plain that the sender was not aware of the routine followed in this office in handling the mail . " Heard of Schiff Package . The police were not advised of the receipt of the Guggenheim machine until late in the afternoon . It is probable that the members of the firm of M. Guggenheim 's Sons might have said nothing whatever about the matter had not the fact that Mr. Schiff had been sent a similar contrivance been made public . There is some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firm was received . One of the office boys said yesterday that it came in late Thursday afternoon . Acting Assistant Manager Arthur J. Trussell was not aware of its existence until yesterday morning , when with several packages containing ore it was turned over to W. J. Dwyer , an assistant clerk . Mr .. Dwyer laid it on the desk of Mortimer J. Mack . At 10 o'clock yesterday morning , Mr. Mack , who is accustomed to handling packages of ore , picked it up . He noticed the peculiarity of the address , which was composed of printed words evidently cut from advertisements in Wall Street Journals . At the centre , In small type , was the name " Guggenheim . " Below , in larger letters , were the words " American Smelting and Refining Company . " In letters of the same size was the address " 71 Broadway : " Mr. Mack lifted the package . It was too light to contain ore , and his suspicions , already aroused , were increased . Turning the package over , he found stamped " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partly erased . Put It in Water . Mr. Mack ordered Dwyer , the assistant clerk , to put the package in- the - wash basin and turn the water on . " If it 's ore it wo n't hurt it , " he said , " and if it 's anything it ought n't to be it might save trouble . " The package had been in the water for several minutes when it exploded with a muffled sound . Water was splashed about and the wrappings were torn , but the contents of the box were unharmed . After the package had dried out it was opened and thoroughly examined . Beneath the outer wrapping was another cover . It was of brown paper which had been plastered with some mucilaginous substance which rendered it air tight , but had not been Impervious to moisture . Inside this covering was a box of about the same dimensions as that sent Mr. Schiff . There were two members of the firm , Murry and Simon Guggenheim , in the offices at the time . They had been told of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the explosion took place . An office boy opened the box . It , too . had a sliding cover and was lined with emery paper . The cover was pierced and through the holes two matches were thrust , their heads resting on the emery paper against the bottom . There were also two matches fixed into the bottom . of the box , their heads resting against the cover . The box was apparently filled with black powder , on the top of which rested a tube 5 inches in length and onehalf inch in diameter . This tube con-. tained a colorless liquid . Contents to be Analyzed , In the offices at the time was Charles Mindeloff , chief chemist of the American Smelting and Refining Company , who is at the Perth Amboy plant . When the Guggenheims were informed of the contents of the package they instructed that they be given to Mr. Mindeloff for analysis . Later in the day Mr. Mindeloff telephoned to Assistant Manager Trussell that the powder was high grade , and that the tube contained gasoline . He also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been imbedded in the powder , their fulminating ends filed through . Had Mr. Mack not ordered thepackage soaked in water , Mr. Mindeloff said , there is little doubt that the box would have been opened in the usual way . The matches would have ignited the powder , the resultant explosion would have shattered the tube of gasoline , and the cartridges would have been discharged . There was enough powder to have caused a considerable explosion . With the ignition of the gasoline there is hardly a chance that the cartridges would not have been discharged . The wrappers in which tke infernal machine had been received anli the cover of the box were sent to the Old Slip Police Station . Police Headquarters was notified and Detective Sergeant Leonard was sent out to investigate . Detectives Reardon , Nolan , and Cunningham were also put on the ease . Detective Sergeant Carey , who investigated the Umbria bomb case and arrested Rousseau , who was convicted as the perpetrator of that affair , was also detailed to investigate the two cases . Carey , who is on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were highly dangerous . " X think we have to look for a crank , " he declared . " What his motive was I have not the slightest idea . " Kuhn , Loeb &; Co ? have underwritten some of the Guggenheim securities . So far as is known the two firms have had no other relations . It was but a short time ago that Edward Wasserman of Wasserman Brothers , 42 Broadway , ' received a package containing an infernal machine . No trace of the sender was ever found .
