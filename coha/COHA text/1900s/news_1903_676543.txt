txt The football season at the colleges has Iprogressed so far without important I characteristics . The new rules have not made the game more interesting to the spectator , except for making the ground . look more like a checkerboard than a gridiron . Ner have they ? removed the decided drawbacks of the game to the player . Football occupies , as one may say , a normal position . Some sort : of interest of this kind would seem to be a necessity in our colleges and universities . There has been much complaint about college athletics and . the . way they are carried . on , and with more or less foundation . But few who remember College* life before the present athletic dispensation can ' fail to see that athletics now supplies a safety valve which in earlier days was lacking . Student life nowadays is by no means so full of the really discreditable things that used to play an obvious part of ? it . We do not hear of Stealing gates and barbers ' poles , of burning college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Every year now , at one or two stated times , there is a regular and formal outbreak of student vigor , and , in addition , there are usually one or two informal outbreaks . There is also hazing . But the . public rowdyism that used to exist in almost every college , the actual theft and violence , . is now rare . And it seems correct to - lay this improvement , partly due to an increase of general decency and refinement in the country , largely to the credit of athletics . It is right enough that there should be chance for some absorbing interest of this kind in college life . People complain that students and girls make more of a hero of a football player than of a hard student . They are undotIbtedly more interested in him , but then so . Is the American people from top to bottorn . It must be remembered that our college men are more generally representative of the whole people than in any other country . To suppose , then , that as a whole they will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else is an absurdity . Our colleges , and in great part our universities , are big boarding Ahoots for general education . They are ' not , nor are any universities in the world , places entirely devoted to pure science . They are not even professional , almost technical , schools like the German universities . A man at a German university is studying his profession  --  law , medicine , theology , o ' teaching  --  and he is naturally devoted to it . He is but rarely pursuing science for its own sake ; he is pursuing it ? for ** sake . - , Oui ? ' Students when ' they come to the Proles- Aloilal schools are devoted enough to their Studies , as every one will recognize ) . ilio ; , has gone from college to a law 26/tool or a medical school . Imagine a university made of professiOnal schools , and try further to imagine athletics at it , rind-one of the most striking reasons for devotion to our college athletics will become clear . Not only is lieves in himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his college , and is very well content to shine with light reflected from them . Ceilege athletics is the great sustainer of college spirit . It needs and is needed by it ; neither could exist without the other . In Germany , again , the American notices in the absence of university athletics a lack of that chance to get together which is so strong a feature of American college life . The reason for this lack is that the German student has no notion of what we mean by college spirit . At any kneipe at any German university you will find men who have but just come from one or arfother of half a dozen other universities . Under such circumstances college spirit , as we think of it , is out of the question , and not having it , the German has naturally no athletics which supports and is supported by it . One real objection to our college athletics is that it is too professional . In spite of rules about amateurs , well observed or not , athletics is commonly looked on by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a business ; it has ceased to be a game . But this is so characteristic a part of the American way of doing everything that it is futile to direct our criticism of it especially to football .
