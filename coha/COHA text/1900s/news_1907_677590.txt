txt Where There 's a Society That Attends to the Reduction of Your Bills . Your correspondent " M. C. " complains of high gas bills . He asks for suggestions . Possibly his meter was underread in February , which would account for the unusually high March-April bill . If this was not the case , ( 1 ) he is using the gas ; ( 2 ) the meter is fast . If the latter , he should have the meter tested and changed . Furthermore , are not the dates your correspondent gives the dates of receiving the bills  --  not the dates of the meter readings ? If so , some of the bills may be for considerably more than thirty days . To prevent a recurrence of trouble I would suggest that your correspondent change his residence to Newark , where we have a Gas Consumers ' Association containing some thousands of members . The object of the association is to reduce gas bills in every legitimate manner . Mistakes such as " M. C. " complains about are carefully investigated , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such association in New York ( pending his removal to Newark ) he had better write to the association here for enlightenment . We can give him a few pointers .
