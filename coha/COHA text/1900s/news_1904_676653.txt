txt T : P. Quinn wants to go to work . After an experience covering several years as business agent of the Solicitors and.Canvassers ' union , as federation of ? labor:orator , and as writer of fervid resolutions for public meetings , he announced yesterday that he was ? ready to engage in manual toll . The other sort of occupation , he said , had proved a delusion and a snare , and he was anxious to obtain something that could be counted on to provide for old age . But Quinn admitted he did not know , what to " go at . " He also confessed that lie felt his training in his business agent career had unfitted him for directing his own affairs . Wherefore he made this proposition : Seeks Ten Years of Bondage . " I will agree to work for ten years for any man , " lie said " at any task he may put me at on these terms : No money is to be paid me during the term , but I am ' to be provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ten years I am to receive forty acres of land in payment for my services . " As I want my compensation to be in land ; I would prefer that my work be on a farm . I will agree to do my best , although I will not work more than eight hours a day . That Is the proper limit set by the unions and it is enough even for the farm . " To - the man who will consider my proposition I will agree that during the life of the contract I will not swear or use ' tobacco or liquor in any form . I have no bad habits to take up ' spending money , ' and so I can get along without it . I do not require change to put In the collection box , for I will pledge myself not to attend church once . " Wants Placid , Pastoral Place , Quinn said that he would like some gentle , plodding task , like herding sheep or gardening , so that his meditations on sociological problems should go on uninterrupted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would ruffle his sensibilities , he believed , and the labor connected with grain and hay raising would be too arduous . There is no hope for a man who does not own land , " lie said . " If he works on a salary he can not get ahead enough to be independent . I know I have always preached against the existing social system and called the wage earners slaves . Still , I do not think it inconsistent for me to offer to enter into bondage for a period . I would be guaranteed some definite return at the end of the period , and that is more than I could hope for under my own management of my income . " Quinn was author of the reply of the federation to the invitation of the crime committee , which solicited the cooperation of the labor organization . The responsibility for social injustice and crime was there laid upon the property owners of the community . The business agent was active In the mass/meetings in the interest of John Turner , the English anarchist who - was detained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coming . Turner .
