" Preparations for War . If " coming events cast their shadows before , " it must have been plainly seen that open warfare was near at hand . On April 1 a special message , short and direct , contained the following advice : ? " Considering it as expedient , under existing circumstances and prospects , that a general embargo be laid on all vessels now in port , or hereafter arriving , for the period of sixty days , I recommend the immediate passage of a law to that effect . " Time brought no remedy for the evils which the Government of Great Rritain chose to inflict upon the United States . War had to come , and this being the case , it should have been declared by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hut , for the vain hope that one British Administration would be just . CRAPTER XII . BRITISH AGGRESSIONS RESENTED ? WAR OF 1812 . Madison 's Review of British Wrongs . With a patience unexampled in history , our government had borne with the aggressions of the British government until forbearance had long been without excuse . War alone could bring relief , yet nothing is more uncertain than an issue of war . Many a just cause has thus been lost . In his special message of June 1 , 1812 , President Madison reviews the situation and lays before Congress the fact that the end of diplomatic resistance had come . Few state papers ever had more of interest for the consideration of the country . The War Message . " I communicate to Congress certain documents , being a continuation of those heretofore laid before them on the subject of our affairs with Great Britain . Without going back beyond the renewal in 1803 of the war in which Great Britain is engaged , and omitting unrepaired wrongs of inferior magnitude , the conduct of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States as an inde pendent and neutral nation . Impressment of our Seamen . " British cruisers have been in the continued practice of violating the American flag on the great highway of nations , and of seizing and carrying off per  - -  sons sailing under it , not in the exercise of a belligerent right founded on the law of nations against an enemy , but of a municipal prerogative over British subjects . British jurisdiction is thus extended to neutral vessels in a situation where no laws can operate but the law of nations and the laws of the country to which the vessels belong ; and a self-redress is assumed which , if British subjects were wrongfully detained and alone concerned , is that substitution of force for a resort to the re // sponsible sovereign which falls within the definition of war . Could the seizure of British subjects in such cases be regarded as within the exercise of a belligerent right , the acknowledged laws of war , which forbid an article of captured property to be adjudged without a regular investigation before a competent tribunal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of persons were at issue . In place of such a trial these rights are subjected to the will of every petty commander . " The practice , hence , is so far from affecting British subjects alone that , under the pretext of searching for these , thousands of American citizens , under the safeguard of public law and of their national flag , have been torn from their country and from everything dear to them , have been dragged on board ships of war of a foreign nation , and exposed under the severities of their discipline , to be exiled to the most distant and deadly climes , to risk their lives in the battles of their oppressors , and to be the melancholy instruments of taking away those of their own brethren . " Against this crying enormity , which Great Britain would be so prompt to revenge if committed against herself , the United States have iii vain exhausted remonstrances and expostulations , and that no proof might be wanting of their conciliatory dispositions , and no pretext left for a continuance of the practice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States to enter into arrangements such as could not be rejected if the recovery of British subjects were the real and the sole object . The communication passed without effect . " The Violation of our Coasts . " British cruisers have been in the practice of violating the rights and the peace of our coasts . They hover over and harass our entering and departing commerce . To the most insulting pretensions they have added the most lawless proceedings in our very harbors , and have wantonly spilt American blood within the sanctuary of our territorial jurisdiction . The principles and rules enforced by that nation , when a neutral nation , against armed vessels of belligerents hovering over her coasts and disturbing her commerce , are well known . When called on , nevertheless , by the United States to punish the greater offenses committed by her // own vessels , her government has bestowed on their commanders additional marks of honor and confidence . " Outrages from Paper Blockades . " Under pretended blockades , without the presence of an adequate force and sometimes without the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in every sea , the great staples of our country have been cut off from their legitimate markets , and a , destructive blow aimed at our agricultural and maritime interests . In aggravation of these predatory measures , they have been considered as in force from the dates of their notification , a retrospective effect being thus added , as has been done in other important cases , to the unlawfulness of the course pursued . And to render the outrage the more signal , these mock blockades have been reiterated and enforced in the face of official communications from the British government declaring as the true definition of a legal blockade , ' That particular ports must be actually invested and previous warning given to vessels bound to them not to enter . ' " Not content with these occasional expedients for laying waste our neutral trade , the cabinet of Britain resorted at length to the sweeping system of blockades , under the name of orders in council , which has been moulded and managed as might best suit its political views , its commercial jealousies , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the complicated and transcendent injustice of this innovation , the first reply was that the orders were reluctantly adopted by Great Britain as a necessary retaliation on decrees of her enemy proclaiming a general blockade of the British Isles at a time when the naval forces of that enemy dared not issue from his own ports . She was reminded without effect that her own prior blockades , unsupported by an adequate naval force actually applied and continued , were a bar to this plea ; that executed edicts against millions of our property could not be retaliation on edicts confessedly impossible to be executed , that retaliation , to be just , should fall on the party setting the guilty example , not an innocent party which was not even chargeable with an acquiescence in it . " When deprived of this flimsy veil for a prohibition of our // trade with her enemy by the repeal of his prohibition of our trade with Great Britain , her cabinet , instead of a corresponding repeal or a practical discontinuance of its orders , formally avowed a determination to persist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her enemy should be laid open to British products , thus asserting an obligation on a neutral power to require one belligerent to encourage by its internal regulations the trade of another belligerent , contradicting her own practice towards all nations , in peace as well as in war , and betraying the insincerity of those professions which inculcated a belief that , having resorted to her orders with regret , she was anxious to find an occasion for putting an end to them . " Abandoning still more all respect for the neutral rights of the United States and for its own consistency , the British government now demands as prerequisites to a repeal of its orders as they relate to the United States , that a formality should be observed in the repeal of the French decrees nowise necessary to their termination nor exemplified by British usage , and that the French repeal , besides including that portion of the decrees which operate within a territorial jurisdiction as well as that which operates on the high seas , against the commerce of the United States , should not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States , but should be extended to whatever other neutral nations unconnected with them may be affected by those decrees . And as an additional insult they arc called on for a formal disavowal of conditions and pretension advanced by the French government for which the United States are so far from having made themselves responsible that , in official explanations which have been published to the world , and in a correspondence of the American minister at London with the British Minister for foreign affairs such a responsibility was explicitly and emphatically disclaimed . Our Commerce to be Sacrificed . " It has become sufficiently certain that the commerce of the United States is to be sacrificed , not as interfering with the belligerent rights of ( treat Britain , not as supplying the wants of her enemies , which she herself supplies , but as interfering with the monopoly which sho covets for her own commerce and navigation . She carries on a // war against the lawful commerce of a friend that she may the better carry on a commerce with an enemy ? a commerce polluted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the only passports by which it can succeed . " Anxious to make every experiment short of the last resort of injured nations , the United States have withheld from Great Britain , under successive modifications , the benefit of a free intercourse with their market , the loss of which could not but outweigh the profits accruing from her restrictions of our commerce with other nations . And to entitle these experiments to the more favorable consideration they were so framed as to enable her to place her adversary under the exclusive operation of them . To these appeals her government has been equally inflexible , as if willing to make sacrifices of every sort rather than yield to the claims of justice or renounce the errors of a false pride . Nay , so far were the attempts carried to overcome the attachment of the British cabinet to its unjust edicts that it received every encouragement within the competency of the executive branch of our government to expect that a repeal of them would be followed by a war between the United States and France , unless the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although silencing forever the plea of a disposition in the United States to acquiesce in those edicts , originally the sole plea for them , received no attention . If no other proof existed of a predetermination of the British government against a repeal of its orders , it might be found in the correspondence of the minister plenipotentiary of the United States at London and the British secretary for foreign affairs in 1810 , on the question whether the blockade of May , 1806 was considered as in force or as not in force . . . . The British would , however , neither rescind the blockade nor declare its non-existence nor permit its non-existence to be inferred and affirmed by the American plenipotentiary . On the contrary , by representing the blockade to be comprehended in the orders in council , the United States were compelled so to regard it in their subsequent proceedings . " Trickery of the Hostile Government . " There was a period when a favorable change in the policy of the British cabinet was justly considered as established . The minister plenipotentiary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the differences more immediately endangering the harmony of the two countries . The proposition was accepted with the promptitude and cordiality corresponding with the invariable professions of this government . A foundation appeared to be laid for a sincere and lasting reconciliation . The prospect , however , quickly vanished . The whole proceeding was disavowed by the British government without any explanations which could at that time repress the belief that the disavowal proceeded from a spirit of hostility to the commercial rights and prosperity of the United States , and it has since come into proof that at the very moment when the public minister was holding the language of friendship and inspiring confidence in the sincerity of the negotiation with which he was charged , a secret agent of his government was employed in intrigues having for their object a subversion of our government and a dismemberment of our happy union . . . . " In reviewing the conduct of Great Britain towards the United States , our attention is necessarily drawn to the warfare lust renewed by the savages on one of our extensive frontiers ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sex and to be distinguished by features peculiarly shocking to humanity . It is difficult to account for the activity and combinations which have for some time been developing themselves among tribes in constant intercourse with British traders and garrisons without connecting their hostility with that influence , and without recollecting the authenticated examples of such interpositions heretofore furnished by the officers and agents of that government . ? Such is the spectacle of injuries and indignities which have been heaped on our country , and such the crisis which its unexampled forbearance and conciliatory efforts have not been able to avert . . . Our moderation and conciliation have had no other effect than to encourage perseverance and to enlarge pretensions . We behold our seafaring citizens still the daily victims of lawless violence , committed on the great common highway of nations , even within sight of the country which owes them protection . We behold our vessels freighted with the produce of our soil and industry , or returning with the honest proceeds // of them , wrested from their lawful destinations , confiscated by foreign courts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instruments of arbitrary edicts , and their unfortunate crews dispersed and lost or forced or inveigled in British ports into British fleets , whilst arguments are employed in support of these aggressions which have no foundation but in a principle equally supporting a claim to regulate our external commerce in all cases whatever . " We behold , in fine , on the side of Great Britain a state of war against the United /States , and on the side of the United States a state of peace towards Great Britain . " Whether the United States shall continue passive under these progressive usurpations and these accumulating wrongs , or , opposing force to force in defense of their national rights , shall commit a just cause into the hands of the Almighty Disposer of Events , avoiding all connections which might entangle it in the contest or views of other powers , and preserving a constant readiness to concur in an honorable reestablishment of peace and friendship , is a solemn question which the Constitution wisely confides to the legislative department of the government . In recommending it to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be worthy the enlightened and patriotic councils of a virtuous , a free , and a powerful nation . " . . . The Declaration of War . The foregoing message did not surprise Congress . In the House , the leaders , particularly from the South , took the subject up with alacrity . Henry Clay was speaker , John C. Calhoun headed the committee that reported the bill favoring a declaration of war . The debate was not protracted . Some favored a continuance of embargo and non-importation measures , but the patience of Congress being exhausted , a large majority approved the position of the President , supported Calhoun 's report which sustained it in every particular , and agreed with the views of Speaker Clay , " that the real cause of British aggression was not to distress an enemy , but to destroy a rival . " Felix Grundy , of Tennessee , well expressed the prevailing sentiment . Said he , " It is not the carrying trade about which this nation and Great Britain are now contending . The true question is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and industry to foreign markets . Our vessels are captured when destined to ports of France . . . . These depredations on our lawful commerce are not to be traced to any rules or maxims of public law , but to the maritime supremacy and pride of the British nation . . . . What , Mr. Speaker , are we called on to decide ? It is , whether we will resist by force the attempt made by that government to subject our maritime rights to the arbitrary and capricious rule of her will ; for my part , I am not prepared to say that this country shall submit to have her commerce interdicted or regulated by any foreign nation . Sir , I prefer war to submission . " Strange to say , the agricultural , rather than the commercial states , assumed the responsibility of national defense . One might have thought the shipping interest , which had had nearly a thousand vessels seized and destroyed , would be first to pronounce for war , but the vote in the House , in the affirmative , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 32 , and in the negative stood 37 to 12 . Connecticut and Rhode Island voted solidly against the declaration , while South Carolina , Georgia , Kentucky , and Tennessee went solidly for it . Massachusetts , New York , and New Jersey gave large . majorities against defending our maritime rights . In the Senate , both senators from Pennsylvania , Virginia , North Carolina , South Carolina , Georgia , and Tennessee voted yea , while for Connecticut , Rhode Island and Delaware both senators voted nay . New Hampshire , Massachusetts , New York , New Jersey and Maryland cast divided votes . The Northern states divided , 7 for , and 8 against , the war , the Southern states stood 12 for , and 4 against it . Unpatriotic Conduct . Unfortunately party feeling and local interest influenced certain State councils which should have been the very last to think of cross-purposes with the national authorities on a question of defense . The President , in his Fourth Annual Message , Nov. 4 , 1812 , thus treats of this matter : ? " Among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constrained to advert to the refusal of the Governors of Massachusetts and Connecticut to furnish the required detachments of militia toward the defense of the maritime frontier . The refusal was founded on a novel and unfortunate exposition of the proviBRITISH // sions of the Constitution relating to the militia . . . . It is obvious that if the authority of the United States to call into service and command the militia for the public defense can be thus frustrated , even in a state of declared war and of course under apprehensions of invasion preceding war , they are not one nation for the purpose most of all requiring it , and that the public safety may have no other resource than in those large aiel permanent military establishments which are forbidden by the principles of our free government and against the necessity of which the militia were meant to be a constitutional bulwark . " . . . The Purposes of the War . As our government was the first to declare the war , the President thought it proper to announce its objects . Thus he stated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abridge the evils from which a state of war can not be exempt , I lost no time after it was declared in conveying to the British government the terms on which its progress might be arrested , without awaiting the delays of a formal and final pacification and our charge d'affaires at London was at the same time authorized to agree to an armistice founded upon them . The terms required that the orders in council should be repealed as they affected the United States , without a revival of blockades violating acknowledged rules , and that there should be an immediate discharge of American seamen from British ships , and a stop to impressment from American ships , with an understanding that an exclusion of the seamen of each nation from the ships of the other should be stipulated , and that the armistice should be improved into a definite and comprehensive adjustment of depending controversies . " To the refined mind of Madison , " war was hell , " but the ministry of England cared nothing for the crimes of war , of devastation , and conquest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British wanted the fighting , but more before it began than afterwards . Warfare ceased only because Napoleon was beaten at Waterloo , and peace in Europe followed . On their part , the British purposely provoked the war . They imagined* it was a step towards breaking down our foreign carrying trade and capturing it , together with the commerce it was built upon . - After the war was over , it was sought to bring this about // by diplomatic boldness and skill . Their pacification was as deadly as their warfare . We fought in resistance to their pretended " right of search " of our ships for British seamen , but the treaty of Ghent contained no mention of it . We had insisted upon lawful trade with either rivals or enemies of England , but , intending that wars shall not build up " neutrals , " to be strenuous rivals to her , she gave no recognition to the justice of our contention . We had for years demanded that impressment of American seamen on board of British ships should cease , but England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , she had long wanted and vainly sought non-protection of the carrying trade between her European ports and our own , with exclusion of our vessels from all colonial ports , which arrangement we had refused as unequal and unfair , but , nevertheless , we made the treaty of peace with an understanding that the will of England in the matter should prevail . Thus , our firm antagonist gained his point . The Treaty of Peace . This was received by the President from the commissioners , John Quincy Adams , Jas . A. Bayard . Henry Clay , Jonathan Russell , and Albert , Gallatin , February 15 , 1815 , promptly ratified and laid before Congress on the 18th by special message , which recommended as follows : ? " The reviving interests of commerce will claim the legislative attention at the earliest opportunity , and such regulations will , I trust , be seasonably devised as shall secure to the United States their just proportion of the navigation of the world . The most liberal policy towards other nations , if met by corresponding dispositions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy towards ourselves . " There was nothing in the treaty of peace relating to commerce and navigation . There was no law authorizing a suspension of protective duties , such as must needs be passed to meet the case of " reciprocity . " There was no nation on earth able to maintain a marine desiring reciprocity , save England , and she wanted it only partially , and so that her shipping should be enabled thereby to get the better of ours . The United States had had no thought of devising a policy to secure the " navigation of the world , " but only for the carrying of our own commerce . // It is true , that during a portion of the time of the war , our vessels had carried to and from the colonial ports of Holland , France , and Spain , but with the return of peace we could not expect a continuation of their business , and we did not get it . Mr. Madison was careful to condition his suggestion ? " if met by corresponding dispositions . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our commissioners had engaged that an act would be passed and a Convention would afterwards be signed in London giving the British the one-sided reciprocity which they demanded . Their authority to do this will be found in the following extract from a letter of Mr. Monroe , Secretary of State , dated June 14 , 1814 , which shows that the original instructions of our commissioners did not contemplate any policy of reciprocity : ? " You may concur in an article stipulating that the subject of impressment , together with that of commerce between the two countries , be referred to a separate negotiation to be undertaken without delay . " Then the secretary suggests the article be worded as follows : " Whereas , by the peace in Europe the essential causes of the war between the United States and Great Britain , and particularly the practice of impressment , have ceased , and a sincere desire exists to arrange in a manner satisfactory to both parties , all questions concerning seamen , and it is also their desire and intention to arrange , in a like satisfactory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is therefore agreed that commissioners shall forthwith be appointed on each side , to meet at with full power to negotiate and conclude a treaty , as soon as may be practicable , for the arrangement of those important interests . It is nevertheless understood that , until such treaty be formed , each party shall retain all its rights and that all American citizens who have been impressed into the British service shall be forthwith discharged . " Two days afterward , Mr. Monroe wrote a supplementary letter to the Commissioners saying , " you may omit any stipulation on the subject of impressment , if found indispensably necessary to terminate it " ? the war . But if it were necessary to abandon the subject of impress172 AMERICAN NAVIGATION . ment , in order to end the war , why did our commissioners sub-mit to dissociation of seamen from commerce ? Was that , also , indispensably necessary ? The fact is in proof , on the authority of Henry Clay and Albert Gallatin , that " a proposition to abolish discriminating duties first came from Great Britain ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treaty of 1806. " i In short , the British idea was , that might made right . Only in one thing connected with the war of 1812 ' did we succeed ? in proving to the world that , ship for ship , gun for gun , and man for man , the Stars and Stripes at sea had no superior in the British ensign , though it had " braved a thousand years the battle and the breeze . " The British Plan for Peace . It was this fact , unexpected and full of meaning , that caused England to insist on terms of peace which she believed would initiate the accomplishment of her main object iu provoking the contest . She had impaired but not destroyed our marine ; we were masters of the art of shipbuilding ; she was master of diplomacy . We could soon restore our shipping losses , but she could vanquish our flag at sea by controlling our fresh and pliant politicians , divided as our people were with party and sectional differences . She suc-ceeded as she planned . Her first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shores of the Great Lakes should be the property of one government , and this one their own ! We were to have no " inland seas , " and no marine thereupon ; no development westward of the Northern States , unless by the country roads ; no more purchasing or settlement of Indian lands , but the British and Indians were to hold forever the great Northwest . Canada was to become the peer of the Union . The British flag only should fly in lake navigation . To a scheme so unreasonable our commissioners strenuously objected . They obtained approximate justice in our northern boundary , getting the line through the middle of the lakes , but had to pay extortionately for it at other places and in other ways . Another of the terms insisted on was Pitt 's plan of 1783 // for mutual non-protection of shipping , partially introduced in the " Jay Treaty , " which had expired , but was in force between Great Britain and another country . After the treaty of peace was ratified and the " reciprocity " Convention made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to augment his naval forces on the lakes , where scarcely a semblance of American power existed . In November , 1815 , our Government sent word to Mr. Adams to propose a limitation of naval force on both sides . To this no encouragement was given . A lord of the Admiralty , March 16 , 1816 , told the House of Coinmons that " bumboat expeditions and pinchbeck administrations would no longer do for Canada ; " that " Englishmen must lay their account for fighting battles in fleets of three-deckers on the North American lakes ; British supremacy should stand unchallenged on those inland seas . " Subsequently , the treaty of 1817 was made , limiting the respective navies to a single vessel each , but the spirit of dominance was not laid . In the debates in Parliament the prospect of a new war with the United States was distinctly held out by the ministers and admitted by the opposition as a sufficient reason for enormous and unparalleled expenditure and preparation in Canada and Nova Scotia . One might think in 1816 , that the bugaboo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naval power of the United States , and all because Americans could build ships and sail them , man them and fight them , and possibly build up a rivalry that might one day undertake control . The Reciprocity Act of 1815 . The treaty of peace ratified , the next step was taken in the Senate for the passage of an act , that should have been entitled " an act to initiate abandonment of ship protection , and for the relinquishment of carriage in the foreign trade . " The British passed their first act thirteen years before , and we had disappointed them in making no response . This time they waited for the convention to be made and then passed their second act in response to our first , which reads thus : " Be it enacted , etc. , that so much of the several acts imposing duties on the tonnage of ships and vessels , and on the goods , wares , and merchandise imported into the United States , // as imposes a discriminating duty of tonnage , between foreign vessels and vessels of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States in foreign vessels and vessels of the United States , be and the same are hereby repealed so far as the same respects the produce or manufacture of the nation TO WHICH SUCH FOREIGN SHIPS OR VESSELS MAY BELONG . Such repeal to take effect in favor of any foreign nation , whenever the President of the United States shall be satisfied that the discriminating or countervailing duties of such foreign nation , so far as they operate to the disadvantage of the United States , have been abolished . " This act is in the words of the resolution reported January 10 , 1803 , subsequently debated , strongly opposed by petitions from the principal ports of the United States , and allowed to drop , as we have described . It originated in the Senate , February 18 , the day when the treaty of peace was ptlelaimed . On motion of Samuel Smith , of Md. , a committee consisting of himself , John Taylor , of S. C. , of William W. Bibb , of Ga. , William Hunter , of R. I. , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider he expediency of repealing all discriminating duty acts , or parts of acts , etc . A report was soon made , and in committee of the whole , February 22 , Mr. Smith made a speech in which he repeated his arguments of 1803 , including the reading of the report which was then made by the committee on manufactures . We quote in part : ? " These , Mr. President , are what are called ' the discriminating duties . ' The advantage derived therefrom to the navigation of the United States was such , that in a very few years there was American tonnage sufficient for the carrying of all the productions of our own country , and of other nations to a great extent ? in fact , our navigation was second to none but Great Britain , when the late war was commenced . " The effect of those discriminating duties was felt by those foreign nations with whom we had the greatest intercourse . Great Britain , in the treaty of 1794 , reserved the right of countervailing those duties and the . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duties if Great Britain did countervail ? but the wars in which she has conBRITISH // stantly been engaged since has prevented its effects from being felt to any considerable extent . The short peace she had after the treaty of Amiens taught the merchants of South Carolina , however , to know that the extra duty on cotton imported in American vessels into Great Britain was so high that it was much better to employ British vessels than to have their cotton carried in their own . " i In the year 1802 , a letter was re-ceived from Mr. King , then Minister of the United States at London , in which he advises the repeal of the discriminating duties . When Mr. Smith had concluded , the bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time . The next day it was passed , receiving 24 votes , about equally divided between North and . South . It was sent immediately to the House , and referred to the Committee on Ways and Means , John W. Eppes , of Va. , Chairman , and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the House . Mr. Seybert , of Pa. , addressed the House This was a subject of great importance , in which his constituents , as much as any people of the United States , were interested ; that it came into the House at too late a pe-riod of the session ( ending March 4th ) to be fully discussed and maturely considered ; that when , heretofore , the subject had been brought before the Congress , it had been opposed by petitions from various quarters , which would not now appear , because no such measure was expected to have been agitated at this session . He therefore moved that the bill be postponed indefinitely . " Mr. Eppes hoped this motion would not prevail . " It was true , on former occasions , when this subject had been before the House it had excited some sensibility among the merchants , but this was a very different proposition from any which had before been agitated.2 The bill proposed to take off these countervailing duties when other nations shall adopt corre176 AMERICAN NAVIGATION . sponding regulations . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheaply , than any country on earth , and such a regulation as was proposed , if reciprocal , would prove highly advantageous to our navigation . " " Mr. Seybert interrupted Mr. Eppes by a withdrawal of his motion to postpone the bill , and it was committed to the Committee of the Whole . " Friday , March 3 , " The bill from the Senate to repeal the discriminating duties on imports and tonnage , on condition that reciprocal measures are adopted by foreign governments , passed through the Committee of the Whole without debate , was reported to the House , ordered to a third reading , was read a third time , passed by unanimous vote , and returned to the Senate . " The Compulsory Measure . If there ever were an ill-advise ' and unfortunate act for the interest of American navigation , it was this one for maritime reciprocity . It was practically compulsory , since our commissioners had promised it . This explains why its enactment was virtually unopposed . The reason given for it by Mr. Eppes ? that we could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true in 1815 than in 1789 or iii 1803 , when something besides cheap building was indispensable in building up the carrying trade . Even had it been true and pertinent in 1815 , cheap vessels had less to do with successful navigation than any other circumstance that could be named . The overruling and all-important factor is employment . To neglect this is to manifest ignorance of the simple and practical philosophy of the carrying trade ? freights both ways , not simply a " cheap " ship . The command of freights in foreign ports , by American vessels , could have been little , if any , better in 1815 than in 1789 , when discriminating duties were established to secure return freights . Reciprocating the taking off of these duties was of no benefit to an American owner , for he thereby lost his return freight . Only a credulous mind could imagine that a benefit would thus arise . It would be a very poor freight indeed , that would not amount to several times the sum of any discriminating or countervailing duty chargeable to one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , the British // wanted these duties of ours removed , so their vessels could get the work of our vessels . Our peace commissioners , not one of them equipped with practical experience in shipbuilding or navigation , had consented to entertain the proposition and got conditional permission to commit their government to it . The reason given by Mr. Eppes was only to save appearances . The condition , " if reciprocal , " was both illusive and delusive . If it would have been advantageous to our vessels to remove the discriminating duties , their owners would have known it and petitioned for it . On the contrary , when the measure was first suggested in 1802-3 , they memorialized Congress against meddling with these duties , the idea was dropped , and in 1804 the discriminating tonnage duties were doubled by adding a tax for " light-money . " Besides , we had had experience enough with the British in treaty matters to have been wiser than to imagine they would observe any treaty or commercial convention that interfered at all with their supremacy at sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vessels of one nation could not bring the goods of another nation to the ports of the United States , but only its own productions . Second , " any foreign nation , " including of course its colonies , could qualify for the " reciprocity " thus limited and described . Here is where we deceived ourselves . We had long wanted admission to the British West India trade . It was assumed that a commercial convention with Great Britain , particularly one of " mutual " character , for " reciprocal benefits , " " free and equal trade , " etc. , might be negotiated with that government . We were mistaken . A lion is on earth for one thing only ? animal mastery . The unwisdom of this act did not lie in its details but in its principle , and in the change of policy involved . From protection of navigation , we were to change to non-protection . It had been under non-protection six years prior to 1789 , and had failed to thrive . It had then come under protection and for twenty-six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the trade affected could survive the reversion . Then , Great Britain was the original proposer of " reciprocity " ? // not to the nations of the world , but to the United States , her future rival . That should have settled the question against her . Results of our Impolitic Step . The Commissioners who negotiated the Convention of July 3 , 1815 , with the British Government were John Quincy Adams , Henry Clay , and Albert Gallatin , three of the five concerned in the treaty of peace . Mr. Adams was Minister at London , and very willing to accommodate matters to suit British sentiment . His idea was that a mutual removal of duties would " result favorably . " How this could be he never explained . To result unfavorably for England would provoke ill feeling ; to result unfavorably for the United States ? no matter . Henry Clay was a believer in protection to American industries , and he wanted the West Indies opened . Albert Gallatin took great stock in " free trade . " 1 ' discounted nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would take the place of protection to great advantage . The benign principle of " generosity " would not be long in winning such popularity in foreign ports that American shipping would , one clay , displace European , and then the carrying of the world would be ours ! But where are we now , with our ship protection dissipated , our ships and prestige gone , Great Britain blessing the day when we glorified her and abased ourselves ? For a quarter of a century we had enjoyed our legislative liberty , by this agreement we would surrender it ? and for what ? For Britain 's legislative liberty ? That was worth nothing to us . Peculiar circumstances , not existing in our case , secured to her several ways outside of legislation to protect her carrying trade , which with us were not available .

" ( Names omitted . ) The Convention Uncomformable to Act . We have quoted at length the Act of March 3 , 1815 , and the foregoing convention , that the reader may find , if he can , whether or not the latter was authorized by the former . The act contemplated a full reciprocation of certain relations between the two nations . A partial reciprocation could not be a fulfillment of the act . We gave . general port reciprocity on our part , but received only partial port reciprocity from Great Britain . We passed the act for the principal purpose of opening the West Indies , which England had always refused . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change in the course of England . The Commissioners knew very well that international law already gave us everything of value which the Convention provided , even a claim to the opening of the Indies under the circumstances of the trade . We had been doing well for twenty-six years without an agreement of any kind for commercial rights or privileges , either with ( great Britain or several other nations . The only good reason for a convention with Great Britain , besides the opening of the Indies , lay in the advantage of getting her to agree to impress no more of our seamen . This she refused . And she also refused to open to us any but her European ports , the half of which were unvisited by our vessels . So she got what she wanted , and gave us what she liked . As the convention was but a travesty of our desires and of our act , our commissioners did well to fix its duration at four years . On the other hand , the British Commissioners knew well enough that their government would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , who were indignant , who meant that England should have general port reciprocity only when she would give it in return . Discriminating duties may be taken as prevailing throughout the calendar year 1815 ; after that year , as to England , they were off . Our Government made a virtue of necessity . We soon began // to extend " reciprocity " and to test its alleged advantages  - -  beginning with Sweden and Norway in 1818 ; France , 1823 ; Denmark , 1827 ; Hanseatic Cities , 1828 ; Prussia , 1829 ; etc . The following table will illustrate results : 1 ? What this Table demonstrates . From the foregoing table of " entered " vessels in our foreign trade , it will be seen that , in the very first year of operation of the convention with Britain , the entrances of that nation , increased 46 per cent. , our own but , 25 per cent . There was a falling off the year following , but our arrivals fell off nearly as much proportionately . In 1818 Brit-ish entrances again decreased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act of April 20 , looking to the compulsion of England to respect our rights of , trade in the West Indies . After a twelve years ' struggles we carried our point . After 1830 , the year of the opening of the West Indies , the British gains in entrances at our ports were immense , and greatly beyond our own growth . // This will be found to be the case , on examining the table , with respect to every nation except Prussia , which seems to have benefited less than the others . This table deals with the time of sailing ships and of wooden construction ? the best ship for commerce being built in the United States . This foregoing table is representative . It proves beyond a doubt ? that our lost marine was convention-sunk , and this fate was dealt out to placate the only deadly foe our young nation ever had . Surely , it is not in the light of the history of the " convention " of 1815 , and the effect of the policy which it initiated , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to honor and fear them forever ? and to try if SUBSIDY will not restore our flag to the sea . Possibly , there might exist a sacred treaty , but a time convention founded on coercion and operated without equity is a thing to be hated and destroyed . No ingenuity can make it an argument for an improper policy . No self-respecting people will maintain such a policy , the outgrowth of such conditions ? when they learn the truth . CHAPTER XI II . NAVIGATION AND NON-INTERCOURSE BILLS ? ACT OF 1817 . Madison 's Farewell Word upon Shipping . President Madison was much disappointed with the Convention work of Adams , Clay , and Gallatin . His feeling is to be seen in his public utterances , for he felt obliged to write , in his Seventh Annual Message , December 5 , 1815 , as follows : ? " It is another source of satisfaction that the treaty of peace with Great Britain has been succeeded by the Convention on the subject of commerce concluded by the plenipotentiaries of the two countries . In this result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corresponding with the disposition of the United States , which it may be hoped will be improved into liberal arrangements on other subjects on which the parties have mutual interests , or which might endanger their future harmony . Congress will decide on promoting such a sequel by giving effect to the measure of confining the American navigation to American seamen ? a measure which , at the same time that it might have that conciliatory tendency , would have the further advantage of increasing the independence of our navigation and the resources for our maritime defenses . " Madison had intended to have the commercial convention provide against impressments by a mutual requirement of law that only citizens or subjects , respectively , of our own country or of Britain , should be employed in the manning of merchantmen . While the British refused this " arrangement , " nevertheless , it was a good one for us to make for ourselves . It had always seemed to be Madison 's idea that a " treaty " would prove a security ? he found even the hope of one a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practical knowledge of the utter worthlessness of the Adams Convention . In his Eighth Annual Message , December 3 , 1816 , he remarks : ? // " It is to be regretted that a depression is experienced by particular branches of our manufactures 1 and by a portion of our navigation . . . . The depressed state of our navigation is to be ascribed in a material degree to its exclusion from the colonial ports of the nation most extensively connected with us in commerce , and from the indirect operation of that exclusion . " Previous to the late Convention at London , between the United States and Great Britain , the relative state of the navigation laws of the two countries , growing out of the treaty of 1794 , had given to the British navigation a material advantage over the American in the intercourse between the American ports and British ports in Europe . The Convention of London equalized the laws of the two countries relating to those ports , leaving the intercourse between our ports and the ports of the British colonies subject , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The British Government enforcing now regulations which prohibit a trade between its colonies and the United States in American vessels , whilst they permit a trade in British vessels , the American navigation loses accordingly , and the loss is augmented by the advantage which is given to the Britisli competition over the American in the navigation between our ports and British ports in Europe , by the circuitous voyages enjoyed by the one and not enjoyed by the other . " This , however , was not the worst of the new arrangement , that in British European ports there was no inducement , even for an American merchant , to prefer an American vessel , our discriminating duty being off . Theorists suppose the rate of freight will make a preference , but British underwriters have always had a way of choosing the ship for the merchant who freights her . Under discriminating duties , this choice lay with the merchant . British underwriters build up no British rivals . Continuing his message , the anxious President , after more than thirty years of battling for the American marine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The reasonableness of the rule of reciprocity applied to one // branch of the commercial intercourse has been pressed on our part as equally applicable to both branches ; but it is ascertained that the British Cabinet declines all negotiation on the subject , with a disavowal , however , of any disposition to view in an unfriendly light whatever countervailing regulations the United States may oppose to the regulations of which they complain . The wisdom of the Legislature will decide on the course which , under these circumstances , is prescribed by a joint regard to the amicable relations between the two nations and to the just interests of the United ' tates . ' ' The term of President Madison would end in a few months , but other friends of an American marine were , it soon appeared , very numerous in the House and Senate ; in fact , concord on this great subject became a general sentiment . Madison 's suggestions were fruitful of action . Navigation Bills of 1816-17 . Two important shipping bills were reported by Mr. Forsyth , of Ga. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Representatives , December 23 , 1816 , and referred to the Committee of the Whole House . The first , called the " Navigation Bill , " prohibited after a certain day " the importation of any merchandise from any foreign port , except in vessels of the United States , or in foreign vessels owned wholly by the citizens or subjects of the country of which the goods are the growth or produce , or from which such goods are usually shipped for transportation : Provided that the prohibition shall not extend to the vessels of any foreign nation which has not adopted or shall not adopt a similar regulation . " Mr. Forsyth explained the views of the Committee iii reporting the bill ; its effects , and the necessity of such a regulation , to place our navigation on a footing with , and to counteract the partial regulations of , foreign countries , Great Britain in particular . The measure looked to opening the indirect carrying of the world to American vessels , or to confining the refusing nations to a direct trade with the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strike out the proviso . An interesting debate followed ? on the principles of the bill ? in which the commercial intercourse of this country // with foreign nations , the relations of trade generally , and the effect of our commercial conventions ( now only with Great Britain and Sweden-Norway ) were widely discussed . Those foremost in the discussion were Forsyth , Lowndes , Smith , of Md. , Calhoun , of S. C. , Clay , of Ky. , Hopkinson , of Pa. , Timothy Pitkin , of Conn . The question on striking out was decided in the negative ? ayes 36 . No other amendments being offered , the second , or " Non-intercourse Bill , " was taken up . This was , " to prohibit all commercial intercourse with ports or places into , or with , which the vessels of the United States are not ordinarily permitted to enter and trade . " Petition to Retaliate Impositions . January 23 , 1817 , Mr. Wendover , of N. Y. , presented a petition of the merchants and shipowners in the city of New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restrictions on the commerce of foreign nations with , and on the shipping of said nations entering the ports of , the United States , as are imposed by them , or any of them , on the commerce of the United States , or on the shipping of the same , entering the ports of such foreign nations . Referred to the Committee of the Whole , having a bill on the subject in hand . January 30 , 1817 , House again in Committee on " Non-intercourse bill . " Mr. Cyrus King , of Mass. , opening the debate , said : ? Speechh , of Cyrus King , of Massachusetts . " The regulations proposed by the bill bore no analogy to the restrictive system , commencing with the non-importation act of 1806 , and ending in the war of 1812 ; that was not to regulate commerce , but to convert it into an engine of war , which reacted with greater force upon our own citizens than it acted upon the enemy . The present regulations , if adopted , would be in self-defense , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It never has been the policy of this country to begin a system of this kind ; but it is her true policy to counteract the regulations of other nations . " . . . Mr. Calhoun , of S. C. , having suggested the making of treaties instead of laws , Mr. King replied : ? // " But , sir , it requires consent of . two nations to form a treaty , though one may pass laws regulating commerce . Such laws are more permanent than treaties . Take the case of Great Britain and her Navigation Act ? one hundred and fifty years old . " .. . Then he quoted Jefferson and Gerry 's report of 1784 , respecting the original plan for the different States to authorize Congress to regulate our trade for fifteen years , and which was not consented to . Ile referred also to the effort and argument of a second committee , in 1785 , headed by Mr. Monroe , the President-elect , who , in his letter to the States , said : ? " Possessing no advantages in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much higher duties and restrictions in those of other powers , it will necessarily become the interest of the American merchant to ship his produce in foreign bottoms ; of course their prospects of national consequence ( as States ) must decline , their merchants become only the agents and retailers of those of foreign powers , their extensive forests be hewn down and laid waste , to add to the strength and make more resources ( of foreign powers ) and the American flag be rarely seen upon the face of the seas . . . . If they ( the States ) wish to cement the Union by the strongest ties of interest and affection ; if they wish to promote its strength and grandeur , founded upon that of each independent State , every consideration of local as well as of Federal policy urge them to adopt the following recommendation : " ? " To vest Congress with power to regulate commerce . " . . . " Such , sir , were the views of some of our most distinguished citizens , and such the principles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country ? equally applicable to our present situation ? equally necessary now to be adopted . That they were not called upon at an earlier period , the convulsed state of Europe from the commencement of the French Revolution , in 1789 , to the termination of the late conflict in Europe , furnishes a sufficient reason . But , sir , Congress ought before to have acted upon this subject ? before the termination of that conflict ? before the negotiation of the late commercial Convention of London . Great Britain did this : She revised her navigation laws ; formed a new tariff , or greatly altered her // former , and adapted the whole to a state of peace in Europe and with America . And although in that Convention she pro-fesses to put the direct trade between the two countries upon a perfect footing of reciprocity , yet she had before secured the principal advantages to her own ships and subjects ? In the words of Mr. Jefferson 's report , 1793 , we did give ' her commerce and navigation in exchange for restrictions and vexations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or lays prohibitory duties on many of ours . All our ports are open to her ; one third of her ports are closed against us . She told our commis-sioners we had nothing to offer in exchange for her colonial ports . Have we not a most extensive and lucrative commerce to offer for them ? a commerce , if not essential to their exist-ence , at least necessary to their growth and prosperity ? Shall it be said we have nothing to offer for the trade of these colo-nies , when they now receive in British bottoms three fourths of their supplies front us ? No , sir ; pass the laws on your table , and at your next negotiation you will have iu them stronger arguments than any of your commissioners had at the formation of the late Convention , as it respects the colonial trade . In a little more than two years that Convention will expire . You will probably treat again upon the subjects embraced by it . These laws will aid you in obtaining a true reciprocity in commerce . " . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked attention to the principal features of the British Navigation Act , quoting from " Chitty 's Law of Nations . " ( The main section of this act is given in chapter iv . ) He dwelt especially upon the fact that Parliament had made exceptions in favor of several nations , our own among them . Said he : ? " Let it not be said that she will not relax in her colonial sys-tem , when we see she has relaxed , even in relation to this coun-try , when it was for her interest . But what reason has she to relax her restrictions if you do not retaliate them ? Relax them , did I say ! Nay , she will add to them ? favor the trade // of her own subjects at the expense of your trade , unless you countervail her acts . The very trade between our country and her colonies , which she allows in her own bottoms , is a relaxation of the old colonial law , which restricted that trade to the mother country . And what has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her colonies and this country ? That some of these colonies have prevented , by high , duties , the introduction from neighboring islands , to which our vessels can go ( except from Bermuda ) , of all commodities from this country , because they can receive then cheaper direct , and can send their produce , such I mean as they permit to be sent , chiefly rum , sugar , and molasses , directly to us , by their own vessels . And , sir , it is principally by this colonial trade of Great Britain , the decided advantage which that affords , which enables her almost to engross the direct trade between this country and Great Britain ? the advantage of double voyages ? freight both ways - thereby enabling her shipowners to carry for less freight . " Tricks of the Plaster Trade . Continuing , Mr. King disclosed the antagonism of certain Provincial Assemblies . " In relation to that part of Mr. Jefferson 's report which refers to some of the British islands which might equally with ourselves be the victims of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that some of the colonies ( I do not refer to the Islands ) have urged England on to the adoption of some of her laws injurious to our navigation . Nay , some of her Colonial Assemblies have themselves passed laws in relation to their trade with this country of which we have reason to complain . On the subject of trade in plaster of Paris , the Assemblies of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia have passed laws of the most offensive character : laying a duty , almost equal to the price of the article in the Boston market , on all the plaster exported from their provinces , and landed to the East of Cape Cod ? the duty I think is 20s. sterling the ton ; and this act , contrary to all expectation , has received the sanction of the Prince Regent . Thus , to enable the British vessels to carry the articles to the place of consumption , a distinction is made in our ports , and a preference given to some of our ports over others . Can Congress for a // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign power to do that which the Constitution will not permit you to do ? Where will these encroachments end , if not met by the most decisive measures of retaliation ? " Sir , I fear this whole business is a sacrifice of principle to a little temporary interest . We hear it said , it will do no good to pass these laws ; Great Britain will not relax in her restrictive system . Sir , it will do this good : it will prevent her wealthy merchants and shipowners from rising into importance from the misfortunes and the bankruptcies of our citizens ; it will prevent her already gigantic naval power from rising still higher on the ruins of our own . " One word more respecting this trade in plaster of Paris . Its importance , and the motives for passing the colonial laws on the subject , may be collected from the resolutions passed ' at a meeting of the merchants , shipowners , and other inhabitants of the city of St. John , N. B. , February 19th , 1816 , to wit : ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duly regulated , will employ 15,000 tons of additional British shipping , being more than is used in all the rest of the trade of the Province . ' " Then follows a denunciation of ' contraband trade ' that has drained off specie ; and complaint is made that many vessels belonging to the out ports of the Bay of Fundy are only nominally British ? virtually American , etc . After referring to the interest of Nova Scotia in the subject it was " ' Resolved , That a petition to the Legislature now in session be immediately forwarded , humbly praying that effectual regulations be enacted , that no plaster of Paris may be delivered in the neighborhood of the American line , or anywhere to the Eastward of Boston in such way as to enable the American coasting vessels to carry it from the said lines to the places of consumption . ' " Considering that the United States furnished the only convenient and good market for plaster , for the product of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia , into whose ports our own vessels could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the N. B. Assembly , and the Prince Regent of England ? was not an uncommon manifestation of British feeling . // Review of the Shipping Situation . Mr. King then examined our tonnage statistics and remarked upon the ruin then plainly threatening our navigation . . . . " The amount of our tonnage ? ( entire marine ) ? in 1816 , by treasury report , was over 1,400,000 tons ; 1 ( but Pitkin thinks actual amount is 1,250,000 . ) The tonnage for 1815 , laid on tables yesterday , equal to 1,368,127 tons , but actual amount may be rated at 1,250,000 . . . . It would re-quire 62,500 seamen to navigate it . Original cost at $40 is $50,000,000 ; actual value at any period two thirds of first cost =$333,333,333 = capital in navigation in 1815 . All of this tonnage requires to be replaced in ten years . This means 125,000 built annually ? whole cost , $5,000,000 . . . . Many different trades are employed in shipbuilding . " . . . " But what is the situation of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( January , 1817 . ) Owing in part to the causes to which I have alluded , the restrictions imposed by one nation , upon our mercantile enterprise , and the many privileges and advantages which the ships and seamen of that very nation enjoy in our ports , in reference to colonial trade , and even to the direct trade with Great Britain , and in some degree , no doubt , to the general peace throughout the world ; more than one half of our tonnage is now useless , dismantled at the wharves , and literally rotting in the clocks . Many of our seamen are re-luctantly compelled to seek employ in foreign countries , and to sail under foreign flags . Our ship carpenters , too , destitute of employ , are obliged , for a living , to go into the British provinces of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia , there to cut timber , even . for the royal navy of England , and to build vessels to carry it to Great Britain . Thus British niereh:uuts with British capital . employ our carpenters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry on the direct trade with Great Britain , but to carry our lumber , our live stock , and our provisions , to their colony . Hundreds of our artists and laborers , formerly em-ployed in shipbuilding , are reduced to poverty , and the owners // of our ships , there being neither sale nor employment for them , are , many of them , bankrupt , without even the consolation of unfortunate merchants , a bankrupt law to save them from prison ; and many of our towns and villages , once flourishing by commerce and navigation , deprived of both , now rapidly decay . Will the bill on your table have a tendency to relieve some of these misfortunes ? I think it will . If it should not open the British islands to us , it will at least employ many of our ships and seamen to carry some of our productions necessary for the British islands , to other islands in the West Indies , to be carried thence in British ships into their own ports ; giving us the privilege , nearly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which now are only carried in British vessels . It will , too , prevent some of their merchants , and some portion of their navigation , from flourishing on the ruin of our own . . . . The measure proposed , if it produces the desired effect , will be equally beneficial to the islands and to this country . " . . . Th . Ii ' , ? i , ( o j ' a Trader . " It has been pretended by some , that the trade , carried on between this country and the British islands , is not a profitable 1 ) 111 ; and we see calculations in some of our public papers , made , no doubt , by British merchants or British . agents among us , to this effect . But why do they persevere in this trade if it be unprofitable ? Why not permit others to participate in the loss ? The suggestions on this head remind me of a circumstance mentioned respecting the first merchant of New York who shipped flaxseed to the Irish market . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the article answered ? Not at all , was the reply , it was a ruinous business ; but it was observed he soon loaded another vessel with the same article , and then another ; still , on the return of each , the story was ? that the trade was most ruinous . His friends asked him why he persisted in such a losing trade ? He replied , that he must do something to support his , family . So those British merchants and agents , who complain that the colonial trade with this country is a losing one , get something to support their families ; and what is more , greatly to benefit the English nation . " . . . One of the principal characters in Congress concerned in the shipping legislation of the country was Samuel Smith , of Md . In 1815 , he had led off with the act of March 3d , to authorize the commercial Convention of July 3d , 1815 , with Great Britain . On that occasion , only this at , followed by this Convention , could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of protective discriminations , even the one he moved for in 1789 , would prove ruinous . Now , " reciprocal liberty of commerce " ? British reciprocity ? h , avinq covered its advocates with confusion , Mr. Smith denied his discipleship . His observations were mostly from a mercantile view ? whether we could afford to lose some trade ? 1 lowever , he inclined to the bill . Said he : ? . . . " If we maintain the system for a year or two , until the Convention of commerce expires , we may , with this act in our hands , make some bargain with the British Government to the advantage of our trade and navigation . . . . If you reject the bill , what will be the consequence ? Great Britain will say that you acknowledge yourselves unequal to the contest , and that she may dictate to us , bound hand and foot , what trade we shall pursue . " Henry Clay on the Convention of 1815 . Mr. Cady , of New York , made suggestions about the construction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bill . This brought out Henry Clay , one of our commissioners that consented to the articles of the Convention in question . He was then Speaker . He said , that " the gentleman was certainly mistaken in his interpretation of the agreement . " " The two great objects of that Convention were , it was true , first , to place the tonnage of the two countries on a footing of equality in each other 's ports ; second , to place the cargoes with which the ships were charged , whether in English or American vessels , on the same equality of footing . But an express clause was contained in the treaty , that nothing contained in the second article should be construed to affect the intercourse between us and the West India islands , and the British North American provinces . It followed , from this provision , that if the productions , for example , of the N. A. or W. I. colonies of Great Britain were carried to Great Britain , it would be lawful for us to interdict those productions from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the United States . Otherwise , each party ' would not be , as provided by the Convention , in possession of all its rights in relation to that intercourse . " But further , the interpretation of the gentleman would lead to a repeal of an important feature of the British Navigation Act . One of its principles was , that the productions of a country should be confined , in their importation into her European ports , to the ships of that country ; that American vessels , in other words , shall not carry into Great Britain the productions of France ; and the very case which the gentleman had stated , would , under the British Navigation Act , subject a vessel to confiscation in the British ports . If an American vessel carried a single cask of the productions of the West India islands , the same confiscation would ensue . " Besides that view of the subject , he had understood that , subsequent to the passage of the acts of Parliament for regulating trade in pursuance of the terms of the Convention of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some manner , regulated the terms as to their cargo , on which American vessels should be admitted into her ports . He did not know whether the enlarged construction which the gentleman from New York had given the treaty , might not be beneficial . But whether or not , that was not the construction of either of the parties to the treaty , and Great Britain had herself acted on a different principle . He indeed considered it the duty of Congress in consequence of one of the provisions of that very treaty , to take up this trade , and regulate it in such manner as the interests of this country appeared to require . " In other words , the " interests of the country " were not promoted or set forward by the Convention , the making of which was decidedly in the interest of England . So anxious was she to get rid of our discriminating duties she did not wait for our ratification in December , but anticipated the date agreed upon . The reason for this move lay in the fact that British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shipping , of all the manufactured goods possible to sell there , and to produce thereby a redundance " to break down all the Yankee factories . " The special message of President Madison , February 3 , 1817 , sets this forth : ? // " The Government of Great Britain , induced by the posture of the relations with the United States which succeeded the conclusion of the recent commercial Convention , issued an order on the 17th of August , 1815 , discontinuing the discriminating duties payable in British ports on American vessels and their cargoes , it was not until the 22 ( 1 of December following that a corresponding discontinuance of discriminating ditties on British vessels and their cargoes in American ports took effect under the authority vested in the Executive by the act of March , 1815 . During the period between those two dates there was consequently a failure of reciprocity or equality in the existing regulations of the two countries . I recommend to the consid-eration of Congress the expediency of paying to the British Gov-ernment the amount of the duties remitted during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , subject to a deduction of the amount of whatever discriminating duties may have com-menced in British ports after the signature of that Convention and been collected previous to 17th August , 1815 . " The Spirit of Sectionalism . The debate on the non-inter-course bill continued . Mr. Cady admitted his ignorance of Mr. Clay 's construction of the Convention . Mr. King indorsed it . Mr. Sheffey , of Va. , thought agriculture was being forgotten . Mr. Jackson , of same State , moved to strike out the first sec-tion of the bill . He opened a rapid fire on Massachusetts for not " toeing the trig " in the late war , and for turning " their force and power against the country , " etc . This motion was withdrawn at request of Mr. Forsyth , who proposed a substi-tute , embracing a system of discriminating duties , to supersede the clauses of prohibition and exelnsiou . . . . Then Mr. Jack-son brought on a long debate about the eomparative patriotism of Massachusetts and Virginia . lle threshed over the straw of John Adams 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like stuff . Next day , John Randolph , of Va. , took a tilt at the old Bay State , and all her alleged faults were rudely exposed . Results of the London Convention . Mr. Bradbury , l of Mass. , made a lengthy speech opposing Forsyth 's substitute // ? the majority of the shipping interests favoring prohibition clauses . As for the state of our navigation under the new relations established by the London Convention he referred to the petitions on the subject . Said he : ? " It is represented in some of those petitions that foreigners are now our exporters and importers ; that instead of being the carriers , as heretofore , of other nations , we are not the carriers even of our own produce . That while American ships are condemned to lay at the wharves , a heavy tax to their owners , and daily going to ruin , the flag of their rivals rides triumphant in our harbors , and they are taking from our own merchants that trade which once afforded the means of their livelihood and prosperity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and such sufferings , I can add the weight of my own testimony , from personal observations . . . . " While every one must be convinced of the existence of these evils , they can not so readily respond to the inquiry , what is the remedy ? The Committee of Foreign Relations , who are charged with the subject , have submitted their plan , which is a prohibition of trade with ports and places from which United States vessels are excluded , for which I shall give my vote . " Mr. Wilde , of Ga. , supported the substitute . Speaker Henry Clay made another and a lengthy speech , showing that the measure proposed was fully in line with the President 's message , already quoted , and that no difficulty need be apprehended with Great Britain , though she may not like our law . Importance of the Question . " This , " he said , " by no means depended on the value of the trade between this country and the colonies of Britain ( amounting to about 86,000,000 of exports and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exclusion from a participation in that navigation essentially affected the trade between this country and the British European possessions , and by the operation of the system , deprived us , in a great measure , of the benefits of the Convention of commerce with Great Britain , which provided for the establishment of a perfect reciprocity of commerce between the United States and the British // European possessions . It was not necessary to trouble the committee with the details , but it must be admitted that where a British vessel could carry two cargoes , whilst the American could carry but one , the advantage must be greatly in their favor . Even if gentlemen were not disposed to do something to obtain for the navigation of the country a participation in the colonial trade , they ought to go so far as to place them on an equal footing as regarded the European trade . Some measure ought to be devised , by which the navigation of ( heat Britain could be prevented from enjoying peculiar advantages over us , in a trade wherein reciprocity had been solemnly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No one ventured to interrupt Mr. Clay , and to inquire how it happened , that the British public and Parliament had no complaint to make of the working of the Convention ? The situation to Mr. Clay must have been painful enough . He had gone as a commissioner to negotiate a Convention concerning commerce and navigation , concluded and signed it , and come home to learn how badly it would work . After two years of experience with the quicksands of " perfect reciprocity " he found these will neither bear up nor float a ship ? that vessels are built and have existence in proportion as they are employed . The duties that they may have to pay all come out of the public whom they serve , but if they serve nobody and much time be wasted in idleness , ruination must await their owners . Mr. Clay 's British adversary at the Convention table knew all these things . He would not have signed a Convention full of " Yankee " advantages . Mr. Clay did not know that " reciprocity " might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Clay 's Diplomatic Inexperienee . After explaining the difference between the pending measure and those of similar character before the war , the speaker continued : ? " Let us then inquire into the character of the evil proposed to be remedied . What is the evil ? Great Britain says that the whole commerce between her colonies and the United States shall be carried on in British ships , absolutely excluding American ships from any participation in it . The most natural // course of the exchange of commodities between nations might thus be defined : That each nation should carry its own products to market ; that we should carry of our produce what we ( lo not want , but they do , to British ports ; and that they should bring what they do not want , but we do , to ours ports . With this course , however , Great Britain was not satisfied . The next , and perhaps the most equal and best mode of providing for the free and fair interchange of commodities , was , to open the trade equally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the commodities of both countries , in a fair competition . Great Britain was not , however , disposed to do this . She not only prohibited the carriage of her colonial commodities in our vessels ; not only entirely engrossed the export trade from her colonies , but refused to allow us any participation , by Conventional regulation or otherwise , in the trade to the colonies . The effect was , to deprive us of the advantages in the augmentation of our commerce , and increase of our seamen , which would result from the carriage of our own produce , to the amount of $6,000,000 annually . With regard to the importance of encouraging our navigation , we need not resort to argument . " Gentlemen alarmed themselves by the apprehension that the other party would view as inimical any regulations countervailing her colonial policy , and that the issue of this conflict of commercial regulations would be war . He believed in no such result . . . . The Convention of Loudon contains an express stipulation on the subject ; and I will observe to gentlemen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second article of the Convention was introduced with the express view of retaining in our own hands the right to countervail the British regulation in this respect . It was so understood by the framers of that Convention . But we have later evidence ? the message says , " the British Government concedes our right to countervail their regulations . " . . . " Whatever we do , it should be with a determination to adhere firmly to it , for depend upon it , Great Britain will never likely relax her policy . This is proved by the history of the failure of all attempts to obtain a relaxation by negotiation , from the first // establishment of the Colonies to this day . Mr. Jay attempted to negotiate on the subject , but failed in his object . Messrs . Monroe and Pinckney tried ; they failed , being obliged to be satisfied with the introduction into the rejected treaty , of 1806 , of a clause similar to that in the late Convention , that each nation should be at liberty to regulate trade with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who negotiated the present Convention of commerce had the subject anxiously at heart ; that they strove all in their power to incorporate in that contract some regulation allowing participation in the colonial trade ; they failed , however , as others had before them . The failure of a more recent attempt at negotiation on the subject was alluded to in the President 's message which he had already quoted . The policy of Great Britain , it followed from these facts , was deeply laid in selfish consideration ? a policy which she had never relaxed , except in periods of war when it became her interest to do so , from the commencement of her colonies to this time . " . . Mr. Clay preferred prohibition to high duties , the former " met the British regulation by a measure of the same character , operating exactly to the same extent . " . . . " On a great national question , in which the honor and character , as well as best right of the country are concerned , he should most cheerfully surrender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character of the country ? for would any gentleman say that it was to be endured , that a most important part of the carrying trade should be taken from us , and that we should tamely submit to it ? I t was intolerable ? ought not to be endured , and would not long . " . . . Our Feebleness in It did not occur to Mr. Clay , that when the British refused to conform their commercial system to justice , the President had no right to change our policy to please them in any respect . We set out , in 1789 , with a determination- to have an American marine . We hit upon measures which built it up , when , as a matter of course , Great Britain wanted those measures , and the system which they represented , discontinued , repealed , and set aside forever . Unless she could persuade us to do this , we were destined to be // able , one day , to contest ? her sovereignty of the sea . She got us , in 1815 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in exchange for partial port reciprocity . Mr. Clay signed this one-sided document , then finding its working would destroy our shipping interest and make our marine a pigmy , he led off in begging Congress to force England to modify her shipping and colonial systems . Had we conducted our business as well as England did hers , and let our ship protection stand , improving it as experience pointed the way , we could have disregarded the methods of any nation whose ambition was the monopoly of navigation . Then , only subjugation by bloody warfare could have prevented the United States from having a marine of her own for her own trade . The way to effect this now is not by continuing Conventions with Great Britain and other foreign countries , but by acts of Congress for the regulation of our commerce . To return to the discussion ? 1 Ir . Robertson , of La. , opposed doing anything , unless it , was to increase our seauwn . Mi . Hopkinson , of I'a. , thought the job too big for us . Mr. Clay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replied " H the British Government did not take this course ( at the instance of the British people ) , it would have to wink at the formation of entrepots , by which the object proposed by the bill ( the employ of our ships ) would be substantially accomplished . " . . . Mr. John Randolph , of Va. , asked Mr. Clay , " whence came the cry for this measure ? From what particular section of the country ? Do you not find it in the message of Governor Smith , of Connecticut , to the Legislature ; in the message of the Governor of Massachusetts ; and in a certain description of prints ? " .. Mr. Smith , of Md. , argued that the measure " would certainly tend to increase seamen , and keep them in our service . " Mr. Lowndes , of S. C. , favored the passage of either bill or substitute ? the prohibition or the duty . Mr. Hopkinson conceived that " the navigation system is the darling of the British nation . The colonial system , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? to what ? To // the navigation system , to which commerce was made subordinate . " The substitute was voted down ? ayes 30 . Mr. Jackson renewed his motion to strike out the first section of the bill . Mr. Clay said : " If a majority of the committee was opposed to acting on this subject , be thought it would be better not to express that disposition in the form now proposed . A postponement of the subject might produce a different impression . It would be extremely unfortunate , if we should say at once to Great Britain , by rejection of this bill , that we mean to acquiesce in her policy in this respect . " Mr. Jackson replied that " the decision of this question would be by no means decisive in regard to the disposition of the House to resist the British system . It might so happen , that the bill would fail in consequence of a difference of opinion between the two systems of duties or exclusion ; that a majority of the House may concur in the general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now proposed should prevail , it would be competent to the gentleman from Georgia to renew in the House his proposition , and then the whole subject might be postponed indefinitely . At the next session it might be more deliberately taken up , and this or some other course be pursued . As to guarding against Great Britain 's understanding of our opinion on this subject , I apprehend it would be labor iii vain : that she will as well understand the difficulty of our legislation iii consequence of the diversity of opinion , if the bill be postponed , as if it be rejected . " Mr. Smith wished the gentleman to permit the bill to pass to the House . IIe would vote against striking out the first section , preferring postponement to next session . The " non-intercourse bill " was then reported to the House , and ordered to lie on the table . Consideration of the " Navigation Bill " resumed . The Committee of the Whole then resumed consideration of the " navigation bill " which had been laid over . After amendment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engrossed for third reading without opposition . It was passed and sent // to the Senate , where it-was amended and passed with little debate . Returned to the House , amendments were concurred in promptly , and the act was approved March 1 , 1817 . Being one of the most important in the history of our shipping legislation we quote it in full : ? " A Bill Concerning the Navigation of the United States . " " Be it enacted , etc. , That after the thirtieth day of September next , no goods , wares , or merchandise shall be imported into the United States from any foreign port or place , except in vessels of the United States , or in such foreign vessels as truly and wholly belong to the citizens , or subjects , of that country of which the goods are the growth , production , or manufacture ; or from which such goods , wares , or merchandise can only be , or most usually are , first shipped for transportation : Provided , nevertheless , that this act shall not extend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adopted , and . which shall not adopt , a similar regulation .

That , after the thirtieth day of September next , there shall be paid a duty of fifty cents per ton upon every ship or vessel of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ district in one State from a district in another State , except it be in an adjoining State on the seacoast , or on a navigable river or lake , and except , also , it be a coasting vessel going from Long Island , in the State of New York , to the State of Rhode Island , or from the State of Rhode Island to the said Long Island , having on board goods , wares , or merchandise taken in one State to be delivered in another State : Provided , that it shall not be paid on any ship or vessel having a license to trade between the different districts of the United States , or to carry on the bank or whale fisheries , more than once a year : and Provided , also , that if the owner of any such vessel , or his agent , shall prove , to the satisfaction of the collector , that three fourths at least of the crew thereof , are American citizens , or persons not the subjects of any foreign Prince or State , the duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rate of six cents per ton ; but nothing in this section shall be construed to repeal or effect any exemption from tonnage duties given by the eighth section of the act , entitled " An Act to Provide for the Establishment of Certain Districts , and therein to Amend an Act Entitled An Act to Regulate the Collection of Duties on Imports and Tonnage and for Other Purposes .

That the several bounties and remissions , or rebatements of duty , allowed by this act , in the case of vessels having a certain proportion of seamen who are American citizens , or persons not the subjects of any foreign Power , shall be allowed only in the case of vessels having such proportion of American seamen during their whole voyage , unless in case of sickness , death , or desertion , or where the whole or part of the crew shall have been taken prisoners in the voyage . " Objects of the Foregoing Act . What were the objects of this lengthy act ? The increase and protection of employment for // American vessels and American seamen , of American shipyards and American mechanics . The first section is aimed at nations ambitious to carry for others , but unwilling to reciprocate . Great Britain was one of these , but there were others , including France and Spain ; and when the Convention of Lopdon should have expired in 1819 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war of 1812 we had carried from and to different countries and their colonies , and it was believed if carrying were free our vessels would pick up business abroad as well as at home . It was not understood then , nor is it now as it should be , that if competition succeeds , for instance , in working American vessels into British , French , or German trade , some way is soon found to defeat competition . Every nation ( but our own of late ) defends its carrying trade , either by its Government , or its institutions , or through the patriotism of its merchants and underwriters . However , this regulation had a tendency to help our shipping . Section 2 prescribes the penalties and proceedings for the violation of the act , : Ind were severe . Sections 3 , 5 , and ( i deal with the employment of seamen , and look to the compulsion of carrying American crews , for fishing , coasting , and foreign trade . While such regulations protected the employment of our sailors , they also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the piratical practices of the British navy in time of war , as giving no excuse to break up our voyages by the impressment of our seamen . An effort had been made in 1790 ? 91 to pass such provisions . Section 4 was intended to exclude foreign vessels from participation in our domestic trade ? coasting , lake , and river . The operation of our discriminating tonnage-duty regulations had soon rescued domestic carrying from the aliens that were wont to engross it , but the false step made in the London Convention , and its disappointing results , admonished our statesmen that our domestic-trade shipping had better be secured ? put safely out of hand of our diplomats . It is to this section of the act of 1817 that we may ascribe the survival of our flag on the vessels doing the transport of our commerce in our coasting // and inland waters . Also , that the American shipyard on lakes 0d coasts has remained an institution , and a source of fortune and of pride to our people . Owing to the great extent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our interstate commerce , we have a considerable marine , saved , as it were , by this act from the destructive competition of foreign nations . And our people are prone to forget that this marine was ever in danger , or that it has been preserved to its by the wisdom and patriotism of the Congress of 1816-17 . Important as it is to maintain this law , our Government has shown a disposition to disregard its provisions in respect to the territory acquired from Spain . While it could , the War Department ignored them , by permitting foreign vessels to carry between the former Spanish ports and our own . Obliged to notice the fact that these ports had become American , by a decision of the U. S. Supreme Court , in a revenue case , Congress was applied to for a provision of law that should commend itself to the Secretary of War . Strangely enough , he was accommodated . The RIGHTS of our vessels are subordinated to the privileges of foreign vessels ? until 1904 . Our trade with the Philippines may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take in sail ? and drift . Can it be that we have lost the patriotism of eighty-five years ago ? CHAPTER XIV . BRITISH POLICY RESISTED ? NON-INTERCOURSE ACTS OF 1818-20 . Administration of James Monroe . With the retirement of Madison hope arose in England that American administrations favorable to the protection of shipping had passed away . Because Mr. Monroe had signed a treaty ? that of 1806 , rejected by Jefferson ? containing articles favoring the British West India policy , it came to be thought that New England and her shipping interest , with her opposition to militia duty , her Hartford Convention resolutions , and petitions to amend the Constitution , might be relegated to pastoral life . But it was the South , not the North , that led in shipping legislation ; besides , no man who knew him could doubt the Americanism of James Monroe . We find the following paragraph in his First Annual Message to Congress , December , 1817 : ? " The proposition of this Government , to extend to the colonies of Great Britain the principles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ports of the United States and the British ports in Europe had been placed on a footing of equality , has been declined by the British Government . This subject having been thus amicably discussed between the two Governments , and it appearing that the British Government is unwilling to depart from its present regulations , it remains for Congress to decide , whether they will make any other regulations , in consequence thereof , for the protection and improvement of our navigation . " This must have checked the idea that was gaining ground in England . The Closing of our Ports . We have seen that the Navigation Act of 1817 was brought forward and debated chiefly in // the House of Re+esentatives . The act of 1818 was introduced and debated mostly in the Senate . It was substantially the same as the " Non-intercourse bill " considered in the House , but laid on the table at the previous session . We quote it here : ? " An Act Concerning Navigation , 1818 . " Be it enacted , etc. , That from and after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States shall be and remain . closed against every vessel owned wholly or in part by a subject or subjects of His Britannic Majesty , coming or arriving from any port or place in a colony or territory of Ilis Britannic Majesty that is or shall be , by the ordinary laws of navigation and trade , closed against vessels owned by citizens of the United States ; and such vessel , that , in the course of the voyage , shall have touched at , or cleared out from , any port or place in a colony or territory of Great Britain , which shall or may be , by the ordinary laws of navigation and trade aforesaid , open to vessels owned by citizens of the United States , shall , nevertheless , be deemed to have come from the port or place in the colony or territory of Great Britain , closed as aforesaid against vessels owned by citizens of the United States , from which such vessel cleared out and sailed before touching at , and clearing out from , an intermediate and open port or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excluded from the ports of the United States , that shall enter or attempt to enter , the same , in violation of this act , shall , with her tackle , apparel , and furniture , together with the cargo on board such vessel , be forfeited to the United States . " SEC. 2 . That from and after the aforesaid thirtieth of September next , the owner , consignee , or agent of every vessel , owned wholly or in part by a subject or subjects of His Britannic Majesty , which shall have been duly entered in any port of the United States , and on board of which shall have been there laden for exportation any article , or articles , of the growth , produce , or manufacture , of the United States , other than provisions and sea stores necessary for the voyage , shall , before such vessel shall have been cleared outward at the Custom House , give bond , in a sum double the value of such articles , with one or more sureties , to the satisfaction of the collector @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board such vessel for exportation , shall be landed in some port or place other than a port or place in a colony or territory of His Britannic Majesty , which , by the ordinary laws of navigation and trade , is closed against Vessels owned by citizens of the United States ; and any such vessel that shall sail , or attempt to sail , from // any port of the United States , without having complied with the provision aforesaid , by giving bond as aforesaid , shall , with her tackle , apparel , and furniture , together with the article or articles aforesaid , laden on board the same as aforesaid , be forfeited to the United States : Provided always , that nothing in this act contained shall be so deemed or construed , so as to violate any provision of the Convention to regulate commerce between the territories of the United States and of His Britannic Majesty signed the third day of July , 1815 . " Sec. 3 describes the form of the bond and manner of executing it . Sec. 4 prescribes how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the revenue laws . Speech of James Barbour , of Va . As the organ of the Committee on Foreign Relations , who reported the bill , Mr. Barbour said it was expected of him that he should state their reasons why it should become law . " It certainly behooved the Senate to give this subject its most serious attention , and to act upon the most mature deliberation ; for relneniher , when once adopted , it must be adhered to . To recede would be to insure an endless duration to the serious evils of which we complain ; and , what is still of more consequence , it must be attended with a diminution of character . Any policy adopted by the unanimous consent of the nation , founded in justice and wisdom , and sustained by perseverance , must finally be felt and yielded to by any and every nation on which it operates . Our Object the Opening of British Ports . " The object of the bill under consideration is to relieve from the effects of measures adopted by Great Britain in relation to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indies ; measures exclusively against us , as injurious to our navigating interest as they are offensive to our dignity . The invidious policy of which we complain , and which is attended with such unpleasant effects , may be summed up in a few words . She has shut her ports in the possessions formerly alluded to , against American vessels and American property . Not a cockboat , not an atom of anything that is American , does she permit to enter , while she modestly insists to bring everything that // she pleases from these possessions to the United States , and to purchase , and exclusively to care the produce and manufactures of the United States in return ; that is , she insists upon , and we have been tame enough to submit to it , to enjoy exclusively the whole of this valuable intercourse . " Isolated States , mere Footballs of Great Britain . " The evil has been of long standing ; it commenced upon our becoming an independent people . She was not generous enough to forget that we had been enemies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She would have found in the same language , the same habits , the same feelings ; and in the kind affections inseparably attending two peoples of a common origin , except when repressed by injustice or oppression , she would have found in these circumstances sure guarantees to an uninterrupted , friendly , and , to her , highly beneficial intercourse . But other counsels prevailed , and displayed a new proof of the mortifying truth that small , indeed , is the portion of wisdom that directs the government of human affairs . Hence , the moment she acknowledged our Independence , she immediately denounced against the United States all the rigor of her colonial system ? departing from it only in such parts as would promote her interest , and render it more injurious and humiliating to us . She superciliously rejected all offers at negotiation . The United States , without a common head , and pursuing among themselves an insulated , and frequently a selfish and unwise policy , became the footballs of Great Britain , who , watching , as she always does , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commerce , seized instantly upon her defenseless prey , and pushed her exclusive system to the uttermost of endurance . In this spirit , instead of being content with enforcing towards us the real colonial system , which was that the trade should be exclusively through and with the mother country , she permitted the produce of her dependencies to be brought directly to this country , and the produce of this country to be carried back directly to then , but both operations to be effected exclusively by British shipping , to the consequent exclusion of the American shipping from the transportation of the produce even of America . So injurious were the effects resulting from our commercial in212 AMERICAN NAVIGATION . tercourse , and so entirely unable were the United States to counteract these effects in their then disjointed condition , that our sanguine anticipations from the successful result of our Revolution began fast to dissipate , and no little solicitude to be experienced in regard to the future . This state of things produced a convention of the States , and finally resulted in our present happy constitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authority , that it is to this cause chiefly , if not entirely , that we are indebted for this greatest blessing of heaven . In looking through the history of mankind , and tracing the causes which contributed to the rise and downfall of nations , it frequently becomes a subject of curious speculation , when we see the most propitious results flowing from apparently injurious causes , and the worst passions of mankind converted into the means of furthering some beneficent purpose of Providence . Little did the statesman of Britain think , when indulging his thirst for cupidity or revenge , that he was to become the involuntary benefactor of America , by essentially contributing to the order of things which now exists . " Adlrantages of our Closer Union . " The new Government being organized , it turned its attention to the particular subjects intrusted to its care . Unfortunately , however , other objects , both foreign and domestic , interposed before its deliberations ripened into action . Europe was agitated by a convulsion the most important in the annals of the world , whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effects . During this troubled state of the world , the policy now under consideration engaged the attention of Congress . ' The result of the effort at that time is known to the Senate ? the causes leading thereto lie out of the proper sphere of this discussion . Mr. Jay was sent to England ? he negotiated a treaty ? so much of it as relates to the trade in question eventuated in nothing ; but such was the condition of the nations of Europe , that we enjoyed , from the necessities of England , what we had a right to expect from her justice . America became the carrier of the world , and her commerce , her shipping , and her wealth increased in the most Footnote // astonishing ratio , till at length America felt the effects of war , and its frequent privations . Pope was no sooner established , than Great Britain resorted to her colonial system , with all its abuse . The more intolerable , as it is exclusively directed against us , inasmuch as she indulges to the vessels of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aggravated by the consideration that she stands alone in this policy , American vessels being admitted into the Freud ' , Spanish , Dutch , and Swedish colonies . This course so injurious to our interest , and so offensive to a just pride , claimed the iuunediate attention of the Government , and efforts were made to obtain redress by a treaty ; the result is known . " Madison 's Leadership Acknowledged . Mr. Barbour read so much of President Madison 's message at the last session of Congress as regards this subject . " Here you perceive the door of negotiation is closed . All hope of redress in that way is desperate , and he calls upon Congress to interpose . Independently of the respect due to the recommendation of a President of the United States , there were other considerations which would give a weight to this opinion of Mr. Madison . When it is recollected that he devoted the whole of his most useful life to his country , with motives always pure , and with a judgment but little liable to err , guided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man , from the commencement of the Government down to the moment of his quitting public life , with the benefit of thirty years ' observation and experience , invariably entertains the same opinion , and , in his last solemn appeal to the nation , strongly inculcates the propriety of the measure under consideration , Mr. Barbour was justifiable in saying a reconuuendation thus sustained would receive from the Senate a degree of consideration far beyond that arising from mere official respect . In addition to this , we have been advised by President Monroe of his fruitless attempts to procure redress by negotiation , and he also submits to Congress the propriety of interposing by regulations whose effects will produce that which he has in vain sought to obtain by negotiation . " This question , then , solemnly addresses itself to the patriotism , to the wisdom , and to the dignity of the Senate . Will // you patiently stand by and fold your arms , while Great Britain pursues a policy towards us as unjust as it is injurious ; or will you , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to retort the invidious policy on its first parent , and enable us to address her in a quarter where she is never deaf to her interest ? " Faith in Perfect Reciprocity . " Mr. Barbour said , there was a general rule in regard to intercourse with all nations he was willing to adopt , or enforce , as a fundamental principle of our policy ? perfect reciprocity ; to mete out the same measure to each that was dispensed to us . Who can or will object to this rule ? A different one proposes an inferiority . But every American Senator would scout such an assertion . Sir , the same rules are applicable to the intercourse of nations as to that of individuals . W here is the man worthy of the name who would not indignantly reject a proposed intercourse with another on the degrading tern 's that he should not visit his house but under circumstances of degradation , while the other should claim access when , and how , and upon what terms he himself dictated ? Nations are but aggrei. atious of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they should make a surrender of that attribute , self-respect , so essential to the genuine dignity of man . Upon this ground alone it seemed to him Congress were bound to interpose ; but he should but feebly discharge his duty were he to leave the question here . For the sake of method and perspicuity , however , he proposed further to discuss the subject , under three heads : ? " 1 . The extensive and injurious effects of the policy complained of , as it regards our shipping interest . " 2 . He would undertake to show that redress was attainable , and would be produced by the proposed measure . " 3 . That entire prohibition of all intercourse was better than seeking to effect it by heavy duties . " No Naval Power without Protected Shipping . " Before he commenced the proposed investigation , he would make a preliminary remark . He took it for granted , that it was the settled policy of the nation to become a naval power . Perhaps there is no one question upon which there is more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other there is it one sentiment , but one wish , everywhere expressed , and that is , that it may go on to increase ; and in fond anticipation , judging from the lustre of its achievements during the war , they see , in its increase , an increase corresponding with the resources of the nation ? the guarantee of our safety and glory . But these fond hopes are illusory , unless wisdom directs our councils . Vain , foolish , your resolutions to build ships , unless you protect your navigation . It is not to the superior fixtures of your vessels , or the ampleness of their supplies , you are to look to victory , but to the number and experience of your-sailors . If you suffer the Power who looks with jealousy on Tour rising commerce , and with envy on the glory of your navy , to exclude you from the participation of those advantages which of right , as being derived from nature , belong to you , abandon all thoughts of an efficient marine , and withdraw from the ocean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the policy complained of . These will be classed under two heads : first , as it regards the tonnage employed directly between the United States and the colonies of Great Britain ; and , second , the indirect effect on the intercourse between this country and the European possessions of Great Britain . Extent of the Evils of British Monopoly : " ( 1 ) The amount of tonnage employed in this trade may be stated as equal to 138,000 , round numbers . This result is arrived at by a perusal of a communication from a very intelligent citizen of the United States who resided in the West Indies , and who has been intimately acquainted with the trade for thirty-five years ; and , further , his statement is said to be founded on an official document . Ile predicates his statement upon the calculation that Jamaica is equal iii its trade and productions to all the W. I. possessions of Great Britain beside . From the thirtieth of September , 1803 , to the thirtieth of September , 1804 , 65 , - 525 tons of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employs half ; hence , 138,000 tons may be presumed to have sailed from America to all the West Indies , to man which , taking as an estimate five men to a hundred tons , requires upwards of 6,000 seamen . From any participation in // this we are entirely excluded . Did this result from the superior advantages which Great Britain naturally possessed over us , or from any regulation she had adopted , founded in justice , while it might be a subject of regret , it could not be of complaint . But such is not the fact . It is by an assumption on her part , and a tame surrender on ours , of that which has been awarded us by nature herself . But the loss of tonnage , and the conse-quent non-employment of seamen , are not limited to the direct intercourse merely , but materially affect the navigation between the United States and the European possessions of Great Britain . This proposition will be most easily illustrated by an example : A British ship arrives in the United States direct from Great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our ports , takes in a cargo of lumber , goes to the West Indies , delivers it , and find-ing freight scarce , she sails to New Orleans , procures a load of tobacco , cotton , etc. , and proceeds to Great Britain : here two or three of the freights belong of right to the shipping of America , as being the growth of America . Yet British ships , from the policy complained of ' , rmonop dine the whole . An American vessel going from a Northern or an Eastern port with a view to take a cargo for Europe , goes in ballast to New Orleans . Even from the colonies in North America vessels are daily entering our ports , laden with plaster , fish , and the pro-duct of their colonies ; these are commuted in some ports of the United States for such cargoes as are wanted in the West Indies , whither they sell or exchange their cargo , and procure a freight in the produce of the islands . Again , British ships en-gaged in the West India trade , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as crates of earthenware , coal , salt , come to the United States , procure cargoes for the West Indies , and return home freighted with the productions of the islands ; while the American trade is limited to a direct trade only with the possessions of Great Britain in Europe . THEY RETURN GENERALLY IN BALLAST.i The bulky supplies furnished by America require , perhaps , one hundred vessels for transport to Great Britain , while what they receive in return ( the costly // fabrics of British manufacture ) may be brought back in some two or three . ' That the result of this unequal contest should be unfavorable can not be matter of surprise . That it has not been more so is accounted for only by the industry and enterprise of our seafaring people . Your ports and harbors , however , ex-hibit melancholy proofs of the decline of our shipping interest , and it is impossible to contemplate the spectacle without experi-encing sincere regret , as well for the misfortune of the individuals , as for the alarming consequences in a national point of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flows our mari-time strength . Certain Success of the Measure . " The second point of view in which Mr. Barbour proposed to discuss this subject is redress within our hands ; and is it likely to result from the proposed measure ? To understand this question correctly , it will be necessary to advert to the amount of the imports from the de-pendencies in question , as also the exports ; the constituent parts of both , and the capacity of the United States to supply herself elsewhere with those productions which from habit have become somewhat essential to comfort . " 1 . As to imports : He felt it necessary to state that the facts he was about to employ had been furnished him by an honorable member of the other House ( Mr. Seybert ) , who had extracted them from a statistical work written by himself , etc . . . . Then he gives a statement of trade , 1803 to 1812 , from various colonies , islands , etc. , that proves " that supplies , far be-yond our wants , may be procured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only diminution will be in the e.mport ( carry-ing ) trade ; the extent of which , compared to the tonnage put out of employment by the system of which we complain , is so utterly insignificant as to be undeserving of notice . In addition , it will be a sacrifice of a small portion of shipping interest of one kind to procure an infinitely greater advantage to another ; of which all may participate . " . . . // Agriculture will help defend Commerce . " The exports from this country to the dependencies in question may be estimated at $6,000,000 ; and the question to be discussed is , what will be the influence of this measure upon the price of the article thus exported ? If it be necessary to admit that Great Britain can do and will do without them , then it would be in vain to disguise the fact , that the price of these articles would diminish , and in so far the value be impaired , and by consequence , the agricul-tural interest injured . But if it were revealed from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he hoped that agricul-turists were prepared , when a just regard to the interests and to the character of their country required it , to make the sacrifice which the emergency called for . He would here take the liberty to state , that he was himself a farmer ; that he derived not a cent from any other source except what he dug from the earth ; that it had not been his fortune to amass money by embarking in ally paper speculation whatever ; he represented farmers and agriculturists ; leis interest was like theirs , and lie , therefore , presnnied he spoke their sentiments , when he proclaimed his readiness to look across any sari/ice of their interest , when the welfare and dignity of the whole people of the United States de-manded it . Tate Patriotism exalts Public Sentiment . " It is but due to frankness to say that they consider the sacrifice heretofore made by them , with a view to preserve our maritime rights , was but illy reciprocated by those whose more immediate interest was concerned ? He made no allusion to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor to open wounds which had already bled enough : for his ardent wish was that oblivion would forever erase from our history the page which forms a record of these transactions ; it was mentioned solely with a view to announce to all whom it might concern , that the same love of country , and the same sensibility to its rights , continued to form the public sentiment , and that they hold everything as compara-tively insignificant when weighed against these high consideraBRITISH // tions . He had mentioned it also for the further object of warning those who , under the influence , real or pretended , of a jealousy that agriculture was hostile to commerce ; a jealousy the less reasonable , as agriculturists had been at least as prompt to encounter sacrifices as any other portion of the community ? of warning such , if at any future time a cry of that kind should be attempted , to look at the history of this measure , in which they would see a security against their sickly apprehensions . The world will see this measure originating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its foundation is as broad as the empire . In discussing its probable duration , no hopes need be indulged of division . The public sentiment is as undivided as its true interests are indivisible . Shades of difference may indeed exist as to the manner or effect of interposing ; but all agree as to the injustice of the policy complained of . But is it true that a sacrifice , to any extent , is to be expected ? He thought not ; and for himself , he claimed less credit for the amount of the sacrifice , which , as an agriculturist , he was called upon to make , than for the promptitude with which he was prepared to encounter it . The Question of IVest India Supplies . " This , then , presents at once the fair question ? can Great Britain get her supplies of bread , meat , and those things essentially connected with the prosperity , if not the existence , of the colonial possessions ? The conversion of the islands from sugar-growing to breadstuffgrowing plantations is thrown out of the question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that that will not be attempted . From whence , then , is she to get her supplies , if not from the United States ? her North American colonies , except Canada , are themselves importers of breadstuffs ; and Canada , at least for the present , raises but little , if any , more than is necessary for her own consumption . Great Britain herself has been indebted , for several years , almost for her existence to the supplies of breadstuffs imported from this country . And with all that she could procure , famine has pressed so hard upon her subjects as to drive them into tumult and disorder . The Peninsula is also indebted to us for her support in part . France , in happier times , might possibly have an excess ? in her present
