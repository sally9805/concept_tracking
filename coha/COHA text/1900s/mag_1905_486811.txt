When the Senate of the United States convened on Monday , two of its members were absent by reason of their conviction for crime . Senator John H. Mitchell of Oregon and Senator Joseph R. Burton of Kansas have each been sentenced to six months in prison and to pay fines of $1,000 and $2,500 , respectively . Both have appealed from the decisions against them , and both are nearing the end of their terms . Their effort plainly is to stave off final decision just as long as possible Reelection , like rehabilitation , is out of the question in Burton 's case , even if he should obtain a setting aside of the verdict against him ; while Mitchell , who is broken down Physically as well as morally , is desperately clinging to his salary as his only means of livelihood . Their empty chairs should be a solemn notice to their fellow-Senators that the prestige of the " most august assembly on earth " has suffered a terrible blow . But even worse for the Senate than the shameful absence of Burton and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also on the Senate 's roll of dishonor . Thomas C Platt , Chauncey M. Depew , and Boles Penrose will be pointed out more often than others , and always as disgraced Senators . The name of Depew has become a byword . Within a year of his reelection for a second term , he has fallen so low in public estimation that a clergyman has called for his expulsion from a social club , and lie himself is practically ostracized . Not a vote would be cast for him were he a candidate for redlection , and the demands for his resignation will grow in volume Indeed , it will be surprising if there is not an effort made in the Legislature to pass a resolution asking for it Against his colleague , the feeling is not so bitter , perhaps because he is physically feeble , perhaps because his character has been better known . For years past , Platt 's sale of legislation has been understood and his personal reputation has been pretty clearly fixed . Yet his recent testimony before the Insurance Committee has branded him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and corruptionist . But he and Depew will , as the Independent says , " continue to misrepresent New York at Washington " ? unless they resign , and this , it thinks , can not be expected . The tide of indignatibn is running against them more strongly than ever . It is impossible to behave that they can expect anything more than the most frigid reception at the White House . Even in the Senate they can not look for condonation . There are , it is true , other Senators who are by no means angels of light ; but there are many like Spooner of Wisconsin , Crane of Massachusetts , and Nelson of Minnesota , to mention only a few of their party associates , who must feel themselves humiliated by astomation with She , Sen  --  torial representatives of New York . Of course , it will ill become men like Dick of Ohio and Alger of CLVIteltigan to throw stones . Senator Fulton of Oregon will not desire to figure as a great purist . Senator Dryden might be excused for is little of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silver and gold Senators of the West will doubtless not be over-interested in the presence or absence of Messrs . Platt and Dopey/ . Such men as these will not be found to have very much more sympathy for Boles *Penrose , the Harvard graduate , the man of family and means , who has chosen for his ' political bedfellows the basest of the Philadelphia ring , with the result of being repudiated by Roosevelt , Haut , and all the national leaders . Penrose has sinned against the light . His political extinction as clearly foreshadowed and can not be delayed mulch longer . Even in the Senate there shbuld be possible at least a measure of social ostracism Influence on pending Matters ? Platt , Depew , and Penrose will be - without any . But at is none the less desirable that they should be made to realize how obnoxious is their personal presence In this way the Senate can not only help to raise its own tone , but be of service to both Pennsylvania and New York . Thlat the time has come for a Change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have emphatically proclaimed their desire for better men in public life Moreover , the Senate at its present session welcomes for the first time several members who give ' every promise of ' honorabl'e service and marked usefulness Senator Brandegee of Connecticut is expected to reflect credit on his alma mater , Yale , and his State . William Warner of MisSoura comes with the hearty endorsement of Gov . Folk and his friends and neighbors Reentering public life after a long retirement , he is free from entangling alliances , and may be counted on to help uplift the Senate . ' Another man who should contrast markedly with the uil-and-sugar Senators is Burkett of Nebraska . His endorsement by popular vote was a notable tribute to hie character . Isidor Rayner of Maryland , toe , has won his spurs before taking his seat . His denunciation of the Gorman constitutional amendment to limit the suffrage not only helped ' to defeat that infamous proposal , but stamped him a man Of ability , Courage , land convictions . From fin Follette of Wisdonsin his admirers expect great things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can decide whether to be lecturer , Senator , or Governor . In short , the new recruits are a promising body  --  in the main , men of force and individuality , and are not to be written down merely as representatives of railroads , the protected interests , or the Trusts . The outlook , therefore , is distinctly encouraging . But this should only stimulate effort to free the Senate from those whose corruption or surrender to corporate interests has too long stained the reputation of a great legislative body . MR . JEROME AND THE JUDGES . " For casting a disdainful glance at the judge of the Supreme Court of Darmstadt , the public executioner has keen fined L4 " That minor news item of the day has its resemblances to what has been said iu this city since Mr. Jerome 's speech about our Supreme Court judges . He has not been fined for his disdainful glance , but he has been well - lectured . He has been accused of vague railing . " Name names . ' " is the demand made upon him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really means . Mr Jerome has been taken aside by kind but firm mentors of the Press and told that he has been reckless , has grossly exaggerated , and has done more harm than good . Judge Parker , in a gallant sortie pro domo snit , comes forward to pay a compliment to the existing judges , which he immediately makes left-handed by expressing the hope that " bold and vigorous effort " will be made to " strengthen the bench . " Really , the surprising thing about all this is that there should be any surprise . The facts which were alluded to by Mr. Jerome are known to ail . They have been set forth in sworn testimony . True , the District Attorney violated a comfortable precedent by blurting out in public what thousands of lawyers have whispered in club-corners . He does not keep his indignation purely for private consumption Seeing where the body politic is ailing , he rudely and openly strikes his hand upon the spot . Now , this very abandon of honesty and fearlessness is one of the things that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man to imagine that his assertions disclose a great discovery It is an old and twice-told tale . Go back no further than the report of the Committee on the Law 's Delays last year , and you will find the thing set down in cold type ? " the aggression of politicians upon the courts , and the baleful practice of political contributions by judicial candidates . " ' Memories are getting to be , we know , as evanescent as last year 's snow , but even so we are aniazed at the forgetfulness of Mr. Jerome 's critics Is ' the report of the Maze't Committee of 1899 so SOOT ! swallowed in ' oblivion ? In that public dolcument , hundreds of p'a'ges are taken up with an exposure of the methods of nominating and electing judges In this city . The system there revealed is precisely that which provokes Mr. Jer ronte to wrath It is a compound of Dec. 7 , 1905 commercialism and political . corruption . Supreme Court judges have been , as a rule , put in nomination , not by their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vast commercial interests of New York , but by ignorant and venal politicians , to whom , as Mr. Jerome averred , judges themselves have h:ad to go with bated breath and whispered humbleness . And with this disgrace has gone the added disgrace and danger of " campaign assessments " ? to put it baldly , payment for a . nomination  --  bang averaging $10,000 for each judicial candidate . The whole ' shameful and perilous system was fully laid bare , yet Mr. Jerome is a loose-tongued fellow to cry out against it ! Mr. Croker Was the blunt exponent , before the Mazet Committee , of the Tammany theory of judicial office , and there can be no doubt that it is Murphy 's , too . Here is Croker 's true account of the fitness of a judge  --  he must be " acceptable " to the inner rang of Tammany : " Q The organization also discusses the candidates for judicial positions , does it not ? A. Yes , sir " Q And for judicial positions in all the courts , whenever there is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gentlemen who are selected to run on the Democratic ticket for judicial offices are gentlemen who are acceptable to the executive committee and the advisers of the Tammany organization , are they not ? A. Yes , sir . " Q. Naturally so ? A Yes , sir " This was entirely borne out by Judge Barrett 's frank and illuminating testimony . He was asked if lie thought Croker had any qualificatiOn whatever to make him the arbiter of judicial character , and replied , with significant evasion : " I should say , if the ? Constitution and laws and customs permitted ht , I should prefer to leave it to Mr. James C. Carter " The contrast between brutal dictation with venality and the free choice of the bar could not well be made more pointed We must quote also Croker 's testi ' many about judicial assessments , confirmed as it was by the examination of judge after judge : " Q. And have not judicial candidates paid contributions to the organization or to its representatives , amounting to $10,000 , $15 , - 000 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How much have they paid ? . A I could not tell you that . Nothing like what you say . " Q. Never ? A Well , they might fifteen or twenty years ago . " Q But how about recent times ? A. In recent times they have not . " Q. Have they paid as much as $8,000 ? A. Probably they have , seven or eight . " Probably Mr. Croker would have fully agreed With Judge Truax , who elegantly expressed the opinion that if a judicial candidate gave $5,000 to a politician , " he ought not to squeal . " But , in addition to the monetary consideration , Tammany expects a further quad pro quo . What it is , Mr. Croker explained : " Q. They fits judges must appoint their subordinates , as a true member of the party should ? A. They should do it , yes , sir . They do not always do it , but they should do it . " Q. And Tammany ) Hall expects them to do it ? A. Expects them . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , does it not ? A. Yes , sir . " Q In all matters of patronage , they should consider th l organization , should they not ? A. First , yes , sir . " Q. Even in the appointment of referees ? A Yes , sir . " Q And you think J that the judges should appoint as referees men who are in line with the Tammany organization ? A All things being equal they should , yes , sir . They should give then . the preference " Yet Mr. Fox has been blamed for saying that he would not have felt safe in taking his motion to open the ballot-boxes before certain Tammany judges ! Mr. Jerome , then , accurately described existing c'onditi'ons . The question simply as whether ' we are to be indignant at the conditions , or at him for portraying them . It is not a mere arraignment of present evils that he made ; he is looking forward to the future , is anxious to star up a sentiment which will make impossible the sale or bargaannag of judgeships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting their judicial " slates " ready ; would-be candidates are doubtless grovelling before powerful district leaders ; many an unfit man is , in the expressive Western phrase , " out for the ermine . " But to stop this nefarious and threatening bumness , Mr. Jerome appeals to the Bar Association , to lawyers ? everywhere , ' and to decent citizens in general . That is the real point , and we must not lose sight of it . Jerome is.at one with Judge Parker in that . Having done well to be angry , New York must see to it that the causes of her wrath at incompetent and suspected judges are removed . MAJWItIONIACAL POSSESSION . As we learn more from the failures of a great man than from the successes of a little one , so the letter of Col. Mann 's which was put in evidence on Saturday is rich in reproof and instruction . In fact , we have not met with a more illuminating philosophy of great wealth . The Colonel , our readers may know , is prosecuting Collter 's Weekly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blackmailing , in Town Topics , various rich and vulnerable notabilities . By way of justification , the Weekly 's counsel produced a letter from Col. Mann to the gentleman in charge of Fads and Fancies , ' instructing him minutely how to approach a succession of millionaire " victims , " who were to be wheedled , flattered , bamboozled , or frightened into paying $1,500 or so for inclusion in that delectable publication . The list of names was long and laughable ; - many of our richest and proudest have had the pleasure of seeing themselves reckoned in with this Blackmail-able Four Hundred . For it is the underlying idea of the precious letter that great riches necessarily mean great gul libility. - Col . Mann and his allies seem to have acted upon that presumption with the utmost confidence . As practised miners in the under-world of millionairedom , they had not the slightest doubt that , wherever they could manage to sink a shaft , they would strike pay dirt  --  dirt , in this donception , making pay certain . Their philosophy of action was apparently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fooled . A financial magnate , hence vain and silly . Having great possesSions , consequently a prey to toadies , sponges , and blackmailers . Rtchesse oblige  --  which means that it obliges the rich man to surrender to every impudent cozener that comes along . " To what financial results Col. Mann might be able to pint as a practical demonstration of hiq theory , we naturally do not know . e wrote of a gratifying " contract " wi h Senator Dryden , which shows that la knew how to play upon opulent vani y in at least that case . Others , we r ad , were trying to " creep out " of their agreements to join the collection of ensitive plants in Fads and Fancies ' ; po mercy was to be shown them , and -e hope none was . But the significant ring is the assurance with which th Colonel passed in review name after name of the most expensive , and calm131 assumed that they were all " easy mark . " There were our hardest-headed men of business , our keenest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , our most matter-of-fact railroad and insurance men  --  all classed as ready dupes of a ' ? transparent bunkogame . How can such things be ? Does the shrewdness which gOes to the amassing of money inevitably become folly in its spending ? Why could Col. Mann count so safely upon finding so large a proportion of gulls among the men of great - wealth ? Well , we can not profess to have penetrated the mystery . There is evidently a world of . folly behind Col. Mann 's letter , but only those privileged to live in it can realize it . Lord Derby said at dinner one day : " One never knows what a lot of fools there are in England until one becomes Prime Minister . " Thereupon up spake his private secretary , Sir Patrick Talbot : " Yes , and - one never knows what a fool a Prime Minister may be until one becomes his private secretary . " " Thank you , Pat , " said Lord Derby . It is this kind of mutual knowledge from the inside which animates the Mann @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emerged tenth can not pretend . Still , in our outside and envious way , we seem to be able to make out certain human motives which help to explain the conduct of such people as those whose names Col. Mann handled so freely . Many of them , obviously , are new to gilded society , and at a loss how to bear themselves therein . Hence the chance of the sharper who offers himself as their mentor . They feel that their wealth compels them to a certain ostentation , and , knowing little of rational methods of expenditure , not being collectors of books or paintings , which only bore them , they fall easily into the hands of a guide to showy publicity . He has only to tell them that " all the parvenus " are going into his little game , and their gregarious instinct does the rest " We fought in Fads and Fancies , ' and you were not there ! " ? so would they render King Henry 's reproachful message , doubtless with his added , " Go hang yourself " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much money , and interesting , - with so many to fawn upon them ; and so they i  --  eadily give ear to an insinuating tong-u6 which suggests a way of informing the public that they are important and . interesting . Hence the whole vast a ' ray of books about Successful Men , ' et . , of which ' Fads and Fancies ' was only the daring climax . ' What the schemers ( have to play upon is a sort of huge del ! Sion in this class of wealthy people ? ammoniacal possession , it might be called . It makes its victims subject to gall kinds of strange attack and seizure enormously inflaming their vanity , eiaggerating their native silliness , and blinding them to the snares openly sprq , d at their feet . We know of no Society for Improving the Condition of the Helplessly Rich . Satirists have proPosed such a thing , but satire has never been able to bring to earth very much ' ? rich folly as it flies . It has been said that no number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him into a zebra . Concrete exposure of our martyrs to Mammon , a sudden consciousness on their part that every man of sense is laughing at them , will do them more good than all the preachers and satirists ; and Col. Mann 's letter will be for many of them like a nail fastened ' in a sure place . " GOOD-WILL " AS AN ASSET . The strictness with which the courts of New Jersey interpret and enforce the " liberal " corporation laws of that State is illustrated by the recent decision of Viee-Chancellor Pitney in the case of See v. Heppenheimer et al . ( 61 AllantiC Reporter , 843 ) . To the economist and the practical financier , as well as to the lawyer , the opinion of the court is of great interest . About Christmas , 1892 , certain gentlemen , one of them a savings-bank official , and another a prominent lawyer of this city , organized in New Jersey the Columbia Straw Paper Company , to take over a number of paper mills upon which options had already been scour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some $750,000 in cash and $2 , - 250,000 - in - stock-  of the newly forMed company , which had an authorized share capital of $4,600,000. i This plan would seem to have left a tomfortable margin for promoters ' proffirs , but it had the drawback of calling for $750,000 of cash , a commodity in which promoters dislike to deal . It wa4 deemed advisable , therefore , to issue $1,000,000 of mortgage bonds , which furnished the cash needed to purchaseithe plants , provid- ed a working capita 1 of $200,000 , and left a balance of $0,000 as compensation for the eminent counsel  --  also a promoter  --  who conceived the brilliant plan . Of the surplusl stock not needed to purchase the mills , ' some $600,000 was given away as a bonus with the bonds ; and the remainder , doubtless , went to that bourne from which no stock returns after the dummy directors conclude their session . It was a small affair , of course , when compared with t ' companies of straw ' and paper organized in the palmy days of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled off , nevertheless ; for the promoters had bought a large part of the bonds , a ' now held a first mortgage on the property of those mill owners who had taken their pay in stock . The history of this company is briefly told . Having secured control of most of the straw-paper mills , it proceeded to raise the price of ? the product from $20 to $28 per ton ; and thereby stimulated competition , which , together with bad management , brought the organization into bankruptcy in the space of two years . Then came a redeivership , and a foreclosure sale which did not yield enough to cover the debts of the company . Thereupon the receiver brought suit against the promoters , alleging that they had received stock without having made payment therefor , in either money or property ; and contending that they were liable for such a proportion of their unpaid stock-subscriptions as might be needed to satisfy the debts of the company . In defending the suit , the promoters argued that the stock of the Columbia Straw Paper Company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honest and reasonable valuation ; and that the difference between the sums paid for the mills and the $5,000,000 of stock and bonds issued by the combination represented the " goodwill " of the company as a going concern . Good-will , we all know , has long been held to be " property " within the meaning of the law ; and what could be more reasonable , at a time when Christmas bells were proclaiming " good-will to men , " than that New Jersey promoters should have injected copious supplies of good-will into the capitalization of a business corporation ? But Chancellor Pitney was unable to take this view of the case In a review of the proceedings which must have made " eminent counsel " wince , he declared that the good-will argument had been sadly overdone . He found that the cash and stock paid to the owners of the paper mills had fully covered the good-will of those mills as going concerns ; and that the newly organized corporation , not yet being a going concern , had not acquired any good-will for which stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , argued that the combination expected to make large profits by raising the price of its product from $20 to $28 per ton ; but the Chancellor ruled against them . Prospective profits , he said , expected to arise from one 's ability to suppress competition , are like the chickens the milkmaid expected to hatch from the eggs bought with the proceeds of the milk she was carrying upon her head . Equally unfeeling was his reply to the argument that similar methods of capitalizing corporations are commonly employed Very true , said the Chancellor , but such practices have " brought obloquy upon our State , " and are not warranted " by anything in our statutes or the decisions of our courts . " Best of all is the Chancellor 's reply to the pitiful plea that the valuatiOn , whether erroneous or not , had been made " in good faith " He showed that properties worth net more than $1,500,000 were capitalized at $5,000,000 by men who manifested their confidence in the future of the concern by taking first-mortgage bonds in payment for all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stock merely as a bonus which might later be sold to the public for what it would bring Here again the ears of " eminent counsel " and others must have tingled , as they heard or read the words of the Court . It was the desire and intention , the judge declared , to sell the shares " for more than they were really worth , " and herein " lies the intrinsically fraudulent character of these transactions " He even observed that the matter was in no wise bettered by sending a board of dummy directors , consisting mostly of the employees and partners of the " eminent counsel , " over to Hoboken to approve the fraudulent valuation in formal meeting . Corporations , he declared , should have " competent and independent " boards of directors to act in the interest of the future stockholders , and not of the interested promoters . In fact , he pronounced the entire contract by which the promoters sold the mills to n board of dummy directors , " a palpable fraud on the act of the Legislature . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and consternation . If promoters can not , under the New Jersey law , capitalize the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow or the gold brick described in the confidential circular , what , in Heaven 's name , is to become of the promoting business ? Furthermore , if the judgment of a dummy director is not to be accepted as final , - how are eminent financiers , as buyers , to make valid contracts with themselves , as sellers ? And finally , if fraudulent - capitalization approved by bogus directors can involve a five-million-dollar concern in so much trouble , what would happen if a billion-dollar corporation shduld ever get into difficulty ? But these , after all , are questions of to-morrow , to-day it is enough to rejoice in the good sense and sterling honesty of Judge Pitney 's decision in See v. Heppenheimer et pals . A DYING , RELIGIOUS CONTROVERSY . The abolition of close communion in the Baptist denomination was announced in the New Yerkpapers a few days ago People who are familiar with the polity of the Baptists are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweeping At a recent meeting of representatives of three national organizations  --  the American Baptist Home Missionary Society , the American Baptist Missionary Union , and the Baptist Publication Society  --  resolutions were passed which in effect declared that the doctrinal difference between the " Free " and the " Strict " Communionists was no bar to united action . Such a declaration , however , is binding only upon those who accept it . The Baptists are locally independent in the most rigid acceptation of the term ; and those congregations which choose to hold to close communion may do so in spite of all resolutions and conventions . The incident , however , has its significance , not merely for Baptists , but for all who watch the dying controversies over dogma ; for the bitter disputes between the " Strict " and the " Free " Communionists are typical of the quarrels which have rent Christendom into hundreds of warring sects . Baptists differ from other Protestants ? broadly speaking  --  in rejecting the validity of infant baptism and in holding to the doctrine of immersion . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first half of the sixteenth century  --  the Reformation period , in which the discussion of minute distinctions of creed raged so furiously . The Baptists , like other major divisions of the Protestant Church , have split and split again , until in this country we have , or have had , eight or ten minor organizations , such as the Six-Principle Baptists , the Seventh-Day Baptists , the Anti-Mission Baptists , and the Free-Will Baptists . The question of admitting to the communion of the Church Christians who do not subscribe to the strict doctrine of the sect , is an old one . Jahn Bunyan himself , the greatest man whom the denomination has produced , was inclined to be lenient on this point , and in consequence he was acrimoniously attacked by more thoroughgding Baptists . It was an age in which billingsgate - was regarded as a , legitimate weapon in religious argument . Not midi , the eighteenth century , hoWever , was there a formal organization of Free-Corsimunion Baptists  --  made up-partly of peroons who had been converted by the ' teaching of Whitefield . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The main body of the denomination , from which these two ; offshoots sprang , has nominally adhered to Strict Communion , though in recent years the topic has been but little agitated , especially in the North , and indiyidual churches have tacitly abandonedl the old policy . These facts would be hardly worth chronicling here and now , Were - it not that this movement within ; the limits of the sect itself is a sort of epitome of the whole Movement of Protestantism . First , separation ; then realization that the disagreements relate to non-essentials ; then cooperation in religious work ; and finally union Of course , we do not mean to say that the Protestant sects have actually united , but the conference in this city last month  --  in spite of the bar against Unitarians and Universalists  --  is a public declaration that differences of creed are small matters . The long debate between the Strict and the Free Communionists was carried on according to the most approved methods of theologians , whether Calvinists , Arminians , Antinomians , or Erastians. 116re also was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the marshalling of all the Scripture texts which can by any possibility be interpreted as bearing directly or indirectly upon the point ; next , a series of deductions from these premises , each of which is treated as an inspired statement of exact truth , from which the logical inference should be as unvarying and inevitable as in mathematics ; thirdly , the appeal to precedent and the practices of the apostles and the fathers ; and finally the appeal to passion and denominational prejudice . There-has been abundant heat , and , as is usual in these contests , too little light . Or sweetness , none . For example , the Strict Communionists used to assert roundly that all they were asking was a rigid adherence to the commission of Christ ; that deviation from it was an ignorant and craven yielding to modern error , not  --  as the misguided and sometimes malignant Free Communionists maintained  --  an act of charity and Christian wisdom . One of the great champions of open communion was that eloquent English divine , Robert Hall , who is said to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His writings on the subject served as an armory for half a century . He , it is true , rose above the low level of partisan rancor and the odium theologieum . Nothing could ' be better in tone than the solemn words With which he closes his ' Reply to the Rev. Joseph Kinghorn ' : " When the Spirit is poured down from on high , he will effectually teach us that God is Love , and that we never please him more than when we embrace with open arms , without distinction of sect or party , all who bear his image " But such passages in this , as in all other religious controversies , are pathetically rare . Fruitless wrangling over the meaning of the original Hebrew and Greek , savage assaults upon character , the imputation of base motives , shocking exhibitions of hatred , malice , and uncharitableness  --  these have been the stigma by which for centuries men have instantly recognized the utterances of professed followers of the Prince of Peace . That a change is coming , none can doubt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of opinion ; another is that thousands of Christians do not care enough about their theology to offer in behalf of it even the feeblest and most amiable defence .
