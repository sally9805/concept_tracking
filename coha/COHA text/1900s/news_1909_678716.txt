txt A SUSPICIOUS SUITOR . Marriage Preferences . May I " butt in " to this " Unclaimed Flower " correspondence to the extent of a few words on behalf of the trapped lobster ? Allow me to sound a note of warning to all young men contemplating plucking some one flower . Give preference to one with arched eyebrows , the so-called " rainbows of peace . " Never propose partnership to a woman , no matter how handsome , talented , and sensible , who is not devoted to her mother , and who has not at least a few words of commendation for some of her friends . Avoid the young woman who takes advantage of every opportunity to " knock " even het : friends and acquaintances , and who sees the uglier side first of every character of occurrence coming within her field of view . As to heredity , it were well if a miserly disposition be not among the possible developments of her later years . THE LOBSTER .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
