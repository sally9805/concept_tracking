txt MATANZAS , Cuba , March ** James H. Wilson , Military Governor of the Department of Matanzas-Santa Clara , in the course of an interview to-day regarding Cuban affairs , said : " Trouble is absolutely out of the question . The future depends largely upon agricultural prosperity , and where work is plentiful , wages are good , and a country is prosperous no sensible man wishes to - alter conditions . " Any person who publishes reports representing the Cubans as preparing a rising does so with a malicious intent to misrepresent them , or because he has been led to believe this by those who know bet- . The prospects of Cuba are very bright . If sugar goes to the United States free or nearly so , there will be such an influx of capital and of immigrants as would render Cuba ere long one of the richest and most prosperous places in the world . " The cattle industry yields enormous profits , particularly as . respects working cattle , which can never be replaced by mules , because the peculiar conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fruit also offer great inducements to capitalists , and tobacco planting yields almost immediate returns . " I do not consider that the immediate future of Cuba depends chiefly upon schools , roadmaking , improved sanitation , or judiciary reform , although , of course , these things are of very great importance . The best the United States can do for Cuba and the Cubans is to give every opportunity for improving the value of the land by putting it to the best uses . In this way capital could do an immense amount of good here , as well as get large returns . " I suggest supplying cattle for working purposes on a time basis , accepting regular rates of interest , which should be about 1 per cent . a month . Cattle can be landed here at a cost of $70 a yoke , which , once here , would bring more than $150 . " Large numbers of working cattle are required by reliable and hard-working men , who are anxious to obtain them . Were I a man of twenty-five , with energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as one of the best places to ? accumulate wealth . " Gen. Wilson says he has investigated the reports that Mr. Drake of Chicago has been endeavoring to foment trouble , and has found these untrue . So far as he is able to judge Mr. Drake is an honorable man , who is in Cuba for a pleasure trip .
