txt District Attorney Jerome successfully blocked the defense yesterday in many Important moves in the trial before Justice Dowling of Harry K. Thaw for the murder of Stanford White . If Mr. Littleton supposed that Mr. Jerome thought Thaw now insane and that he should be In Matteawan and that he would welcome evidence as to Thaw 's insanity , conneel for the defense was mistaken , for the District Attorney objected so successfully to putting in evidence the records of insane asylums where members of the Thaw and Copley families have been harbored that counsel for the defense plainly showed surprise and disappointment . After protesting against one of the objections of Mr. Jerome , Mr. Littleton said : " I merely wanted to know , your Honor , just how far the District Attorney is going to exclude evidence on technicalities . " " I know only that the objection is legal and is sustained , " was the retort of the Justice . Mr. Jerome said nothing but snuffed , at a menthol pencil with which he is endeavoring to clear up a heavy cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the records of the asylum at Roanoke , Va. , which showed the commitment of Horace S. Thaw , which were brought up from Virginia by Dr. William W. S. Butler , one time assistant physician in that institution . Mr. Jerome managed to keep them out of evidence . The District Attorney was again successful in blocking the defense when the records of the State Asylum for the Insane at Williamsburg , Va. , were presented by Dr. L. S. Foster of Norfolk , Va . Dr. Robert H. Chase of Philadelphia , with the records of the asylum at Frankford , Penn. , telling of the incarceration of Harriet Alice Thaw , was also not allowed to testify . When these physicians were asked as to the mental condition of those members of the Thaw and Copley families coming under their care , Mr. Jerome objected on the ground that such evidence was in the nature of privileged communications between physician and patient and demanded that the defendant first waive ais right . These rights of . privilege were not waived . Again when Mrs. Amy Cozette , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carlo in 1897 , was asked to describe the mental condition of the patient Mr. Jerome objected , pointing out that the relation between nurse and patient had been but recently put in the same class as the relation between physician and patient and the defendant would have to waive his rights of privilege . Finally the defense consented to waive these rights and Mr. Littleton asked if his announcement of this fact would be sufficient . Mr. Jerome wanted the prisoner to speak for himself , and Justice Dowling then put the question to Thaw . Thaw seemed to concentrate his thoughts with difficulty , first fastening his eyes on Justice Dowling and then lowering them with his left hand shelled around his ear . His answer was in a husky whisper , so low that the stenographer could not ' catch it . He said : " I do . " Mrs. Amy Cozette told of being summoned , with Dr. Price Mitchell , to Thaw 's room in the hotel in Monte Carlo . She nursed him night and day for about two weeks . He had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extremely nervous condition , and once slipped by her after dressing , got out of the hotel , and paid a Call . He returned wild eyed and excited . He wrote many letters , which she helped him to destroy . About one in seven of them he finished . She thought his conduct and his symptoms those of an irrational man , and he seemed in a more nervous condition as the fever began to leave him . When Mr. Jerome tried to get from the nurse the kind of medicine given the patient in Monte Carlo and she replied that it was a powder the composition of which she did " not know , Thaw turned - to the Deputy Sheriff who sits on his left and whispered to him , and then whispered to Lawyer Peabody . He laughed silently to himself , as if highly amused . The skin of the face creased and the eyes lighted up , but the light in the eyes was not t-at of merriment . Thaw 's Family Keep Away , The effect of the disclosures In regard to the insanity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Littleton in his speech to the jury in the opening of the defense on Monday , was to keep from the courtroom yesterday Thaw 's sister , Mrs. George Lauder Carnegie . She did not appear at all during the day , and the only kinsman of the accused present was Josiah Thaw , his half brother . But Mr. Littleton kept at his line of defense in the same unsparing manner in which he had opened on Monday . That pus prisoner felt the sting of this was evident , especially when Dr. Deemar , the family physician , testified , and his old teacher , Charles F. Koehler , told of his imbecility as a young man in the Wooster ( Ohio ) University . It was while the school teacher was testifying that the fact came out that Mr. Littleton 's defense of Thaw and the defense as first outlined by Judge Olcott of the firm of Olcott , Gruber 8- , Ronynge , which caused the latter firm 's dismissal by Thaw , were along the same lines . Mr. Jerome asked the witness to whom he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a schoolboy . " To Judge Olcott , " he said . Mr. Littleton had expected to present his case so as to picture Thaw 's life from the cradle to the Tombs , but he explained to the codrt that a number of important witnesses  --  one from California , one from Virginia , one from Pennsylvania , and others from Europe  --  who were expected in the city yesterday had not arrived . He was compelled to jump from Monte Carlo to the Madison Square Roof Garden and put on the stand Martin Green and Thomas B. Hanly , newspaper reporters , who testified to seeing Thaw the night of the shooting and who described him as wild eyed and acting in an irrational manner . Dr. John T. Deemer , one of the Thaw family physicians , was the first witness called for the defense . He now practices in Kittanning , Penn . He testifiedl that he was called to examine the prison- I er for a ' nervous ailment when he was a child . He found his nervous system muchl out of order . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he was about 451 years old . lie was of unsound ' mind . Dr. Deerattr knew him for six years , and ' he was demented all that time , he said . His form of mental unsoundness was imbeollity . He also knew Margaret Copley , who ? was afterward Mrs. Ross . She had a son , John Ross , who is now about 50 years old . Dr. Deemar first knew John Ross twenty-five years ago . Mr. Jerome objected to showing insanity in collateral branches of the family , holding that the insanity of John Ross ' might have come not from the Copley strain of blood , but from the Ross strain . He said that he had no intention of objecting to the establishment of any evidence showing hereditary insanity directly , but he insisted on having evidence to show the purity of the Ross blood before accepting evidence as to the insanity of Margaret Copley Ross 's child . Mr. Littleton consented to inquire into the Rose strain . Dr. Deemar said that he knew the father of the Ross who married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was no insanity in the family that he knew of and all the Ross children were unusually strong-minded , Dr. Deemar , on cross-examination by Jerome , said that Henry W. Copley lived with two cousins , who were supported by Mrs. Thaw . His mind was in such a condition that he could not earn a living . Dr. William W. S. Butler of Roanoke , Va. , testified that he was assistant physician of the insane asylum in that city in 1884 . There he found Horace S. Thaw . The patient was 23 years old then . Dr. Butler brought with him the papers committing the patient to the asylum , and these were offered in evidence to establish Horace Thaw 's insanity . Mr. Jerome objected , and Mr. Littleton was only able to put the papers in the record as exhibits . That had been objected to and the objection sustained . This objection he excepted to . Dr. L. S. Foster of Norfolk , Va. , formerly of the Virginia State Insane Asylum staff and one of its Directors , identified the records @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffered the same fate as Dr. Butler 's , being put in the record with exceptions from the ruling of the Court , but not being allowed before the jury . Dr. Foster was excused . Thaw 's Teacher Testifies . Charles F.

The Faculty consisted of twenty members , and he was a. tutor in the academic department . Dr. S. F. ' Scovel was in charge of the collegiate department . The witness testified that Thaw was about 16 or 17 when he was put under him for instruction . He described Thaw as nervous in his gait , walking zig-zag ; his eyes were striking , his complexion anaemic , and in classes his manner was different from that of the other students . He was abstracted , and he would stare fixedly . There were twitchings of face and lips , and he was unsteady whether walking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The witness said that Thaw seemed unable to concentrate his mind at all . He had kept a. diary of his school work in Wooster , but had destroyed it a numbor of years ago . Thaw remained in the school three months , and was sent away after a consultation of the Faculty . " Did the acts of Thaw , his physical condition , his conversations , and behaviour impress you as rational or irrational ? " Mr. Littleton asked . " Irrational . " In the cross-examination Mr. Jerome asked for the name of another student in Thaw 's class . ' Tom Flattery , " replied the teacher . Q. ? Was he good in mathematics ? A. ? Fair . Q. ? Did he always obey you ? A. ? No . Q. ? Did you think Tom Flaherty crazy ? A. ? No. 0 . ? Name another boy . A. ? Jack Breslin . Q. ? Did he obey you always ? A. ? No . Q. ? Was he crazy ? A. ? No .

( The old teacher carefully looked the prisoner over , peering into his eyes . ) A. ? There Is a difference . Q. ? What difference ? A. ? He stared vacantly In front of him when at school . Mr. Jerome strove with all his power of sarcasm to break the effect of the witness 's testimony , but Mr. Koehler was not in the least disturbed . Mr. Jerome asked him if he had remembered Thaw during all these years without any extraordinary effort to keep the picture in his mind . His reply was that he had , and that he had used the plight of Thaw as an example of the rich man 's son handicapped in the beginning . ' Tell one Instance when you made such use of the memory of Thaw . " In Winona. in the Summer of 1892 , " he replied .
