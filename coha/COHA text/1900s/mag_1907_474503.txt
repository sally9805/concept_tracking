THEREHERE are certain streets in Rich-where the residents show as little concern for honest , accurate time as they do for good architecture . On a well-known thoroughfare , for instance , one may find in five blocks at least four clocks that are not doing what one might expect of them ; there may be others , but I ceased to take a personal interest in observing them after my watch had stopped in mute protest . The unsuspecting visitor is constantly tempted to pry into the hidden mysteries of his watch in this neighborhood , and only begins to realize the true state of affairs after it has become a dead weight in hi.s waistcoat and ceased its pleasant ticking . When at two o'clock I innocently set my watch to 1.30 P.M. by the first of the twin - tower clocks of the hotel , I never suspected that anything was wrong , though I must admit being somewhat disconcerted when , a moment later , I ran foal of its sister clock and gnu ' it registering 12.25 P.M. However , I said nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor policy to shout what I had in mind to a thing suspended three hundred feet above my head , contenting myself by setting my watch at 12.25 P.M , and shaking it violently in the midday sun , until I had worked myself into a good perspiration . The raw layman always shakes his watch in similar predicaments ; he does not know exactly why , but shakes it nevertheless , with the same cheerful optimism we show in screaming at the timid foreigner , under the impression that he will understand more readily . I might have forgotten my former unpleasantness had I not fallen in with a native , who , with the best intentions , reopened the matter by assuring me that the trouble lay not . in my watch , but in the hotel 's clocks . He expressed great surprise that T did not know that they could not he depended upon since the fire ; and added that he was sorry that I hadnot met him earlier in the day , as my watch undoubtedly was a good one before I began tampering with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , because , he explained , even though my watch had stopped for the last half-hour , the hotel was not so far ahead in the race as I might imagine , seeing that the church , a few streets above , was two full hours faster than the combined clocks of the hostelry ? if that was any consolation . " If fire can debauch the secular hotel time . " I pleaded , " could you tell me what these good people have been doing in their church ? " He replied that he would hate to say . Now that I am able to look at the matter dispassionately , I can see that even the distracting moments of my first day in Richmond had their raison d ' " are : they were the means of dispelling many fond illusions . The City of Seven Hills ' ? a mere catchword for unsophisticated visitors . We counted eight bills in the radius of four blocks without extending ourselves . We could have borne this ? we had to bear it ,  - -  hut no one will know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it up , the last idol of our youth toppled over : the delectable ambrosia these many years accepted as typifying ? nay , glorifying ? the high culture of Virginia ? the mint julep ? is a thing of the past ! But enough of these distracting moments . A random walk across the city will lead one to suspect that the Richmond of to-day is perhaps more in need of an architect than of accurate time . The few remaining legacies of antebellum days are being tampered with in spite of numerous protests . New wings and an amendatory front have been added to the old Capitol to keep abreast of the times , Not satisfied with meddling with one of the best examples of Colonial architecture in Richmond , sonic one conceived the idea of adding a pebbled drive to the beautiful park , so that the rich and languid may encircle the building and gloat over the new front without leaving their carriages ? an inspiration that necessitated the uprooting of dozens of patriarchal elms that stood clustered about the old Capitol for generations . Thanks to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tendency to make the East End of the city the only " possible " residence section , one may still - find tucked away in the wake of this easterly progress fragments delightfully reminiscent of old Richmond ? distinguished old mansions whose sober conservatism of fa ? ade and portico gives little hint of the rare beauty of the garden in the rear , spaced with groves of dainty Von . CXIV. ? N , 683. - 89 crape-myrtle enveloped in a mist of faint pink and lavender blossoms . This is a quarter rich in piquant legend , and amusing tales are whispered about an . entertainment given to the Prince of Wales when he was a guest at Ballard 's Hotel , then standing near by at its zenith of prosperity , and rumors are still current that an elaborate gilt bed had to be borrowed for the occasion ' , being the only one deemed suitable for the royal guest . Of the old coffee-houses that once flanked Main Street and brought their quota of idlers and politicians , nothing remains ; yet even prosaic Main Street , if followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one derelict , now hemmed in by tenements of considerable beauty , that will bring you to a standstill , marvelling at the miracle that saved it from the fate of more pretentious landmarks that have long since been toppled over into oblivion : and you will forgive modern Richmond for many rash acts and retract many harsh statements . Its great boulders are stained to a deep umber ; the diminutive dormer-windows , festooned with abandoned spider-webs , now lean at crazy angles ; the roof rises and falls in sleepy hollows , and as you step nearer for a closer inspection you see a modest sign with the legend " George Washington Headquarters . " Few more fitting monuments to the great struggle for liberty can he found to-day than this gloomy democratic mass of weather-beaten masonry . In its crude way it accomplishes more than the most elaboratepiece of sculpture : it brings one in touch with the very background of those stirring times , and furnishes a thrill that is only intensified when one learns that George never had his headquarters in Richmond during the War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , end teaches the homely lesson that though we may neither toil nor spin , if we but be of good cheer and have confidence , yet we may prosper . There is a side of reconstructed Richmond whose natural formation has protected it from the present tide of reformation . Its approach is .. so well guarded by the dirt and squalor of narrow , muddy streets that one might give up the pilgrimage in disgust but for the delicious spicy fragrance of the air , laden with tobacco-dust , that increases as you press on through the throngs of negro idlers and roustabouts ; past great factories humming with machinery ; here picking your way over intricate meshes of rails , now dodging a freight-car , till a fresh gust redolent of earthy country odors sweeps with unexpected fury through the narrow crevice between the buildings , lifting a yellow mist of dust . You press through , to find the veil lifted : above there is the blue canopy of the sky , a rolling fertile country slopes away into distant woods , and at your feet rushes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in whirling , seething eddies about its wooded islands , to tumble boisterously over the massive boulders in innumerable bubbling cascades of ochre , only to broaden out and slacken pace , collecting its forces for the great and final movement to its estuary and the sea . It was along the banks of this capricious yellow stream that I formed an acquaintance which might have ripened into intimacy had not Justice John nipped it in the bud . To have passed a day in Richmond and not seen John is ? but more of him later ; it is of George Washington Andrew Jackson that I would speak at present ? a tall , sinewy colored enigma . who , with the slow primeval motion peculiar to negroes , frequently paddled me along the river in his boat and dropped me on the spot where I had work- , continuing his course until he reached the sewer 's mouth , where he anchored for the afternoon . He was an active member of a little coterie of colored gentlemen who formed the nucleus of an Track Walton club , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sewer when it is active and the great river catfish swarm . Then the word is passed on with incredible rapidity ; and negroes ? associate members ? from points as for distant as Chimborazo Park leave their work in the kitchen and reach for the eau of worms and pole to steal noiselessly to the river , lighthearted and regardless of the morrow . Of Andrew 's legitimate employment I know little , as it was the illegitimate side that came most frequently to my notice ; but there were times when his natural volubility would for days give way to a moody sullenness , which led me to believe that he was " seekin ' " ? a conditioncommon among the Southern negroes , whose symptoms may suddenly appear in your butler , when without warning he becomes a mystic , drops his responsibilities , and settles down comfortably into the first chair to dabble with the introspective and seek an " experience " : some hair-raising visitation to he offered as a testimony before the negro can be baptized or enter the church . If these be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up from Old Point Comfort to Louisiana . As your train rushes past the red clay of Virginia , you see them festooned about the wood-piles in a state of coma , motionless in the fields , or crowding the station platforms . Beneath the cool shade of bridges spanning the passing stream , or in sequestered nooks by the roadside , there is the inevitable group in easy sprawl , and as you leave them fading into the distance , you unconsciously recall Pater 's gospel of being rather than of doing , and think how he would have loved and understood the negroif he did not have to live with him . To-day it is a common sight in Richmond to see cold , unsentimental men riding about , erect and fierce , in their military saddles ; first up one alley and down the next , then back again through a side street , apparently without any definite route or purpose in view ? only to reappear for a moment and gallop away in a cloud of dust . I might never have known that these , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their frequent appearance piqued any curiosity and prompted me to inquire of a pedestrian . " Why , my deah seh ! " he exclaimed , amazed at my naivete , " if the boss of lawge conee'n did n't pay fp ' or five men to ride afteah these heah niggahs , befo ' an hour had passed they 'd all be fast asleep , with the bosses takin ' care o ' themselves . " Thus does cruel custom trample on the poor African 's legitimate needs . The negro who to-day may be seeking the truth may be sought by the police to-morrow , and it is doubtless my slight acquaintance with these conditions that has since led me to question Andrew 's sincerity on that memorable night when I witnessed his cruel disappearance from the world and has left me wondering whether a premonition of impending disaster did not prompt him to take refuge in religion as being the lesser of two evils . But for the sound of voices raised in hymns of praise that floated through the gloomy entrance to Locust Alley and reached my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Main Street , I might never have changed my route , and to this clay Andrew 's whereabouts would be shrouded in mystery . As I elbowed my way through a nondescript crowd that encircled a small group of evangelists . I saw that T had missed much ; for their captain ? a pale , sallow man whose face bore the marks of much ill usage ? had reached his climax , and waved grotesquely about him in a hysterical appeal to the scoffers grouped in the shadow of some porticos , and with outstretched arms screamed , " Come hither ! " to the clusters of haggard faces at . the windows . Then pausing to the accompaniment of the wailing and incoherent muttering of those who kneltin prayer , he hopped into the air exultingly , rapping his heels together to sound the last eall for penitents ; and men with weak digestions faltered on the brink of a new life ? in the end shuffling timidly into the open space and hung their heads . It was after the last of these stood nervously shifting his weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tall , lanky individual pushing his way through the crowd . At first I thought . my eyes had deceived me ; but when he turned , there was no mistaking the small head , shaped not unlike a hickory-nut with its pointed top , or the loose-jointed arms and spindle-legs : this was Andrew ? not in his happy , buoyant mood , but visibly agitated , glancing furtively at each dark doorway as if in momentary dread lest some evil spirit of the night should start wild-eyed from the gloom to accomplish his destruction . His great chest heaved ; his hands trembled as they clutched the soft felt hat ; and when they had finished singing " Almost Persuaded , " and called for testimonies , all of the suppressed emotion of the negro vented itself when he found his voice and shouted , " I done see Jesus ! " " Wait till you see Justice John , " exclaimed a thick-set , marble-eyed sceptic , seizing him With the tenacity of a lobster and exhibiting his shield . So rapidly was the thing accomplished that when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowd ; I do n't mean to say he ran , for Andrew was habitually slow in his movements ; he simply went ? through the crowd and down the alley , like a man who has been connected with a steam-windlass . When on the following morning the bizarre group of night-drifters formed in line as court opened , Andrew stood outconspicuously among his fellows by a certain native elegance ; for it was Sunday when the thing happened , and on these days he could be fastidious in his dress to the point where a colored gentleman in the South runs no little risk of seeing the daylight go ? all of a sudden ? and of awakening on the morrow to find himself at the bottom of some areaway , with a dull throbbing at the back of the head . His less prosperous white brother may be poor , but that does not deprive him of an innate sense of propriety . So when the justice looked carelessly at the harvesting of the night before , it is little wonder that he eyed him curiously before taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ query : " What 's yo ' name ? " " George Washington Andrew J ackson . " " How long have you been in this heah town ? " " 1 disremembe 's zactly how long . " " Like the town , Geo'ge ? " " Yais , sub . " " What 's the ehawge l " " Ilurmin ' a crap game near Locust Alley , " replied a man whom I immediately recognized as the officer who had made the arrest , and I leaned forward eagerly to catch every word of the cross-examination , familiar as I was with Andrew 's infinite resources in the matter of alibis . But the justice had caught sight of Andrew 's patent-leather shoes , and paused for a minute inspection before inquiring anxiously : " Wheah did von come from , Geo'ge ? " " No'th Ca'lina , sub . " " Thirty days , " replied the justice , with infinite good humor , and the long line took one step forward .               @ @ @ @ @ @
