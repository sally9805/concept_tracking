txt The Secret Service men on duty here guarding the President were thrown into confusion to-day , when the first crank of the season appeared , and , for all their efforts , might well have got within talking distance of the President had not Mr. Roosevelt been on board the Sylph on a trio up the Sound all the afternoon , returning late to-night . He was told of the man 's visit , but only laughed and did not aopear worried . Although the would-be visitor to the President eluded the Secret Service men this afternoon , they ran him down tonight and will see that he leaves town on the first train to-morrow morning . In the meantime he is in the Columbia Hotel , outside the door of which a Secret Service man is camping , with orders from Chief James Sloan not to leave his post for an instant . Moses S , Okun , manufacturer of the Okun gas checks for inclosed arc lamps , with offices at 6 Reade Steet , Manhattan , is the way the man whom the Secret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself . He is a harmless-looking little Russian , about 40 years old , below the average height . His skin is swarthy and his manner nervous . He first appeared here about a week ago and tried to obtain quarters at the Octagon Hotel . Proprietor Charles Weeks declined to entertain him , however , and Okun returned to New York . Last night at 7 o'clock , however , he reappeared , and this time got a room In the Columbia Hotel , engaging it for a week and paying in advance , He retired early and was not noticed again until 11 o'clock this morning , when he visited the office of Justice of the Peace Walter Franklin in the Town Hall , where for the first time his peculiarities caused comment . He told the Justice he wanted a warrant issued against a certain rich man , who was exerting a hypnotic influence over him and trying to kill him . He said he had already written to President Roosevelt on the subject , Justice Franklin persuaded him to go away , and Okun returned immediately to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Crank Goea to_the Sagamore . Then he appeared in South Street and later attracted the attention of several people , who saw him wandering about near Sagamore Hill , the President 's home . No Secret Service man was fortunate enough to see him at the time , however , and he disappeared again , returning to the hotel at 10 P. M. and going to his room , wnere Tie had stowed two heavy suitcases under his bed . By this time , however , the Secret Service men had got on Okun 's trail . and Chief Sloan called at the hotel and asked to see him . Okun made no objection and told the chief the same story ho had told the Justice . He said he had come to Oyster Bay because it was the home of President Roosevelt , and he believed he could get more protection against his enemies there than in any other place . He said he had written to President Roosevelt asking his protection , and meant to call on him and request it in person before leaving town . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him for many years and that he changed his address in New York almost daily in order to throw the man off the trail . He said that nine years ago he had written to Mr. Roosevelt , who was then Governor of New York , asking his protection against his mysterious enemy with the uncanny power , and that Gov . Roosevelt had referred him to the District Attorney . Planned a Submarine . Three years ago , he said , things got so bad that he went to England , and from there addressed a second communication to Mr. Roosevelt , the President , again demanding protection from his enemies . His failure to receive a reply , he said , convinced him that the only thing to do was to come to Oyster Bay for a personal Interview .

Okun said that besides expecting to receive more protection because of his proximity to the President . he also expected to benefit his eyes , which he said were weak , by a sojourn in Oyster Bay , believing the town something of a health resort , if the President were to be taken as a. sample of its residents . President Roosevelt has been unusually active this season , going much abroad , and the arrival of Okun threw the Secret Service men into a state of excitement far greater than if it had not been the first of its kind this year . Okun persisted in declaring that he should see the President before leaving town . - Opposed as President Roosevelt is known to be to the criminal rich , " Okun told Chief Sloan .
