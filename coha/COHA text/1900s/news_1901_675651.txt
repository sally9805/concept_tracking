txt Washington IS beginning to be crowded with visitors , who are coming to see William inaugurated a second time . Yesterday the city wore about its usual appearance so far as crowds were concerned . To-day and tonight it has been very different . The blare of the first brass band was heard early this morning , and from hour to hour today other brass bands have brazenly announced new arrivals of military or civilian organizations . Along the avenue  --  Pennsyie yenta Avenue  --  these incoming visitors found the decorators hurrying to completion the most ambitious . and well-thoughtout plan of decoration that has been erne ployed to add interest to an inauguration ct remor. y . This work is not fully completed , but it is sufficiently advanced to show that - it will be creditable and generally liberal : The public buildings are treated with taste and skill , usually by the use of several 1 designs and in large masses of color in=stead of a waste of effort with small , flags or rosettes . At the Capitol the throng was large , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ QUI* moving throng , anxious to be shown eViieye thing in as short a time as possible and to get out to see sights not to be seen to-mOrrow . The echoes in the old Hall of Representatives were working overtime , the guides leading echo seekers about in bunch7. ! es of a dozen to test the remarkable reverberations of the chamber . There was the usual dissatisfaction  - -  on the part of the visiting American who , had not been here before with the limited ca= pacity of the galleries of the Senate , and the House . the passages leading to the galleries being blocked up all day by those who were waiting their turn to get into a place from which their Senators or Representeuves could be seen and heard . Soldiers roamed about the rotunda and out upon the platforms that are to be in use on Monday for just about an hour , and under the porch of the Capitol were a lot of bluejackets reeving flags to lines that were to run them into position above the pediment . It was a Hvely and profitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ busy enough . but there was little of the talk during the day that rewards the occasional visitor . It seldom falls to the lot of the occasional visitor to catch the exciting incident or speech in Congress . Odds and ends of legislation . transacted with the maximum of disorder . made the business seem like anything but crderly and deliberate work to the man in the gallery . The crowds along Pennsylvania Avenue to-night are not made up wholly of strane gers , but there are many strangers among them . That fact is made known to men who dine about in Washington by the discovery that prices at restaurants have been advanced to-night from 30 to 50 per cerkt , 4 and prices for windows along the lineeot march of the inauguration parade have stiffened in twenty-four hours most won. : derfully , going up from $1 ? to $25 for the cheaper windows , and out of all reason for the higher-priced and most comfortable places of observation . There is a very superior demand for windows near Senator Hanna 's " private throne . " as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fours teenth Street , backed up against the neW Willard Hotel . Hanna promises to be about as interesting as President - and Vice President Roosevelt . BIG DEMAND FOR SEATS . The requests for seats at the Capitol , in , the Senate Chamber , and at the east front for Monday is possibly greater than - ever before . There are 7,000 seats at the east front , and the tickets held by 3,000 persons entitle them to enter the Senate Chamber , above or below . Four thousand seats to two special platforms are at the disposal of Senators and Representatives , and are to be reached by persons who will not enter the Capitol at all , but reach the platforms over bridges laid from the porches of the Senate and the House . R. is estimated that there have been 12,000 requests for seats on the platforms holding 7,000 , In allotting the press tickets the Sergeant at Arms of the Senate issued a ticket for each of the 175 regular user3 of the gallery and a few extras , to occupy a gallery with less than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for seats that could not be complied with , and more than a third of those who hold tickets to the gallery will be unable to get into it . There was a great throng of people In the Court of Honor in front of the Treasury and White House to-night expecting a repetition of the illumination of last night , when the wiring was tested . The hope was gratified , for after the trial of last night the Inaugural Committee in charge decided to repeat the illumination for five nights instead of three , as at first intended . The operation of turning on the lights proved almost as fascinating to the crowds as a display of fireworks . When the levers were shifted traceries of light rippled along the eaves of the four long reviewing stands on each side of the avenue , the thirty-eight large and small columns included in the court suddenly flashed into sight and gleamed with myriad small incandescent lamps , the court becoming at once the architectural verity that it had not seemed by daylight . Strangers of all degrees are arriving here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ing. - : in advance , and are met at the Baltimore and Ohio or the Pennsylvania station by persons wearing red badges . These red-badge people are members of the Committee on Public Comfort , and it is part of their business to guide provided visitors and to provide the unprovIded with rooms . This they do by sending them to the offices , where rooms are to be engaged . At those ( - Glees there are reckless inquirers and inquirers who are careful about their contracts and expenditures . An early morning call was made by a man . He wanted to know where he could get good accommodations . " You can get room and board at No. ? , on  --  Street , for x:1.:0a day , " he was told . " That 's not what I want . " he explained . " I only want a place to sleep . " " Then you can get a room or bed , " said the clerk , giving him several locations , with as many different prices . - Is 50 cents a night the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's about the cheapest on the list , " he was told . STRANGER WAS SURPRISED . The stranger expressed surprise that there were no t wen 1 y-five-cent beds , for where he came from a stranger who called would be made welcome at any time /and no charge Would even be made for something to eat . hotels in his section would lodge a man for a quarter . and he thought that wile cliodgli to pay in a big city . He was told : hat there were cheap lodging , houses where he could get a bed for a quarter . but he compromised on a fifty- , vent bed . kind started toward his prospective resting place , thoroughly happy . A woman . who wanted a room only , and who said she would take her meals hi . down-town dining rooms . was anxious to ' , g s over the long list of plates on the lists .. " This place . said the clerk . pointing out the address of a goof boarding-house , keeper near the Capitol . " is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge is only 7 : : cents a night . "  --  , " And is the house near Sixth Street ? " . inquired the woman . ? ? IC , : only four squares away , " the Clerk told her . - Nee , - she said , " tell me where I can get a bed for less than 75 yenta. " - Here is one. - the clerk told her ; " 50 tents a night is the rate. ? ' - What about tile Arlington and Riggs ? " . the stranger asked . " They ate tilled. - " I 'll call later , " was the woman 's state : . meta. , and she went away without selectin4 ' ' " a lodging place .
