SCENE . The library and card-room at JACK BROOKFIELD 'S , Louisville . There is a large doorway in the center , at the back , which leads into a hallway , in which the banister of a stairway that descends to the street level is seen . A second and smaller doorway is near the front in the wall to the left of the stage . This doorway leads to the dining-room . The second plan of the left wall is occupied by a fireplace and mantel , surmounted by a marine painting . The fireplace is surrounded by a garde au feu club seat . The rest of the left wall , as well as the rear wall on both sides of the center door and all of the right wall , is fitted with book-cases about five feet high , in which are books handsomely bound . The walls above these bookcases are hung with heavy brocaded Genoese velvet of a deep maroon in color and loosely draped . The ceiling is of carved wood , gilded . On the wall velvet , at proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these paintings are fitted with hooded electric lights . Such a fitting is above a noticeable , Corot , which hangs to the right of the center door . A dark-red rug of luxuriant thickness is on the floor . The furniture is simple , massive , and Colonial in type . It consists of a heavy sofa above the fireplace and running at right angles to the wall . A heavy table fitted with books is in the center ; a smaller table for cards is at the stage , right . Chairs are at both tables . Above the center door is a marble bust of Minerva , surmounted by a bronze raven , lacquered black , evidently illustrating Poe 's poem . The Antommarchi death-mask of Napoleon in bronze hangs on the dark wood fireplace . A bronze mask of Beethoven is on one of the bookcases and on another is a bust of Dante . A bronze Sphinx is on another bookcase . The room is lighted by a standing lamp at the back and by the glow from the fireplace . Over the table , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bronze shade . This lamp , while not lighted , is capable of being turned on by a push button , which depends from it . On the table , center , is a large paper-cutter made of an ivory tusk . Empty stage . After a pause there is a sound of laughter and dishes , left . ( Enter Jo , sleek negro of Pullman car variety , by stairway and center door . He goes to door , left , and pauses  --  laughter ceases ) . JO Massar Brookfield. p. 3 BROOKFIELD ( Outside , left . ) Well Jo ? JO Mr. Denning , sah . BROOKFIELD Ask Mr. Denning to come up .

JACK motions him out and LEW goes . ) What you got to-night ? Young Rockefeller BROOKFIELD Some ladies- DENNING ( Grinning . ) What- BROOKFIELD ( Sternly . ) My sister and her daughter  --  and a lady friend of theirs . DENNING ( Disappointed. ) - No game ?  --  BROOKFIELD Not until they go . DENNING ( Getting a peek off into dining  --  room . ) Oh  --  chafing-dish . BROOKFIELD They ' ve been to the opera .  --  I had Harvey brew them some terrapin . DENNING ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limp . ) BROOKFIELD No , I think there 's some left . ( Pause . ) I ' m going to take a long chance and introduce you , Tom , only do n't say anything about poker before the ladies . DENNING Thought you said your sister  --  BROOKFIELD I did . p. 5 DENNING Well , she 's on , is n't she ? BROOKFIELD But she does n't like it  --  and my niece  --  my niece does n't like it . ( Enter HARVEY , old negro servant , from dining-room , left . ) HARVEY I ' ve made some coffee , Mars BROOKFIELD You have it in the dining-room or heah , sah ? BROOKFIELD ( Going . ) I ' ll ask the ladies . DENNING How are you , Harvey ?

She is smartly gowned and is energetic . ) BROOKFIELD Alice  --  this is my friend , Mr. Denning  --  my sister  --  Mrs. Campbell . ALICE Mr. Denning . ( Enter HELEN and VIOLA . HELEN is thoroughly feminine in type , and is young-looking for the mother of a boy of twenty  --  VIOLA is an athletic Kentucky girl . ) HELEN I never take coffee even after dinner and at this hour  --  never ! ( Exit HARVEY . ) BROOKFIELD Mrs. Whipple , may I present Mr. Denning ? HELEN ( Bowing . ) Mr. Denning . DENNING Good-evening ! BROOKFIELD My niece , Miss Viola Campbell . DENNING How are you ?

DENNING Ha , ha ! Excuse me ! ( Exit ) ALICE The foundry ? ( Sits right of table . ) BROOKFIELD Never did a day 's work in his life . That 's Tom Denning . ( Nods off . ) VIOLA ( On sofa at fireplace . ) Tom Denning 's the name of the big race-horse . BROOKFIELD Yes-he 's named after the racehorse . HELEN ( On sofa , beside VIOLA . ) What does he do ? BROOKFIELD His father  --  father 's in the packing business  --  Kansas City ; this fellow has four men shoveling money away from him so he can breathe . ( Starts toward dining-room . ) ALICE ( In amused protest . ) Oh , Jack ! BROOKFIELD Yes  --  I ' m one of them  --  you 'll find cigarettes in that box . ALICE Jack ! ( Rises. ) p. 8 BROOKFIELD ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VIOLA ( Protesting . ) Well , certainly not for me , Uncle Jack ? BROOKFIELD Of course , not you HELEN Thank you , Mr. Brookfield ! ALICE ( Joining JACK . ) My dear brother , . you confuse the Kentucky ladies with some of your Eastern friends . BROOKFIELD Careful , Alice . Helen lived in the East twenty years , remember . HELEN But even my husband did n't smoke . BROOKFIELD No ? HELEN Never  --  in his life  --  BROOKFIELD In his life ? Why make such a pessimistic distinction ? ( HELEN turns away right . ) ALICE Jack ! ( After a look to HELEN . ) How can you say a thing like that ? BROOKFIELD She 's the man 's widow  --  I 've got to say it if any one does . ( Enter HARVEY with coffee . ) Mr. Denning 's got his tortoise , Uncle Harvey ? p. 9 HARVEY ( Offering tray to HELEN . ) He 's got the same as we all had , Mars BROOKFIELD Yas , sah . ( Laughs . ) HELEN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) BROOKFIELD I ' ll take it , Uncle Harvey . I think three or four of them ' ll help this head of mine . ALICE ( Taking coffee . ) Why do n't you let Viola cure your headache ? VIOLA ( Taking coffee . ) Yes , Uncle Jack . BROOKFIELD No , the coffee ' ll fix it , I ' m sure . ( Exit HARVEY . ) VIOLA Sit here while you drink it . BROOKFIELD No  --  no , Viola . It is n't enough for that . I 'll conserve your mesmeric endowment for a real occasion . ( Swallows coffee in one mouthful . ) VIOLA Goodness ! Just to please me ? BROOKFIELD ( Shaking head . ) Do n't want to spoil your awful stories . ( Exit to dining-room. ) p. 10 HELEN Is Viola a magnetic healer , too ? ( Sits right of table . ) VIOLA ( Taking a book , and returning to the sofa , carrying also a large ivory tusk paper-cutter . ) Oh , no . ALICE ( Sitting left of table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headaches , Mrs. Whipple . Those I crush out of my victims . HELEN I remember Jack used to have a wonderful ability that way as a young man . VIOLA He says only with the girls . ALICE We know better , do n't we ? HELEN Yes . VIOLA Well , for myself , I ' d rather have Uncle Jack sit by me than any regular physician I ever saw . HELEN You mean if you were ill ? VIOLA Of course . ALICE You must be very clear with Mrs. Whipple on that point , Viola , because she used to prefer your Uncle Jack to sit by her , even when she was n't ill . HELEN ( To VIOLA . ) But especially when ill , my dear . ( To ALICE . ) And has he quit it ? p. 11 ALICE Yes  --  you know Jack went into politics for a while . HELEN Did he ? ALICE Local politics  --  yes  --  something about the police did n't please him and then he quit all of his curative work . HELEN Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's something unpleasant about the word " heeler . " HELEN Oh ! VIOLA Entirely different spelling , however . HELEN Our English language is so elastic in that way . ALICE Yes , the papers joked about his magnetic touch . The word " touch " is used offensively also . So Jack dropped the whole business . HELEN And Viola inherits the ability ? ALICE Well , if one can inherit ability from an uncle . HELEN From a family . ALICE That 's even more generous , but Viola is like Jack in every way in which a girl may resemble a man . Horses and boats and every kind of personal risk  --  and  --  VIOLA ( Rises . ) I ' m proud of it . p. 12 ALICE And Jack spoils her . VIOLA Am I spoiled ? ( Goes to back of table . ) ALICE He could n't love her more if he were her father  --  ( Enter CLAY , a boy of twenty . ) CLAY ( Pausing at door . ) May I come in ? VIOLA Certainly . CLAY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beautiful . CLAY ( Waving hand above . ) And the sleeping apartments are what I take pride in . Private bath to every bedroom , reading-lamps just over the pillows  --  VIOLA Have n't you seen the house , Mrs. Whipple ? HELEN Not above this floor . ALICE Would it interest you ? ( Rises and goes left . ) HELEN Very much . ALICE ( At door of dining-room . ) Jack  --  BROOKFIELD ( Outside . ) Yes  --  p. 13 ALICE ( To HELEN . ) Will I do as your guide ? HELEN ( Rises . ) Oh , yes . ( Enter JACK . ) ALICE I want to show Helen over the house . BROOKFIELD Do . ALICE The rooms are empty ? BROOKFIELD Empty , of course . ALICE Do n't be too indignant , they 're not always empty . ( To HELEN . ) In Jack 's house one is liable to find a belated pilgrim in any room . HELEN ( Laughing . ) And a lady walking in unannounced would be something of a surprise , would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ALICE Jack ! BROOKFIELD My dear sister  --  they would . Hard lines when the reputation of a man 's house is n't respected by his own sister  --  ha ! ( Exit left , with mock indignation . ) HELEN ( Smiling . ) The same Jack . ALICE Intensified and confirmed ! ( Pausing at door . ) Will you come , too , Viola ? p. 14 VIOLA No , thank you mother . ( HELEN looks at ALICE.She and ALICE go . ) CLAY What was Frank Hardmuth saying to you . ( He indicates the dining-room . ) VIOLA When ? CLAY At supper  --  and in the box at the theater , too ? VIOLA Oh  --  Frank Hardmuth  --  nobody pays any attention to him . CLAY I thought you paid a great deal of attention to what he was saying . VIOLA In the same theater party a girl 's got to listen  --  or leave the box . CLAY Some persons listen to the opera . VIOLA I told him that was what I wanted to do . CLAY Was he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't call it that . CLAY Would anybody else have called it that if they ' d overheard it ? VIOLA I do n't think so . CLAY Wo n't you tell me what it was about ? VIOLA I do n't see why you ask . p. 15 CLAY I asked because he seemed so much in earnest  --  and because you seemed so much in earnest . VIOLA Well ? CLAY And Frank Hardmuth 's a fellow that ' ll stand watching . ( Looks off left . ) VIOLA ( Smiling . ) He stood a good deal to-night . CLAY I mean that he 's a clever lawyer and would succeed in making a girl commit herself in some way to him before she knew it . VIOLA I think that depends more on the way the girl feels . CLAY Well-I do n't want you to listen to Frank Hardmuth under the idea that he 's the only chance in Kentucky . VIOLA Why , Clay Whipple- CLAY You know very well I 've been courting you myself , Viola , do n't you ? VIOLA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big boy . CLAY ( Follows right . ) Have I gone with any other girl  --  anywhere ? VIOLA I do n't know . ( Sits right . ) CLAY And I ' ve spoken to your Uncle Jack about it . p. 16 VIOLA To Uncle Jack ? CLAY Yes . VIOLA ( Rises . ) Nobody told you to speak to Uncle Jack . CLAY Mother did . VIOLA Your mother ? CLAY Yes . Mother 's got regular old  --  fashioned ideas about boys and young ladies and she said , " if you think Viola likes you , the honorable thing to do is to speak to her guardian first . " VIOLA Oh !  --  you thought that , did you ? CLAY I certainly did . VIOLA I ca n't imagine why . CLAY I thought that because you ' re Jack Brookfield 's niece , and nobody of his blood would play a game that is n't fair . VIOLA I wish you would n't always throw that up to me . ( Goes to sofa . ) ' T is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Sits . ) CLAY ( Following . ) Why , Viola , I was praising him . I think your Uncle Jack the gamest man in Kentucky . VIOLA Nor that either . I do n't criticize my Uncle Jack , but he 's a lot better man than just a fighter or a card-player . I love him for his big heart . p. 17 CLAY So do I. If I ' d thought you cared I ' d have said you were too much like him at heart to let a fellow come a-courtin ' if you meant to refuse him  --  and that was all that was in my mind when I asked about Frank Hardmuth  --  and I do n't care what Hardmuth said either , if it was n't personal that way . VIOLA Frank Hardmuth 's nothing to me . CLAY And he wo n't be ? ( Pause . ) Will he  --  ? ( Pause . ) Say that . Because I ' m awfully in love with you . VIOLA Are you ? CLAY You bet I am . Just Tom-fool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never said so . CLAY Mother said a boy in an architect 's office had better wait till he was a partner  --  but I ca n't wait , Viola , if other fellows are pushing me too hard . VIOLA ( Rises . ) Uncle Jack says you are a regular architect if there ever was one . CLAY It 's what you think that makes the difference to me . VIOLA Well , I think  --  ( Pause )  --  Uncle Jack certainly knows . p. 18 CLAY And an architect 's just as good as a lawyer . VIOLA Every bit . CLAY Viola . ( Takes her in his arms . ) VIOLA Now  --  I do n't mind tellin ' you  --  he was speakin ' for himself  --  Frank Hardmuth . CLAY By Jove  --  on this very night . VIOLA Yes . CLAY Seems like the Hand of Providence that I was here . Let 's sit down . ( They sit . ) You ' ve got confidence in me , have n't you ? VIOLA Yes  --  I 've always said to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day  --  I should say I had confidence in you . CLAY Huh . ( Laughs . ) Of course the big jobs pay . Things like insurance buildings  --  but my heart 's in domestic architecture  --  and if you do n't laugh at me , I ' ll tell you something . VIOLA Laugh at you  --  about your work and your ambition ! Why , Clay ! CLAY I do most of the domestic interiors for the firm already  --  and whenever I plan a second floor or a staircase I can see you plain as day walkin ' through the rooms  --  or saying good-night over the banisters. p. 19 VIOLA Really ? ( CLAY nods . ) You mean in your mind ? CLAY No , with my eyes ' . Domestic architecture 's the most poetic work a man can get into outside of downright poetry itself . VIOLA It must be if you can see it all that way . CLAY Every room  --  I can see your short sleeves as you put your hands on the banisters  --  and sometimes you push up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way  --  ( Brushes his forehead . ) VIOLA Oh , this- ( Repeats the gesture. ) - all girls do that . CLAY But not just the same way as you do it . Yes , sir ! I can see every little motion you make . VIOLA Whenever you care to think about me . CLAY Bless you , no  --  that 's the trouble of it . VIOLA What trouble ? CLAY The pictures of you  --  do n't come just when I want them to come  --  and they do n't go when I want them to go  --  especially in the dark . VIOLA Why , how funny . CLAY Sometimes I ' ve had to light the gas in order to go to sleep . p. 20 VIOLA Why , I never heard of anything like that . CLAY Well , it happens with me often . I designed this room for your Uncle Jack  --  but before I put a brush in my color-box I saw this very Genoese velvet and the picture frames in their places  --  and that Corot right there  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VIOLA ( Rises . ) A superstition ! ( Regards the Corot . ) CLAY I said to Jack , have anything else you want on the other walls , but right there I want you to put a Corot that I ' ve seen at a dealer 's in New York  --  and he did it . VIOLA Uncle Jack generally has his own way about pictures . CLAY I only mean that he approved my taste in the matter  --  but my idea of this house really started with  --  and grew around that canvas of Corot 's . VIOLA Then it is n't always me that you see ? CLAY Always you when I think about a real house , you bet  --  a house for me  --  and you ' ll be there , wo n't you ? ( Takes her in his arms . ) VIOLA Will I ? p. 21 CLAY Yess  --  say , " I will . " VIOLA I will . ( Reenter ALICE and HELEN . ) ALICE ( Astonished . ) Viola ! ( VIOLA goes left . ) CLAY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you knew ? HELEN Yes . CLAY ( To ALIC . ) And I asked Jack , too . ALICE You mean  --  CLAY We ' re engaged  --  if you say it 's all right . ALICE And you  --  Viola ? VIOLA ( Nodding . ) Yess  --  ALICE ( Going to chair left of table . ) Well , if Jack 's been consulted and you all know of it  --  I should make a very hopeless minority . CLAY Why any minority ? ALICE Only the necessary considerations . ( To HELEN . ) Clay 's prospects  --  his youth . VIOLA Why , he designs most of the work for his firm now . p. 22 CLAY That is , dwellings . HELEN I should advise waiting  --  myself  --  until Clay is in the firm  --  ( To CLAY . ) And I did advise delay in speaking to Viola herself . CLAY I ' d a waited , mother , only Frank Hardmuth proposed to Viola to-night ! ALICE To-night ? VIOLA At the opera . ALICE ( To HELEN . ) One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ! So you do consent , do n't you ? ALICE I think your mother and I should talk it over . CLAY Well , it 's a thing a fellow does n't usually ask his mother to arrange , but  --  ( Pause . ) VIOLA You mean privately ? ALICE Yes . CLAY We can go to the billiard room , I suppose ? VIOLA Come on . CLAY ( At the center door with VIOLA . ) You know , mother  --  how I feel about it . ( Exit with VIOLA. ) p. 23 HELEN I supposed you had guessed it . ( Sits right of table . ) ALICE I had  --  but when the moment arrives after all , it 's such a surprise that a mother ca n't act naturally . HELEN Clay is really very trustworthy for his years . ALICE There 's only one thing to discuss . I have n't mentioned it because  --  well , because I ' ve seen so little of you since it began and because the fault is in my own family . HELEN Fault @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) Clay is playing . HELEN You mean  --  ALICE Here with Jack 's friends . HELEN Clay gambling ! ALICE ( Wincing . ) I do n't quite get used to the word , though we ' ve had a life-time of it  --  ( Sits left of table. ) gambling . HELEN I should n't have thought Jack would do that  --  with my boy . ALICE Jack has n't our feminine view-point , Helen  --  and , besides , Jack is calloused to it . p. 24 HELEN You should have talked to Jack yourself . ALICE Talked to him ? I did much more  --  that is , as much more as a sister dependent on a brother for support could do . You know Jack really built this place for me and Viola . HELEN I ' d thought so  --  yes . ALICE Viola is the very core of Jack 's heart  --  well , we both left the house and went into our little apartment and are there now . A woman ca n't do much more than that and still take her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  ALICE And it hurt him  --  hurt him past any idea . HELEN You did that because my Clay was  --  was playing here ? ALICE Not entirely Clay  --  everybody ! ( Pause  --  a distant burst of laughter comes from the men in the dining-room . ) There is n't a better-hearted man nor an abler one in the State than Jack Brookfield , but I had my daughter to consider . There were two nights under our last city government when nothing but the influence of Frank Hardmuth kept the police from coming to this house and arresting everybody  --  think of it . HELEN Dreadful  --  p. 25 ALICE Now , that 's something , Helen , that I would n't tell a soul but you . Viola does n't know it  --  but Jack 's card-playing came between you and him years ago and you  --  may know it . ( Rises and looks toward dining-room . ) You may even have some influence with Jack . HELEN I  --  ah , no . ALICE Yes  --  this supper to-night was Jack 's idea for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HELEN Why , Jack did n't even sit with us . ALICE Also  --  for you  --  Jack Brookfield is a more notable character in Louisville to-day than he was twenty-two years ago . His company would have made you the subject of unpleasant comment . That 's why he left us alone in the box . HELEN Is n't it a pity  --  a terrible pity ! ( Laughter off left . HELEN rises . ) ( Enter HARDMUTH , JACK , DENNING , and LEW . HARDMUTH is the aggressive prosecutor . ) HARDMUTH I tell the gentlemen we ' ve left the ladies to themselves long enough , Mrs. Campbell . ALICE Quite long enough , Mr. Hardmuth . DENNING Where 's the young lady ? Jack 's niece ? p. 26 HELEN In the billiard room , I believe . DENNING ( To HELEN , disappointed . ) Oh-Jack 's been telling us what a great girl she is . HARDMUTH Some of us knew that without being told . DENNING And she 's wonderfully like  --  you wonderfully . HELEN You compliment me  --  BROOKFIELD Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's mother . DENNING Ai n't I ? BROOKFIELD This lady is Mrs. Whipple . DENNING Oh , Clay 's mother ? ( HELEN bows . ) Well , your boy , Mrs. Whipple , plays in the hardest luck of all the people I ever sat next to . HELEN You mean- BROOKFIELD ( Interrupting and putting his arm about DENNING . ) You depreciate yourself , Tom . There 's no hard luck in merely sitting next to you . DENNING Ha , ha . HELEN ( To ALICE . ) I think Clay and I should be going . BROOKFIELD ( Consulting his watch . ) Oh , no  --  only a little after twelve and no one ever goes to sleep here before two . ( To DENNING . ) I told you to keep still about card games . p. 27 DENNING I meant unlucky at billiards.They 're all right , ai n't they ? BROOKFIELD Oh  --  ( Walks away impatiently . ) DENNING Let 's go and see the young lady play billiards with Clay . ( To ALICE . ) I can see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ALICE toward door . LEW follows . ) BROOKFIELD Shall we join them ? HELEN I ' d like it . ( JACK and HELEN start up . ) HARDMUTH Jack ! Just a minute . BROOKFIELD ( To HELEN . ) Excuse me  --  DENNING ( To ALICE as they go . ) No , Kansas City 's my home , but I do n't live there . ( Exit with ALICE . ) BROOKFIELD Be right in , Lew . ( Exit HELEN With LEW . ) Well , Frank  --  HARDMUTH I took advantage of your hospitality , old man , to-night . BROOKFIELD Advantage ? HARDMUTH Yes  --  I 've been talking to your niece . p. 28 BROOKFIELD Oh ! HARDMUTH Proposed to her . BROOKFIELD Yes ? HARDMUTH Yes , Jack . ( Enter Jo at back , from downstairs . ) JO A gentleman called you on the telephone , sah . BROOKFIELD ( Regarding watch . ) Who ? JO Judge Brennus  --  name sounds like . Holdin ' the wire , sah . BROOKFIELD I do n't know any Judge Brennus . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he 's got to leave town in the mornin ' and he ' d be very much obliged if you ' d see him to-night . BROOKFIELD Did you tell him we were dark to-night ? JO He did n't want no game . It 's about a picture  --  a picture you 've got . BROOKFIELD A picture ? JO He wants to look at it . ( JACK looks at HARDMUTH . ) HARDMUTH It 's a blind . BROOKFIELD ( Consulting watch . ) Well , this is a good night to work a blind on me . ( To JO . ) Tell the gentleman I ' II be up for half an hour . p. 29 JO Yes , sah . ( Exit . ) BROOKFIELD So you proposed to Viola ? HARDMUTH Yes . How do you feel about that ? BROOKFIELD You know the story of the bar-keeper asking the owner , " Is Grady good for a drink ? "  --  " Has he had it ? "  --  " He has . "  --  " He is . " HARDMUTH Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  she has n't answered me . BROOKFIELD ( Musing . ) Ha  --  HARDMUTH And under those conditions , how 's Grady 's credit with you ? BROOKFIELD Well , Frank , on any ordinary proposition you ' re aces with me . You know that . HARDMUTH ( Seated right of table . ) But for the girl ? BROOKFIELD It 's different . HARDMUTH Why ? BROOKFIELD She 's only nineteen  --  you know . HARDMUTH My sister married at eighteen . BROOKFIELD I mean you 're thirty-five . HARDMUTH That 's not an unusual difference . p. 30 BROOKFIELD Not an impossible difference , but I think unusual  --  and rather unadvisable . HARDMUTH That 's what you think . BROOKFIELD That 's what I think . HARDMUTH But suppose the lady is willing to give that handicap ? ( Pause  --  JACK shrugs his shoulders . ) What then ? BROOKFIELD Let 's cross the bridge when we come to it . HARDMUTH You mean you 'd still drag a little ? BROOKFIELD ( Pause . ) Do you think Viola likes you well enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we come to it . BROOKFIELD We have come to that one , Frank . There 's another man in the running and I think she likes him . HARDMUTH You mean young Whipple ? ( Rises , goes to fireplace . ) Well , he took second money in the box party to-night  --  at the supper table , too . I ' ll agree to take care of him , if you ' re with me . BROOKFIELD ( At table , center . ) I think he 's your biggest opposition . p. 31 HARDMUTH But you . Can I count on you in the show-down ? BROOKFIELD ( Pause . Sits right of table . ) If Viola did n't care enough for you , Frank . to accept you in spite of everything , I should n't try to influence her in your favor . ( Enter LEW , center , from left . ) ELLINGER I think a bum game of billiards is about as thin an entertainment for the outsiders as " Who 's got the button ? " HARDMUTH ( Meeting LEW up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business , Lew , with Jack for a minute . ELLINGER Well , I can sit in by the bottle , ca n't I ? ( Moves towards dining-room . ) BROOKFIELD Help yourself , Lew . ELLINGER Such awful stage waits while they chalk their cues . ( Exit left . ) HARDMUTH But you would n't try to influence her against me . BROOKFIELD ( Pause . ) She 's about the closest thing to me there is  --  that niece of mine . HARDMUTH ( Pause . ) Well ? p. 32 BROOKFIELD I ' d protect her happiness to the limit of my ability . HARDMUTH If she likes me  --  or should come to like me  --  enough  --  her  --  happiness would be with me , would n't it ? ( Sits again . ) BROOKFIELD She might think so . HARDMUTH Well ? &gt; BROOKFIELD But she ' d be mistaken . It would be a mistake , old chap . HARDMUTH I know twenty men  --  twelve to fifteen years older than their wives  --  all happy  --  wives happy , too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it ? BROOKFIELD She 's a fine girl  --  that niece of mine  --  not a blemish . HARDMUTH Well  --  BROOKFIELD I want to see her get the best  --  the very best  --  in family  --  position  --  character  --  HARDMUTH Anything against the Hardmuths ? ( Jack shakes head . ) I ' m assistant district attorney  --  and next trip I ' ll be the district attorney . BROOKFIELD I said character . p. 33 HARDMUTH Character ? BROOKFIELD Yes HARDMUTH You mean there 's anything against my reputation ? BROOKFIELD No  --  I mean character pure and simple  --  I mean the moral side of you ! HARDMUTH Well , by God ! BROOKFIELD You see , I ' m keeping the girl in mind all the time . HARDMUTH My morals ! BROOKFIELD Let 's say your moral fiber . HARDMUTH ( Rises . ) Well , for richness this beats anything I ' ve struck . Jack Brookfield taking to me about my moral fiber ! ( Goes toward fire . ) BROOKFIELD You asked for it . HARDMUTH ( Returns aggressively . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ m going to ask for the show-down . What do you mean by it ? BROOKFIELD ( With fateful repression . ) I mean  --  as long as you ' ve called attention to the " richness " of Jack Brookfield talking to you on the subject  --  that Jack Brookfield is a professional gambler  --  people get from Jack Brookfield just what he promises  --  a square game . Do you admit that ? p. 34 HARDMUTH I admit that . Go on . BROOKFIELD ( Rises , front of table . ) You ' re the assistant prosecuting attorney for the city of Louisville ; the people do n't get from you just what you promised  --  not by a jugful  --  HARDMUTH I ' m the assistant prosecuting attorney , remember  --  I promised to assist in prosecution , not to institute it . BROOKFIELD I expect technical defense , old man , but this was to be a show-down . HARDMUTH Let 's have it  --  I ask for particulars . BROOKFIELD Here 's one . You play here in my house and you know it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . HARDMUTH I ' ll support the law whenever it 's invoked . Indiet me and I ' ll plead guilty . BROOKFIELD This evasion is what I mean by lack of moral fiber . HARDMUTH Perhaps we ' re a little shy somewhere on mental fiber . BROOKFIELD You make me say it , do you , Frank ? Your duty , at least , is to keep secret the information of your office ; contrary to that duty you ' ve betrayed the secrets of your office to warn me and other men of this city when their game was in danger from the police . p. 35 HARDMUTH You throw that up to me ? BROOKFIELD ( Sits on left end of table . ) Throw nothing  --  you asked for it . HARDMUTH I stand by my friends . BROOKFIELD Exactly  --  and you ' ve taken an oath to stand by the people . HARDMUTH Do you know any sure politician that does n't stand by his friends ? BROOKFIELD Not one . HARDMUTH Well , there ! BROOKFIELD But I do n't know any sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . HARDMUTH That 's a little too fine-haired for me ! ( Turns to fire . ) BROOKFIELD I think it is . HARDMUTH ( Returns . ) I ' ll bet you a thousand dollars I ' m the next prosecuting attorney of this city . BROOKFIELD I ' ll take half of that if you can place it . I ' ll bet even money you ' re anything in polities that you go after for the next ten years . HARDMUTH Then I do n't understand your kick . BROOKFIELD But I ' ll give odds that the time ' ll come when you ' re way up there  --  full of honor and reputation and pride  --  that somebody ' ll drop to you , Frank , and flosh ! You for the down and outs . p. 36 HARDMUTH Rot ! BROOKFIELD It 's the same in every game in the world  --  the crook either gets too gay or gets too slow , or both , and the " come on " sees him make the pass . I ' ve been pallbearer for three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kentucky  --  just a little too slick , that 's all  --  and they ' ve always got it when it was hardest for the family . HARDMUTH So that ' ll be my finish , will it ? BROOKFIELD Sure . HARDMUTH ( Going back of table . ) You like the moral fiber of this Whipple kid ? BROOKFIELD I do n't know . ( Crosses to fireplace . ) HARDMUTH Weak as dishwater . BROOKFIELD I do n't think so . HARDMUTH I ' ll do him at any game you name . BROOKFIELD He 's only a boy  --  you should . HARDMUTH I ' ll do him at this game . BROOKFIELD What game ? HARDMUTH The girl ! I thought I could count on you because  --  well , for the very tips you hold against me ; but you ' re only her uncle , old man , after all . ( Swaggers down right. ) p. 37 BROOKFIELD That 's all . HARDMUTH And if she says " yes "  --  BROOKFIELD Frank ! ( Comes to front of table . Pause . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth ' ll come out  --  as to who murdered the governor-elect of this State . HARDMUTH Is there any doubt about that ? BROOKFIELD Is n't there ? HARDMUTH The man who fired that shot 's in jail . BROOKFIELD I do n't want my niece mixed up in it . HARDMUTH ( Angrily . ) What do you mean by that ? ( Enter HELEN , center . An awkward pause . ) The young people still playing ? HELEN Yes . HARDMUTH I ' ll look ' em over . ( Exit . ) HELEN Wo n't you come , too ? BROOKFIELD I ' d rather stay here with you . HELEN That gentleman that called after supper  --  BROOKFIELD Mr. Denning  --  HELEN Yes . He seems to take pleasure in annoying Clay  --  p. 38 BROOKFIELD ( Seriously . ) Yes  --  I know that side of Denning ( Goes to door of dining-room . ) Lew ! ELLINGER Yes . BROOKFIELD I wish you ' d go into the billiard room and look after Tom Denning . ELLINGER ( Entering left . ) What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) HELEN ( To JACK . ) Commenting humorously  --  hiding the chalk and so on . ELLINGER ( As he goes up . ) Lit up a little I suppose . BROOKFIELD ( Nodding . ) Just " ride herd " 1 " Take care of , " in the sense of a cowboy who rounds up the herd and keeps them out of mischief . on him . ( Exit LEW . ) HELEN ( Going left to sofa . ) He does n't seem much of a gentleman , this Mr. Denning . BROOKFIELD He was n't expected to-night . HELEN Is he one of your " clients " ? BROOKFIELD ( Smiling . ) One of my " clients " ? p. 39 HELEN Clay meets him here ? BROOKFIELD Yes  --  has met him here . HELEN I did n't think you ' d do that  --  Jack  --  with my boy . BROOKFIELD Do what ? HELEN Gamble . BROOKFIELD ( Smiling . ) It 's no gamble with your boy , Helen  --  sure thing . He has n't won a dollar ! HELEN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over it . BROOKFIELD Perhaps it would be more humorous to you if he ' d won . HELEN If he plays  --  I 'd rather see him win , of course . BROOKFIELD ( Beside sofa . ) That 's what puts me in the business  --  winning . The thing that makes every gambler stick to it is winning occasionally . I ' ve never let your boy get up from the table a dollar to the good and because he was your boy HELEN Why let him play at all ? BROOKFIELD He ' ll play somwhere till he gets sick of it  --  or marries . HELEN Will marriage cure it ? BROOKFIELD It would have cured me  --  but you did n't see it that way . p. 40 HELEN You made your choice . BROOKFIELD I asked you to trust me  --  you wanted some ironclad pledge  --  well , my dear Helen  --  that was n't the best way to handle a fellow of spirit . ( Goes front of table . ) HELEN So you chose the better way ? BROOKFIELD No choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And wasted your life . BROOKFIELD ( Sitting on edge of table . ) That depends on how you look at it . You married a doctor who wore himself out in the Philadelphia hospitals . I ' ve had three meals a day  --  and this place  --  and  --  a pretty fat farm and a stable with some good blood in it  --  and  --  HELEN ( Coming to him . ) And every one of them . Jack , is a monument to the worst side of you . BROOKFIELD ( Stands and takes her hands ; he smiles . ) Prejudice , my dear Helen . You might say that , if I ' d earned these things in some respectable business combination that starved out all its little competitors  --  but I ' ve simply furnished a fairly expensive entertainment  --  to cminent citizens  --  looking for rest . p. 41 HELEN I know all the arguments of your  --  profession  --  Jack , and I do n't pretend to answer them any more than I answer the arguments of reckless women who claim that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . BROOKFIELD ( Goes to chair , right . ) I ' m not flattered by the implied comparison  --  still  --  HELEN I only feel sure that anything which the majority of good people condemn is wrong . ( Sits left of table . ) BROOKFIELD ( Sits right of table . ) I ' m sorry  --  HELEN I ' d be glad if you meant that  --  but you ' re not sorry . BROOKFIELD I am sorry  --  I ' m sorry not to have public respect  --  as long as you think it 's valuable . HELEN I amuse you  --  do n't I ? BROOKFIELD ( Elbows on knees . ) Not a little bit  --  but you make me blue as the devil , if that 's any satisfaction . HELEN I ' d be glad to make you blue as the devil , Jack , if it meant discontent with what you ' re doing  --  if it could make you do better . p. 42 BROOKFIELD I ' m a pretty old leopard to get nervous about my spots . HELEN Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way ? BROOKFIELD I had hoped that twenty years of charitable deeds had made you also charitable in your judgment . HELEN I hope it has . BROOKFIELD Do n't seem to ease up on my specialty . HELEN You called your conduct . " wild oats " twenty years ago . BROOKFIELD It was  --  but I found such an excellent market for my wild oats that I had to stay in that branch of the grain business . Besides , it has been partly your fault , you know . ( HELEN plays with the ivory paper-knife , balancing it on the front edge of table . ) HELEN Mine ? BROOKFIELD Your throwing me over for my wild oats  --  put it up to me to prove that they were a better thing than you thought . HELEN Well  --  having demonstrated that  --  BROOKFIELD Here we are  --  HELEN Yes  --  here we are . p. 43 BROOKFIELD Back in the old town . Do n't you think it would be rather a pretty finish , Helen , if despite all my  --  my leopard 's spots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philadelphia episode of yours  --  HELEN You call twenty years of marriage episodic ? BROOKFIELD I call any departure from the main story episodic . HELEN And the main story is  --  BROOKFIELD You and I  --  HELEN Oh  --  ( Paper-knife falls to floor  --  JACK rises and picks it up , stands in front of table left hand on HELEN 'S  --  his right gesticulating with paper-knife . ) BROOKFIELD Would n't it be a pretty finish if you took my hand and I could walk right up to the camera and say , " I told you so "  --  ? You know I always felt that you were coming back . HELEN Oh , did you ? BROOKFIELD ( Playfully , and going right center . ) Had a candle burning in the window every night . HELEN You ' re sure it was n't a red light ? BROOKFIELD ( Remonstrating . ) Dear Helen ! have some poetry in your composition .

( Goes back of table . ) HELEN You know you had  --  at nights  --  about this hour  --  I 'd find it impossible to sleep until I ' d got up and written to you  --  and two days later I ' d get from you a letter that had crossed mine on the road . I do n't believe the word " telepathy " had been coined then  --  but I guessed something of the force  --  and all these years , I ' ve felt it  --  nagging ! Nagging ! BROOKFIELD Nagging ? HELEN Yes  --  I could not keep you out of my waking hours  --  out of my thought  --  but when I surrendered myself to sleep the call would come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , really .

Shall we say to the world  --  " We told you so ? " What of my picturesque finish ? HELEN You know my ideas  --  you 've known them twenty-two years . BROOKFIELD No modification ? HELEN None !

( Points above to second floor . ) And  --  well  --  I do n't think I could get interested in this bridge game that the real good people play  --  would you object to a gentleman 's game of " draw " now and then ? HELEN You called it a gentleman 's game in those days . BROOKFIELD No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no  --  BROOKFIELD M  --  ( Pause . ) I trust you wo n't consider my seeming hesitation uncomplimentary ?

( Enter JO . ) BROOKFIELD Oh , nothing  --  nothing . ( To JO . ) Well ? JO That gentleman , sah , about the picture . BROOKFIELD I ' ll see him . ( Exit JO . ) HELEN A caller ? BROOKFIELD Wo n't be a minute  --  do n't go away , because I think we can settle this question to-night , you and I. HELEN Please do n't put me in the light of waiting for an answer .

( Pause . ) I thought at one time ' that I would buy this picture . p. 48 BROOKFIELD You know it , then ? JUSTICE PRENTICE Yes . ( Pause . ) Are you particularly attached to it , Mr. Brookfield ? BROOKFIELD ( Sitting . ) I think not irrevocably . ( Takes pad of paper and figures mechanically . ) JUSTICE PRENTICE Oh . ( Pause , during which the JUSTICE looks at the picture . ) Do I understand that is what you paid for it , or what you intend to ask me for it ? ( JACK starts . ) BROOKFIELD What ? JUSTICE PRENTICE Sixty-five hundred . BROOKFIELD ( Astonished . ) I did n't speak the price , did I ? JUSTICE PRENTICE Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't pay that amount . BROOKFIELD ( Puzzled . ) That 's its price  --  however . JUSTICE PRENTICE I regret I did n't buy it from the dealer when I had my chance . ( Looks about at other pictures on backwall . ) I could n't have given it so beautiful a setting , Mr. Brookfield , nor such kindred  --  but it would not have been friendless  --  ( At fireplace . ) That 's a handsome marine . p. 49 BROOKFIELD Yes . JUSTICE PRENTICE Pretty idea I read recently in an essay of Dr. van Dyke 's . His pictures were for him his windows by which he looked out from his study onto the world . ( Pause . ) Yes ? BROOKFIELD Quite so . JUSTICE PRENTICE ( Regarding a picture over dining-room door . ) M  --  Washington ! BROOKFIELD ( Again astonished . ) What ? JUSTICE PRENTICE My home is Washington  --  I thought you asked me ? BROOKFIELD No , I did n't . JUSTICE PRENTICE I beg your pardon  --  BROOKFIELD ( Front of table ; aside . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to ask him . JUSTICE PRENTICE ( Viewing other pictures . ) And the phases of your world , Mr. Brookfield , have been very prettily multiplied . BROOKFIELD Thank you  --  may I offer you a cigar ? ( Opens box on table . ) JUSTICE PRENTICE Thank you , I wo n't smoke . p. 50 BROOKFIELD Or a glass of wine ? JUSTICE PRENTICE Nothing . I ' ll return to the hotel  --  first asking you again to excuse my untimely call . BROOKFIELD I wish you ' d sit down awhile . JUSTICE PRENTICE But I did n't know until I ' d missed it from Knoedler 's how large a part of my world  --  my dream world  --  I had been looking at through this frame . ( Regards the Corot again . ) BROOKFIELD Well , if it 's a sentimental matter , Mr. Justice , we might talk it over . JUSTICE PRENTICE I must n't submit the sentimental side of it , Mr. Brookfield , and where I have so  --  so intruded . BROOKFIELD That 's the big side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ' m sure of it  --  and I must n't take advantage of that knowledge . BROOKFIELD You 're sure of it ? JUSTICE PRENTICE Yes . BROOKFIELD Is that my reputation ? JUSTICE PRENTICE I do n't know your reputation . BROOKFIELD Then , how are you sure of it ? p. 51 JUSTICE PRENTICE ( Impressively . ) Oh  --  I see you  --  and  --  well , we have met . BROOKFIELD Ah  --  JUSTICE PRENTICE Good-night . ( Going up . ) BROOKFIELD One moment . ( Pause . ) You said your address was Washington ? JUSTICE PRENTICE Yes . BROOKFIELD You thought at the time I was about to ask you that question ? JUSTICE PRENTICE I thought you had asked it . BROOKFIELD And you thought a moment before I had said sixty-five hundred for the picture ? JUSTICE PRENTICE Yes . BROOKFIELD Do you often  --  pick answers that way ? JUSTICE PRENTICE Well , I think we all do  --  at times . BROOKFIELD We all do ? JUSTICE PRENTICE Yes  --  but we speak the answers only as we get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his spoken word . BROOKFIELD A person 's thought ? p. 52 JUSTICE PRENTICE Yes . BROOKFIELD Do you mean you know what I think ? JUSTICE PRENTICE ( Returning to table . ) I had n't meant to claim any monopoly of that power . It 's my opinion that every one reads thoughts of others  --  that is , some of the thoughts . BROOKFIELD Every one ? JUSTICE PRENTICE Oh , yes . BROOKFIELD That I do ? JUSTICE PRENTICE ( Regarding him . ) I should say you more generally than the majority of men . BROOKFIELD There was a woman said something like that to me not ten minutes ago . JUSTICE PRENTICE A woman would be apt to be conscious of it . BROOKFIELD You really believe that  --  that stuff ? ( Sits left of table . ) JUSTICE PRENTICE Oh , yes  --  and I ' m not a pioneer in the belief . The men who declare the stuff most stoutly are scientists who have given it most attention . BROOKFIELD How do they prove it ? JUSTICE PRENTICE They do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Each man must do that for himself , Mr. Brookfield. p. 53 BROOKFIELD How  --  JUSTICE PRENTICE ( Pause . Smiles . ) Well , I ' ll tell you all I know of it . ( Becoming serious . ) Every thought is active  --  that is , born of a desire  --  and travels from us  --  or it is born of the desire of some one else and comes to us . We send them out  --  or we take them in  --  that is all . BROOKFIELD How do we know which we are doing ? JUSTICE PRENTICE If we are idle and empty-headed , our brains are the playrooms for the thought of others  --  frequently rather bad . If we are active , whether benevolently or malevolently , our brains are workshops  --  power-houses . I was passively regarding the pictures ; your active idea of the price  --  registered , that 's all  --  so did your wish to know where I was from . BROOKFIELD You say " our brains "  --  do you still include mine ? JUSTICE PRENTICE Yes . BROOKFIELD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . JUSTICE PRENTICE I think so . BROOKFIELD Why has n't this whatever it is  --  effect  --  happened to me , then ? JUSTICE PRENTICE It has . p. 54 BROOKFIELD ( Pause . ) Why did n't I know it ? JUSTICE PRENTICE Vanity ? Perhaps . BROOKFIELD Vanity ? JUSTICE PRENTICE Yes  --  often some  --  friend has broached some independent subject and you have said , " I was just about to speak of that myself . " BROOKFIELD Very often , but  --  JUSTICE PRENTICE Believing the idea was your own  --  your vanity shut out the probably proper solution  --  that it was his . BROOKFIELD Well , how , then , does a man tell which of his thoughts are his own ? JUSTICE PRENTICE It 's difficult . Most of his idle ones are not . When we drift we are with the current . To go against it or to make even an eddy of our own we must swim  --  Most everything less than that is hopeless . BROOKFIELD ( Smiling . ) Well  --  I have n't been exactly helpless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Brookfield . ( Going . ) You have a strong psychic  --  a strong hypnotic ability . BROOKFIELD ( Smiling . ) You think so ? p. 55 JUSTICE PRENTICE I know it . BROOKFIELD This business ?

JUSTICE PRENTICE Many persons  --  yes  --  but I would n't do it if I were you  --  BROOKFIELD Why not ? JUSTICE PRENTICE Grave responsibility . BROOKFIELD In what way ? JUSTICE PRENTICE ( Pause . Smiles . ) I ' ll send you a book about it  --  if I may . BROOKFIELD Instructions ? JUSTICE PRENTICE And cautions  --  yes  --  ( Goes up to picture again . ) If you tire of your Corot , I ' d be glad to hear from you .

Mrs. Henderson filed her protest against my coming home loaded and I ' ve got to be moderate . JUSTICE PRENTICE Well , if you wo n't , you wo n't . JUSTICE HENDERSON ( Front of table , picks up book . ) Hello ! Reading the Scriptures in your old age ? JUSTICE PRENTICE It does look like a Bible , does n't it ? That 's a flexible binding I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him very much . JUSTICE HENDERSON I like some of his stuff . JUSTICE PRENTICE When I get home from the Capitol and you prosy lawyers , I ' m too tired to read Browning and those heavy guns , so I take Bret Harte  --  very clever , I think ; I was reading before you came  --  ( takes book )  --  " A Newport Romance . " Do you know it ? p. 67 JUSTICE HENDERSON I do n't think I do . JUSTICE PRENTICE It 's about an old house at Newport  --  that 's haunted  --  a young girl in the colonial days dies of a broken heart in this house , it seems . Her sweet-heart sailed away and left her  --  and here 's the way Bret Harte tells of her coming back . ( HENDERSON sits . ) Oh , I ' m not going to read all of it to you  --  only one verse . ( Looks at book .  --  Pause . ) Oh , I forgot to tell you that when this chap left the girl he gave her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of material evidence necessary to this summing up . ( HENDERSON nods . PRENTICE reads . ) " And ever since then when the clock strikes two , She walks unbidden from room to room , And the air is filled , that she passes through , With a subtle , sad perfume . The delicate odor of mignonette , The ghost of a dead-and-gone bonquet , Is all that tells of her story ; yetCould she think of a sweeter way ? " Is n't that charming , eh ? JUSTICE HENDERSON A very pretty idea . JUSTICE PRENTICE Beautiful to have a perfume suggest her . I suppose it appeals to me especially because I used to know a girl who was foolishly fond of mignonette. p. 68 JUSTICE HENDERSON Well , you do n't believe in that stuff , do you ? JUSTICE PRENTICE What stuff ? JUSTICE HENDERSON That Bret Harte stuff  --  the dead coming back  --  ghosts and so forth ? JUSTICE PRENTICE Yes , in one way I do . I find as I get older , Judge , that the things of memory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there are companions of my boyhood that I have n't thought of for years  --  that seem to come about me  --  more tangibly , or as much so as they were in life . JUSTICE HENDERSON Well , how do you account for that ? Spiritualism ? JUSTICE PRENTICE Oh , no . It 's Time 's perspective . JUSTICE HENDERSON Time 's perspective ? JUSTICE PRENTICE Yes . ( Pause . ) I ' ll have to illustrate my meaning . ( Indicates a painting . ) Here 's a sunset by Rousseau . I bought it in Paris last summer . Do you see what an immense stretch of land there is in it ? JUSTICE HENDERSON Yes . JUSTICE PRENTICE A bird's-eye view of that would require a chart reaching to the ceiling . But see Rousseau 's perspective . The horizon line is n't two inches from the base . p. 69 JUSTICE HENDERSON Well ? JUSTICE PRENTICE ( Returns to table . ) Well , my dear Judge , that is the magic in the perspective of Time . My boyhood 's horizon is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they grow , the nearer it comes , until I think sometimes that when we are through with it all  --  we go out almost as we entered  --  little children . JUSTICE HENDERSON ( Pause . ) That 's a very beautiful painting , Judge  --  a Russell , you say ? JUSTICE PRENTICE A Rousseau . JUSTICE HENDERSON Oh  --  JUSTICE PRENTICE Yes  --  cost me three thousand only , and a funny thing about it : the canvas just fitted into the top of my steamer trunk , and it came through the custom-house without a cent of duty . I completely forgot it . JUSTICE HENDERSON Your memory is n't so retentive , then , as it seems ? JUSTICE PRENTICE Not on those commercial matters . ( Enter SERVANT with coat . In crossing front of table to HENDERSON , the coat knocks a miniature from the table to the floor . ) JUSTICE PRENTICE You dropped your tobacco-box , I guess , Mr. Justice . p. 70 JUSTICE HENDERSON ( Examines pocket . ) No . SERVANT ( Picks up miniature . ) It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my gracious ! It might have been broken . SERVANT Oh , it often falls when I ' m dusting , sir . JUSTICE PRENTICE Oh , does it ? Well , I ' ll put it away . ( Exit SERVANT . ) An ivory miniature by Wimar . I prize it highly  --  old-fashioned portrait , see ! Gold back . JUSTICE HENDERSON A beautiful face . JUSTICE PRENTICE ( Eagerly . ) Is n't it ? Is n't it ? ( Looks Over HENDERSON 'S shoulder . ) JUSTICE HENDERSON Very . What a peculiar way of combing the hair  --  long , and over the ears . JUSTICE PRENTICE The only becoming way women ever wore their hair . I think the scrambly style they have now is disgraceful . JUSTICE HENDERSON Your mother ? JUSTICE PRENTICE Dear , no , a young girl I used to know . Oh , do n't smile , she 's been dead a good thirty years  --  married and had a large family . p. 71 JUSTICE HENDERSON Very sweet  --  very sweet , indeed . JUSTICE PRENTICE Is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Card , sir . JUSTICE PRENTICE Gentleman here ? ( Takes card . ) SERVANT Yes , sir . JUSTICE PRENTICE I ' ll see him . ( Exit SERVANT . ) JUSTICE HENDERSON Call ? JUSTICE PRENTICE Yes . The man owns a picture that I ' ve been trying to buy  --  a Corot . JUSTICE HENDERSON Oh  --  another of these perspective fellows ? JUSTICE PRENTICE Yes  --  his call does n't surprise me , for he 's been in my mind all day . JUSTICE HENDERSON Seems to be in a hurry for the money  --  coming at midnight . JUSTICE PRENTICE I set him the example  --  besides , midnight is just the shank of the evening for Mr. Brookfield . He 's supposed to be a sporting man  --  ahem . ( Enter SERVANT and JACK . JACK is paler and less physical than in first act. ) p. 72 JUSTICE PRENTICE Good-evening . BROOKFIELD You remember me , Mr. Justice ? JUSTICE PRENTICE Perfectly , Mr. Brookfield  --  this is Justice Henderson . JUSTICE HENDERSON Mr. Brookfield . BROOKFIELD Pleased to meet you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ' m not intruding . JUSTICE HENDERSON I ' m just going , Mr. Brookfield . ( To PRENTICE . ) To-morrow ? JUSTICE PRENTICE To-morrow ! JUSTICE HENDERSON ( At door , inquiringly . ) No constitutional point about it ? Eh ? JUSTICE PRENTICE None . JUSTICE HENDERSON Good-night . JUSTICE PRENTICE Good-night . ( To JACK . ) Have a chair . BROOKFIELD Thank you . ( Stands by chair left of table . ) JUSTICE PRENTICE ( Toward buffet . ) I ' ve some medicine here that comes directly from your city . BROOKFIELD I do n't think I will  --  if you ' ll excuse me. p. 73 JUSTICE PRENTICE Ah  --  ( Pause . Smiles . ) Well , have you brought the picture ? BROOKFIELD The picture is still in Louisville  --  I  --  I ' m in Washington with my niece . JUSTICE PRENTICE Yes ? BROOKFIELD And  --  a lady friend of hers . They ' re very anxious to meet you , Mr. Justice . JUSTICE PRENTICE Ah . ( Pause . ) Well  --  I go to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 're leaving the city to-morrow  --  as you were when I had the pleasure of receiving you . JUSTICE PRENTICE I remember . BROOKFIELD ( With watch . ) They were to come after me in five minutes if I did n't return , and those five minutes , Mr. Justice , I hoped you would give to me . JUSTICE PRENTICE With pleasure . ( Sits right of table . ) BROOKFIELD ( Plunging at once into his subject . ) Those two books you sent me  --  JUSTICE PRENTICE Yes ? BROOKFIELD I want to thank you for them again  --  and to ask you how far you go  --  with the men that wrote them  --  especially the second one . Do you believe that book ? p. 74 JUSTICE PRENTICE Yes . BROOKFIELD You do ? JUSTICE PRENTICE I do . I know the man who wrote it  --  and I believe him . BROOKFIELD Did he ever do any of his stunts for you  --  that he writes about ? JUSTICE PRENTICE He did n't call them " stunts , " but he has given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BROOKFIELD For example ? JUSTICE PRENTICE For example ? He asked me to think of him steadily at some unexpected time and to think of some definite thing . A few days later  --  this room  --  two o'clock in the morning  --  I concentrated my thoughts  --  I mentally pictured him going to his telephone and calling me . BROOKFIELD And did he do it ? JUSTICE PRENTICE No  --  ( pause )  --  but he came here at my breakfast hour and told me that at two o'clock he had waked and risen from his bed  --  and walked to his ' phone in the hallway with an impulse to call me  --  and then had stopped  --  because he had no message to deliver and because he thought his imagination might be tricking him . BROOKFIELD You had n't given him any tip , such as asking him how he ' d slept ? p. 75 JUSTICE PRENTICE None . Five nights after that I repeated the experiment . BROOKFIELD Well ? JUSTICE PRENTICE That time he called me . BROOKFIELD What did he say ? JUSTICE PRENTICE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be in bed asleep and not disturbing honest citizens , " which was quite true . BROOKFIELD By Jove , it 's a devilish creepy business , is n't it ? JUSTICE PRENTICE Yes . BROOKFIELD And if it 's so  --  JUSTICE PRENTICE And it is so . BROOKFIELD Pay a man to be careful what he thinks  --  eh ? JUSTICE PRENTICE It will very well pay your type of man to do so . BROOKFIELD I do n't want to be possessed by any of these bughouse theories , but I ' ll be blamed if a few things have n't happened to me , Mr. Justice , since you started me on this subject . JUSTICE PRENTICE Along this line ? BROOKFIELD Yes . ( Pause . ) And I ' ve tried the other side of it , too . p. 76 JUSTICE PRENTICE What other side ? BROOKFIELD The mesmeric business . ( Pause . Makes passes . ) I can do it . JUSTICE PRENTICE Then I should say , Mr. Brookfield , that for you the obligation for clean and unselfish thinking was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ve put people  --  well  --  practically asleep in a chair and I ' ve made them tell me what a boy was doing  --  a mile away  --  in a jail . JUSTICE PRENTICE I see no reason to call clair-voyance a " bughouse " theory . BROOKFIELD I only know that I do it . JUSTICE PRENTICE Yes  --  you have the youth for it  --  the glorious strength . Does it make any demand on your vitality ? BROOKFIELD ( Passes hand over his eyes . ) I ' ve fancied that a headache to which I ' m subject is more frequent  --  that 's all . JUSTICE PRENTICE But you find the ability  --  the power  --  increases  --  do n't you ? BROOKFIELD Yes  --  in the last month I ' ve put a man into a hypnotic sleep with half a dozen waves of the hand . ( Makes pass. ) p. 77 JUSTICE PRENTICE Why any motion ? BROOKFIELD Fixed his attention , I suppose . JUSTICE PRENTICE ( Shaking head . ) Fixes your attention . When in your own mind your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Another slight pass . ) BROOKFIELD I wo n't ? JUSTICE PRENTICE No . BROOKFIELD What ' ll I do ? JUSTICE PRENTICE Simply think . ( Pause . ) You have a headache , for example . BROOKFIELD I have a headache for a fact . ( JACK again passes hand over eyes and forehead . ) JUSTICE PRENTICE Well  --  some persons could cure it by rubbing your forehead . BROOKFIELD I know that . JUSTICE PRENTICE Others could cure it by the passes of the hypnotist . Others by simply willing that it should  --  ( Pause )  --  be cured . BROOKFIELD Well , that 's where I ca n't follow you  --  and your friend the author . JUSTICE PRENTICE You simply think your headache . p. 78 BROOKFIELD I know it aches . JUSTICE PRENTICE I think it does n't . BROOKFIELD ( Astonished . ) What ? JUSTICE PRENTICE I  --  think  --  it does n't . BROOKFIELD ( Pause . ) Well , Just this moment , it does n't , but  --  ( Pause )  --  is n't that  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JUSTICE PRENTICE It wo n't come back to-day . BROOKFIELD That 's some comfort . The blamed things have made it busy for me since I ' ve been studying this business . JUSTICE PRENTICE It is a two-edged sword  --  BROOKFIELD You mean it 's bad for a man who tries it ? JUSTICE PRENTICE I mean that it constantly opens to the investigator new mental heights , higher planes  --  and every man , Mr. Brookfield , is ill in some manner who lives habitually on a lower level  --  than the light he sees . ( Enter SERVANT . ) SERVANT Two ladies , sir . JUSTICE PRENTICE Your friends ? p. 79 BROOKFIELD I think so . ( PRENTICE and JACK look at SERVANT . ) SERVANT Yes , sir . JUSTICE PRENTICE Ask them up . ( Exit SERVANT . ) BROOKFIELD Thank you . JUSTICE PRENTICE ( Rises . ) I ' ll put away Judge Henderson 's glass . BROOKFIELD They ' re Kentucky ladies , Mr. Justice . JUSTICE PRENTICE ( Indicating JACK . ) But I do n't want any credit for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Enter SERVANT with HELEN and VIOLA . ) BROOKFIELD My niece , Miss Campbell . JUSTICE PRENTICE Miss Campbell . BROOKFIELD And  --  HELEN One moment , Jack , I prefer to introduce myself . JUSTICE PRENTICE Wo n't you be seated , ladies ? ( Exit SERVANT . HELEN sits right of table . VIOLA goes to the window-seat . JACK stands center. ) p. 80 HELEN You are not a married man , Justice Prentice ? JUSTICE PRENTICE I am not . HELEN But you have the reputation of being a very charitable one . JUSTICE PRENTICE ( Sits left of table . ) That 's pleasant to hear  --  what charity do you represent ? HELEN None . I hardly know how to tell you my object . JUSTICE PRENTICE It 's a personal matter , is it ? BROOKFIELD ( Back of table . ) Yes , a very personal matter . JUSTICE PRENTICE Ah ! HELEN I have here an autograph book  --  JUSTICE PRENTICE ( To JACK . ) I usually sign my autograph for those who wish it  --  at the  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prentice , I have brought one . JUSTICE PRENTICE Well , I do n't go in for that kind of thing very much . I have no collection  --  my taste runs more toward  --  HELEN The autograph I have brought is one of yours , written may years ago . It is signed to a letter . Will you look at it ? ( Opens autograph book and gives small folded and old lace handkerchief from book to VIOLA , who joins her. ) p. 81 JUSTICE PRENTICE With pleasure . ( Takes book . ) Is this the letter ? Ah  --  ( Reads . ) " June 15 , 1860 . " Dear me , that 's a long time ago . ( Reads . ) " My dear Margaret : The matter passed satisfactorily  --  a mere scratch . Boland apologized.  --  Jim . " What is this ? HELEN A letter from you . JUSTICE PRENTICE And my dear Margaret  --  1860 . Why , this letter  --  was it written to Margaret ? HELEN To Margaret Price  --  JUSTICE PRENTICE Is it possible  --  well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what we call coincidences are ever mere coincidences . Margaret Price . Her name was on my lips a moment ago . BROOKFIELD Really , Mr. Justice ? JUSTICE PRENTICE ( To JACK . ) Yes . Did you know Margaret Price ? BROOKFIELD Yes . ( Looks at HELEN  --  PRENTICE 'S gaze follows . ) HELEN She was my mother  --  JUSTICE PRENTICE Margaret Price was  --  HELEN Was my mother . p. 82 JUSTICE PRENTICE Why , I was just speaking of her to Justice Henderson whom you saw go out . Her picture dropped from the table here . ( Gets it . ) This miniature ! Margaret Price gave it to me herself . And you are her daughter ? HELEN Yes , Justice Prentice . JUSTICE PRENTICE Yes , I can see the likeness . At twenty you must have looked very like this miniature . ( Passes miniature to HELEN . ) HELEN ( As JACK and VIOLA look at miniature . ) I have photographs of myself that are very like this . ( To PRENTICE . ) And you were speaking of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  --  But be seated , please . ( VIOLA sits again at window . ) I ' m very delighted to have you call . HELEN Even at such an hour ? JUSTICE PRENTICE At any hour . Margaret Price was a very dear friend of mine ; and to think , you ' re her daughter . And this letter 1860  --  what 's this ? HELEN Oh , do n't touch that . It will break . It 's only a dry spray of mignonette , pinned to the note when you sent it . p. 83 JUSTICE PRENTICE ( Musingly . ) A spray of mignonette . HELEN My mother 's favorite flower and perfume . JUSTICE PRENTICE I remember . Well , well , this is equally astonishing . BROOKFIELD Do you remember the letter , Mr. Justice ? JUSTICE PRENTICE Perfectly . BROOKFIELD And the circumstances it alludes to ? JUSTICE PRENTICE Yes . It was the work of a romantic boy . I  --  I was very fond of your mother , Mrs.  --  by the way , you have n't told me your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be Margaret Price 's daughter for the present . JUSTICE PRENTICE Very well . Oh , this was a little scratch of a duel  --  they 've gone out of fashion now , I ' m thankful to say . HELEN Do you remember the cause of this one ? JUSTICE PRENTICE Yes ; Henry Boland had worried Margaret some way . She was frightened , I think , and fainted . HELEN And you struck him ? JUSTICE PRENTICE Yes , and he challenged me. p. 84 HELEN I ' ve heard mother tell it . Do you remember what frightened her ? JUSTICE PRENTICE I do n't believe I do . Does the letter say ? HELEN No . Try to think . JUSTICE PRENTICE Was it a snake or a toad ? HELEN No  --  a jewel . JUSTICE PRENTICE A jewel ? I remember now  --  a  --  a  --  cat's-eye . A cat's-eye jewel , was n't it ? HELEN ( With excitement . ) Yes , yes , yes . ( Weeping . ) JUSTICE PRENTICE My dear madam , it seems to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ' ve so hoped you would remember it . On the cars I was praying all the way you would remember it . And you do  --  you do . JUSTICE PRENTICE I do . VIOLA ( Comes to HELEN . ) Compose yourself , dear . Remember what depends on it . JUSTICE PRENTICE It is evidently something in which I can aid you . HELEN It is  --  and you will ? JUSTICE PRENTICE There is nothing I would not do for a daughter of Margaret Price . You are in mourning , dear lady ; is it for your mother ? p. 85 HELEN For my son . JUSTICE PRENTICE ( To JACK . ) How long has he been dead ? HELEN He is not dead . Justice Prentice , my boy  --  the grandson of Margaret Price  --  is under a sentence of death . JUSTICE PRENTICE Sentence of death ? HELEN Yes . I am the mother of Clay Whipple . JUSTICE PRENTICE ( Rises . ) But , madam  --  . HELEN He is to die . I come  --  JUSTICE PRENTICE ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself . The case of Whipple is before the Supreme Court of the United States . I am a member of that body  --  I can not listen to you . HELEN You must . JUSTICE PRENTICE You are prejudicing his chances . ( To JACK . ) You are making it necessary for me to rule against him . ( To HELEN . ) My dear madam , for the sake of your boy , do not do this . It is unlawful  --  without dignity or precedent . ( To JACK . ) If the lady were not the mother of the boy I should call your conduct base  --  p. 86 VIOLA But she is his mother . HELEN ( Following . ) And Justice Prentice , I am the daughter of the woman you loved . JUSTICE PRENTICE I beg you to be silent . BROOKFIELD Wo n't you hear us a moment ? JUSTICE PRENTICE I can not . I dare not  --  I must leave you . ( Going . ) VIOLA Why ? JUSTICE PRENTICE I have explained  --  the matter is before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . HELEN I wo n't talk of the question before your court . That , our attorneys tell us , is a constitutional point . JUSTICE PRENTICE That is its attitude . HELEN I will not talk of that . I wish to speak of this letter . BROOKFIELD You can listen to that , ca n't you , Mr. Justice ? JUSTICE PRENTICE Do you hope for its influence indirectly ? HELEN No ; sit down , Justice Prentice , and compose yourself . I will talk calmly to you . JUSTICE PRENTICE My dear madam , my heart bleeds for you . ( To JACK . ) Her agony must be past judicial measurement . p. 87 BROOKFIELD Only God knows , sir ! ( HELEN sits at table ; VIOLA stands by her side ; PRENTICE sits by the fire ; JACK remains standing . ) HELEN ( Pause . ) Justice Prentice . JUSTICE PRENTICE Mrs. Whipple . HELEN You remember this letter  --  you have recalled the duel . You remember  --  thank God  --  its cause ? JUSTICE PRENTICE I do . HELEN You know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an insanity ? JUSTICE PRENTICE I remember that . HELEN I inherited that aversion . When a child , the sight of one of them would throw me almost into convulsions . JUSTICE PRENTICE Is it possible ? HELEN It is true . The physicians said I would outgrow the susceptibility , and in a measure I did so . But I discovered that Clay had inherited the fatal dislike from me . BROOKFIELD You can understand that , Mr. Justice ? JUSTICE PRENTICE Medical jurisprudence is full of such cases . Why should we deny them ? Is nature faithful only in physical matters ? You are like this portrait . Your voice is that of Margaret Price . Nature 's behest should have also embraced some of the less apparent possessions , I think . p. 88 BROOKFIELD We urged all that at the trial , but they called it invention . JUSTICE PRENTICE Nothing seems more probable to me . HELEN Clay , my boy , had that dreadful and unreasonable fear of the jewel . I protected him as far as possible , but one night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finding that the sight of this stone annoyed him , pressed it upon his attention . He did not know , Justice Prentice , he was not responsible . It was insanity , but he struck his tormentor and the blow resulted in the young man 's death . JUSTICE PRENTICE Terrible  --  terrible ! HELEN My poor boy is crushed with the awful deed . He is not a murderer . He was never that , but they have sentenced him , Justice Prentice  --  he  --  is to die . ( Rises impulsively . ) BROOKFIELD ( Catching her . ) Now  --  now  --  my dear Helen , compose yourself . VIOLA ( Embracing her . ) You promised . HELEN Yes , yes , I will . ( VIOLA leads HELEN aside . ) JUSTICE PRENTICE All this was ably presented to the trial court , you say ? p. 89 BROOKFIELD By the best attorneys . JUSTICE PRENTICE And the verdict ? BROOKFIELD Still was guilty . But , Mr. Justice , the sentiment of the community has changed very much since then . We feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our lawyers decided to go to the Supreme Court , I remembered some letters of yours in this old book . Can you imagine my joy when I found the letter was on the very point of this inherited trait on which we rested our defense ? BROOKFIELD We have ridden twenty-four hours to reach you . The train came in only at ten o'clock . HELEN You  --  you are not powerless to help me . What is an official duty to a mother 's love ? To the life of my boy ? JUSTICE PRENTICE My dear , dear madam , that is not necessary  --  believe me . This letter comes very properly under the head of new evidence . ( To JACK . ) The defendant is entitled to a rehearing on that . HELEN Justice Prentice ! Justice Prentice ! ( Turns again to VIOLA . ) VIOLA There  --  there  --  ( Comforts HELEN. ) p. 90 JUSTICE PRENTICE Of course that is n't before us , but when we remand the case on this constitutional point  --  HELEN Then you will  --  you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henderson had convinced me on the point as you called . So I think there is no doubt of the decision . HELEN You can never know the light you let into my heart . ( VIOLA . returns the lace handkerchief to the book which HELEN opens for the purpose , closing it again on the handkerchief . ) JUSTICE PRENTICE What is that perfume ? Have you one about you ? HELEN Yes , on this handkerchief . JUSTICE PRENTICE What is it ? HELEN Mignonette . JUSTICE PRENTICE Mignonette . HELEN A favorite perfume of mother 's . This handkerchief of hers was in the book with the letter . JUSTICE PRENTICE Indeed . HELEN Oh , Justice Prentice , do you think I can save my boy ? JUSTICE PRENTICE ( To JACK . ) On the rehearing I will take pleasure in testifying as to this hereditary aversion  --  and what I knew of its existence in Margaret Price . p. 91 BROOKFIELD May I tell the lawyers so ? JUSTICE PRENTICE No . They will learn it in the court to-morrow . They can stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's heart . HELEN Comfort . It is life ! JUSTICE PRENTICE ( To JACK . ) Say nothing of this call , if you please . Nothing to any one . BROOKFIELD We shall respect your instructions , Mr. Justice . My niece , who has been with Mrs. Whipple during this trouble , is the fiance of the boy who is in jail . JUSTICE PRENTICE You have my sympathy , too , my dear . VIOLA Thank you . ( Goes to PRENTICE and gives him her hand . ) JUSTICE PRENTICE And now good-night . VIOLA Good-night . ( Goes to door where JACK joins her . ) HELEN Good-night , Justice Prentice . You must know my gratitude  --  words can not tell it . ( Exit VIOLA . ) JUSTICE PRENTICE Would you do me a favor ? HELEN Can you ask it ? ( JACK waits at the door. ) p. 92 JUSTICE PRENTICE If that was the handkerchief of Margaret Price , I ' d like to have it .

ALICE One man ? BROOKFIELD Yes . ALICE Out of a jury of twelve . BROOKFIELD One man can stop the other eleven from bringing in an adverse verdict  --  and this one is with us . ALICE Would your going to Helen and Viola in the court-house stop his being with us ? BROOKFIELD Perhaps not , but it would stop my being with him . p. 95 ALICE What ? ( Looks about . ) I do n't understand you . BROOKFIELD Justice Prentice told me that he could sit alone in his room and make another man get up and walk to the telephone and call him by simply thinking steadily of that other man .

BROOKFIELD ( Inquiringly . ) That night , a month ago , when you rapped at my door at two o'clock in the morning and asked if I was ill in any way ? p. 96 ALICE I was simply nervous about you . BROOKFIELD Call it " nervousness " if you wish to  --  but that was an experiment of mine  --  a simple experiment . ALICE Oh ! BROOKFIELD Two Sundays ago you went right up to the church door  --  hesitated , and turned home again . ALICE Lots of people do that .

BROOKFIELD That you knew it ? No . That you planned it and arranged and procured his assassination .

As revenge for her refusal and mine , you ' ve persecuted through two trials the boy she loved , and the son of the woman whose thought regulates the pulse of my heart , an innocent , unfortunate boy . In your ambition you ' ve reached out to be the governor of this State , and an honored political party is seriously considering you for that office to-day . HARDMUTH That Scovill story 's a lie  --  a political lie . I think you mean to be honest , Jack Brookfield , but somebody 's strung you . BROOKFIELD Wait !

I did n't salute him because I resent his disrespectful treatment of myself during his cross-examination . HARDMUTH Entirely within my rights as a lawyer and  --  JUSTICE PRENTICE Entirely  --  and never within the opportunities of a gentleman . HARDMUTH Your side foresaw the powerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member of the Supreme Court , and my wish to break that  --  JUSTICE PRENTICE Was quite apparent , sir ,  --  quite apparent ,  --  but the testimony of every man is entitled to just such weight and consideration as that man 's character commands . But it is not that disrespect which I resent . I am an old man  --  That I am unmarried  --  childless  --  without a son to inherit the vigor that time has reclaimed , is due to  --  a sentiment that you endeavored to ridicule , Mr. Hardmuth , a sentiment which would have been sacred in the hands of any true Kentuckian , which I am glad to hear you are not . p. 101 BROOKFIELD That 's all . HARDMUTH Perhaps not . ( Exit . ) JUSTICE PRENTICE My dear Mr. Brookfield , that man certainly has n't seen this newspaper ? BROOKFIELD No  --  but he knows it 's coming .

BROOKFIELD An appeal to the governor  --  for elemency . ALICE Well ? BROOKFIELD Then we delay things until a new governor comes in . But suppose that new governor is Hardmuth himself ?

BROOKFIELD Because until now I lacked the character and the moral courage . I spring it now by the advice of Justice Prentice to reach that convention at Frankfort . ELLINGER Well , you reached them . JUSTICE PRENTICE The convention was only a secondary consideration with me  --  my real object was this jury with whom Mr. Hardmuth seemed too powerful . p. 111 ELLINGER Reach the jury ?

BROOKFIELD Now , my boy , drop your hatred of Hardmuth as you drop your fear of the scarf-pin . Do n't look back  --  your life 's ahead of you . Do n't mount for the race over-weight . ( Enter JO . ) JO Mr. Ellinger . ( Enter LEW . ) ELLINGER I do n't intrude , do I ? BROOKFIELD Come in . ELLINGER ( To LADIES . ) Good-evening , Ah , Clay . ( Shakes hands with CLAY . ) Glad to see you looking so well . Glad to see you in such good company . ( To JACK , briskly . ) I ' ve got him . BROOKFIELD Got whom ? p. 129 ELLINGER Hardmuth . ( To LADIES . ) Detectives been hunting him all day , you know . HELEN He 's caught , you say ? ELLINGER No  --  but I ' ve treed him  --  ( to JACK. )  --  and I thought I ' d just have a word with you before passing the tip . ( To LADIES . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raids and closing laws , and I see a chance to get even . BROOKFIELD In what way ? ELLINGER They ' ve been after him nearly twenty-four hours  --  morning paper 's going to offer a reward for him , and I understand the State will also . If I had a little help I ' d hide him for a day or two and then surrender him for those rewards . BROOKFIELD Where is Hardmuth ? ( Sits at table . ) ELLINGER Hiding . BROOKFIELD ( Writing a note . ) Naturally . ELLINGER You remember Big George ? BROOKFIELD The darkey ? ELLINGER Yes  --  used to be on the door at Phil Kelly 's ? BROOKFIELD Yes . p. 130 ELLINGER He 's there . In Big George 's cottage  --  long story  --  Big George 's wife  --  that is , she  --  well , his wife used to be pantry maid for Hardmuth 's mother . When they raided Kelly 's game , Big George pretended to turn State 's evidence , but he really hates Hardmuth like a rattler  --  so it all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' d win a couple of hundred at Kelly 's I used to slip George a ten going out . Your luck always stays by you if you divide a little with a nigger or a humpback  --  and in Louisville it 's easier to find a nigger  --  so  --  BROOKFIELD He 's there now ? ELLINGER Yes . He wants to get away . He 's got two guns and he ' ll shoot before he gives up  --  so I ' d have to con him some way . George 's wife is to open the door to Kelly 's old signal , you remember  --  ( raps )  --  one knock , then two , and then one . BROOKFIELD Where is the cottage ? ELLINGER Number 7 Jackson Street  --  little dooryard  --  border of arbor-vit on the path . BROOKFIELD One knock  --  then two  --  and then one  --  ( Rises with note written . ) ELLINGER What you gonta do ? BROOKFIELD Send for him . p. 131 ELLINGER Who you gonta send ? BROOKFIELD That boy there . CLAY Me ? BROOKFIELD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And my niece . VIOLA What ! To arrest a man ? BROOKFIELD ( To CLAY . ) My machine is at the door . Give Hardmuth this note . He ' ll come with you quietly . Bring him here . We ' ll decide what to do with him after that . ALICE I ca n't allow Viola on such an errand . BROOKFIELD When the man she 's promised to marry is going into danger  --  VIOLA If Mr. Hardmuth will come for that note  --  why ca n't I deliver it ? BROOKFIELD You may  --  it Clay ' ll let you . CLAY ( Quietly taking note as JACK offers it to VIOLA . ) I ' ll hand it to him . BROOKFIELD I hope so . ( Gives goggles and coat . ) Take these  --  remember  --  one rap , then two , then one . CLAY I understand  --  number seven  --  ? p. 132 ELLINGER Jackson Street . ALICE I protest . HELEN So do I. BROOKFIELD ( To CLAY and VIOLA . ) You ' re both of age . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hardmuth the goggles , nobody ' ll recognize him and with a lady beside him you ' ll get him safely here . CLAY Come . ( Exit with VIOLA . ) ELLINGER ( Following to door . ) I ought to be in the party . BROOKFIELD No  --  you stay here . ALICE That 's scandalous . BROOKFIELD But none of us will start the scandal , will we ? HELEN Clay knows nothing of that kind of work  --  a man with two guns  --  think of it . BROOKFIELD After he 's walked barehanded up to a couple of guns a few times , he ' ll quit fearing men that are armed only with a scarf-pin . HELEN ( Hysterically . ) It 's cruel to keep constantly referring to that  --  that  --  mistake of Clay 's  --  I want to forget it . BROOKFIELD ( Going to HELEN . Tenderly . ) The way to forget it , my dear Helen , is not to guard it as a sensitive spot in your memory , but to grasp it as the wise ones grasp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one courageous contact . We think things are calamities and trials and sorrows  --  only names . They are spiritual gymnastics and have an eternal value when once you front them and make them crouch at your feet . Say once for all to your soul and thereby to the world  --  " Yes , my boy killed a man  --  because I ' d brought him up a half-effeminate , hysterical weakling , but he 's been through the fire and I ' ve been through the fire , and we ' re both the better for it . " p. 133 HELEN I can say that truthfully , but I do n't want to make a policeman of him , just the same . ( Exit to dining-room . ) ALICE ( Following . ) Your treatment 's a little too heroic , Jack . ( Exit . ) ELLINGER Think they ' ll fetch him ? BROOKFIELD ( Sits left of table . ) Yes . ELLINGER He ' ll come , of course , if he does , under the idea that you ' ll help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pretty hard double-cross , but he deserves it . I ' ve got a note of fifteen thousand to meet to-morrow , or , damn it , I do n't think I ' d fancy this man-hunting . I put up some Louisville-Nashville bonds for security , and the holder of the note ' ll be only too anxious to pinch ' em . BROOKFIELD You ca n't get your rewards in time for that . ELLINGER I know  --  and that 's one reason I come to you , Jack . If you see I ' m in a fair way to get a reward  --  BROOKFIELD I ' ll lend you money , Lew . ELLINGER Thank you . ( Jack takes checkbook and writes . ) I thought you would . If I lose those bonds they ' ll have me selling programs for a livin ' at a grandstand . You see , I thought hatin ' Hardmuth as you do , and your reputation bein ' up through that stuff to the papers  --  p. 134 BROOKFIELD There . ( Gives check . ) ELLINGER Thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to you in a week . BROOKFIELD ( Rises . ) You need n't . ELLINGER What ? BROOKFIELD You need n't hand it back . It 's only fifteen thousand and you ' ve lost a hundred of them at poker in these rooms . ELLINGER Never belly-ached , did I ? BROOKFIELD Never  --  but you do n't owe me that fifteen . ELLINGER Rot ! I ' m no baby  --  square game , was n't it ? BROOKFIELD Perfectly . ELLINGER And I ' ll sit in a square game any time I get a chance . BROOKFIELD I know , Lew , all about that . ELLINGER I ' ll play you for this fifteen right away . ( Displays check . ) BROOKFIELD No . ( Walks aside . ) ELLINGER Ai n't had a game in three weeks  --  and , besides , I think my luck 's changin ' ? When Big George told me about Hardmuth I took George 's hand before I thought what I was doin '  --  and you know what shakin ' hands with a nigger does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LEW 'S plea . ) No , thank you , Lew . ELLINGER My money 's good as anybody else 's , ai n't it ? BROOKFIELD Just as good , but  --  ELLINGER It ai n't a phoney check , is it ? ( Examines check . ) BROOKFIELD The check 's all right . ELLINGER ( Taunting . ) Losing your nerves ? BROOKFIELD No ( pause )  --  suppose you shuffle those and deal a hand . ( Indicates small table , right . ) ELLINGER That 's like old times ; what is it  --  stud-horse or draw ? ( Sits at table . ) BROOKFIELD ( Goes to fireplace . ) Draw if you say so . ELLINGER I cut ' em ? BROOKFIELD You cut them . ELLINGER ( Dealing two poker hands . ) Table stakes  --  check goes for a thousand . BROOKFIELD That suits me. p. 136 ELLINGER ( Taking his own cards . ) Sit down . BROOKFIELD ( At other side of room looking into fire . ) I do n't need to sit down just yet . ELLINGER As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ELLINGER Yes ? BROOKFIELD ( Pause . ) Do you happen to have three queens ? ( LEW looks at JACK , then carefully at back of his own cards , then at the deck . ) ELLINGER Well , I ca n't see it . BROOKFIELD No use looking  --  they 're not marked . ELLINGER Well , I shuffled ' m all right . BROOKFIELD Yes . ELLINGER And cut ' m ? ( JACK nods . ) Could n't a been a cold deck ? BROOKFIELD No . ELLINGER Then , how did you know I had three queens ? BROOKFIELD I did n't know it . I just thought you had . ELLINGER Can you do it again ? p. 137 BROOKFIELD I do n't know . Draw one card . ELLINGER ( Drawing one card from deck . ) All right . BROOKFIELD ( Pause . ) Is it the ace of hearts ? ELLINGER It is . BROOKFIELD Mm  --  turns me into a rotter , does n't it ? ( Comes gloomily to the big table . ) ELLINGER Can you do that every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is , consciously . I ' ve always had luck and I thought it was because I took chanees on a game  --  same as any player  --  but that do n't look like it , does it ? ELLINGER Beats me . BROOKFIELD And what a monster it makes of me  --  these years I ' ve been in the business . ELLINGER You say you did n't know it before ? BROOKFIELD I did n't know it  --  no  --  but  --  some things have happened lately that have made me think it might be so ; that jury yesterday  --  some facts I ' ve had from Justice Prentice . Telepathy of a very common kind  --  and I guess it 's used in a good many games , old man , we are n't on to . p. 138 ELLINGER Well  --  have you told anybody ? BROOKFIELD No . ELLINGER ( Excitedly . ) . Good ! ( Rises and comes to JACK . ) Now , see here , Jack , if you can do that right along I know a game in Cincinnati @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children . BROOKFIELD Good God ! you ' re not suggesting that I keep it up ? ELLINGER Do n't over-do it  --  no  --  ( Pause . ) Or you show me the trick and I 'll collect all right . BROOKFIELD ( Slowly . ) Lew  --  ( Pause . ) Some of the fellows I ' ve won from in this house have gone over to the park and blown their heads off . ELLINGER Some of the fellows anybody wins from in any house go somewhere and blow their heads off . ( Pause . ) BROOKFIELD True  --  ELLINGER Three queens  --  before the draw  --  well , you could ' a ' had me all right  --  and you wo n't tell me how you do it ? BROOKFIELD I do n't know how I do it ; the thought just comes to my mind stronger than any other thought . p. 139 ELLINGER ( Reprovingly . ) God A'mighty gives you a mind like that and you wo n't go with me to Cincinnati . ( Goes to card table ; studies cards . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sah . BROOKFIELD Ask him to step up here . JO Yes , sah . ( Exit . ) BROOKFIELD ( Goes to door , left . ) Alice  --  Helen  --  Justice Prentice has called ; I ' d like you to join us . ELLINGER Can the old man call a hand like that , too ? BROOKFIELD I ' m sure he could . ELLINGER And  --  are there others ? BROOKFIELD I believe there are a good many others who unconsciously have the same ability . ELLINGER Well , it 's a God 's blessin ' there 's a sucker born every minute . I ' m a widow and an orphan ' longside o ' that . ( Throws cards in disgust onto table . ) ( Enter ALICE and HELEN . ) ALICE Been losing , Mr. Ellinger ? p. 140 ELLINGER Losing ? I just saved fifteen thousand I was gonta throw ' way like sand in a rathole . I ' m a babe eatin ' spoon victuals and only gettin ' half at that .

HELEN Where 's Clay ? VIOLA Downstairs . Good-evening . JUSTICE PRENTICE Good-evening . BROOKFIELD ( To others . ) Pardon . ( To VIOLA . ) Did the  --  gentleman come with you ? VIOLA Yes . ( LEW flutters and shows excitement . ) BROOKFIELD Wo n't you ask Clay , my dear , to take him through the lower hall and into the dining-room until I ' m at liberty ? VIOLA Certainly . ( Exit . ) JUSTICE PRENTICE I am keeping you from other appointments ? p. 141 BROOKFIELD Nothing that ca n't wait . JUSTICE PRENTICE I am leaving for Washington in the morning . BROOKFIELD We ' ll all be at the train to see you off . JUSTICE PRENTICE That 's good , because I should like to say good-bye to  --  to the young people  --  I can see them there  --  I sha n't see you then , Mr. Ellinger  --  ( Goes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Good-bye , Judge  --  you  --  you ' ve given me more of a " turn over " than you know . JUSTICE PRENTICE Really ? ELLINGER I ' d a saved two hundred thousand dollars if I ' d ' a ' met you thirty years ago . JUSTICE PRENTICE Well , that 's only about six thousand a year , is n't it ? ELLINGER That 's so  --  and , damn it , I have lived . ( Smiles  --  looks dreamily into the past . ) JUSTICE PRENTICE Good-night . ( Exit PRENTICE . ) BROOKFIELD Good-night  --  good-night . ALICE Is that Hardmuth in there ? ( Points to dining-room. ) p. 142 BROOKFIELD Yes . ALICE I do n't want to see him . BROOKFIELD Very well , dear , I ' ll excuse you . ALICE ( Going . ) Come , Helen . BROOKFIELD ( At door , left . ) Come in . ( To HELEN , who is going with ALICE . ) Helen ! I ' d like you to stay . HELEN Me ? BROOKFIELD Yes . ( Exit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VIOLA . VIOLA lays automobile coat on sofa . HARDMUTH bows to HELEN . HELEN bows . ) BROOKFIELD Your mother has just left us , Viola . You ' d better join her . VIOLA Very well . BROOKFIELD ( Taking her hand as she passes him . ) And I want you to know  --  I appreciate very much , my dear , your going on this errand for me  --  you ' re the right stuff .

HARDMUTH When ? BROOKFIELD Whenever you ' re ready . HARDMUTH I ' m ready now . BROOKFIELD Then I ' ll help you now . ELLINGER Now ? BROOKFIELD Yes . HELEN Does n't that render you liable in some way , Jack , to the law ? BROOKFIELD Yes  --  but I ' ve been liable to the law in some way for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You go down and tell the chauffeur to leave the machine and walk home . I ' m going to run it myself and I ' ll turn it in . CLAY Yes , sir . ( Exit . ) HARDMUTH You ' re going to run it your-self ? BROOKFIELD Yes . HARDMUTH Where to ? BROOKFIELD Across the river , if that 's agreeable to you  --  or any place you name . HARDMUTH Is anybody  --  waiting for you  --  across the river ? p. 144 BROOKFIELD No . HARDMUTH ( Again with note . ) This is all on the level ? BROOKFIELD Completely . ELLINGER Why , I think you mean that . BROOKFIELD I do . ELLINGER ( Aggressively . ) But I ' ve got something to say , have n't I ? BROOKFIELD I hope not . ELLINGER ( Quitting . ) If you ' re in earnest , of course . But I do n't see your game . BROOKFIELD I ' m not fully convinced of Mr. Hardmuth 's guilt . ELLINGER Why , he 's running away ? ( Enter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd make against me , but I ' m not guilty in any degree . BROOKFIELD I want to do this thing for you , Frank  --  do n't make it too difficult by any lying .

BROOKFIELD Because the three queens and the ace were in your mind . ELLINGER I do n't see any other explanation . BROOKFIELD Suppose , instead of the cards there ' d been in your mind a well-developed plan of assassination  --  the picture of a murder  --  p. 146 ELLINGER Did you drop to him that way ? BROOKFIELD No . Raynor told me all I know of Hardmuth  --  but here 's the very hell of it . Long before Scovill was killed I thought he deserved killing and I thought it could be done just  --  as  --  it  --  was done . HELEN Jack ! BROOKFIELD I never breathed a word of it to a living soul , but Hardmuth planned it exactly as I dreamed it  --  and by God , a guilty thought is almost as criminal as a guilty deed . I ' ve always had a considerable influence over that poor devil that 's running away to-night , and I ' m not sure that before the Judge of both of us the guilt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jack , dear , perfectly morbid .

( Change of manner to brisk command . ) I ' m going to help him over the line  --  the roads are watched , but the police wo n't suspect me and they wo n't suspect Lew  --  and all the less if there 's a lady with us  --  ( To LEW . ) Will you go ? p. 147 ELLINGER The limit . BROOKFIELD Get a heavy coat from Jo . ELLINGER Yes . ( Exit . ) BROOKFIELD ( Alone with HELEN . ) You know you said I used to be able to make you write to me when I was a boy at college ? HELEN Yes . BROOKFIELD And you were a thousand miles away  --  while this fellow  --  Hardmuth  --  was just at my elbow half the time . HELEN It ca n't help you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know it , and make what amend I can . Will you go with me while I put this poor devil over the line ? HELEN ( Taking VIOLA 'S fur coat . ) Yes , I ' ll go with you . BROOKFIELD Helen , you stood by your boy in a fight for his life . HELEN Did n't you ? BROOKFIELD Will you stand by me while I make my fight ? HELEN ( Giving her hand . ) You ' ve made your fight , Jack , and you ' ve won .
