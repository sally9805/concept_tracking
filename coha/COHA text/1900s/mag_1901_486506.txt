' Modern Athens , ' by George Horton - , ( Charles Scribner 's Sons ) , is a very attractive little volume of 90 pages , which skims off the surface of Athenian life and scenes , without the slightest odor of the guide-book . The illustrations , by Mr. Lin-son , give the touch of poetry which the author has felt and expressed with so much sprightliness and delicacy . Along with this should be mentioned with high praise a short tale by the same author , The Tempting of Father Anthony ' ( Chicago : A. C. McClurg Co. ) , which deals with the peasants and monasteries of the Peloponnesus , and has caught to perfection the spirit and humors of the idyllic life it describes . The selfish novel-reader who cares nothing about Greece , and is bent simply on his hour of enjoyment , will find it here , and may be ensnared into doubling it by a second reading , while the old traveller who can not shake off the spell of that leisurely rustic life , set against enchanting landscapes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so vivacious and so sympathetic , so full of intimate knowledge and kindly observation . The Queen 's Comrade : The Life and Times of Sarah , Duchess of Marlborough , ' by Fitzgerald Molloy ( London : Hutchinson &; Co. ; New York : Dodd , Mead &; Co. ) , in two handsome volumes , is another of the contributions to the biography of the Revolution and the reign of Queen Anne so numerous of late . The first and greatest Duchess of Marlborough doubtless deserves a biography quite as much ? as some of her contemporaries thus honored , for she was an important if not a great figure in a critical period of English history , and had an influence on the course of events which was none the less decisive because it was not recognized by the Constitution . It is , however , doubtful , considering her character and position , whether she deserved just such a biography as this . Mr. Molloy has taken as his peculiar province in his earlier volumes the back stairs , the stage , and the half-woild , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he has achieved what there was to achieve . In the present case , as with its predecessors , he can hardly be regarded seriously as either an historian or a biographer ; nor does he probably expect to be , for these volumes add little to the illumination of the period they cover . Such history as they contain , like most history of intrigue and conspiracy , treats chiefly of things that either never happened at all , or , having happened , were of little account . For those who care greatly for gossip , even though it be two hundred years old , these volumes will prove enjoyable , for they are readable and even in places entertaining , and fill a gap in biography even if not wisely nor well . They are beautiful pieces of bookmaking . In one department Mr. Molloy does indeed excel . A budding historical novelist might well take a page from his subheadings . The fact that , at the end of seven years , Messrs . Dodd , Mead &; Co. have found it advisable to reissue their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' with the original illustrations ( now in a single volume ) , disproves , we think , Miss Martineau 's rather haughty censure of this work . The book was never malevolent , nor , a caricature . As a study of American society it was extremely limited , as , indeed , of American life and scenery in general ; and the author 's generalizationshad seldom a sufficient basis . But her observation was keen and just , and her descriptions lively and engaging . She has history to relate , and it will be long before Americans can cease to read her without profit . The Spinster Book , ' by Myrtle Reed ( G. P. Putnam 's Sons ) , is a series of short essays on such subjects as " The Natural History of Proposals " and " The Consolations of Spinsterhood . " A genius with the gift of humor might conceivably raise both themes into the plane of literature . How far Miss Reed 's handling of this delicate material justifies her attempt to entertain and instruct , may be judged by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which compares with a man 's shoulder ; almost any man will do at a critical moment ; but the clavicle of a lover is by far the most desirable " ( p. 30 ) . Again , from p. 90 , " Food properly served will attract a proposal at almost any time , especially if it is known that the pleasing viands were of the girl 's own making . " The most charming covers nowadays enclose , too often , such rubbish as this , not worth the paper on which it is printed , so that we are learning to look with distrust on new books with ornate bindings  --  a distrust amply justified in the present instance . Miss H. E. Hersey is well known as an educator of New England girls . It is to be hoped that her imaginary letters ' To Girls ' ( Boston : Small , Maynard &; Co. ) will reach their addresses . A college woman herself , trained in the Vassar of twenty-five years ago , Miss Hersey is well-fitted to advise the younger generation . The letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " " Social Relations , " and " Personal Conduct . " They are extremely sensible- and often amusing . The girl who should meet all Miss Hersey s requirements for a gentlewoman would be a prig , but the fear of that remote contingency need not deter the school or college girl from taking to heart a few of these admirable hints for the conduct of life . The principal article in the Quarterly Statement for October of the Palestine Exploration Fund is Prof. George Adam Smith 's notes of a journey through Hauran , in which the old and the new are strangely intermingled . He chronicles the discovery of an Egyptian monument , the second only found in this trans-Jordan region , and calls attention to the large amount of freight traffic on the railway ? " grain going out , timber and cloth coming The monument has been identified as commemorating a conquest of Sell I. , the builder of the great hall of columns at Karnak .

Other subjects treated are the site of Calvary , Gen. Gordon 's " Skull Hill , " and the Resurrection . At the annual meeting it was reported that among the more important questions awaiting solution was the disposal of the dead in pre-Israelitp and early Israelite:tiaths , and the period of the introduction of iron , " a metal seemingly unirsown in the earliest periods of pie-Israelite occupation ; and the development of various implements ? knives , arrow-heads , etc. , " and the ethnological position and historical connection of the Philistines with the country . The Annual Report of the Secretary for Mines and Water Supply of Victoria for 1900 records a slight falling off of the yield of gold as compared with that of 1899 , partly attributable to the increased prosperity of other industries , which has given profitable employment to men previously engaged in working the shallow alluvial deposits , and partly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ores-wick after turning out , since it was opened up , 223,320 ounces , and paying in dividends ? 371,000 . The vital question of the ventilation of mines has received unremitting attention ; the quality of the air in the deep alluvial and quartz mines is carefully inspected , and regulations are in force which enable miners to work without danger to life or health . Serious consideration has also been given to the problem of how far mining operations under the dredging system could be permitted . It was known that many thousands of acres of auriferous land might be dredged without injury or loss to the agricultural interest , and during the year 110 acres of such land were dredged , producing 21,636 ounces of gold . Numerous maps and plans accompany this volume . The first Calendar for 1902 to reach us is that issued by R. H. Russell , in twelve oblong ribbon-bound sheets , " The Football Calendar .

With the word Kyx , odd even in the oddest ( K ) assemblage in our alphabet , the Oxford English Dictionary closes its fifth volume ( Henry Frowde ) . The preface has to tell of more colaborers in this great enterprise who have fallen by the way  --  no fewer than five ( saddest of all ) having passed on " without seeing the printed sheets of any portion of the letters at which they worked . " Dr. Fitzedward Hall 's death is lamented anew . On the other hand , fresh assistance is coming forward , in particular for the more remote languages , adoptions from which distinguish J and K , and illustrate the expansive genius of the Englishlanguage .

' " However restrained , it is this feature which makes an English dictionary a world 's thesaurus to an extent unapproachable by any other . One of the outlanders made at home by virtue of English colonization is Kangaroo , which , passing from the aboriginal name of the tanimal , has come to signify a , native of Australia , a chair , a bicycle , and a mining share . The substantive has also begotten a verb , " to jump " ; a Chicago journalist having avoided the commonplace phrase by writing of " those who kangaroo from the foregoing inferences to the conclusion .

Kodak , our American Eastman 's creation , in 1890 , lines up in appearance with the most primitive antipodal accession Another Americanism is Kerosene ( Kerosene , as Abraham Gesner would have had it in 1854 ) . Instruments of torture like Knout and Koorbash occur in this section of the Dictionary , and though the Boers ' Sjambok is neither here nor to be looked for , the Dutch Keelhauling is , and the barbarous practice was abolished in Holland only in 1853 .

The series entitled " Periods of European History " ( Macmillan ) , which has been edited by Mr. Arthur Hassan , now reaches its close with Mr. W. Allison Phillips 's ' Modern Europe . ' The set as a whole and its separate volumes are so well known to historical students in this country that we need say little about the conclusion of the work . From first to last a high level of accuracy has been maintained , and in all respects the series speaks well for the quality of historical scholarship at the English universities . We have noticed in more than one of the prefaces an apology or an explanation which was based on the plea that the period in question was long and the field wide . But , while Mr. Phillips 's predecessors have freely used the right of stating their difficulties , none of them has had such good cause as he for dwelling upon superhuman obstacles . The historian of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one has , or ever will possess . As Mr. Phillips says : " Even were all the chancelleries to yield up their jealously guarded secrets , and all private portfolios opened to students , a scientific history or modern Europe would still be an impossibility , for a hundred lives of mortal men would not suffice for the collation and comparison of the stupendous mass of documents And so the historian , collecting his materials with misgiving at second , third , and fourth hand , can often at best only make a compromise with truth " All that one can do in a case like this  --  overwhelmed by materials , closely restricted as to space , and bound by the rules of collaboration  --  is to select the main incidents , go to the best sources for the facts , and write a plain narrative . Mr Phillips has recognized his limitations , and the satisfactory character of the present book is due to the exclusion , not merely of secondary subjects , but of unreasonable aspirations . So far as Mr. Phillips can be said to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following sentence . " The attempt to establish a ' Confederation of Europe ' I have made the central interest of my book , which is mainly occupied with the history of the forces by which this beneficent purpose has been forwarded or retarded . " While we are unable to compare this volume with works like those of Fyffe , Seignobos , and Andrews , we can commend it as being an excellent sketch of political history since the Congress of Vienna ? Mr. G. W. Botsford 's ' History of the Orient and Greece ' ( The Macmillan Co. ) is an elementary handbook intended for the use of schools and academies , and furnished with sample examination-papers in the old-fashioned manner . Like Professor Mahaffy 's ' Survey of Greek Civilization , ' it endeavors to describe , in some 350 pages , Greek origins , history , art , and literature . Thus to cover the ground from the pyramid-builders and Buddha to Alexander the Great , with a glance at modern Greece , involves a summary method . Mr Botsford has , however , given the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barely indicated , by adding lists of authorities and parallel reading to every chapter The writer is well known as an historian of Greece and Rome , and we need not say that the work is , as far as it may be , scholarly and in all respects up to date . While his style lacks Mr. Mahaffy 's brilliance and vigor , his statements are on the whole more sound In a work where so much has to be left for the riper age of the student , we could have wished that Mr. Botsford had treated the shadowy but effective personality of the traditional Homer with more reverence . Plato allows certain useful fictions to be employed in the education of the young . We believe that the modern scientific view of the authorship of the Homeric poems is a counsel of perfection that should be reserved until the student has had the advantage in his greener youth of a belief in that impressive figure , the " blind man who dwells in Chios ' rocky isle " ? a conception that inspired Milton and Keats , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even some good scholars left who are willing to err with Mr. Andrew Lang rather than accept such a " Homer " as Mr. Botsford presents to the ardent youthful mind . " By the name ' Homer , ' " he says ( p. 10 ) , " we mean any one of the minstrels who helped to make either the Iliad or the Odyssey . " Keats 's sonnet on Chapman 's Homer would do the average boy a world more good than this definition . It is to the delighted fancy of the young that we must appeal if their early Greek studies are to mean more to them than their chemistry lessons Mr. Botsford 's illustrations are excellent . ? Mr. Frederic Rowland Marvin compiles and Fleming H. Revell Co. publish ' The Last Words ( Real and Traditional ) of Distinguished Men and Women . ' The fine motto from Shakspere on the title-page is hardly justified by the compilation . The wonder is that where so many examples are brought together , so few are in any way remarkable . Many are commonplaces of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find Henry Clay 's " Unbutton my shirt-collar , " for there are many of this kind . Hardly more interesting are the accents of a conventional piety , of which we havd A3good many . It is evident that histrionic persons do not forget their art ill their extremity . It would seem as if the artists are most apt to dwell in articulo mortis on their particular work . Thus , we have John Crome 's " 0 Hobbema , Hobbema , how I do love thee ! " Fusers " Is Lawrence come " and Gainsborough 's " We are all going to Heaven , and Vandyke is of the company . " A few of these last words are noble , like Arria 's Non dolet , Pinto ; some very pathetic ? Burns 's " Do n't let the awkward squad fire over me , " and Calhoun 's " The South , the South , what will become of her " Others are grim enough ? Lord Thurlow 's " I 'll be shot if I do n't believe I 'm dying , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Some of the more noted " infidels " are tagged with their appropriate recantations , and Thomas Paine is particularly ill-treated in his explanatory note ; but , in general , Mr. Marvin seems to have a kindly feeling for the heretics . Some of the explanatory notes are admirable . Sometimes , where we need one , there is none , as in the case of Buckle 's " Poor little boys " The had people seem to have acquitted themselves quite as admirably as their betters , at the parting of the ways . ? ' The Soul of a Cat ' ( Putnams ) , by Margaret Benson , is a tastefully illustrated little book of clever character studies , not biographies , of pets in an English home , five cats , two dogs , two parrots , several domestic fowls , and a family of robins . Its main purpose is to show that each animal has , like each man , its own peculiarities of ' disposition . Ra , the Persian cat , for instance , was as treacherous as he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand that caressed him an instant too long . Perms , his grandmother , " a troubled little soul of a cat , ' craved human love so passionately that she even hated her own kittens when they became old enough to be her rivals . Though none of the animals described were remarkably intelligent , the author 's sympathetic observation has revealed much of interest in them , and may help other people to get a better understanding of their own pets . The reader recognizes her accuracy of description in little details of appearance and action , which he finds he has often noticed , though only subconsciously ; as when she shows the collie " standing four-square " above the little quarrelsome terrier that he has knocked down , and " smiling over the grizzled head snapping helplessly between his feet " ; or the cat Sandy refusing to stay where he was put , " keeping his muscles tense , like a coiled spring , and , as soon as the grasp slackened , carrying out quite slowly and deliberately his first intention . " The last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and compares their traits . It is interesting and suggestive , but can not be regarded as a scientific contribution to animal psychology . ? The once-amusing " Gyp " seems to have lapsed into a painful decadence , and is taking her anti-Semitism very hard . Her late novel ' Le Friquet ' is a mere explosion of hatred against the Jews . All its bad characters are of that race , while it is to be regretted that its good ones are not more Christian . Le Friquet ( a nickname signifying a lively little character like that of a sparrow ) is a waif picked up by the roadside , and now at the age of fifteen a quaint , comely child and a star performer in Jacob-son 's American Circus . She is - maltreated by Jacobson , so she says , though Jacobson calls her a raenteuse , and from her later conduct we do not feel at all positive about the question of veracity She is saved and taken charge of by the Schlemmers , a rich banker and his beautiful wife . The principal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ describing this banker and those of his race as sales youtres and youpins , which is about equivalent to " sheenies " " Probably he is a Dreyfusite , " she at once reflects . She goes about on horseback and on foot , at Saint-Severin-sur-Mer , where the scene of the story is laid , repeating that though those people brought more or less profit to the seaside folk , they were , and ought to be , detested , and saying ' " It 's a pity there are so many Jews at Saint-Severm ; it keeps away the other bathers ; it 's a veritable calamity . " The rule is laid down that it makes no difference whether a Jew is converted to Christianity or not ( Schlemmer , for instance , is one only by race , and is an intimate friend of the parish priest and interested in the good works of the district ) . For , says she , " If you baptize a negro , he does n't become white , does he ? " Madame Schlemmer , a beauty of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comforts of a home and to have the spending of an income of $200,000 a year or more , is represented as a noble , pensive character . She has done quite enough in being true to the banker for some years , and , after that , she is free to take the scornful Hubert de Ganges for a lover , and do as she pleases ; it is the proper sort of treatment to mete out to such a husband ; it serves him right for being a aoutre . In short , ' Le Friquet ' is a detestable book that leaves a bad taste in the mouth . It is not likely that it represents much more than " Gyp " herself , grown senile and crabbed. -
