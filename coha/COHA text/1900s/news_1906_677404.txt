txt The St. Mary 's Perfectly Seaworthy . Commander G. C. Hanas of the nautical schoolship St. Mary 's says he is now feeling the effect of several false reports circulated last Summer about the seaworthiness of the St. Mary 's . There is a falling off in the number of applications at the school , and he attributes all of it to these reports and rumors which stated that the ship was no longer seaworthy and had been blown on the rock off the coast of Morocco . Not one bit of this was true . The reports also stated that St. Mary 's was to be replaced by the Hartford for these reasons , while the true reason for the desired change is the obsolete character of the old ship . She is not suited to the needs of a modern schoolship . Now that the State of Washington is to establish a nautical schoolship -- and is to do it with an up-to-date ship -- New York City ought not be second in the way of equipment . The commander says the St. Mary 's made the last trip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she encountered much rough weather and was forced to heave to forty-eight hours off Cape Finistere . Parents of boys who are afraid of the old ship 's seaworthiness need have no fears in that direction .
