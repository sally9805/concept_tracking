txt A rearrangement of the-Northwestern railroad situation , according to excellent information , is said to be the reason for the sudden and unexpected rise in the stock market Friday afternoon and yesterday . According to thisl'authority , an agreement has been reached by all the parties interested under which , after the final decision in the Northern Securities ease , the situation will be settled as follows : The interests controlling the Great Northern Railway will retain the Burlington system , Union Pacific interests will secure the Chicago and Northwestern , - and the Chicago , Milwaukee and St. Paul people will get control of the Northern Pacific . Rumors of an arrangement somewhat resembling this one have been current for come time , but the novel feature of ' the scheme as outlined is that giving the St. Paul interests control of the Northern Pacific and not vice versa . That apparently immaterial change in the plan will , it is declared , make every difference in the world . Were the Northern Pacific to take over the St. Paul , then the Hill-Morgan interests controlling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controlling the Northern Pacific-St . Paul alliance . But by giving the Northern Pacific to the St. Paul . the control of the road over which all the trouble and dispute of 1901 arose would be virtually in neutral hands  --  namely , those of the **27;351;TOOLONG Oil combination . While these , men hold stock in the rniOn Pacific , Ithey have still greater interests in the St. Paul line , so that under the proposed arrangement they could be relied upon to see that fair play was observed all around . The St. Paul system has for some time been considering the advisability of building a line to the coast , and surveys for this purpose were made several years ago . With the control of the Northern Pacific , the St. Paul would be assured of a Pacific outlet , and the rivalry of a , new line to the coast would be avoided . It was said yesterday that the plan included an iron-clad agreement by which each system guaranteed not to intrude in the territory of the other and not to engage in ruinous rate cutting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an interchange of Directors , so that each group would have a sufficient representation in the other groups to guard against any policy that might be to its disadvantage . The agreement thus outlined was thought reasonable by several railroad experts to whom it was mentioned , but it was impossible to get an authoritative official statement regarding it . J. Hill was out of town , and at the offices of E. H. Harriman and of J. P. Morgan &; Co. no information was obtainable . Union Pacific advanced to 119% , a new high record , With heavy transactions . This is a rise of over 5 points in two days . ( St. Paul sold up to 275 after haring been quoted as low as 171 a few days ago . Great Northern preferred on Friday gained 9 points , and Chicago Northwestern ruled strong at top prices . The stocks of the other railroads concerned in the settlement are not actively traded in . The strength in these issues influenced the whole . market and , with a few exceptions , all stocks scored gains of from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in sentiment was not better illustrated than by the fact that while the entire dealings on Friday barely reached 700,000 shares , the sales yesterday in only two hours of business comfortably exceeded that total . The arrangement suggested would give to each of the interests that have been occupying opposing positions ever since the Northern Pacific corner , an independent line from Chicago to the Pacific Coast . Vnion Pacific and Northwestern now form a through line from Chicago to San Francisco and to Puget Sound by way of the Oregon Short Line . St. Paul would reach the Puget Sound cities by way of the Northern Pacific , and Great Northern would make a through line from Chicago to the coast by means of the Burlington . While the lines of the Burline.ton . St. Paul and Northwestern traverse the same teiritory in Minnesota . Wisconsin . Iowa , and South Dakota . they are competitors largely for through traffic and if in this respect the traffic officials of either can be held in check by the proposed community of interest , the arrangement , if carried out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
