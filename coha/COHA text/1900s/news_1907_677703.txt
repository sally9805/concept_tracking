txt The Price of Shaves and Shoes . Some years ago a bachelor friend told me that each time he shaved himself he put 25 cents in a box , and from this money he clothed himself . Acting on this idea , I hung up to my bathroom a tin box having a slit in its top . Each time I shaved myself I put into it 10 cents . When the children needed shoes my wife took the money needed from this box , depositing a slip with the amount written on it . In this way I have been able to keep track of the money saved . The amount deposited each year has averaged between $13 and $14 , which means about nine pairs of children 's shoes . I have been pursuing this scheme for nine years , and it has become such a firm habit that I shall probably always continue it . The razors were a gift from my father twenty years ago , and as I sharpen them myself the only outlay has been an occasional 15 cents for soap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and cleanliness which self-shaving insures , but I shoe the children as well .
