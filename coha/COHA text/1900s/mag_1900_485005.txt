The address of ex-President Harrison at Ann Arbor on Friday supplies the needed rallying-point for the men who voted for McKinley in the recent election , but who were opposed to his policy is the Philippines . It is safe to say that Mr. McKinley could not have been reelected without the votes of such men . If any conservative Democrat or good character had been nominated , the campaign would have had a very different ending . When the smoke of the bat- tle passed away , there was a deep and earnest desire among the class of voters , we have described for some strong man of unquestioned Republicanism to speak cut and take the lead of this unvoiced sentiment in the party . All eyes turned to Senator Hoar as the proper man for this duty , but the only response heard from that quarter was , that after the Philippines were pacified and the supremacy of law established ( presuma bly by killing the inhabitants ) , the blessings of liberty would probably be granted to them . No other voice was heard until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This was in the true spirit , fdr freedom and self-government , but Mr. McCall could not command the following that Mr. Hoar might have gained , or that he had already gained by former speeches on this question . Such was the situation when Mr. Harrison made his magnificent speech at Ann Arbor . It was an unexpected deliverance . It was known , indeed , that Mr. Harrison was opposed to what is denominated Imperialism , but it was not anticipated that he would make a public declaration of his beliefs . It has been so much the habit of our ex-Presidents to avoid political discussion , except in a brief and de , sultory way , that a thoroughgoing speech on the Constitutional status of our new belongings came as a surprise . As nothing was more needed , so nothing could have been more weighty . Mr. Harrison 's position is such that his gun carries farther in the Republican party than Senator Hoar 's or any other . Mr Harrison 's speech was upon the relation of " our new possessions " and their inhabitants to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Federal Constitution applies to Porto Rico and the Philippines . He was perfectly frank in the presentation of his views , which were expressed with great clearness and force . As to the legal questions involved , he holds that the Constitution follows the flag ; that as Porto . Rico and the Philippines are parts of the United States , the fundamental law of the- republic applies to them as much as to any other parts of the United States . The ex-President is an able Constitutional lawyer , who has the faculty of making his points so clearly that everybody can See them , and his argument that the Constitution everywhere applies as a whole  --  not such portions as a President or Congress may choose to apply in one or another section  --  appeals irresistibly to the mind of the candid layman . He combats the theory that the Constitution applies only to the States , and not to the Territories ? a theory which consistent Imperialists have carried to its logical conclusion by claiming that Arizona and New Mexico , like Porto Rico and the Philippines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and subject to a Congress acting , as Mr. Harrison puts it , " under no restraint except what interest and benevolence impose . " This view of the American Constitution he flatly declares to be " shocking . " The theory that the Porto Ricans and the Filipinos will be sufficiently protected by the " benevolence " of their rulers at Washington  --  in other words , Mr. McKinley 's policy of " benevolent assimilation " ? is treated with contemptuous ridicule and righteous indignation . " The man who has to rely upon benevolence for his laws is a slave , " bluntly says Mr. Harrison . He points out that the tea tax against which our forefathers protested was not oppressive , but that they objected to it on the ground that the British Government had no right to levy it . He asserts that it was a mockery to raise the flag in Porto Rico while the Governor stood under it and sea d a proclamation putting the island outside the Constitution and under Congress . The hypocrisy of the pious claim that has been advanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relentless severity . Mr. Harrison asserts that a condition has been created contrary to liberty for a commercial profit , and says that he has been told that the Porto Rican Tariff Law was passed to protect the beet-sugar interests . He waxes sarcastic when he talks of the alleged " duties that Providence has imposed on this country ' , " remarking that we are carrying the white man 's burden , but that he has noticed that this means to carry the black man 's gold . This is , or of right ought to be , an epoch-making speech . Everything conspires to give the utterance dignity and weight . It comes from an ex-President , who is reserved by nature and who has spoken on public questions but seldom since his retirement from office . It is a solemn , earnest , and indignant protest against the policy of a . Republican Administration from a man who is by instinct a strong partisan , and who has always been loath to condemn the political organization with which he has acted ever since its origin . This ringing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced from him because he is a patriot , the descendant of a man who fought to establish the Constitution , and himself a soldier in a later war to maintain that Constitution , and as much a believer in the principles of that instrument as his ancestor was in the last century or he himself a generation ago . No question is ever settled until it is settled right . The great question before this nation will never be settled except upon the lines which ox-President Harrison laid down at Ann Arbor . It is only a question of time when it will be so settled . PHILIPPINE PROGRESS . The country may well congratulate itself if a change of attitude towards the Filipinos is being forced upon the President and his Cabinet by Republican dissatisfaction with the prospect of indefinite hostilities in the archipelago , as was foreshadowed last week by the Evening Post 's Washington correspondent . After having complacently ' swallowed for nearly two years the fic- ' tions of Gen. Otis and others as to the approaching end of hostilities ( officially announced in 1899 on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 18 , August 12 , etc. ) , it appears that the Administration is at last awakening to the fact that the military outlook is " very serious . " Corning as this does at the very moment when Congress is upsetting the whole army organization , it can hardly be pleasant . It may even be that the Hong Kong correspondent of the London Daily Mail possessed some foundation for his recent sensational dispatches as Lo the American inability to make headway in the islands and to prevent the traffic in arms and ammunition . Be this as it may , it will be a cause for widespread rejoicing if it appears that the Administration has really been able to grasp the size of the problem before it . On an understanding of the situation arrived at , it , may happen that other remedies than extermination will suggest themselves to the Cabinet and to the Republican leaders . If the Manila Times , a leading American newspaper in the Philippines , may be relied upon to give a truthful picture of the situation , Republican dissatisfaction with the outlook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and disheartening collection of tales of misgovernment , of native and American criminals and their crimes , of constant slaughterings of natives , of bloody deeds of revenge , of burned villages and towns , and of native suffering sufficient to satisfy the most morbid taste . One year in Bilbid prison without trial , and when tried declared innocent of robbery  --  this is the story of Gabino Andres , styled by the Tames an " intelligent-looking native . " The rape of a fourteen-year-old prisoner is the charge against six Manila policemen , according to the Times , while some of the Macabebes enlisted in the army are accused of having " burglarized " and completely ransacked the house of a respectable woman From a native contemporary , the Times learns that a patrol of soldiers in San Mateo. " fatigued by the monotony of their rounds , " were by a " miserable piece of treachery " surrounded and attacked by insurgents summoned by their hosts . The editor of the Times himself editorially testifies to the corruption of the Covernment 's court interpreters , but excuses the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing all that it can . Stabbings , shootings , and suicides among the Americans are as regular occurrences as aide the prize fights between soldiers in the Manila Athletic Club , in which civilizing dis plays the garrison regiments , the Twentieth and Twenty-first Infantry and Sixth Artillery , were well represented on November 17 In plain sight of eighty - Filipinos there was murdered about the same time the native tailor of E troop , Fourth Cavalry , near the Manila Country Club . the reason being his failure to obey a summons to return to his place in the native ranks . None of the spectators arrested the murderers , who walked away . Of three American soldiers who started forth in a native cart to arrest suspected insurgents in the outskirts of Manila without the permission of their officers , two " disappeared . " Guided by the third , troops reached the place where it was thought that the men had been done away with , and burned every house . " Not a shack was left standing , " but the inhabitants escaped , having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there disappeared a drunken private of the Signal Corps in the interior of Luzon , after having fired a peaceful village for his own amusement . It is reported that the natives put a prompt end to this civilizer . Rosario , a village in the Batangas district , was recently completely destroyed by fire by American troops , with a view to the destruction of Filipino stores and munitions of war , which the invaders " had reason to believe " were stored in the village . The church and the convent were spared . Capt George W. Beigler of the Twenty-eighth Infantry , and his men , slaughtered seventy-five Filipinos in a trench , both ends of which the Americans occupied . The dead lay within a space of fifteen yards , the Americans killing them as they ran out . The account of this glorious deed is to be found in the Times also , as well as the manly revenge for the death of Lieut . Max Wagner , Twenty-sixth Infantry , when fifty-two natives were killed , although there was no proof whatever that they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , under these circumstances , the southern islands should again be reported to be suffering greatly , or that Sefior Buencamino should appeal to the Philippine Commission for their aid in rebuilding a road through a country nearly ruined by war and typhoons . Only prompt action , he says , will prevent the complete ruin of this once prosperous Luzon province of Pampanga by hunger , sickness , and theft . Through all this sickening record , taken at random from the Times , there comes an occasional glimpse of the activity of the Philippine Commission  --  such as an order for a civil-service system ; plans for schools and money for their improvement ; here a costly project for the improvement of the harbor of Manila , and there the rebuilding of military roads Nowhere is there the slightest evidence of a growing cordiality between natives and Americans , nowhere a sign that the two races have begun to understand each other or to live on other terms than of veiled or open hostility . In Manila itself the frequent arrest 's of Filipino recruiting officers give color to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and prove that Filipino officers are willing to run great ' danger in behalf of their cause They even risk coming before one of the many American military tribunals which pass upon questions of life and death , and weigh legal evidence with all the experience given to them by years of company drills in frontier posts and by recruiting duty in our large cities , their numerous death sentences being generally reversed by Gen. MacArthur . It must be plain that this state of affairs can not go on for ever . Either the Administration must tire of it and decide that humanity is , after all , the best policy , or it must call for the reconcentrado and still bloodier policies . The concentration plan is now being tried in South Africa , with which our own situation in the East still forms a close parallel , and at least one English service paper speaks with disgust of Roberts 's " fatuous weakness " in handling the Boers thus far . It is for Americans of all kinds and conditions to prevent the continuance of the present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the authorities , on the grounds of decency , justice , and humanity . We have heard much of our inability to give up the Philippines because of our honor before the world . It may well be that a prompt relinquishment of the islands , or a complete change of policy , will alone save the United States from a bitterer humiliation than any yet realized by those whose curious honor permits the extermination of a people , but prevents doing them simple justice . THE PARALYSIS OF THE TREATY MAKING POWER . The United States is rapidly coming to be regarded by the other great Powers as a nation which is net able to make a treaty . We have been trying to conclude important international agreements during the past fifteen years , h'it have seen one after another of them go to wreck in the Senate . It is needless to enumerate the long and melancholy list . Whether the President was Cleveland or Harrison or McKinley , whether the negotiators were Democratic or Republican , the power of the Senate to ratify treaties has been mainly exercised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conventions with Great Britain have been broken on the Senate 's veto . The Chief of State has made treaties with France and Germany , but the Senate has said with a sneer , " They reckon ill who leave me out , " and has brought the whole work to the ground . With or without intention , we seem to the world to have stripped ourselves of a leading attribute of sovereignty  --  the power to make treaties . That the result is badly to impair our national prestige admits of no question Already foreign writers on government and international relations are beginning to say that it is absolutely worth no country 's while to attempt to make a treaty with the United States . ' I he President may be conciliatory , the Secretary of State may be willing to agree , but there is always the intractable Senate to say us nay ; so what is the use ? This is a most humiliating thing to be truthfully said of a great nation . It leaves us in a contemptible position . Treaties between nations are like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man , that does not observe them is apt to be sent to Coventry . These repeated fiascos , in the case of weighty international agreements , put us very much in the awkward plight of a country gentle . man who should graciously invite his neighbors to joint use of a shady lane , but should warn them at the same time that certain ill-conditioned cousins of his would give them a clubbing if they attempted to walk there . In a newly hatched and loudly cackling " world-power , " this inability to make a treaty is little short of ludicrous . To be a world-power means at least to meet other powerful nations on equal terms . It is indeed , an essential function of world-powers to make agreements with each other for their reciprocal advantage and for the peace of the world But here we are , thrusting ourselves into the company of the great Powers , and at the same time confessing that we can not bear ourselves as a great Power should . We can not make , or at any rate can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is as if we sought membership in an expensive club , and got promptly posted for nonpayment of dues . It is all very well to say that foreigners ought to undergtflo.a the playful ways of our Senate , and to bear in mind that it is an essential part of the American treaty-making power . What they see , after repeated demonstration , is that the Senate makes waste paper of all that the President and his authorized agents can do . " Very well , then , " they will say , when next approached for the adjustment of some international grievance , " first produce the advice and consent of the Senate , for otherwise we shall simply be wasting our time and yours . " This would not be a very respectful way of addressing the chosen rulers of a world-power , but if we condemn ourselves to the attitude of a -world-feebleness , what can we expect ? The brute obstructive position which the Senate now so regularly assumes in the presence of all capital treaties submitted to it , is the strange effect of many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the singular mixture of functions assigned to the Senate by the Constitution . It is a Privy Council and a legislative body in one . Curiously enough , the perils of such a union were foreseen in the Constitutional Convention , and a proposal was made that there should be a Privy Council in addition to the Senate . This would have had more support if the future development of th ( - Senate could have been unfolded before the gaze of the fathers and founders . At first , in truth , the Senate was ery like a Privy Council . Its membership was small . Its sessions were all in secret . It played but a small part in legislation , compared with the House . But a hundred years have changed all that . A body of ninety men is a ridiculously large number to act as the confidential advisers of the President . Moreover , the Senate has come to be indisputably far the more powerful legislative house . It shapes ten laws to its will where the Representatives have their way in one And just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treaties They can not be separated , in the minds of Senators . from great matters of legislation before them . They confuse their function as Privy Councillors with their functions as legislators Any one can see , for example , that the forces antagonistic to the Hay-Pauncefote treaty are inspired by ulterior motives . It is not simply that the opposing Senators desire to beat the treaty , or cut the spinal column out of it , but that they have their eye on other measures , which they hope that the fate of the treaty will retard or advance , as the case may be . Votes cast for or against the treaty are really cast for or against a canal bill , a ship-subsidy bill , railroad legislation , or what not . It is , then , through a Constitutional displacement , so to speak , combined with the degeneracy of the character of the Senate , that that body has come to have its present unhappy - reputation as the great assassin of treaties The result is before us , and is enough to make our cheeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nations in consequence of failure after failure to ratify what they consider a solemn promise made by the head of our Government , is a real disgrace . The loss of a battle could not humiliate us more . The remedy is simple , as far as suggestion goes , though we admit it will be immensely difficult to apply it . If the Senate could be remanded to its old and proper place in legislation , and its membership restored to its ancient stan dard of broad-minded statesmanship , the trouble would be largely overcome . But this would imply a House of Representatives and a President ready to stand up for their Constitutional prerogatives against a usurping Senate . Neither of these is visible on the Washington horizon , however , and so we seem doomed to go on for a time with a Senate in which prejudice and selfish interests and sinister motives shall prevail over the higher considerations of international good will and the peace of the world . Yet , unless there be a change , the United States will continue to enjoy the unenviable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make a treaty . SENATOR HANNA 'S SPEECH . In his speech on behalf of the Ship-Subsidy Bill , familiarly known as the " Hanna-Payne Bill , " Senator Hanna made himself responsible for certain figures purporting to give the amounts received for carrying the mails by the principal Atlantic lines . These are the figures that represent the lamentable condition which it is sought to correct by the bill ; and as Senator Fianna acknowledges himself to be one of the authors of the bill , it seems reasonable to expect accuracy of statement on so important a matter , where the facts can be readily obtained from official docucents . Senator Hanna said that , with a subsidy of $290,000 a year each , the vessels of the American Line would not earn as much as was earned by the vessels of the Cunard and White Star Lines under the mail pay received from Great Britain . Now here are the facts : In the official report of the Superintendent of Foreign Mails , issued by the United State Post-office Department on October 23 last , on page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrying from New York 825,339,773 grammes of letters and prints , received from the Government a compensation of $647 - 278.40 . It is interesting , in connection Kith this , to observe that the Cunard Line , for carrying 849,618,113 grammes , received from the same source only $-284,721.04 , and that the White= Star Line , - for carrying 209013,953- grammes , received only $48,820.71 . But taking the amount officially stated as having been paid to the American Line for this mail service ( $647,278.40 ) , and comparing it with the recent reports of the British Postmaster-General , it appears that the subvention paid by the British Admiralty to the Cunard Line was ? 15 , - 000 ( $75,000 ) , and to the White Star line ? 14,600 ( $73,000 ) , for one year , and that in addition to this the total amount paid for the carriage of mails from the United Kingdom to New York during the year was ? 107,694 ? say about $500,000 ; that is , the entire subvention paid by the British Government to the White Star and Cunard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mails by all vessels from the United Kingdom to the port of New York , was $648,000 , as against $1,160. - 000 per annum which four vessels of the American Line would receive under the proposed hill , even adopting Senator Hanna 's own figures . If the Congressional Record were ex amined to find the excuses assigned for Government gifts to favored industries , it could be shown that this scarecrow of foreign aid to competing enterprises has been worked upon the public with the greatest regularity , but probably never with a more utter disregard of the facts than now It is well known that the aids given by the British Government to certain great mail-carrying lines to India , China , and Australia are given for political rather than commercial purposes , and are made neceesaiy for the purpose of maintaining connection with the scattered colonies of the empire , whose freight and pas sen ger traffic would not justify or support the lines which are absolutely required for Government purposes ; yet England , which controls about half the tonnage of the world , pays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea-going steam tonnage , while the United States , on tonnage of the same character , pays under the existing postal subsidy $1.23 per ton , all of which is apparent on pages 3 and 18 of the report of the majority of the House Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries , filed on March 31 last in support of this very bill . Mr. Hanna declared in a triumphant way that the four ships of the American Line , which are the carriers of the United States mail , have never made a dollar of net profits . He did not say whether the company has been well managed or not . Consequently there was a defect in his logic almost as marked as the difference between the figures he gave concerning the mail-pay of the Cunard and White Star Lines and the correct ones . It is quite possible that a company might not make any net profits , , however large its gross earnings might lie . Everything , depends on the . management . Senator Lindsay asked Mr. Hanna if it were true that the American Line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much as the Cunard Line or the White Star Line , and Mr. Hanna replied that in his belief it was true . Naturally Mr. Lindsay did not see what was the use of passing the bill in that case . Finally Mr. Hanna declared that he was seeking to promote patriotism and pride in our national life He put the Subsidy Bill on higher grounds than dollars and cents . It was for the interest of the whole people , he said , that the bill should pass . His theory is that money collected from the taxpayers and put into the hands of ship-owners and shipbuilders will diffuse itself through the community in a satisfactory way , especially if it is paid to those who are not making any net profits now We think the results would be even more satisfactory if the money were distributed to the people of the United States per capita , and that if any preference were shown , it should be to those who are able to make a fair living by their own exertions . Mr. Hanna 's argument as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made by Mr Clyde , one of the members of the " Maritime Committee " ( of which Mr. Hanna is also a member ) , in his argument before the House Committee last winter . Mr. Clyde is himself one of the beneficiaries of the proposed Subsidy Bill , although we believe not one of the originators He belongs rather to the class of old-fashioned , steady-going ship-owners , who did not know how much they needed Government aid till somebody else told them Having been persuaded , however , that he had pocket-room for any share coming to him under the bill , he took a purely business view of the subject , which is expressed in the following words : " If we are satisfied , we who expect to share the direct benefits of this bill , to begin with  --  if we are satisfied to see one single member Griscom of that Maritime Committee receive that much money , in whose affairs we have no interest whatever , we think you can be sure that he is not getting more than the service he renders is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to how that money can be distiibuted so as to do the most good and build up the largest possible merchant marine , I do not think that you should give weight to the adverse criticisms of people who have had no practical experience in the ownership or operation of ships " This appears to have been Mr. Hanna 's view also , although he did not express it as frankly as Mr. Clyde did . AN EXAMPLE FOR GOVERN-ORS A year ago the people of Massachusetts tried the experiment of electing to the Governorship a plain business Man , who had little taste for the ornamental functions of the office , but al . great capacity for executive work . His Rust term , under the system of annual elections which Massachusetts still maintains , is about closing . Mr. W. Murray Crane comes of a family which for many years has successfully conducted the industry of paper-manufacturing in Dalton , a small town in the Western part of the State He is in middle life and has maintained the business traditions of his house , while at the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hearty sympathy with good causes . He was given one office after another of growing importance , until in 1896 ha was elected Lieutenant-Governor , and three years later he was promoted to the position of " His Excellency , " as the Massachusetts Constitution styles the Chief Executive . Gov . Crane 's address to the Legislature , upon his inauguration last January , gave the public a welcome surprise by its brevity ; it would fall considerably short of filling two pages of this newspaper It was so brief that it is safe to say ten people read it where one would have waded through a message of three times its length It was as pointed as it was brief . Beginning with a statement that the financial condition or the Commonwealth was the most important subject to come before the lawmakers , he set forth the situation in detail and said : " The lesson which the figures of this debt statement teach is that Massachusetts has reached a limit of indebtedness beyond which she should not go It is time to cal a halt The Commonwealth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercised in appropriations and expenditures " The system of government by commissions has been carried very far in Massachusetts . The new Governor declared that inquiry and reflection had confirmed an opinion which he ha d held for some time , that the best interests of the public service would be advanced by a revision of some of these commissions . The Massachusetts Legislature , like that of New York , has often interfered in the government co ' the State 's chief city . Gov Crane expressed positive views on this question : " Cities and towns should be let alone , to work out their own municipal problems It is in the end no kindness to them to be granted authority by the Commonwealth to assume financial burdens which are prohibited by general laws A wiser policy would be to compel them to live within their means , the Legislature imposing its superior authority only when it is clear that an extraordinary emergency exists " The legislators found that the Executive meant what he said . When they proceeded to pass bills that contravened his urgent recommendations , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the especial necessity of avoiding further indebtedness for the so-called " Metropolitan district , " which includes much of Boston 's suburban territory , . and in which heavy obligations have been assumed for great parks , an increased water-supply , improved drainage , and sanitation . " I recommend , " he said , " that a stop be made at once to the authorization of expenditures for new work in this district . " When the Legislature , nevertheless , passed two bills authorizing the expenditure of $755,000 and $200,000 for parkways and driveways therein , he referred to his protest in January against such action , and said that his convictions had only been strengthened by his experience since then , declared that " the ease with which great financial burdens are imposed or assumed is a tendency of the times which , in my opinion , needs to be checked , " and refused his signature . When bill after bill was pushed through the Legislature authorizing Boston to incur indebtedness for a municipal building , a park , playgrounds , and additional schoolhouses , he painted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tax limit and the debt limit of the city , chiefly in order to avoid such applications to the Legislature ; reminded the legislators that those measures contravened his recommendation of January in opposition to the tendency of the State to interfere in the local affairs of cities and towns , and in one case usurped authority that should be exercised by the Mayor and City Council , and he vetoed every one of them . The spoilsmen tried their hand at breaking down the merit system by getting a bill passed which would allow call substitutes in the Boston Fire Department to be made permanent members of the force without a civil-service examination . It did not affect many men , but it involved a great principle , and the Governor vetoed it in a brief but cogent message , which served as the death-knell for other bills , of the same sort , but of a more pernicious character , which were on the calendars . Perhaps the most important exercise of this power was in regard to the Westminster Chambers Bill . In 1898 the Legislature had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any building to be erected in certain streets adjacent to Copley Square in Boston . A syndicate of wealthy capitalists was then putting up a large building which they wanted to have ninety-six feet high , they made it of that height , and then appealed to the Legislature to condone their offence by passing a special law for their benefit . The Legislature readily complied , but the Governor refused his sanction to a measure " intended to relieve citizens of the Commonwealth from the consequences of deliberate disregard of the provisions of a statute , " declaring that " the vital point involved is not the appearance of the building or the difficulties under which the owners labor , but it is rather whether law may be violated only to be excused or condoned .

But the - weaker power-is supposed to have less right to keep on fighting than the stronger , and the stronger keeps on fighting as long as there is any resistance , and is held entitled to kill everybody who keeps up this resistance This is so well known that the suprise and lamentation expended over the Boer resistance are mysterious It is the history of all wars of subjugation . The rule is that the weaker party must submit or die . This is one of the great beauties of war . This delusion has been greatly helped during this later war-revival by the readiness of the clergy to take part in it . Until now they have , as a rule , at least in Protestant countries , abstained from praising the killing of people as an aid to the diffusion of the gospel . But an immense stimulus has been given to man 's natural propensity to kill his fellows by religious or semi-religious poetry . The poets have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in killing . The amount at verse expended on this is one of the saddest things in the literary history of humanity . From the first war-song of the savage down to Rudyard Kipling 's poetry is an immense space of time , but this space has been filled by very much the same sort of stuff . The butchery of human beings has received almost as much attention from the poets as has been accorded to their loves . Our sacred literature , too , is full of similes drawn from the battle-fields Everything is done by the soldiers themselves to make Is ar seem a picturesque business The uniform , the serried ranks , the glittering steel , the martial music  --  all help to quickon the blood of even the most timid , and hide from him the horrors of ' actual warfare .

There is no better way of pleasing it , if it be warlike , than praying for " the success of our arms .

They would approach the Throne of Grace with a petition that the enemy might have his optic nerve cut out by a ball ; that he might have his pelvis smashed , that he might be disembowelled , that he might lose one or two legs ; that he might lie on the field thirty-six hours , mortally wounded , that he might the of enteric fever , that his provisions and water might give out , that his house might be burned , and his family left roofless and starving In this way , the real nature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , and something would be done to disabuse the minds of the young men and their parents of the idea that war is simply a kind of diversion , in the nature of a football game , which will elevate their character and improve their health and increase their business .
