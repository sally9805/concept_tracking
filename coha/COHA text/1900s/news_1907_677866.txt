txt Viscount Aoki , Japan 's first Ambassador to the United States , has received Instructions from his Government to return to Tokio , and it is understood at Washington that his recall Is permanent . Ambassador Amu presented his credentials May 8 , 1908 ; his return marks the end , for the present , of Japan 's attempt to vindicate in a peculiar way her undisputed right , as President RoosEirme phrased it In his message of Dec. 5 , 1906 , to " stand abreast of the foremost and most enlightened peoples of Europe and America . " Reports that his diplomacy was not aggressive enough in the settlement of the San Francisco dispute to suit his countrymen , and that consequently , in their opinion , Japan must hereafter confine her attention solely to affairs of the Orient , are confirmed by a recent significant utterance by Count ORITMA. formerly Minister of Foreign Affairs and now leader of the Japanese radical party . In the Japanese-English Pacifio Era for November Count OatmrA said : We must always remember that our diplomacy does not always keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; sometimes It restrains the full exercise of our powers . Not the happiest thing of which we could remind ourselves ; nevertheless , a fact . Bearing in mind , therefore , this handicap which our diplomacy 21aes upon us , let us console ourselves with being the dominant power in the Far East , But Ambassador Aoki may not reasonably be charged with responsibility for the failure to overcome the effects of e. race prejudice that has since manifested itself in a province of Great Britain , Japan 's ally , In contravention of the express terms of a treaty between the allied powers . So strong was this manifestation that , despite Premier LAKCP.IED 'S protestations to the contrary . it is likely that an arrangement will be effected to restrict in future Japanese immigration into Canada . Mr. AOKI 'S enemies also complain that he " failed to bluster sufficiently " to prevent the dispatch of our fleet to the Pacific . But his Government has experienced no feeling of insecurity because of the Pacific cruise . The grave condition of China , acute and growing critical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the time set for the abdication of the Empress Dowager and for the hatching of a great revolutionist plot , is enough to account for the transfer of our sea strength to Eastern waters . The Japanese Ambassador no more than the Ambassadors from the European countries can be held accountable for our decision to protect , If need be , the territorial 1-tegrity of China Viscount Aoki will depart with the consciousness that his diplomacy , which dealt with the United States as a Nation and not as a union of sovereign States , though it did not prevail upon Congress to enact a law enabling his countrymen to become American citizens , did effect a compromise short of the passage of the exclusion law desired by the Pacific States . His successor , we are sure , will.be anxious to come to a permanent understanding on the basis of this compromise . Internal industrial conditions and their interests in Korea and Manchuria demand at present the undivided attention of the Japanese people .                @ @ @ @ @
