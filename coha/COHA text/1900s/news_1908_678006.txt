txt Conjectured the Kaiser Thinks Hill is n't Rich Enough to Maintain the American Embassy Properly . Special Cable to THE NEW YORK TIMES . BERLIN , March ** impenetrable mystery surrounds the alleged declination of the Kaiser 's Government to accept Dr. David Jayne Hill as Charlemagne Tower 's successor in the American Embassy . The most conflicting statements are in circulation . The Foreign Office authorizes a categorical denial that Dr. Hill has been declared persona non grata , and asserts that the assent to his appointment , which was given through the customary channel of the German Embassy at Washington in November , holds good to this hour , and that if Dr. Hill should arrive in Berlin to-morrow he would be cordially welcomed . On other hand , a positive report emanating from a responsible quarter persistently declares that notwithstanding the Foreign Office 's disclaimer , it is an undeniable fact that the Washington Government has been advised that Dr. Hill is regarded as unfit to be the American Ambassador here . If this report is true , the information could be conveyed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Berlin , with which the Kaiser must have opened negotiations on his own account without the knowledge of the Foreign Office . Tower ? alites to Come Home . When THE NEW YORK TIMES 'S correspondent called on Mr. Tower to-day and informed him of the suggestion current in the United States that he might be planning to remain in Berlin , and told him of the report that the State Department was embarrassed through his failure to resign after a promise to do so , the Ambassador authorized the following statement : " It is true that I have not yet sent in my formal resignation , but it is my inflexible purpose-to resign during the coming Summer . The State Department has no official knowledge of my intentions , for the reason that the only reference I ever have made to them was in a private letter to the President intimating that I desired to be relieved from diplomatic service this Summer , because my wife and I Wished to return to America and re-establish our home . , " I can not discuss Dr. Hill 's case from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject- to the State Department . " American dispatches having stated that Dr. Hill 's ineligibility was connected with Prince Henry 's visit to America in .1902 , when Dr. Hill accompanied the Kaiser 's brother as the representative of the State Department , I interviewed Baron von Holleben , who was the German Ambassador at Washington at the time , and who also accompanied Prime Henry across the United States . Denial by von Bolleben . " Please deny in my name in the most . positiva manner , " said Baron won Holleben , " that Dr. Hill incurred Prince Henry 's displeasure in any respect . Dr. Hill 's conduct throughout the trip was characterized by the utmost tact , His courtesy contributed conspicuously to the pleasure of the Prince 's journey . " Whatever niqy be the cause of this sudden discovery of Dr. Hill 's ineligibility , I am certain it can not be connected with that memorable event . " The Baron pointed out that while he utterly disbelieves that the German Government has declared that Dr. Hill is not acceptable , such an act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power . " America several years ago , " explained Baron von Holleben , " informally agreed to the custom in vogue among . the monarchical powers of submitting diplomatic appointments , and respecting any objections which might ensue . If , however , Dr. Hill should be rejected , it would be the first case of the kind in the history of GermanAmerican diplomatic relations . " I can not believe it is true . I , on the contrary , was so certain he was coming here that I already had made preliminary arrangements for a welcoming breakfast at which the French and Spanish Ambassadors and the Dutch and Swiss Ministers in Berlin , all of whom served with me in Washington while Dr. Hill was Assistant Secretary of State , should have a happy reunion in honor of Dr. Hill 's arrival . " Conjectures in Berlin . The most astonishing feature of the incident , - which has caused a tremendoussensation in Berlin , is the fact that Dr. Hill should be found persona non . grata at this late date . Three weeks ago he visited Berlin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engaged a butler , told his personal friends he expected to take uP his residence here in August , dined with the Towers , and learned from them they were intending to - leave about that time . His " unfitness " must have developed since then . It is possible it came to light as the result of a private - communication the Kaiser made to Mr. Tower when his Majesty , dined ' at the American : Ern , bassy - the night of - March , 13 . The Emperor on-that occasion said:300u. ; larly to one of the guests who was leaving next day for Washington , - I wish you would tell your President I am angry with him for allowing Mr. Tower to leave Berlin . " A variety of conjectures are current in the Berlin diplomatic corps for the Kaiser 's alleged belief in Dr. Hill 's " unfitness . " The commonest observation is that Mr. Tower may have reconsidered his desire to leave Berlin after being assured how thoroughly the Kaiser would regret his departure . Still another supposition is that the Emperor realizes that Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maintain the American ' diplomatic representation on the scale observed by Mr. Tower , and fears that the United States Embassy would in consequence be relegated to second place .
