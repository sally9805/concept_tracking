WHO was Charles Gleyre ? To ask and to answer that question in approaching the art of the late James McNeill Whistler is to draw much nearer , I think , to what is interesting in the genesis of that art , than if we seek to learn where and when the American painter and etcher was born , who his parents were , and all the other things that are supposed to count , and usually do count . in the development of a man 's genius . In Whistler 's case they do not count at all , and only the compilers of reference books need trouble themselves about the vexed question as to whether he was born in 1834 or 1835 , in Baltimore or // St. Petersburg . He was , himself , always rather mysterious on these points . Perhaps he realized their unimportance , and , in his quizzical way , amused him- ? elf by evading the importunities of the intrusive biographer . The well-known story of his youthful indiscretion at West Point tells us nothing essential . After the death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been summoned to Russia by the Czar Nicholas , to supervise the construction of a railway there , he returned to this country with Mrs. Whistler , and entered the Academy on the Hudson . The famous Coast Survey plate on which he etched half-a-dozen irrelevant heads , thereby inviting a rebuke from his superior , and bringing about the abrupt termination of his military career , is a souvenir of his wayward temper , ? nothing more . No , the first salient fact by which we are confronted in his record is his entrance into Gleyre 's studio in 1856 , and so I return to new question . Gleyre was a born classicist , a devoted conservator of those principles upon which Ingres had placed his imprimatur , ? the only principles , as they thought , which it was rational for French art to follow . Obviously they were , in a measure , wrong . Gdricault proved it , Delacroix proved it , the works of all the Romantic and Naturalistic painters , both figure compositions and landscapes , remain an irrefragable proof that Ingres @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all things not academic . Less obviously , perhaps , but conclusively enough , they were , in a measure , right . At least they were in harmony with the French genius ; at least they preached , in their gospel of ? the rectitude of art , " the truth that is at the bottom of the most characteristic things in the Salon to-day . But Gleyre , as Whistler 's master , ceases for the moment to represent the continuity of French practice ? he becomes a protagonist in the great artistic quarrel of the nineteenth century , that between tradition and temperament . Looking back at the pair in those early days , both men are perceived in a peculiarly interesting light . Gleyre stands for everything that has been formulated and accepted . Whistler , a mere youth , is already bent upon revolution , and the odd thing is that all his resources for the struggle were accumulated in his own nature ; he drew nothing from the comrades who , like himself , sought an outlet from the stifling atmosphere of the Academy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to remember . Even then he was a kind of solitary , the influence of Gleyre only serving to accentuate his detachment from the reigning school . Never in later life did he more vividly demonstrate his title to a place apart in modern art than when he defied the very representative of officialdom to whom he had come to be taught . I have said that he drew nothing from his more independent comrades . Degas was among them ; be knew other Frenchmen since become celebrated , like that painter , for successful rebellion against routine , and he shared in their high erected talk . He did not share in any of their new movements to the extent of trying to do what they were trying to do . If he suffered rejection with Manet , for example , from the Salon , and thereupon sought recompense , with that artist , in the Salon des Refuses , it was by virtue of qualities entirely his own , and bearing the stamp of no school , impressionistic or what not , that he was scorned in the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at this point because the contrast between his work and Whistler 's in their time of trial is especially suggestive . The Frenchman 's great sensation in the Salon des Refuses of 1863 was made with his now famous ? then merely notorious ? Le Dejeuner sur l'Herbe . The American sent La Femme Blanche , the first of his three early Symphonies in White . The position taken by both painters amounted in effect to this : that they cared nothing for subject as subject , but were solicitous solely for the charm to be got out of the sheer manipulation of paint . The difference between them , beginning in temperament , ended in something like a total separation of their ideals . To Manet the incongruity of his nude bather , grouped beneath the trees near a stream , with two men in the coats and trousers of modern life , was of no earthly consequence . He was not painting an anecdote , he was painting an effect of light and air . But he really gives us more than this , he puts life into his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we live in , something that moves and breathes and has a very human interest . Brilliant as a technician , Manet was most brilliant in putting his technique at the service of truth . What Velasquez and Hats taught him he used in a large , robust spirit . The scales had fallen from his eyes . The world was intensely real to him . His eyes devoured the substance of life , and his hands thrilled with a sense of power as he seized it and transferred it to canvas , its vitality heightened rather than diminished , and its appeal directed to the layman , caring for mankind hardly less , than to the dilettanti of " pure painting . " Whistler had felt the magic of Velasquez , and he was weary , as Manet was , of the cold , sapless fruits of the Academy . But it was no more in his nature to face the truth as Manet faced it than it was in his nature to emulate his contemporary 's prodigious vigor . La Femme Blanche is not , like any one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be denied , ? one sees in this canvas simply the graceful wearer of a white dress which the artist has wanted to paint against a white curtain , and the same atmosphere as of technical experimentation hangs about The Little White Girl of 1864 , and the third of the " symphonic " studies , painted in 1867 . These canvases are all interiors . Not for him the luminosity which , for Manet , Monet , and all the rest of the Impressionists , meant a new and indispensable factor in art . He sought cooler tones , in a still , sequestered world of his own ; untroubled by the nervous tension of familiar life ; unlit by anything so garish as the sun , ? detached , in a word , from ordinary reality . Long afterwards , alluding to his great portrait of his mo . they , which he called an Arrangement in Grey and Black , he protested that some its personal associations were interesting to him , the public could have no legitimate concern with that side of the work . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on its merits as an arrangement . " This was his attitude in the sixties , when he was feeling his way toward the expression of his ideal , and he never abandoned it . He was furious with Mr. Hamerton for complaining , in The Saturday Review , that there were inure varieties of tint in the Symphony in White , No . Ill. than could be squared with a literal interpretation of the title . " Boa Dieu : " he exclaims , " did this wise person expect white hair and chalked faces ? And does he then , in his astounding consequence . believe that a symphony in F contains no other note , but shall be a continued repetition of F , F , F. ? ... Fool ! " ' The critic had certainly committed a bease , but this is not to say that Whistler deserved no criticism at all in those earlier clays . On the contrary , it is very easy to exaggerate the value of the three paintings I have named . They are immensely interesting as illustrations of a kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in the middle member of the trio particularly , the note struck is not simply so new , but so charming that it is , at first blush , a little dial . cult to understand why Paris was so slow in applauding the painter . The truth is that the absence in Whistler of that power which we have seen in Mallet inns destined , not altogether unjustly , to keep Inns for a long time out of his own . Pre- occupied with the nuance of tone , trying to achieve in painting an effect which judo its parallel in , say , the music of Chopin , or the poetry of Verlaine , he neglected to so perfect himself in the handling of his brushes that one would see his effects and nothing else . As a matter of fact one sees a great deal else , a point which Whistler 's thick and thin admirers are absurdly unwilling to concede . The work of the master , " he somewhere says , " reeks not of the sweat of the brow , ? suggests no effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Consider the want of limpidity in the surfaces , the want of elasticity in the lines , of the three Symphonies in White , and judge if there is no sign of effort in those works . Of masterful ease there is assuredly no suggestion . Some charm of tone is there , and the savor of genius is unmistakably present , hot it is tone that needs to take on a purer transparence ; it is genius that is not yet in full possession of itself . What Whistler himself thought of his first essays in paint is shown by an episode taken from a much later period in his career . lie found , in an English collection , a picture he had painted , and painted so badly that he longed to destroy it . So anxious was he to do this that he offered to paint a full-length portrait of the owner , and another of his wife , in exchange for this ghost from his past ! If from the start he had been only a painter , the explanation of his deficiencies could lie the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting things about Whistler that , just as he makes his debut in painting , and starts the critic on an analytic pursuit , the latter is brought athwart the etchings , and , for the moment , must see his subject in a very different light . Again the name of Gleyre presents itself . Looking simply to the three Symphonies in White one would say that he , to whom draughtsmanship was as the soul of art , had not taught his pupil to draw . Not down to the end of his career was Whistler to draw with the brush as most other masters have drawn , ? masters as unlike one another as Velasquez , Titian , Raphael , Mantegna , and Ingres . But with the etching needle in his hand he drew as only Rembrandt had drawn before him , with a precision , a delicacy , a power , which , perhaps , after all , not Ingres and Gleyre together could have taught him . These qualities appeared in his first etchings , the French Set of 1858 ; and when the Thames @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had developed his art to a remarkable point of self-possession and force . Altogether he produced nearly four hundred plates , and , while they vary in excellence , there is not one in the collection which is without some touch disclosing the great artist . For convenience these etchings may be roughly divided into four groups . The first two have just been named . In them , and in the etchings of the sixties , brilliance both of line and tone is the predominating characteristic . Then , around the early seventies , Whistler modified his manner , sketched the figure with a freer point , and often substituted for the rich tones , the velvety blacks and deep browns of his earlier plates , a grayer and more impalpable veil of color , approximating more to the key of certain of his paintings . Several years passed , and in Venice he entered upon a new phase , exchanging the full firm line of his first plates for a looser , more stenographic form of expression . Thereafter , in plates done in France , Belgium , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naval review , he adhered to much the same method . The point of view from which he made all his etchings is well exhibited in a passage from one of his letters to a friend who happened to be staying in Stuttgart at the time , and had written him of the picturesqueness of that place . " It sounds delightful , " he says . " I have never been to Stuttgart , but should fancy it a most fascinating old town . Is it full of quaint little daintinesses for use to carry off ? 830 Whistler . ? and is the town a dear Old-World spot ? withdrawn quite from the circulating tourist ? " This was ever his mood , one of immediate sympathy for dainty picturesqueness , and what makes the fragment I have quoted doubly characteristic is its indication of his tendency to look for that quality in what I may call the immobile aspects of a city . If he seeks movement at all , it is in the lines of shipping on the Thames , or it is in the men and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over these idlers or passers-by he pauses only long enough deftly to summarize them , and to furnish his composition with some sign of life . Why did he not make more of the human figure in his etchings ? He was not altogether without resource in this direction . In fact , some of his portraits , like the Drouet , for example , or several others of men , women , and children , show a fine sense of form . I think the reason why we find among his plates none of the dramatic figure subjects that we find in the etched work of Rembrandt , whom he equals otherwise , is that he was not interested in human nature for its own sake ; indeed , I sometimes wonder if he was interested in it at all , if the passion and poetry of life were not , to him , a sealed book . In his Ten O'Clock lecture Whistler speaks of Art being selfishly occupied with her own perfection only , having no desire to teach ; and in illustration of her disposition to seek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he cites " her high priest " Rembrandt , who , he goes on , " saw picturesque grandeur and noble dignity in the Jews ' Quarter of Amsterdam , and lamented not that its inhabitants were not Greeks . " The point is well taken , yet we can imagine Rembrandt protesting to Whistler , ? if they are now somewhere talking together of their earthly experiences , ? protesting that his position in the matter had been understated ; that he saw a good deal more than picturesque grandeur and noble dignity in the Jews ' Quarter at Amsterdam and wherever else he sought his models ; that he saw , and felt , the emotions by which the faces of those models were marked , by which their frames had been made significant of the soul 's travail . We can not imagine Whistler illustrating the Scriptures as Rembrandt illustrated them . To have done so he would have had to suffer a transformation of his whole nature , to have learned that there is more in roan . kind than the materials for an " arrange . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he had had an impulse toward Rembrandt 's way of looking at things . it is probable that he would have failal through his lack of anatomical know . ledge . His portraits , I repeat , are often masterly , but he needed an even greater command over the secrets of the figure than they reveal to put forth elaborate compositions . I note the fact with little or no regret , however , for in his chosen field Whistler made such beautiful etch. ings that it would be foolish to wish that he had done something else . Architecture , seemingly so fixed a phenomenon , nevertheless presents itself to different eyes with the most drastic differences . To Mdryon it is again and again a symbol of mystery and of eerie , even tragic beauty . To a man of the light temperament of Lalanne it is an affair of grace and elegance . To Whistler it meant a picturesqueness from whirls now and then a certain romantic glamour might seem inseparable , but which he sought to express quite unemotionally . We know what he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the riverside with poetry as with a veil , and the poor buildings lose themselves in the dim sky , and the tall chimneys become campanili , and the warehouses are palaces in the night . and the whole city hangs in the heavens and fairyland is before us . " But it was as the colorist , as the painter , that he wrote these words . As an etcher it was not fairyland that he saw , whether on the Thames or in Venice , it was simply a world of picturesque buildings and boats , dim arches that held subtle beauties of light and shade , delicate traceries of stone or metal that made in his plates an effective " pattern . " There is poetry in it , the sensuous poetry that appeals solely to the eye . It has none of the deeper implications of the art produced by a man looking , involuntarily , beneath the surface . But let us have done with qualifications . In his own sphere of etching Whistler is incomparable . Edmond de Goncourt , in that amazing journal which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loved , quotes Legros as saying to him , in 1882 , " Whistler , oni , c'est pas mal . . . c'est de la jolie can-forte d'amateur ! " How , I wonder , could an artist as accomplished as Legros is himself utter a remark like this If there is one thing more than another which is demonstrated by Whistler 's etchings it is that in them he enjoys absolute control of his needle ; that here he is a master from whom no secrets of technique are hid . It is not simply that he is letter-perfect , so to say , that he abides by every canon of the art . It is that from beginning to end his style seems to have been so sinewy , so strong , so wonderfully buoyant . At the outset his line is forcible and clear . It is often deeply bitten , and while he knows well what to omit , he gives one an impression ? notably in the Thames set ? of objects patiently observed and very carefully noted . In his later Venetian studies he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great deal more detail , secures the tenderest atmospheric effects , and , in brief , refines his art without losing any strength . All through the long succession of plates he enchants us with his faculty for extorting from his material the loveliest webs of line , the loveliest passages of tone . He is superb in composition , whether he be etching the old tenements that line the Thames , with rocking masts and the delicate lines of rigging to break the monotony of their homely fa ? ades , or is commemorating some infinitely more romantic theme in France or Venice . He is always sufficiently pictorial , no matter what his subject may be , and always conscious of the special quality of the etcher 's art , knowing how to adjust his material to it , seeking the lines that will best form an interesting arabesque . His style is unique . No etcher in the past , not Rembrandt or Claude ; no one in his own time , not Mdryon or Haden , ever saw his subject quite as he saw it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those masters have qualities which he lacked . We have observed how Rembrandt outsoars him in intellectual and spiritual grasp . Whistler could never interpret landscape as Haden has interpreted it . But in strength and beauty of line , in brilliance of style , Whistler 's etchings form a body of work with which the masterpieces of Rembrandt and Haden are alone worthy to be grouped . I have seen , written by him on a proof of one of Rembrandt 's noblest portraits , these words : " Without flaw . Beautiful as a Greek marble or a canvas by Tintoret . A masterpiece in all its elements , beyond which there is nothing . " The familiar butterfly affixed to this tribute carried a discomfiting suggestion with it . Could any of the works of art bearing that dainty emblem deserve such heroic praise ? Perhaps not . Whistler never rose , like Rembrandt , to the heroic plane . Nevertheless , so far as they go , his etchings are " without flaw . " In all the years from which they date he was steadily painting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon went to live in London , where he made his home for many years . He could hardly expect to find in Chelsea a more sympathetic environment than he had found in Paris , but too much has been made of what his surroundings may have signified to him in either place . For a painter of his predilections the only things needful were a 832 Whistler . studio and an occasional patron . He did not paint French life when he was in France . He never thought of painting English life when lie came to England , but went on along the lines laid down in those Symphonies in White to which I have already referred . Some commentators have been astonished at his intimacy with Rossetti . It was entirely natural . The fact that they did not paint in the same fashion is beside the question . Where they were absolutely united was in preferring , as artists , a kind of curtained existence , in which they could ignore the claims of the schools and the world in general , and make pictures as far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so many pieces of Oriental porcelain . Rossetti , embracing with enthusiasm the pre-Raphaelite ideal of fidelity to nature , never took the trouble to learn how to paint , so that he might put the truth on canvas with some degree of accuracy . He cared not for the scenes outside his house and garden , but for the scenes in the poets . He dreamed iridescent dreams , and , reflecting them in his work after his own self-willed esoteric fashion , was content . He and Whistler must have been vastly pleased with themselves as they stood aloof from everything that was making the history of their time , and , with scornful chuckles , cultivated each his hidden plot of ground . Whistler was the surer of remaining comparatively undisturbed in his seclusion because of his rare gift for quarreling . He was a difficult man to get on with , and the wrecks of friendships were scattered through his career in appalling profusion . It is said that there still survives somewhere a portrait he painted of the late Mr. Naylor Leyland , after he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house , and had parted from him in a rage . In this portrait the mild-mannered collector is given horns and hoofs , and is transformed into a ramping devil . True or not , the tale does no injustice to Whistler , who loved the fray , and , wiles offended , was capable of taking a sting . ing revenge . He made himself feared , in short , and , even in the midst of society , that must have helped to create a spiritual loneliness for him . If he suffered any loss thereby he never knew it . supremely self-centred , ? " You can not serve the Republic , . .. and Whistler , " he once wrote to a friend , ? lie threw himself into his work and exploited his own ideas with an absorption and a con. viction of right which we can not but admire . The results of his labors , portraits , marines , and pictures like the Fireworks at Cremorne , which proved such a memorable stumbling-block to Mr. Ruskin . were , in general , slow in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that left him handicapped , as it were , and caused him to proceed upon a canvas , as a rule , with the greatest deliberation ? Or was it that the subtlety of tone he was always seeking could not be attained at a stroke ? There are stories of the miraculous facility with which he could paint a picture , of the consummate skill with which he could brush in a detail , without a moment 's hesitation , leaving it perfect . It will be remembered that at the Ruskin trial be testified that he had painted the Fireworks at Cremorne in " about a day . " The point , he thought , was Ministerial , for in asking two hundred guineas for the picture he argued that he was asking to be paid , not for the work of a day . but for " the knowledge of a lifetime . " The question , however , of whether lie was a rapid or a slow painter , a sure Or a hesitating one , is interesting , for it really bears upon the essential character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to technique , with the grand masters that he is to he grouped . One of the traits of those masters is a certain momentum . as of a creative force passing through the world . boldly , majestically , and leaving land- // marks in its wake . It is not Rubens alone who suggests this idea of propulsive energy and great weight , or Michael Annie , or Gals . Even the serene Velasquez suggests it . We have all heard a great deal about Whistler 's resemblance to the Spaniard , and it is there , but not where the central springs of action . the very divine spark of genius and its free fruitful movements , are concerned . The greatest art , no matter how complex in design it may be , is unmistakably spontaneous . Whistler 's art was not of that highest order ; it is more apt to suggest the slow and painstaking building up of an effect . Where von find the resemblance between him and Velasquez is in the gradations that he gets out of blacks and grays and whites ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a neutral background ; in the texture of his color throughout . We may go further and say that be load a sense of values akin to that of Velasquez himself . But if we keep in mind what Whistler was driving at , and what he actually accomplished , we must admit that a meaning he never intended can easily be read into his much quoted retort , " Why drag in Velasyeah " For one thing , Velasquez , as Whistler himself pointed out , " made his people live within their frames , and send epos their legs . " That was not precisely Whistler 's own aim , except in a few rare instances . His figures are not SO much human beings , living within Their frames and standing upon their legs , as they are lovely apparitions , alluring visions of charming women glidingarmigh some place of dim lights and hovering shadows . The portrait of Lady Moan . known as the Harmony in Pink and Gray , may or may not be a good portrait . Tlo ere is no mistaking its beauty as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its purity and sweetness . Again , in lower keys , the portrait of Miss Rosa Corder . Arrangement in Black and Brown , and the study in the same colors // known as The Fur Jacket , a similar impression of something faint , elusive , and most delicately sensuous is conveyed . There are other portraits which recur to me , particularly La Dame au Brodequin Jaune , and the dainty portrait of Miss Alexander , Harmony in Gray and Green , a picture of childhood , which has no parallel in modern art save Mr. Sargent 's Little Miss Beatrice Goelet . But I pass over all these studies of blooming femininity ; I pass over such delightfully decorative schemes as The Balcony , The Music Room , The Gold Screen , and The Lange Leizen of the Six Marks , to reach the two most renowned canvases that Whistler painted ? his portrait of mother , which now hangs in the Luxembourg , and the portrait of Carlyle in old age , which , in recent years , has been acquired by the Corporation of Glasgow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ masterpieces than by saying that when one has seen them one instinctively revises his impression of all the painter 's other canvases . The bulk of his work is charming . The Portrait of the Artist 's Mother and the Thomas Carlyle are much more than that . To realize the difference is to see the unwisdom of being stampeded by a man 's fame into accepting everything he does as necessarily a triumph of genius . It is well to acclaim the genius of Whistler . We only darken counsel when we grow hysterical over it . For my own part I believe that his numerous portraits of women , while sure to survive as paintings of great individuality , and of a very delicate beauty , would not carry Whistler 's name unquestioned down to posterity if he had not also painted his portrait of his mother , and the Carlyle . Those rank him with the old masters . The others , if they formed Isis sole legacy to the galleries of the world , would keep him among the men just below the best . The reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at things as they are . The mark of the great picture in every epoch has been a mark of organic balance . The painter has realized his conception with absolute felicity . Nothing could be added . Nothing could be taken away . Everything in the picture , composition , drawing , modeling , color , the personality of the sitter , when the picture is a portrait , contributes to one end , and that is a unit of beauty . Can it be said of any of Whistler 's portraits of young women that they fulfill these conditions as the portrait of his mother fulfills them ? He may have denied a thousand times our right to interest ourselves in his mother 's personality . Long after her name and his , perhaps , have vanished from the frame , men would look on this canvas and prize it as the portrait of an individual . It would be the same with the Carlyle ; characterization is of immense importance in both works . But it is the rounded perfection of them that I would chiefly emphasize , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whistler has given form to his idea . The curtain and framed picture which figure in the background of the portrait of his mother , the two pictures and the butterfly introduced for the same decorative purpose in the Carlyle , give us no sense of artificiality , of painfully sought effect , that we feel in looking at so many of what I may designate as his minor achievements . In his two unqualifiedly great paintings he rises to a seriousness which he was only too seldom disposed to cultivate . In them he shows the " noble dignity " which he attributed to Rembrandt . Survey his work as a figure painter from beginning to end and it seems as if all his life he were trying for something wholly fine , came near it again and again , but only twice , when he painted the portraits I have chosen , saw his heart 's desire satisfied . I say " his heart 's desire " because at bottom he is just as faithful to himself in his pair of masterpieces as in his other paintings . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his cherished theories . The two portraits are as much " arrangements " as anything he ever painted , ? only they are more completely successful as such . He is the butterfly here as elsewhere . This , indeed , ought never to be forgotten , for even when he holds his own amongst the old masters . it is through his possession of a quality quite different from that to which they , in the main , owe their preeminence . He is not strong as they are strong , he has not their conquering might . Some one has defined taste as the feminine of genius , and Whistler is the incarnation of taste . Once , talking with a companion about the energy and skill shown by certain painters conspicuous in modern art , he remarked , with a gentle deprecating humor that robbed his words of all complacence , that while he admired the men in question , he could not but feel that he had put something into his own work which theirs lacked . He called it distinction , and the epithet is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us off our feet , but with a quietude and a persuasiveness that , in these days especially , are above rubies , they exert the spell of high distinction . There have been more masculine painters ; but none has surpassed him in expressing on canvas the quintessence of refinement . The dangers to which an exemplar of this kind of art is exposed I have emphasized in glancing at Whistler 's minor portraits , those curiously " precious " productions that so narrowly escape unreality , because in portraiture an excessively decorative and too exquisite method is the more seriously to be questioned . In his Nocturnes , on the other hand , and in his other daring variations on themes provided by scenes oat of doors , Whistler has far less to fear . In them he is untroubled ay any question of form , he is not handicapped by the necessity of giving even an approxe mately clear statement of facts . Returning again to his testimony in the suit // he brought against Ruskin , we find him admitting . as to the famous Fireworks picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it would certainly bring about nothing but disappointment on the part of the beholders . " On the same occasion , when his Nocturne in Blue and Silver was produced in court , he said , " It represents Battersea Bridge by moonlight , " but when Baron Huddleston asked Mtn if he would describe the picture as a correct representation of the subject , he replies ! , ' I did not intend it to be a correct ' portrait of the bridge . It is only a moonlight scene , and the pier in the centre of the picture may not be like the piers at Battersea Bridge as you know them in broad daylight . As to what the picture represents that depends upon who looks at it . To some persons it may represent all that is intended ; to others it may represent nothing . . . . My whole scheme was only to bring about a certain harmony of color . " With such an ambhion it is clearly unnecessary for a painter to give any such place to the truths of nature as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members of the Barbiroe school . Nature , in fact , merely provides hint with an excuse for the exercise of his virtuosity . Whistler is not the only modern painter representing this principle . Monticelli , in his studies of sylvan glades obscurely peopled with shapes that might be those of fair women or fairer wraiths , invented chromatic splendors which , at their best , are as distinguished in their way as Whistler 's elegiac harmonies . Other men of lesser ability have worked in the same vein . The special value of IVIdstler 's Nocturnes resides in the ravishing beauty of their color , the poetry of their sentiment , and the piquancy of their style . He could , when he chose , paint a sparkling little water color of the sea . not only beautiful but true ; he could paint a picture like his Thames in Ice , as realistic as a work of Courbet 's . But he was happiest in those paintings , like the Crepuscule in Flesh Color and Green , Valparaiso ; or the Nocturne , Gray and Gold , ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene is altogether subsidiary to our enjoyment of the color in which he has enveloped it . The two pyrotechnical nocturnes , The Fire Wheel and The Falling Rocket , though not perhaps his finest works in this field , are certainly the most instructive , for in them he carried his theories to their ultimate conclusion , eschewing all tangible facts , and aiming at his effect almost as though he had no pictorial intention at all , but were covering a panel with color as an Oriental craftsman powders a box with gold . Painting these Nocturnes and Symphonies and Harmonies , he gave to art a new sensation , one in which the more esoteric charm of his genius is extraordinarily beguiling . Incidentally he showed to the world his rare versatility . But still he was not satisfied , and having given his measure in painting and etching , he insisted upon being recognized as a writer . He was a witty man , and he wrote like one . Two books stand to his credit . The Gentle Art of Making Enemies , which he published @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his Ten O'Clock lecture , and a quantity of squibs and letters indited in scorn of his critics and other persons who had annoyed him . In The Baronet and the Butterfly : a Valentine with a Verdict , which dates from 1899 , he set forth at considerable length the details of the litigation in which he was involved with Sir William Eden over a portrait he had painted of the baronet 's wife . This second book has no serious claim upon the reader . It records an episode in which the artist shone with a good deal less than his accustomed brilliance , and it shows him , to tell the truth , in no very engaging mood . The Gentle Art of Making Enemies , however , is sure to be preserved , for it contains many of Whistler 's ideas on art , and is , to boot , abundantly amusing . The ideas signify , 836 Whistler . first and last , that the artist is an isolated phenomenon , seeking beauty for its own sake , and quite beyond the understand-beg of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be thankful for the privilege . The critic , by the way , is always a " There never was an artistic period . There never was an Art-loving nation . " In all ages the artist has been an unexplainable gift of God to mankind , ? though from the way in which Whistler leaves mankind out of the question it might perhaps be more accurate to interpret him as arguing that the artist simply " happens , " and is his own sole reason for existing . Art , he says , " is a goddess of dainty thought , ? reticent of habit , abjuring all obtrusiveness , purposing in no way to better others . " Her leading principle in the pursuit of beauty is one of selection . " Nature contains the elements , in color and form , of all pictures , as the keyboard contains the notes of all music . . . . To say to the painter that Nature is to be taken as she is , is to say to the player , that he may sit on the piano . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own work , and restated elements in the broad philosophy of art which any one might learn from intelligent study of the masters , but which it was well to have expressed as deftly and pungently as he expressed them . The Bible of Art , he once called his book , in half-mocking , half-proud humor . It is not that , but it is unquestionably a stimulating volume . The epigrams it contains , the steel points on which he impaled his enemies , are glittering and sometimes venomous , but though Whistler had a malice all his own , his humor is so delightful that even his victims must have enjoyed many of his thrusts . He had a rare gift for repartee . When he talked of the " shock of surprise that was Balaam 's when the first great critic proffered his opinion , " and a commentator in Vanity Fair , turning to the Scriptures , gleefully pointed out that " the Ass was . right , although , nay , because he was an Ass , " it took him but a moment to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that historically you are right .

" In the catalogue for the exhibition of etchings which he held in London in 1883 , he created much mirth by placing under the titles quotations from his crit. ics , and very comical was the result . One of the gentlemen cited , Mr. Frederkk Wedmore , complained that he had been misrepresented , that he had been quoted as using the word " understand " when he had really written " understate . " This ? tier promptly apologized . " My care- lessness is culpable , " he said , " and the misprint without excuse ; for naturally I have all along known , and the typographer should have been duly warned , that with Mr. Wedmore , as with his brethren , it is always a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of understand . ing . " How many more instances of his readiness and ruthlessness might be given I The list is endless , for not only is The Gentle Art of Making Enemies packed with sharp sayings , but all his life Whistler barbed his words , and hudreds of his witticisms have been widely circulated , either in print or in the talk of those who have known him . Naturally his diabolical instinct for the biting phrase has reacted upon the public estimate of his character as a man , and in many quarters the accepted view is that which Degas is said to have once expressed to his face , that one would hardly suspect from his talk and demeanor that he was a great artist . That , I confess , was my OM first his pression of him , for as he minced about his drawing-room in the Rue de Bac our summer morning a dozen years ago . flour ishing a bird cage before my eyes like a dancer flirting a fan , he seemed as nn. like cm eminent painter as any one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ froth . which disappeared as one came to know him better . He was , even in his gravest moments , a distinctly picturesque figure . slight , erect , and with gestures of the most birdlike vivacity . Yet he hail withal admirable dignity , and to the picturesqueness of his personality there was added the charm of his talk . At one moment most suavely courteous , at another vehement to the point of rudeness. he captivated you often by what he hail to say . and entertained you always by the way in which he said it . Of course lie made enemies , but , equally of course , Ihe made many friends , and kept more of them than , with his pose of defiance toward everybody , he was perhaps will-in ; to admit . " A friend , my clear x : " he once wrote to one who had rendered Idne a service , " a tried friend : I doubt if I shall know how to deal with him : I have no habit , ? and you might alter the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death he wrote , " I learn that I have . lurking in London , still a friend . though for the life of me I can not remember his name . " That was only pretty Fanny 's way . The making of enemies indubitably afforded him a kind of fearful joy . but there were lovable traits in his nature , kindness , and generosity , and affect ion for children , and to lay stress anon his quarrels is to do a deep injustice to his memory . When Do Maurier sneered at Whistler , under the name of doe Sibley. in Trilby , he did more than commit a breach of good breeding ; he showed how thoroughly he had misunderstood the comrade of his Bohemian clays in Paris . It would be absurd to deny Whistler 's cruelty , or his occasional lapses from good taste . He pursued some of the objects of his wrath with more tern ' per than manners . The Baronet and the Butterfly especially contains some striking evidence in this direction , and The Gentle Art of Making Enemies is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is certain , however , that , as time goes on , Whistler 's character , being more clearly understood , will be more sympathetically regarded . His fame as an artist is already fixed , and has , indeed , been fixed for a long time , though he liked to keep up the fiction that the world was unworthy of him , ? it was part of his plan of aloofness , ? and there are quaint admirers of his who persist in talking , and writing , as if , after all his efforts , he had made no impression upon his time . He was never popular as Leighton or Bouguereau was popular . It was not until late in his career that he received high prices for his pictures . But - Whistler is the last artist in the world for us to consider with reference to what ordinarily constitutes popularity . He did not paint for the many ; he painted , if ever a man did , for the few ; and he never lacked the appreciation which must have been dearer to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far back as 1872 , when he sent his portrait of his mother to the Royal Academy , and it was threatened with rejection , Sir William Boxall declared that he would withdraw from the council if it were not accepted . There is an anecdote of his going down to Hughenden , without waiting for the formality of an invitation , to paint Lord Beaconsfield 's portrait . The great man did not rise to the situation , but he gave - Whistler his friendship . ( I can not omit the episode of the Prime Minister 's walking arm in arm with the painter down Whitehall , and Whistler 's nest , " If only my creditors could see " ) He knew hundreds of the celebrities of his day , and many of them understood and valued him . Why , therefore , should we bewail his sad fate , talking of him as a man who had suffered much ? If he had times of privation , so have other great men had them . Others have known what it has meant to have the bailiff at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a singularly rich and happy one . He did the work he wanted to do , and did it in his own way . He had hosts of friends , ? when he lost them it was usually through his own fault ; and he did not have long to wait for the approval of his fellow painters . For a generation his influence has been acknowledged in the studios , and probably no artist of his time has received more frequently the sincerest form of flattery . His etchings have long been prized by connoisseurs and assiduously collected ; the moment it was announced that he had taken up lithography , some eight or ten years ago , his sketches in this medium were at once eagerly sought . His paintings all found owners , and when the sale of what he left in his studio takes place , we may be sure that it will be well attended , and that competition for his works will be fierce . His two best portraits hang , as I have noted , in the Luxembourg and in the Public Gallery at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boston Museum of Fine Arts has his Blacksmith and one or two other things , and elsewhere in America numbers of his pictures may be found in private galleries . The critics he contemned may in some cases , at the outset , have undervalued him . But there has mover been anything visible in the public prints even remotely resembling the general ignorance of his art , and the foolish din taste for it , which he liked to attribute to the critics , pretending that they were arrayed in a conspiracy of dullness and fatuity against Mm . He was eulogized everywhere when he died . He had been eulogized for years before the end came , He passed from the scene full of years and honors , secure of the applause of his peers and of that of a much larger section of the multitude than , with his strange temperament , it would have suit ed him to admit . He leaves no school , but that is natural enough . His art is inimitable . He could help greatly to purify the taste of his time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , some rab uable hints on color , and he made the " arrangement " in portraiture popular . But his influence , though wide , as I have said , has been more a corrective than a constructive force . Imitation of hini led to nothing more than ? imitation . His is not the kind of art that , imposing itself upon men , starts an evolutionary movement . He meant it to exist in and for itself alone , and so it does , like some rare orchid that has no prototype and can have no successor .
