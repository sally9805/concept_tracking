The scene is a tent at a garden fte for charity on the estate of Mr. Botes , in Hertfordshire , England , on a Saturday in July . Weeks and Hallen , two young footmen in rather splendid liveries , are arranging the tent for the use of a fortune teller . A small table stands in the center with a chair on each side . The place is decorated with greens WEEKS Who is this yere Gypsy fortune teller anyway ? HALLEN The American what 's staying here  --  Miss Sheldon . Ai n't you ' eard ' em talking at table ? WEEKS No , I ai n't ' eard . HALLEN This is a queer family we 're in anyway , however you looks at it . WEEKS ( With emphasis . ) They pay wages ! HALLEN Faugh ! Why not ? A millionaire brewer and a German to boot , ought to be bigger'n they is . WEEKS ' E ai n't no German ! HALLEN Well ! you beat me ! Anybody would think you was extra help in for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there when ' e was ten and came to London , and made ' is fortune ' ere ! An ' now ' e 's got the idea of being a Baron . Hold Botesy wants to be a hancestor , that 's what ! See ? p. 3 VICTORIA ( Outside . ) And this is Jo 's booth , Father  --  The Gypsy 's tent . ( She enters from the left followed by Botes and Cyril , who has a dog with him ) Finished , Hallen ? HALLEN Quite , Miss . MR . BOTES Well , this looks all right . CYRIL Do n't it ? I got it up from a picture of one I saw the Prince of Wales had at Marlborough House ! VICTORIA ( Laughing . ) Then it 's sure to suit you and father ! MR . BOTES Do you think it 's rich enough , Cyril ? Ought n't you have a little gold furniture ? Remember we 're entertaining royalty for the first time , and we do n't want to mince matters . VICTORIA Give them plenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . And it 's a good chance to advertise the Botes Brand ! CYRIL Sis ! Do n't be so funny ! VICTORIA Father , if you ever get the title you are so mad about , I propose for our family crest  --  MR . BOTES What ? CYRIL ( Quickly . ) Do n't ask her ! p. 4 VICTORIA A glass of lager , between two money bags rampant , with a crown of hope ; and underneath for a motto , " There is no fly in our amber . " It will sound better of course , in Latin ! MR . BOTES Well , you can make fun of me , Vic , but it is the serious ambition of my life , and I 'm going to get a title if there 's one for sale in Eastphalia ! CYRIL That 's the spirit , Dad ! MR . BOTES For any price I can command . CYRIL Right ho , old Pops ! VICTORIA It will take three generations to make your brand-new title worth bearing . It 'll smell of varnish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! If I get a Barony from King George , I shall choose the name of my old home . " Baron Arnsberg " !  --  has n't that a fine old flavor ? VICTORIA ( Sniffing . ) Not to me ! I taste rosin ! CYRIL But what I want to know is , why should it be all right socially , to sell bad champagne , and all wrong to make good beer ? VICTORIA Father , you 'll never get any title to compare with your old one . MR . BOTES " Word of honor Botes. " p. 5 VICTORIA Yes ! " Word of honor Botes . " MR . BOTES Well , that came to me really from my father . Just as I want to give a Barony to Cyril . Father 's simple word in Arnsberg was as good as any document that was ever signed and sealed and witnessed . It was the catechism Father taught me ! Never to break your word when once it was given . ( Rising as he continues . ) Be mighty careful how you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost you , stand by it . No matter what your temptation do n't break your word , break your neck rather . VICTORIA Hurrah for Grandfather ! CYRIL Out of date now . If you 'd started your business on that principle nowadays , old chap , we 'd have to drink our own beer and pay for it . MR . BOTES Speaking of paying for things  --  I wish Mrs. Sheldon 'd pay for her automobile . The Pushard people wrote me they must hold me responsible , as I introduced her , and she pays no attention to their bill . I suppose it 's all right ? VICTORIA Of course . Jo told me she had a big fortune from her first husband . CYRIL I say , the Prince is awfully gone on Jo , ai n't he ? But he would n't marry her , would he ? VICTORIA Why not ? p. 6 MR . BOTES I suppose he 'd make her his morganatic wife . CYRIL Well , what 's the matter with that ? MR . BOTES Do n't work well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prince Jerome Bonaparte when he married a Baltimore lady that way . CYRIL Did he ? VICTORIA It would never do for Jo ! She does n't share your and Cyril 's titled ambitions ! She has high ideas and high ideals . MR . BOTES I do n't think one season on the Riviera goes quite to the bottom of any young lady 's character . It seems to me Mrs. Sheldon knows her way about pretty well . VICTORIA Jo is a very different thing from her stepmother . CYRIL Rather ! MR . BOTES Well , all the same I think Miss Jo is  --  SHELDON ( Outside . ) Hush ! Do n't say it ! I am in hearing  --  unless it was something very nice . Of course if it was something very flattering , you can say it and I 'll wait outside . If it was something disagreeable then I 'll come right in and stop you . MR . BOTES It was very disagreeable . SHELDON I do n't believe you ! She enters from the left in gypsy costume , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her dress ) p. 7 MR . BOTES Splendid ! Splendid ! CYRIL Bravo ! Bravo ! VICTORIA Lovely , Jo ! Lovely ! SHELDON Do you really like it ? ( They all exclaim again and try to see the back . ) No , no , you must n't look at the back . It is n't finished there ,  --  Vic , go around to the back like a dear and see what 's the matter . CYRIL Vic is very near sighted . SHELDON Oh , is she ! ! MR . BOTES And very extravagant . She never could make both ends meet ,  --  it takes her father ! SHELDON Oh , does it ! how is it , Vic ? VICTORIA It needs a pin , that 's all . Has anyone got a pin ? SHELDON Gentlemen , here 's your chance . Has either of you a pin ? ( Botes and Cyril both look around in mock eagerness ) CYRIL Here 's a hammer and tacks ! SHELDON Wo n't do . VICTORIA Never mind , I 've got one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , gentlemen , for your kind assistance . p. 8 HALLEN ( Entering , to Botes . ) A telegram for you , sir . SHELDON ( Quickly , without thinking . ) Perhaps Prince Adolf is n't coming . VICTORIA ( Laughing . ) Dear me ! How anxious we are ! CYRIL Oh ! Would n't it be awful ! ( Jo throws the cards at Cyril . ) MR . BOTES Really , Miss Jo , I 'm apt to receive one or two telegrams in the course of a day . Listen ! " I will give to myself the pleasure of to bring my aunt the Grand Duchess of Hohenhetstein and her suite at the Fte when you shall kindly arrange to receive . " VICTORIA Oh , heavens ! MR . BOTES " My regards to your daughter . Adolf . " SHELDON Oh , you are a wretch . Wait till I tell your fortune today . Then I 'll punish you . MR . BOTES ( Going out toward the left . ) Come along , Cyril , we must make arrangements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be on hand . " VICTORIA Oh , mercy  --  I suppose so . CYRIL What I want to know is  --  has n't she come to look Miss Jo over ? p. 9 SHELDON Look here  --  I 'm what they call at home an athletic girl ; and if you keep on like this I 'll forget myself and go for you ! CYRIL I wish you would . If you 'd grapple me once you could hang on as long as you 'd want . I 'd like it . VICTORIA Where 'll you sit ? SHELDON Here .  --  and he there . VICTORIA He ? SHELDON ( Embarrassed . ) I mean he or she or they , whoever is having their hand told . VICTORIA ( Laughing . ) Oh , Jo  --  can you read hands at all ? SHELDON No  --  not really ! I just guess at it . I make them look me straight in the eyes  --  VICTORIA Oh , well ! then of course they give up everything ! SHELDON And then I sort of feel my way and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 've got a perfect plan ! I shall be outside the tent there , and can easily see those coming from the other way . Cyril is to take his time giving them their tickets , while I come in and give you points quickly and when I ring the bell , I rush out , and Cyril lets the victim in ! ( She waits for an answer , but Jo is preocupied and looking into space . ) Do n't you think that 's a fine plan ? ( Then receiving no answer . ) Jo ! ( She turns Jo around . ) You have n't heard a word . p. 10 SHELDON Yes I have , really . You 're going to come in and tell me things , I know . Vic ! Tell me something new ! VICTORIA What ? SHELDON Of course you 're all only teasing me about Prince Adolf . You do n't really think I care for him . Do you ? VICTORIA O no ! not at all , Jo ! Not at all ! SHELDON Well ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him  --  do you ? VICTORIA ( Seriously . ) I do n't know a woman in London who 'd have held her own with him as you have . SHELDON I 've never thrown myself at any man 's head , not at any rate until he 'd thrown himself at my feet . VICTORIA Has n't Prince Adolf ? SHELDON Not at my feet yet ,  --  he may be about my knees  --  but not in earnest . I 'm sure he does n't care a rap about me . VICTORIA My dear , I 'll bet you a five pound note for the Eastphalian sufferers , that he talks , eats , drinks and sleeps , laughs , sings , nothing but you ! SHELDON ( Embracing her . ) Vic Botes , you 're the dearest girl that ever lived . VICTORIA Oh , am I ? p. 11 SHELDON Yes , and if it was n't for you I think I 'd take the very first boat back to America ! I 'm homesick . VICTORIA I should n't call it " Home " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for any personal reasons , you know that , it 's just my curiosity 's aroused ;  --  did a Crown Prince of any nation ever marry an American girl ? VICTORIA Of course I understand that your question is purely impersonal ! but I ca n't say that I ever did hear of a case . In fact , my dear , I do n't think an heir to a throne could marry anyone not of royal blood , except in one way . SHELDON What way ? VICTORIA Morganatically . SHELDON Morganatically ! You mean one wife and then marry someone also for Queen ? VICTORIA Yes . SHELDON Well ! The only American girl that sort of a Crown Prince could get would come from Utah . You can take your little Jo 's word for that . VICTORIA Of course a Prince can give up his throne . An Austrian Grand Duke became plain Monsieur Somebody or other three or four years ago to marry a Swiss girl , and they say they 're the happiest couple in the world . p. 12 SHELDON It would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , to give up a throne ? VICTORIA Not if he loved you . SHELDON No , I 'd give up fifty ! I 'd be glad of the chance to have something big to do to show how much I loved . Have you ever been in love , Vic ? VICTORIA No , men bore me . SHELDON Bore you ? VICTORIA Yes ! I think they 're the most selfish , egotistical creatures . SHELDON Oh , come , Vic ! VICTORIA Want everything for themselves  --  SHELDON Wait a minute , my dear  --  has one wanted you yet ? VICTORIA No , thank heaven . SHELDON Oh well , just wait till one does , and then you 'll thank heaven the other way around . VICTORIA How do you know ? unless you 're in love yourself . SHELDON Oh , I just imagine . ( Mrs. Sheldon enters , speaking as she does so , with a letter in her hand ) MRS . SHELDON Anything private , or may I come in ? p. 13 VICTORIA and Jo . ( Together . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SHELDON They 're in great excitement at the house getting ready to receive the Grand Duchess with Prince Adolf ,  --  and I 've just had a dear letter from your father , Jo . VICTORIA I suppose I ought to see if I can help . SHELDON When am I to see the rest of the Fte ? VICTORIA I 'll come back for you or send Cyril . ( Exit ) MRS . SHELDON Your father is n't very well , Jo . SHELDON Oh , Mother Lena ! MRS . SHELDON Not seriously ill , but I confess I 'm a little worried . He writes " I 'll be all right I know in a day or two ; I expect the next English mail if it brings letters from you both will finish my cure . Especially if it tells me you are both coming home . Is n't it most time ? You 've been gone five months , three weeks , two days , and eighteen hours ! Give my very best love to my girl , Jo ; I know someone 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine for life , Lena , and I 'll never let you go away again without me , law office or no law office . " MRS . SHELDON I can tell his girl Jo one thing , a woman is very lucky to have the devoted love of a man like your father . p. 14 SHELDON And his girl Jo can tell you , her dear father is lucky to have a woman like you , Mother Lena , to make him so happy . Bless you for it . MRS . SHELDON Bless you ! Jo dear , of course you know what everyone here is talking about ? SHELDON No ! What ? MRS . SHELDON Prince Adolf ! SHELDON ( Roguishly . ) What about Prince Adolf ? MRS . SHELDON Miss Josephine Sheldon ! I was not born yesterday , and I ought to know what I 'm talking about when I say this young foreigner is head over heels in love with you ! SHELDON Mother Lena , he 's only amusing himself , he 's not in earnest  --  any more than I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? SHELDON ( Hesitating . ) I do n't know . MRS . SHELDON Where ignorance is bliss ' t is folly to be  --  SHELDON Perhaps  --  but Mother Lena  --  he could n't marry me ! He must marry some Princess . MRS . SHELDON If he loves you he will find a way . It would be a great match , Jo . p. 15 SHELDON That means nothing to me . I will only marry for one thing  --  Love ! and I could never love a man whom I did n't honor down to the ground . MRS . SHELDON You must n't ask too much . Men are human . SHELDON So am I. I do n't ask for an angel , I would n't want one to live with  --  not in this world . But the man I love must want me , and only me , above everything and everybody else , as I shall want him . He must make me believe he would never lie to me as I would never lie to him . He must make me feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he were there with me ; that there is no such thing as loneliness for him or me in life with our love between us , and no comradeship for either of us in the world without each other . That 's what love means to me , Mother Lena . MRS . SHELDON ( Meaningly . ) When did you think out all this ? SHELDON ( Smiling and turning away embarrassed . ) Lately ! MRS . SHELDON Jo ! SHELDON I know it 's a pretty big order ! MRS . SHELDON Bend your head down ! Here is a present for you , to bring you good luck today . SHELDON ( As she does so . ) But you must n't give me so many presents , and such handsome ones . It reminds me  --  I opened a bill that came for you today by mistake . p. 16 MRS . SHELDON A bill ? SHELDON From Streeter , the Bond Street Jeweller . It looked like " Miss Sheldon " on the envelope . Mother Lena , it 's for 3500 pounds  --  over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for payment . MRS . SHELDON It 's an old , old bill we 've had some discussion about . SHELDON It said for articles bought since April 8th , this year . MRS . SHELDON ( A little coldly . ) You read it through very carefully . SHELDON Naturally  --  I thought it for me . MRS . SHELDON Well , I have my own reasons for not paying at present . SHELDON But it does n't somehow seem to me quite right  --  not square . MRS . SHELDON Jo ! SHELDON I 'm sorry , but you know I always say just what I feel . Does Father know about it ? MRS . SHELDON No  --  and must n't . Remember , he 's ill . SHELDON Mother Lena , you 've not been speculating ? MRS . SHELDON No , no ! I tell you I have my own reasons for not paying Streeter 's bill . p. 17 HALLEN ( Entering . ) Mrs. Sheldon ? MRS . SHELDON A gentleman to see me ? HALLEN Yes , madam , Hi brought him ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and show him in here . HALLEN Yes , madam . MRS . SHELDON It 's a man I want to see on business  --  a lawyer from home . SHELDON Vic is probably ready to show me around by now . MRS . SHELDON Now do n't worry about that bill . SHELDON But it 's such an awful sum ! MRS . SHELDON When I tell you to trust me it 's all right . SHELDON But why run up a bill for so valuable a pearl necklace or for such a tiara , if you ca n't pay , and where are they ? MRS . SHELDON When I tell you it 's all right ? SHELDON Forgive me  --  yes , I know I must be wrong . MRS . SHELDON There , that 's sensible . And now I want you to do me a little favor , a little joke I want to play on Mr. Botes . SHELDON What ? p. 18 MRS . SHELDON You know how eager he is for a title ? SHELDON I think everyone know that ! MRS . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big honor for him in the near future ,  --  SHELDON I see ! The title he 's so crazy about . MRS . SHELDON Of course . You know he hopes to get a barony out of old King George of Eastphalia . SHELDON I 'll find a coronet glued on to his life line ! How old is he ? MRS . SHELDON About sixty something . SHELDON Then I 'll find it right about the middle . The lines make a fool 's cap rather , but it 'll do for Mr. Botes ' crown . Thank you for the chain  --  it 's a beauty  --  but you ought n't  --  MRS . SHELDON Jo ! SHELDON Ought n't to spoil me as you do ! Goodbye . ( Enter HALLEN , followed by WILTON . ) ( Exit Jo . ) HALLEN Mr. Wilton . MRS . SHELDON Those other curtains . ( The whole attitude and expression of Mrs. SHELDON when she is alone , changes . Her face grows hard and worried and her body sinks into an attitude of dejection . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WILTON. ) p. 19 MRS . SHELDON ( Turning pleasantly . ) How do you do ? WILTON How do you do , Mrs. Sheldon ? MRS . SHELDON You know of course , that your business is strictly private  --  and that I do n't wish anyone here to know any details of your errand ? WILTON Oh yes . Mr. Prenter made me quite understand that . MRS . SHELDON Mr. Prenter is well ? WILTON Not altogether  --  he is too much worried . MRS . SHELDON I am sorry ; I sincerely hope , for my own sake , that the bank 's affairs are in good condition . WILTON Mrs. Sheldon , I am Mr. Prenter 's lawyer , and I 've been sent over here to come straight to the point . There can be absolutely no more delay or evasion . Unless you can send me back by Tuesday 's steamer from Liverpool with two hundred and fifty thousand dollars for the Central National Bank , Mr. Prenter will be an utterly ruined man , the Examiner will take charge of the bank , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am over here ! You would have to procure extradition papers . WILTON That would be easy . Meanwhile you would have the disgrace of exposure all the same , for yourself and for your husband . p. 20 MRS . SHELDON Mr. Sheldon knows nothing whatever about my business . WILTON He would have to prove it . We have his signature on some of your papers . MRS . SHELDON I got those from him by deception . He thought he was witnessing mortgages . WILTON Well , that 's not our business . MRS . SHELDON Why does n't Mr. Prenter help himself ? After all he 's more criminally responsible than I. He 's President of the bank and has made me these loans illegally without the knowledge of the other directors . To save himself he ought  --  WILTON He ca n't ! All he can raise is one hundred thousand dollars  --  which is not enough to carry on the business of the bank . He 's a desperate , repentant man , Mrs. Sheldon , and he 's made up his mind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you and he suffer , unless you can furnish two hundred and fifty thousand more  --  MRS . SHELDON I came over here in the hopes of raising the money , and if I have n't sent it , it 's because I 've failed . I 've worked like a slave over here . I 've bought jewels I could n't pay for , and given them as security in one direction , I 've borrowed twice what sums I could on the strength of my letters of introduction , and on the social success of my step-daughter . And do you know how much I have managed to scrape together ? Twelve thousand pounds ! Sixty thousand dollars ! not a cent more ! p. 21 WILTON It 's worse than ruin to you , Mrs. Sheldon.  --  It means prison . MRS . SHELDON Do n't ! Do n't ! You go too far when you say that to me . I acted in good faith with Mr. Prenter . WILTON Bah ! I do n't believe in you , Mrs. Sheldon . I believe these securities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me ? MRS . SHELDON ( Rising , almost in tears . ) How dare you ? ( Then controlling herself . ) Mr. Prenter controlled the bank funds ! I did n't ! He was willing to accept the usurious interest I promised ! Save your threats for your client , not me , Mr. Wilton  --  and cable him today that he shall have the two hundred and fifty thousand dollars . WILTON You said as much before . MRS . SHELDON And I say it again . When must you sail back with the money ? WILTON Tuesday noon . MRS . SHELDON I will have definite news for you by Monday ; we return to town after tomorrow . WILTON Will your definite news be in a cash form ? MRS . SHELDON More than likely . WILTON It will be somewhat necessary , as I hope I have made myself clear . p. 22 MRS . SHELDON I do n't want to hear what Mr. Prenter begged . Cable him  --  " Everything all right . " He must n't make a fool of himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over . Can you find your way back ? There 's a servant who will show you . ( Calling . ) Weeks ! Weeks ! Mr. Prenter will do nothing till he hears from you , you 're sure ? WILTON Yes . ( WEEKS appears in the doorway . ) MRS . SHELDON Weeks , show this gentleman the way back . And , Weeks ? WEEKS Yes , ma'am . MRS . SHELDON Ask Mr. Botes to be so kind as to join me here . WEEKS Here comes Mr. Botes , Madam . ( Exit . ) MRS . SHELDON ( In a conventionally agreeable manner to Wilton . ) Good-bye , Mr. Wilton . Delighted to have seen you  --  WILTON Thank you . ( Exit ) MRS . SHELDON He might want some sort of a guarantee from Jo ! To be sure we were in earnest and meant business . I wonder if he knows her handwriting ? MR . BOTES ( Outside . ) Is Mrs. Sheldon here ? p. 23 WEEKS Yes , sir  --  she was just asking for you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BOTES Mrs. Sheldon , wo n't you help receive her Royal Highness ? MRS . SHELDON Delighted ! But first , Mr. Botes , can you give me just five minutes ? MR .

( She holds out her hand . ) MR . BOTES ( Taking it . ) Mrs. Sheldon ! MRS . SHELDON We 're good friends , I hope ? MR . BOTES So do I. MRS . SHELDON Good . ( With a final grasp of his hand , she drops it . ) You 're a man about forty-five . MR . BOTES Thank you . MRS . SHELDON And I 'm forty . MR . BOTES No ! No ! Not yet . MRS .

BOTES I did n't know you had them in the States , except " Colonel " and " Judge . " MRS . SHELDON No , I 'm serious . I want forty thousands pounds . Would you give it for a title such as you wish ? MR . BOTES Well , Mrs. Sheldon , you rather take my break away . MRS . SHELDON What 's forty thousand pounds to a man with millions if he can satisfy his ambition , and that of his son ? MR . BOTES It 's not the money that staggers me . What title ? How is it possible ? It must be some practical joke of yours and Vic 's . MRS . SHELDON What a practical joke !

SHELDON Jo will give  --  a  --  all that passes between us of course is buried ? p. 25 MR . BOTES I give you my word of honor . MRS . SHELDON Jo will give you a guarantee of a barony among the titles given in celebration of her wedding to the Crown Prince if you will give me the sum I ask for . MR . BOTES You are speaking for her as well as for yourself ? MRS . SHELDON Yes . You let her tell your hand this afternoon . But I need hardly ask you not to discuss the matter with her . If we go on into this I am to be the middle man  --  that Jo insists on . MR . BOTES Well , I ca n't say as I blame her . It means a sort of shaky business for a young lady to go in for . It is n't my daughter 's idea of Miss Jo at all ! I 'm sure if I were to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . SHELDON But you 'll not tell your daughter . MR . BOTES No , I 've given you my word , and that 's my weak point , you know , not to go back on my word . MRS . SHELDON ( Smiling . ) I should call it a strong point . MR . BOTES The marriage would have to be morganatic ? MRS . SHELDON That would n't limit your influence with Prince Adolf ;  --  he loves her ! p. 26 MR . BOTES Oh , I do n't object if Jo does n't . MRS . SHELDON If I give you a paper signed by Jo agreeing to use every influence in her power to have you granted this barony ; to make it a positive request of her husband and her first one . MR . BOTES ( Taking out his pocket book  --  doubtfully . ) Of course that would n't be really any guarantee . MRS . SHELDON Perhaps not legally , but morally . And after all what 's forty thousand pounds to a multi-millionaire to risk ? MR . BOTES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I took that tack . MRS . SHELDON ( Leaving her hand on his arm . ) I know how you love your son  --  think what it will mean to Cyril . MR . BOTES ( Rising . ) But it seems so unlike your daughter . MRS .

BOTES ( Approaching her . ) Well , look here , if you 'll bring me this signed by Miss Jo ,  --  I 'll risk it . p. 27 MRS .

WEEKS ( At the door , hurriedly , excited . ) Beg pardon , they 're passing the lodge , sir . MR . BOTES Good Lord ! Where 's my hat ? SHELDON Lena put me up to teasing your father , but I do n't think I succeeded very well , do you ? VICTORIA Poor Father ! He is like the little boy in the advertisements  --  He wo n't be happy till he gets it . What sort of a man is your father ? I 've often wondered . SHELDON ( Sitting on the ground . ) Oh , such a dear old darling , Vic . We were n't separated a day of our lives until he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married even then , but he expected me to run off and leave him any day . Only I have n't gone off as quickly as he expected . And his marriage has made a tiny little break  --  not between him and me ,  --  only in our lives because , try as hard as I can , I ca n't really love Mrs. Sheldon. p. 31 CYRIL Pst ! Pst ! Countess Casavetti . VICTORIA Who ? CYRIL ( Whispers strongly and disappears . ) Casavetti . SHELDON Oh , quickly  --  tell me something about her . VICTORIA She is an American who married a cheap Italian in a boarding house in Florence . She 's a beastly little woman  --  crazy about married men . Takes everybody 's husband away . They call her the Housebreaker . SHELDON Where 's her own husband ? VICTORIA Oh , my dear ! Lost a long time ago in the shuffle . SHELDON But I do n't see that this helps me. very much . VICTORIA Oh , you do n't do yourself justice . SHELDON What 's her latest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dark . CYRIL This way . COUNTESS CASAVETTI ( Giggling as she enters . ) I 'm quite frightened . SHELDON You need n't be . p. 32 COUNTESS CASAVETTI Of course you 're not really a gypsy ! SHELDON No , not really . COUNTESS CASAVETTI ( Sitting by the table . ) I have n't the slightest idea who you are . I hope you do n't know me . ( Giving her left hand . ) SHELDON I 'm sorry to say I never had the pleasure of seeing you before in my life . COUNTESS CASAVETTI ( Surprised . ) But I 'm an extremely well-known woman in London and having my portrait in the book of beauty  --  unfortunately gave me added notoriety . SHELDON ( Looking at her left hand . ) Too bad ! I see you have a great deal of temperament . COUNTESS CASAVETTI Oh , where do you see that ? SHELDON I must n't give my trade away  --  but I see you are a very ardent woman . COUNTESS CASAVETTI It 's perfectly wonderful ! You know I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't mind them myself . COUNTESS CASAVETTI Do you love everyone ? SHELDON No , I wo n't go so far as that  --  But I think you 're what Cyril would call  --  a flyer . p. 33 COUNTESS CASAVETTI I rather like Cyril ! The trouble is he 's not married and there 's no excitement . SHELDON Oh , but he 's young yet , he 'll keep , and he 's sure to marry in time . You must have your reserves . COUNTESS CASAVETTI That 's true ! How clever you are . ( The " Watch on the Rhine " is played by the band in the distance . Jo and the COUNTESS lift their heads and listen . ) COUNTESS CASAVETTI The Royalties have arrived . Do go on ! SHELDON No  --  Yes , yes , it is there ! COUNTESS CASAVETTI What ! ! SHELDON Do you want me to tell you everything I see ? COUNTESS CASAVETTI Oh , yes , please  --  everything .

COUNTESS CASAVETTI ( Laughing with nervous delight . ) What 's he like ? p. 34 SHELDON Tall ! COUNTESS CASAVETTI Oh , it 's perfectly wonderful ! And is he dark ? SHELDON Yes , dark . COUNTESS CASAVETTI Yes , that 's right . SHELDON Of course it 's right ; the hand never lies . COUNTESS CASAVETTI I think it 's perfectly amazing ! I 've always scoffed at this sort of thing , you know ! excuse me , but  --  are you a lady , or are you paid for this ? SHELDON I 'm doing this for my friend  --  I am Miss Sheldon , an American . COUNTESS CASAVETTI ( Quickly . ) Do n't tell me you are the Miss Sheldon , the beauty who was on the Riviera this winter ? SHELDON No , I wo n't tell you that , but only that I am Miss Jo Sheldon . COUNTESS CASAVETTI The one the Crown Prince of Eastphalia is mad about ? SHELDON There I can assure you you are very wrong . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have known you from your photographs . They do flatter , do n't they ? SHELDON Well , really ! p. 35 COUNTESS CASAVETTI Oh , you know what I mean ! I want to be taken by the same man  --  you must give me his name and address . ( Re-enter CYRIL . ) CYRIL You 've had your guinea 's worth , Countess Casavetti . COUNTESS CASAVETTI ( Taking her parasol  --  rising and going back of table to opening . ) Oh dear , do come to see me in London , I am sure we would get on immensely , and I should adore having you tell my hand every day . CYRIL Come , come , or it will be half a crown extra . COUNTESS CASAVETTI Do lunch next Tuesday , I 've a short blond one coming then .

He 's none of her business . p. 36 VICTORIA ( In the doorway , whispering . ) Pst ! Cyril ! Cyril ! SHELDON Cyril ! CYRIL Prince ? ( Cyril rushes out . ) VICTORIA Prince Adolf ! SHELDON ( Jumps up with a little scream of joy . ) Oh , hurrah !  --  she did n't keep him long . I 'll reward him for that  --  if I can ! VICTORIA He only arrived here two minutes ago ! It did n't take him long to get here , did it ? SHELDON Not very . VICTORIA ( Insinuatingly . ) I wonder if he knows by any chance who the gypsy is ? SHELDON ( Mischievously . ) I wonder ! and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think I know all about him I need to . VICTORIA I thought I 'd just  --  SHELDON Well , you need n't think , my darling .

SHELDON I 'm not in a hurry , only  --  ( pushing her up to entrance. )  --  please go away  --  he might n't wait . VICTORIA Not wait ! He 'd wait till Doomsday !

And if you do it again I 'll give your money back and not tell you a thing ! ( Pushing the coin . ) PRINCE ADOLPH I beg pardons .

You must remember that you are to let your hand lie perfectly quiet or else the important lines wo n't show . Whatever pressing is to be done , I must do it . PRINCE ADOLPH Will you ? ( Eagerly . ) SHELDON ( Holding his left hand . ) If it 's necessary to tell the lines . PRINCE ADOLPH I shall like dat immense  --  go on .

Now in this hand is the line as you 've made it yourself , and it says you have spoiled your disposition . PRINCE ADOLPH Well , dat vas not true either . SHELDON Thank you ! I seem to have made a good beginning ! ! ! p. 41 PRINCE ADOLPH You haf not begin yet ! It shall take you one hour to begin , and one more hour also to make finish .

SHELDON ( Going on with the right hand . ) You are capable of loving very deeply . PRINCE ADOLPH Ah , dat was right ! ! SHELDON But I ca n't make out if it is loving someone else , or yourself . PRINCE ADOLPH So ! Well , you shall skip dat , I know mineself dat answer . ( He leans over table . She looks up at him , smiling ; he smiles meaningly back at her  --  she turns her glance away  --  and then back to his hand. ) p. 42 SHELDON You are very brave . PRINCE ADOLPH That was nefer mein fault . Dere vas nefer one Hohenhetstein a coward ! SHELDON ( Looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sensible , republican king !  --  just like a President !

I beg your pardons ! but look once more  --  you shall be mistaken , where was der blonde lady ? SHELDON There ! Do n't you see  --  a lovely little canary blonde ! PRINCE ADOLPH Nein ! I hate canaries ! and I see only one tall , beautiful , black-haired , blue-eyed Juno ! SHELDON O well , that 's because you do n't understand how to read a hand . p. 44 PRINCE ADOLPH No , just look one other time and see when you ca n't see with mein eyes ! I see her dark ! SHELDON But that 's the best I do : it 's impossible to go back upon your fate line . See ! there she is , a little blonde . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ADOLPH No , I was not willing to see her  --  she was a lie ! SHELDON No , she 's true . She crosses your fate line , just like Forty-second Street . PRINCE ADOLPH Vat vas dat ? Forty-second Street ? SHELDON O , it 's the  --  the equator of New York ; it crosses every important street in the city and lands you in the water at both sides . I 'm afraid she 's a strenous lady , your blonde , and that you 've got the water ahead of you . PRINCE ADOLPH ( Looking disgustedly at his hand . ) It was all your joking . It has all not nothing of truth at it . I tell you what we do . Try now the other hand once . ( The PRINCE holds out his left hand . ) SHELDON It would n't do any good . That hand 's only what you might have been . PRINCE ADOLPH Perhaps it was not too late yet for me to be what I might have been . p. 45 SHELDON Perhaps not ! ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir , but time 's up . And there 's a line out here waiting a dozen deep . PRINCE ADOLPH But I vas not satisfied at mein future . CYRIL Try another !

PRINCE ADOLPH Do you not see some new lines dis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and one side goes off at right angles ! Can that mean going away from your throne ? PRINCE ADOLPH How ? SHELDON Perhaps a revolution in Eastphalia ! PRINCE ADOLPH ( Laughing . ) O , neffer ! Ve vas the smallest and der happiest Kingdom in all Germany . SHELDON It could n't mean that you are going to give up the throne ! PRINCE ADOLPH O neffer ! dat vas also as impossible ! SHELDON Impossible ! PRINCE ADOLPH Why should I mein throne give up ? Let us skip Pollittiks and go on to the heart line . SHELDON You 're quite right . Why should you give up your throne ? By all means let us skip pollittiks . Well , this hand says you love much  --  PRINCE ADOLPH Yah ! SHELDON ( Continues . ) And often ! p. 47 PRINCE ADOLPH Nein ! SHELDON And you are loved back often  --  PRINCE ADOLPH Nein , nein ! SHELDON But not much . PRINCE ADOLPH ( Angry . ) What beastly hands I do have for mineself . SHELDON Until  --  ( She looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?

SHELDON ( Lightly . ) Well , if I could be as lucky in business as Mr. Botes  --  SHELDON You could n't be because you 're so generous . Even Mr. Botes ' own children acknowledge he 's the hardest fisted , most miserly nice person they ever knew . MRS . SHELDON Give that to Mr. Botes without a word , except that I 'll join him in a moment .

Only the sofa is conveniently placed and it is quite by itself . ) VICTORIA ( Amused , looking around . ) I do n't think the room looks very well . SHELDON As the Duchess said  --  " Handsome is as handsome does "  --  ( As she does so , Jo pulls cushion away and puts it at the end of couch . ) And this does very well for us , thank you .

How 's that ? p. 102 VICTORIA ( As if crushed in seat . ) The most uncomfortable seat I was ever in in my life ! You ca n't breathe . SHELDON My dear , who wants to breathe ? You do n't think about breathing .  --  Of course , it is rather crowdy now , it does make a difference whom you share it with . VICTORIA Why do n't you sit on his lap and be done with it ? SHELDON Do n't be vulgar ! Although I 'm not so sure I should mind that so awfully . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thing has been done , even by a lady ! SHELDON O , I know you think I 've lost my mind , but I have n't . It 's only my heart I 've lost , Vic , only my heart ! And I do n't want to find it . You darling , I do n't want to find it !

I love him still , Vic . Ca n't you shame me out of it ? VICTORIA Dear old girl . I 'm so sorry . SHELDON Only what 'll I do , Vic ? Vic ? What 'll I do ?

BOTES ( After a moment 's hesitation . ) Very well . My daughter and I will wait in the other room . The whole matter was your own plan ; and now it 's started , you 've both got to see it through . If you want that cheque of mine made good , Miss Jo marries the Prince . ( Going to conservatory on the right . ) Vic , I 'll show you this . ( VIC . goes to BOTES and he shows her the agreement which he takes from his pocket. ) p. 126 VICTORIA What ? MR . BOTES The paper Miss Jo gave me  --  then things will be clearer to you . ( Exeunt VIC and BOTES . ) SHELDON Now quickly , what does all this mean ? What have you done ? MRS . SHELDON I am in desperate straits for money  --  and a MR . Wilton came over here to save me  --  to save us  --  all , from a terrible scandal . SHELDON Scandal ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why , why ? MRS . SHELDON ( Ignoring her question . ) I saw how things were drifting between you and Prince Adolf , and in desperation I made this plan ! I managed to wheedle 40,000 out of MR . Botes on the strength of a barony which you are to get for him on your marriage to Prince Adolf . You know that would be the easiest thing in the world for you . SHELDON It 's hard for me to follow you . I ca n't realize . I still do n't understand . MRS . SHELDON You will marry him , wo n't you , Jo ? SHELDON But why do you need such a sum of money ? p. 127 MRS . SHELDON We have n't time to discuss that now . You will marry him , Jo ? SHELDON And that paper  --  what was it ? MRS . SHELDON An agreement between you and MR . Botes . I signed your name to it . SHELDON ( Outraged  --  rising . ) You dared ! MRS . SHELDON Jo ! You ' ll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No ! MRS .

There must be some way at home to get this money ? MRS . SHELDON Do you think I 've not tried every way ? I owe money everywhere . At a breath of trouble , we ' ll be swamped here by a score of people I 'm in debt to . SHELDON You do n't deserve to be helped . MRS . SHELDON O , I know you would n't do it for me . But for your father . SHELDON He is n't responsible in any way for what you 've done . MRS . SHELDON I 've borrowed money illegally , and as much in his name as my own . It was easy enough for me to get your father to sign any paper I asked him to . He always took my word for what the paper was . p. 129 SHELDON Yes , he had faith in you . He loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't escape being punished , if you do n't do as I say . SHELDON No , no , I ca n't believe that ! MRS . SHELDON You will believe it ! When it 's too late to help ! Will you let him go to prison ? ( Jo simply stares at her . There is a pause . ) He will go ! But I have my chance , and I 'll take it ! SHELDON What do you mean ? MRS . SHELDON Your father is there , they can arrest him any minute , but I 'm over here and if you let the crash come , before they can get the papers , I 'll be out of reach in Belgium , where there 's no extradition treaty . SHELDON You ' ve even looked that up ! MRS . SHELDON Yes ! SHELDON Oh ! But my instinct was right that kept me from loving you . You came into our lives when my father and I were the happiest couple in the world ! Why did you come , why ? Why ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my father 's reputation , to trade on his love ! To make him a cat 's paw  --  to sacrifice him , body and soul , if necessary , to save your mean , contemptible self ! You ought to crawl and beg at my father 's feet for a crumb of forgiveness which you do n't deserve to get . You traitor  --  to everything and everybody ! p. 130 MRS . SHELDON What are you going to do ? SHELDON ( Very quietly . ) Of course I 'm going to save my father . MRS . SHELDON ( Excited and eager  --  bending over the couch . ) How ? ( There is a long pause while Jo stares straight ahead of her . ) MRS . SHELDON How ? SHELDON By any sacrifice that 's necessary . MRS . SHELDON Jo ! You ' ll do it ? SHELDON ( Rising and drawing away in disgust and almost fear of her . ) Do n't ! Do n't ! ( Calls . ) MR . Botes !

SHELDON ( To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turning to BOTES . ) I signed this  --  and gave it to you , and I 'll stand by it . ( VIC . takes the paper  --  reads it . ) MR . BOTES Good ! Write a note to Prince , Adolf asking him to call this afternoon , that you have reconsidered . SHELDON Yes , but first you must give your word of honor to your daughter that you will make your cheque good today . MR . BOTES Certainly . p. 132 VICTORIA Father ! MR . BOTES I give you my word , Vic , to make good today the cheque I gave Mrs. Sheldon . ( Jo sits and writes . Botes and Vic speak in lowered tones aside . ) What do you think of your friend now , Vic ? VICTORIA She did n't sign that paper ! MR . BOTES What do you mean ? VICTORIA It 's all written in her mother 's hand ; Jo did n't sign it . MR . BOTES Well , she 's going to live up to it . That 's all that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , father , how shamefully I think you 're behaving . Let them have the money . MR . BOTES What !

That 's all  --  shameful . Jo ! MR . BOTES ( To Jo . ) What have you written ? No more tricks ! SHELDON ( Handing the paper to Vic . ) Read it aloud . VICTORIA ( Reading . ) Come this afternoon at five  --  if you still want me  --  I will be the sort of wife you wish . Josephine Sheldon .

BOTES It 's good business all around . He gets what he wants , you get what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all 's well that ends well . SHELDON Wait one minute , MR . Botes . MR . BOTES Yes . SHELDON Suppose Prince Adolf should alter his mind and not want me now , even at his own price ! MR . BOTES Humph ! I 'll risk that ! SHELDON You see I 'm not willing for him to marry me blindfolded . When he comes this afternoon I intend to tell him all the truth ! MR . BOTES ( Turning to her . ) What ! SHELDON I intend to tell him why I 've changed my mind ! Tell him of our agreement ; tell him for just how much he 's buying me , and then , if he still wants the bargain , I 'm his . MR . BOTES That 's against the whole spirit of the agreement ! SHELDON But it 's within the letter of it . MR . BOTES Even then there 's nothing legally binding in the letter of it . p. 134 SHELDON Yes , but I 've made it with " Word of Honor Botes " ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Every business is full of tricks , ours is n't different from the average !

VICTORIA I want to know if you have kept your promise and made Mrs. Sheldon 's note good ? MR . BOTES You , and-your friend must live up to her side of the bargain . VICTORIA Are you really going to hold Jo to her word ? MR . BOTES Yes . VICTORIA Jo is lending herself to this abominable business of yours to protect someone else , I know . If I only had some money of my own ! MR . BOTES Well , you have n't . I 'm too good a business man for that . VICTORIA It is heartless and brutal of you . MR . BOTES Hold on ! after all I 'm your father . VICTORIA ( Almost breaking down , but still angry . ) I know it , and I 'm ashamed of you . p. 137 MR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live here with you if you do this . MR . BOTES Please yourself . VICTORIA But it 's a disgraceful marriage . He is n't worthy of Jo or he would n't ask it of her . That sort of man will tire of her in a year and marry some princess , and where will poor Jo be ? It 's too dreadful . MR . BOTES It 's her own fault , if she does n't hold him . And anyway , it 's a good enough marriage for a scheming woman ,  --  VICTORIA She 's not a scheming woman . ( Enter Jo . ) SHELDON Yes , Mr. Botes ? MR . BOTES Ah , I 'm glad you 've come . Mrs. Sheldon 's not satisfied with running up a bill with Streeter 's for several thousand pounds , and another with the Panchard people , but she 's been buying outrageously on credit , my credit , at half a dozen other shops . SHELDON But surely she means to pay . MR . BOTES What with ? So far as I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have my own letter of credit , but of course in face of any such amount , it 's nothing . p. 138 MR . BOTES I ca n't have Mrs. Sheldon arrested for debt here in my house . That alone might upset this marriage . So I 've told my lawyer for the present I 'll be responsible  --  for the present , you understand . Unless you carry out your threat and tell Prince Adolf everything . Do that and Mrs. Sheldon can be arrested and welcome . ( Enter CYRIL . ) CYRIL ( Giving Jo a note . Jo sits on sofa . ) I say , Jo , here 's a note I found on the hall table for you .

Still , I am happy ! MR . BOTES Why ? SHELDON You could n't understand . MR . BOTES Why not ? ( After a pause . ) Why not ? p. 140 SHELDON Because you 're too selfish . Because you 're too wrapt up in getting everything you want for yourself at any sacrifice ! Because you 're too senseless to other people 's sufferings to sympathize with anyone 's joys but your own . You belong to the eye for an eye and tooth for a tooth school .
