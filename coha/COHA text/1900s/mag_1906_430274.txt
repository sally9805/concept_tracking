 | NO one can comprehend the calamity to San Francisco in its entirety . The individual experience can probably give the general public the clearest idea . I was one of the fortunate ones , for neither personal injury nor death visited my household ; but what I saw and felt I will try to give to you . It was 5:13 A.M. , and my husband had arisen and lit the gas stove , and put on the water to heat . He had closed our bedroom door that I might enjoy one more nap . We were in a fourth-story apartment flat , said to be built with unusual care . Twelve flats , so constructed , occupied a corner one block from Golden Gate Park . All our rooms , six in number , opened into a square reception hall , from which the stairs descended . The shock came , and hurled my bed against an opposite wall . I sprang up , and , holding firmly to the foot-board , managed to keep on my feet to the door . The shock was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falling objects already commenced the din . The door refused to open . The earthquake had wedged it in the door-frame . My husband was pushing on the opposite side and I pulling with all my strength , when a twist of the building released it , and the door sprang open . We braced ourselves in the doorway , clinging to the casing . Our son appeared across the reception-room , and my husband motioned to him to stand in his door also , for fear of the chimney . It grew constantly worse , the noise deafening ; the crash of dishes , falling pictures , the rattle of the flat tin roof , bookcases being overturned , the piano hurled across the parlor , the groaning and straining of the building itself , broken glass and falling plaster , made such a roar that no one noise could be distinguished . We never knew when the chimney came tearing through ; we never knew when a great marine picture weighing one hundred and twenty-five pounds crashed down , not eight feet away from us ; we were frequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only kept our feet by mutual help and our utmost efforts . The floor moved like short , choppy waves of the sea , crisscrossed by a tide as mighty as themselves . The ceiling responded to all the angles of the floor . I never expected to come out alive . I looked across the reception-room at the white face of our son , and thought to see the floors give way with him momentarily . How a building could stand such motion and keep its frame intact is still a mystery to me . Stand in front of your clock and  | count off forty-eight seconds , and imagine this scene to have continued for that length of time , and you can get some idea of what one could suffer during that period . Talk about De Quincey 's " Vision of Sudden Death " ! With ever-lessening intensity , it finally quit . My husband told me to dress quickly and get down our tortuous stairs to the street . I rushed to the window and saw my neighbor of the lower flat standing in the middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ babe in her arms . I called to her and asked if I should fling out some bed-clothing to wrap them in . She said her husband had gone into the house to get their clothes . The street was black with people , or rather white , for they were mostly in strict undress . Then I turned to dress myself . What a change in values ! I had no thought for the dress I had cherished the day before . I was merely considering what was warmest and most substantial . A coarse wool skirt , and a long coat lined with white silk and highly decorated with trimming . Did I choose the latter because it was pretty ? No , indeed ! but because it was warm and long . My diamonds and money were thrust into a hand-satchel , and we hastily made our way to the street . The electric poles stood in the most inebriated attitudes the length of our street . Chimneys on roofs , chimneys in the street , bricks and broken glass everywhere , stone steps gaping apart , wooden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We walked around to the Park Emergency Hospital , three blocks away . We were anxious about the great buildings in the business section , and hoped to obtain some news there . The street was elevated at one point several feet , and a great broken water-main was flooding that section . The hospital is a one-story , low stone structure , with tiled roof . Its stone facing had nearly all fallen away , the chimney was gone , and the tiles were twisted and broken . All the timbering that supported the roof was exposed to view ; the stone arch over the entrance was crumbled and just ready to fall . The matron had just been removed unconscious from a heap of brick , mortar , and general debris . The attendants were making frantic efforts to get the ambulance out . Tumbled piles of stones were in front of the doors , and one door was so wedged that it could not be moved . But the ambulance was found to be narrower than the remaining door , willing hands were lifting and turning the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horses hauled it out over an amount of debris that in ordinary times would have been considered insurmountable . After a half-hour we came up to our flat to take an inventory of the situation . I walked over the remains of my choicest china , porcelain , and cut-glass , without a feeling of regret or a sigh or tear . Everything seemed so insignificant , and the world so far away . That is , the world we had lived in . All estimates of value were annihilated . Human life seemed the only thing worth consideration . Thin spirals of smoke now began to ascend from various places in the business section , and we realized how completely we were at the mercy of fire , with the broken water-mains , and reservoirs perhaps destroyed . The gas and water had been cut off immediately in most of our homes . The power-houses were down and the electricity gone too . We took a few bricks and built a fire between them in the middle of the street , like every one else , and ate our breakfast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " sent us scurrying to the road , and as night came on we gathered some bedding together and went into the Park , the Mecca of all the city . All day I had been feeding homeless ones who had drifted out from the Mission district , where great clouds of angry smoke were rising and large areas had already been devastated . As I took my load to go , I saw a mother and daughter sitting in the next alcove , into which four doors from flats opened . They were weary , and the girl almost fainting . Everything they had was burned , and they had had nothing to eat all day . I told them they could go up in our flat and sleep , if they wished . They were afraid ; so was I. Then I  | gathered all the door-mats in the alcoves about , went upstairs and found two old comforters , and made them a bed . I gave them food , and hastened to the Park through the gathering twilight . My husband and son had spread a mattress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great eucalyptus-tree towering over us . We crawled in , sleeping crosswise of the mattress , and my long coat kept me snug and warm . The immense fires started by the earthquake now made such a ruddy glow that it was easy to see everything , although the flames were two miles away . No lights were allowed in the Park , and all was soon quiet except the wail of a baby , the clang of an ambulance , and the incessant roll of wheels and tramp of feet as the people constantly sought the refuge of safety . People were all about us in huddled groups , sleeping the sleep of exhaustion on the lawns and under the shrubbery . Late in the night I heard a cry , " Bakers wanted ! Bakers wanted 1 " over and over ? the first cry of a stricken people for bread . Later came another , through the silent night ? " Union telegraphers wanted " ? to tell the world our awful plight . Morning came , and my husband was detailed to take charge of the water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now more precious than gold , and not a drop must be wasted . Many of the mains were broken , and no one knew how the reservoirs were . A large iron caldron was secured from the engineer of the Park , and two stone-masons volunteered their aid . Stone was hauled from the fallen chimneys of the Park Lodge , and the caldron soon set , and a fire roaring under it to boil water for tea or coffee . Do you imagine the post of water-distributer to be an easy one ? The day came on dusty and hot . The wind had changed , showering us with ashes and stinging our eyes with smoke from the ever-increasing fire . The line formed for cold water . Each had his turn . A man would argue for a drink for his wife , and look down the long line of Americans , Japanese , negroes , Chinese , and all sorts and degrees of men , women , and children . " Just one cupful . It only takes a moment , and she 's almost famished . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one else , " replied my husband , with that fierce look from his old military days that I knew covered the softest heart in the world . And the man went to the foot of the line , and it was just an hour and a half before he came to the faucet for his pitcherful . All day long the procession rolled past . Everything that could be used as a conveyance was pressed into service , young men acting as motor power to buggies and carriages . Trunks were hauled along the smooth park walks on their casters . Delivery wagons crammed with everything but what they advertised , wheelbarrows piled mountain high , people with packs on their backs , carrying parrots and banjos and a thousand and one treasures , and all so good-natured and ready for a smile 1 I never saw one person crying . Two young men went by , carrying a roll of bedding suspended from a pole . One end had sagged , and a fine blanket was dragging on the earth . I said : " Look ! your bedding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " responded one of them , with a quizzical look . " No difference at all ! " cried I , and we all laughed heartily . Men met , were introduced , exchanged business cards of places consumed by the flames , appreciated the joke , and went their way . As night drew on , the fire was only a half-mile away , and coming toward us . My son and I went to our flat and took the most useful and valuable things we had , and tied them up in sheets and strapped them in baskets to take to the Park . We removed part of them ; the rest were deposited on the landing of the stairs . The flames now lit the whole country round , and he who had directed our fire department for so many years with such bravery and skill was crushed to death under the fallen bastions of the California Hotel . Dynamite was being used liberally , and the deep resounding booms of its explosion came at frequent intervals . It was our only resource to stay the fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had lost everything , and I still had the house to draw upon as a base of supply . A wheelbarrow was our table , and about it gathered our family , a fat old lady who had owned a lodginghouse , her daughter , a parlor-maid at the St. Francis Hotel , an old Hebrew tailor , penniless and forlorn , a medical fakir with long hair , and ? I am afraid , one of the genus Tramp ! However , he was hungry as the rest . This list I kept for four days , until my own resources were gone and the generous distribution of supplies was well inaugurated . The third day of the fire I turned away from the weary throngs and climbed an eminence to see where the flames were spreading . They were racing up Nob Hill , the old habitation of California 's first millionaires . There stood the palaces of Flood , Hopkins , Stanford , Huntington , and the Crockers . While we gazed roofs began to smoke , long tongues of flame shot up into the murky rolling clouds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fire so mighty that they seemed but a sediment at its base . To-day Nob Hill stands almost as bare as when it was primitive , rolling sand . The walls of the Flood building , a chimney of the Crocker home , alone remain to tell of the old landmarks . As we returned to camp we encountered one of the long lines waiting for their turns to draw rations . A young mother turned away with her well-filled basket , wheeling her baby before her . " I want to go home , mamma , I want to go home , " pleaded the little one , as she passed into the darkening aisles of the Park . " We have n't any home , dear ; lie down and let mamma cover you up , " she replied , in the softest and most comforting of voices . As showing how lightly we slept , and what apprehension from the fire stayed with us in our dreams , in the small hours of that night a horseman dashed through the Park shouting , The fire is under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dark copses and lawns , and joy flowed like a wave over the great concourse hidden in the shrubbery . It rained a little the fourth night , and , as the weather continued threatening and we had no tent , we returned to our desolated flat . In the night it poured . The fallen chimneys had torn through the ceilings into two of our ' rooms ; the flat tin roof had thus been bent down , and now acted as a funnel . We heard an ominous drip , drip , and then a steady splash . We dared not light a candle ? it was against military orders . So we groped along , hand in hand , through the fallen furniture , pictures , and bundles , and found the water beating a merry tattoo on my sewing-machine , velvet carpet , and some overturned books . We scrambled them out of the way and hurried to the kitchen . Streams were falling on my gas and coal stoves . We placed pans , but they filled faster than we could empty them . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despair we shut the door and went to bed . On account of our inability to cope with the flood that poured in on us , the three flats below us were very much damaged by water , as they were locked up and their owners away . The next day we learned that my husband 's law library was burned . Did we feel regret ? No 1 we simply did not have time . We were now drawing rations , and suffering for nothing but bread . I had a gift of twenty loaves from out of town . I went through the Park giving it away . I found a very genteel Spanish woman , a former music-teacher , who had only one blanket for cover , one sheet for a screen against the weather , one utensil for cooking , an iron pot , and very few clothes . Her long black hair had not been combed since the earthquake , but she had a smile , and insisted on dividing with me the meat she had just cooked . I took her to our flat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Would you know what they were ? First , comforters and a warm dress , then followed underwear , stockings , dishes , cooking utensils , knives , forks , scissors , needle and thread , a comb , baking-powder , fruit jars for milk , and piles of clean old clothes to use for towels , dishcloths , and a thousand and one purposes for the camp .  | The bugle-calls in the morning , the pacing sentries and galloping officers , told of our military occupation . Two shots which I heard ended human lives . Both were cases of looting . Men who met that fate were frequently left to lie where they fell , and a sign of Looter " put over them . One pertinent feature of this awful experience of earthquake and fire is the entire change of opinion in regard to the automobile . Its most virulent critics now sound its praise . The railroad and street-car service was destroyed at one blow , and we suddenly appreciated that San Francisco was truly a city of magnificent distances . The autos alone remained to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , carried the dead to the morgues , flashed past with doctors and nurses , city officials , and army officers . One chauffeur I knew ran his auto for forty-eight hours without rest , resuming after a brief nap to carry dynamite to blow down threatening walls . Yesterday we rode in an old vegetable wagon , down through the devastated city , to the ferry building . Familiar places could be located only by the few towering steel structures , rising gaunt and bare over heaps of brick and stone , tangled wires , warped metal girders , and remnants of tottering walls . Verily the abomination of desolation , and four square miles of it ? the great , pulsing commercial heart of the town in ashes ! Everywhere one sees rows of houses strangely out of plumb , and we saw one two-story dwelling standing at an angle of 60 ? . Steps and brick facings , for the lower stories , suffered particularly . A Catholic church on Golden Gate Avenue is nothing more than a picturesque ruin . The seamed and cracked walls and sunken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Across the street from us a chimney ran from the ground through a threeflat structure . The base of that chimney was snatched aside and the rest of it came rattling down into the basement , the flooring of the bottom flat giving way at the same time . Golden Gate Park has suffered particularly in its public buildings . The art museum is a shattered wreck . The music stand , built of stone , with its high , pillared wings and long tiers of steps , has sunk in the middle , the gigantic cornices lying in heaps at its front and sutures running through all its massive stone-work . It was the gift of Claus Spreckels , and cost $60,000 . At the children 's play-house the roof has fallen into the restaurant , the stone walls are shattered , and piles of brick , glass , and stone litter the ground . Strangely enough , the large conservatory , with its glass dome and far-stretching wings , has hardly a broken pane , although the road not fifty feet back of it has gaping cracks in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me say that this stupendous disaster leads a thoughtful person to two conclusions ; viz. , faith in humanity , and the progress of the human race . All artificial restraints of our civilization fell away with the earthquake 's shocks . Every man was his brother 's keeper . Every one spoke to every one else with a smile . The all-prevailing cheerfulness and helpfulness were encouraging signs of our progress in practicing the golden rule , and humanity 's struggle upward toward the example of our Saviour .
