txt 6o PARISH LIFE IN ENGLAND appears to have been a great robbery ofl plate from the treasury , which we learn was in a room over the vestry , and the thieves got off with a large amount of plunder . There is no need to multiply instances , for we are continually finding mention of such robberies of church property , and I am sorry to say the parsons did not always show an example of strict honesty in these matters , as when one of them appropriated a valuable cushion to his own use , and another ? I forget where ? had filched an old but handsomely broidered cloth from the church which he served and used it as a coverlet for his own bed . The poor man may have been cold , but he need not have denied the theft when he was charged with it , as it seems he did , for one witness came forward and testified that he had himself seen the broidered cloth upon the reverend gentleman 's bed with his own eyes ! I fear I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for most people hate details , and on details they will not dwell for long . Having got thus far in an inquiry which has been really of a very superficial character , it must suffice to state my conviction , which becomes stronger and stronger the further that inquiry is carried , that the property of one kind or another owned by the parish cornBEFORE THE GREA7 ' PILLAGE ht munities throughout England in the first half of the fifteenth century must have amounted to an aggre-gate which represented millions of money . It remains to inquire what became of it , and how it vanished as it did . The ninth and last Parliament of King Henry the Eighth assembled at Westminster on the 23rd of November , 1545 . The great Act of the session was " An Act for the dissolution of chantries , hospitals , and free chapels , " in which were included those remarkable foundations known as secular colleges or collegiate churches about which so little has hitherto been written and about which much remains to be written by some one qualified to treat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with all that belonged to them should be forthwith surrendered to the King during the term of his natural lift , without inquest before a jury or any other circumstance , and , before the end of the year , colleges , hospitals , chantries , and free chapels were falling rapidly to the King . Mr. Dixon , in his very able " History of the Church of England from the Abolition of the // Roman Jurisdiction , " has given a brief ? too brief ? account of these institutions. = They had long been threatened , and it had long been felt that now that the vast possessions of the monasteries great and small had been squandered and nothing remained of them , the colleges and chantries must be con fiscated next . The plundering went on apace . " For all that , the King 's purse remained as empty as ever , and his mysterious beggary was unappeased still . " But though the Court of Augmentation did its work with unparalleled expedition ? or , as one may say , with the most shameless haste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the spoilers could not be abolished without some legal formalities , and when Henry the Eighth died , in January , 1547 , there were hundreds of them still standing , and the King 's life interest ( ! ) in them had come to an end . That little difficulty was soon got over , and what had been granted to King Henry was soon granted to his son , now upon the throne . It makes one sick to read the hateful story ! Pro clamations , injunctions , orders of the council , and what not came out in swarms , all having the same object , the plundering of all corporate property chantries and chapels of ease , hospitals , colleges , gilds ? " all were handed over to the Crown . " To // the Crown , forsooth ! the crown that weighed so heavily upon the brows of the sad boy king , now scarce twelve years old . I am not qualified to tell the story of those three or four years which were chiefly taken up with the plunder of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of English history , and has long been waiting to be told . But let one caution be offered to those who may set themselves to this great task . Let them beware how they fall into the old mistake which has led us all astray for so long . Let them get rid of the old assumption that this monstrous robbery was a necessary part of what we call the Reformation . Religion had just about as much to do with this business as religion had to do with the September massacres at Paris in 1792 . In the latter case , the mob went raving mad with the lust of blood ; in the former case , the richer classes went raving mad with the lust of gain . The most startling fact in the long series of surprises which meets us , as the events of the first two years of King Edward 's reign pass before our view , is that during all this time the old ritual was still kept up in all our churches . The Mass was still said or sung , prayers for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unknown tongue ; and Henry the Eighth in his last will left vast sums to be spent ( 4 PARISH LIFE IN ENGLAND in masses for his own soul . The church formularies and church ritual had all this time been subjected to very insignificant changes indeed . It was not till May , 1549 , that the first Prayer Book of Edward the Sixth was issued . After its publication no other form of prayer was allowed . The old service books were at once doomed . Then , for the first time , the people found themselves actually forbidden to use those sacred vessels , ornaments , vestments , and the like which they and their forefathers had delighted in for centuries , which had been for them integral parts of their religious observances , and had been in their ignorance not only signs and symbols of the faith they professed and had been taught , but their helps and supports in every act of adoration , of prayer and praise .

The plunderers were astute men in that age of systematic plunder . Doubtless they had foreseen what was coming . The spoil of the chantries and hospitals and gilds had given them a grand haul ; but if there was more to get , why should not they have it ? So an Act was passed that all such books heretofore used or still preserved in the churches , and all images , pictures , and other ornaments as being " things corrupt . . . vain , and superstitious , and , as it were , a preparation to superstition , " should be destroyed , burnt , or otherwise defaced . But the 6 // scramble had begun long before this . Why should people wait for the clumsy machinery of Parliament to be set in motion ? There was such a general and widespread anticipation of what was coming that almost immediately after the death of King Henry men of all classes began to fall upon the spoil . Sometimes the churchwardens themselves were authorised to lay hands on the church goods , and were not slow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the parishes from the council ; sometimes emissaries from the bishops appear to have taken part in the confiscation . In three years it may be said that almost all the parish churches in England had been looted ; before the end of the King 's reign there had been a clean sweep of all that was worth stealing from the parish chests , or the church walls , or the church treasuries . In the next generation there were churches by the score that possessed not even a surplice ; there were others that had not even a chalice ; and others again in considerable numbers which were described as " ruinated . " When the Second Book of Homilies was issued in 1562 already we find the homilist indignantly exclaiming : " It is a sin and shame to see so many churches so ruinous and so foully decayed , almost in every corner . . . . Suffer them not , " he adds , " to be defiled with rain and weather , // with dung of doves and owls , stares and choughs , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behold in many places of this country . " And yet what else could have been looked for ? The great pillage was nothing less than this ? the Disen dowment of all the Parishes in England . Nothing was left to the parish community but the bare walls of the church fabric , stripped of every " thing of beauty " on which the eyes had delighted to rest . No church was allowed to retain more than a single bell . The beautiful art of campanology almost died out . The organs were sold for the price of the pipes ; the old music , the old melodies , were hushed , for praising God in an unknown tongue was pro hibited . The old gatherings in the gildhalls came to an end . It is nonsense , it is absolutely contrary to fact , to say that it was owing to the suppression of the monasteries that new devices were resorted to to save the poor from starving . Pauperism came in , not by the Suppression of the Monasteries , but by the Disendowment of the Parishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the fifteenth century with those of the same parish in the seventeeth or eighteenth , and what a change has come over the scene ! In the earlier documents , when we have learnt to read // them aright , there is interest and liveliness in every line . In the later ones there are everywhere indi-cations that the parishioners are only vying with one another to keep down the rates ; the lead is sold off the roof and replaced by thatch ; there is hig-gling between one party and another party as to whether twopence or threepence a dozen shall be paid for sparrows or their eggs ; there is a division , decided in the negative , as to whether there shall be a new rope to ring the solitary bell ; there is a squabble about the fences of the churchyard ; there is a presentment that hogs were rooting up the graves ; the parish meeting is attended by threes and fours , there is an atmosphere of meanness and squalor pervading the shrivelled assemblies . The one piece of property that remains to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old parish community survived . Then came a time when some cunning parishioners here and there began to see a chance of getting rid of their liabilities as parishioners , and began to feel " conscientious objections " to contribute to the maintenance of the fabric in which they seldom or ever appeared . The Quakers showed the first example : it was soon followed . Thus far the parishes were only disendowed , it remained for them to be disestablished . That began when , as the // phrase is , church rates were abolished ? i.e. , when no one who objected to contribute to the maintenance of the church could be compelled to pay for the use of it . As I read , that act was a bribe to people not to belong to the old parish community . But the end came when the Local Government Act of 1894 became the law of the land . By that Act the old parish communities were formally disestablished . The parish was defined to be " a place for which a separate overseer is or can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting the parish priest as such has no locus standi , nor have the churchwardens : the old constitution of the parish community has gone . Meanwhile the parish churches remain . Again I ask , as I have often asked before , To whom do the churches belong ? There are some at any rate in every " place for which a separate overseer is or can be appointed " who still are joyfully willing to take upon themselves the liability to keep the church in repair ; some who gladly avail themselves of the privilege of worshipping in the old houses of God where generations of their fathers worshipped during centuries gone by ; some who have no wish to interfere with the liberty of conscience and the freedom of worship which others so strongly claim . // But these men and women have their rights too , and one of these rights is that they shall not be liable to he interfered with , or their liberty be restricted by every noisy brawler who may object , or choose to protest , against the ritual sanctioned by ecclesiastical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the churches maintained at ' the " worshippers ' " cost . Some of us seeing things as they are , and accepting the logic of facts , arc not afraid of their parishes being disestablished , any more than they are scared when compelled to confess that they were disendowed three centuries ago . Some of us are quite awake to the fact that the disestablishment of the Church is one thing , and that the disestablishment of the parish is quite another . But we who take up this position do think strongly that the time has come when the ownership of the churches up and down the land should be handed over to somebody , and they count it an outrage and a monstrous injustice that every religious body in this land of ours should be able to claim its place of worship as its own , whether that body be Jew or Gentile , Roman , Greek , or Mormonite , Quaker , Wesleyan , Muggletonian , or Independent , but that they who for the present have the use of the , say , 20,000 parish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little more than sufferance , and should not be able to call their churches their own . " Why ca n't we get the Bishops to move ? " asks one and another .. " They are our leaders , they ought to know their own mind ! " Alas ! only once in the history of the Reformed Church of England have the Bishops as a body known their own mind ; then , when those seven were thrown into the Tower ? and then the hearts of Englishmen throbbed with a mighty burst of enthusiastic loyalty ? the nation rose up as one man to acknowledge with gratitude the heroism of their episcopal leaders . Alas ! again I say alas ! there was another occasion when the Bishops as a body " knew their own minds . " It was when twenty Bishops in the House of Lords voted solid against Lord Grey 's second Reform Bill . There was only one dissentient ! The Bill was thrown out for that time : but what next ? The Anglican Bishops of this Reformed Church of England never have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not led it . The Society for the Propagation of the Gospel , the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge , the Church Missionary Society did not enter upon their /2 PARISH LIP E IN ENGLAND several magnificent careers at the suggestion of our Bishops . Even in that glorious war against the accursed horrors of slavery were they the Bishops who led the van ? Of late years things have gone from bad to worse ; we expect from " our leaders " such restless activity ( if that is the word ) as leaves no time for serious thought ? such perpetual " serving of tables " as , according to the Twelve Apostles , was inconsistent with the exercise of the higher Apostolic functions . We need statesmanship , and we look for it in vain .

THE PARISH PRIEST IN ENGLAND BEFORE THE REFORMATION THE PARISH PRIEST IN ENGLAND BEFORE THE REFORMATION T has long been felt that an increasing number I of candidates for Holy Orders in the Church of England are young men who have received but an inadequate training for the ministry , and that the daily routine of duties expected from the younger clergy is distinctly unfavourable to the growth of any habits of study . Among themselves , too , there is a conviction that it is becoming very hard , almost impossible , for them to keep abreast of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that , while other professions and other classes of the community are becoming more studious , well-informed , and better instructed , they are unhappily dropping behind . - It was to meet so serious a danger as this that , in 1893 , some leading professors and tutors in the University of Oxford issued an invitation to such of the clergy as were so inclined , to spend a fort-75 // night at Oxford , where a certain measure of hospitality would be offered by several of the colleges , and where , brought into touch with academic life and academic thought , they might be afforded the opportunity of learning from the Divinity Professors and others what were the latest results of research and inquiry arrived at by professional students in the domains of Exegesis , Scientific Theology , and History . The Oxford experiment proved successful ; and during the Long Vacation of 1894 it was repeated at Cambridge . The lecturers who took part in the movement were professors of the University , and such scholars and men of learning as were believed to have something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this or that line of study . I could not but feel gratified when a request was made to me that I should deliver one of these lectures . The subject was left to me , and the novelty of it coinmended itself to the Committee . Since its delivery I have been asked by many to publish it . With some few excisions it is printed pretty much as it was delivered . By the term Parish Priest we understand an official responsible for the spiritual oversight of the // inhabitants of a certain geographical area which we call the Parish . But here we are at once face to face with a problem surrounded with difficulties . In the first five centuries at least after Christ , the word rrapoucta was used almost exclusively to denote what we now call the Bishop 's Diocese . The province of Gaul ? meaning by that the great stretch of country now embracing Belgium and France ? was in the fifth century divided into some sixty odd civitates ; and though I am not prepared to say that each civitas had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , true that to every civitas a bishop had already been assigned , whose stool ( as Mr. Freeman was pleased to phrase it ) was set up in the chief town of that civitas . The chief town gave him his title ; the civitas was his 7rapoucia or parish . It is to be remembered that , as in the Apostolic age the work of converting the world started from the great towns , so was this emphatically the case in Gaul . How early or how late the practice became general of calling the country cure the Parish and the Episcopal See the Diocese I have never been able to discover . As early as the fourth century we find mention of country churches with lands belong-ing to them , and in the next century the numbers of these foundations so much increased that Sidonius 78 THE PARISH PRIEST IN ENGLAND : ( A.D. 433 ? 488 ) mentions a visitation he made of the rural churches in his diocese ( Auvergne ) , and we notice that by this time these settlements are sometimes called Parocliicc and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A.D. 539 ? 593 ) more often calls the country cures Dioceses and the Episcopal See the Parochia . But , call them what you will , we are fairly well instructed as to the manner in which the country parishes ( as we call then ' now ) rose up in Gaul ; and I have a suspicion that what was true of Gaul was true , mutatis mutaudis , of Britain . I have a suspicion that if we had for British history anything approaching to that wealth of original sources which we have for early French history during the first five or six centuries of our era , we should have evidence that some ? perhaps many ? of our English parishes existed as ecclesiastical parishes , with pretty much the same boundaries as they have to-day , and are survivals of a condition of affairs anterior to the Saxon Conquest . ' Be that as it may , however , there are indications that the parish priest all through the Saxon times held a position of greater independence relatively // to the bishops than he held on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indications are worth drawing your attention to for more than one reason . ( I ) Among us in pre-Norman times Archdeacons are hardly heard of . Bishop Stubbs reminds us that the first person who is called archdeacon is Wulfred , who became Archbishop of Canterbury in 8o5 ; and he adds that the office of archdeacon is only once mentioned in the Northumbrian Priest 's Laws . The fact is so significant that I must beg you to pardon a digression ( which is really not a digression ) while I try to explain the significance . You all remember that in the Apostolic age it was found necessary very early to appoint deacons , who were to be the administrators of the finances of the Church . In the same way it came to pass that , when the revenues of the bishops in Gaul became almost unwieldy , it became necessary that the revenues of the see should be placed under the management and supervision of an official who should regulate the expenditure and its distribution , keep the very voluminous accounts , and strike the annual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary in Gaul , because all the endowments in a diocese were paid into the episcopal exchequer and were under the bishop 's 8o THE PARISH PRIEST IN ENGLAND control . He apportioned to each priest his income , and , even where local funds were forthcoming , the priest resident in a certain cure was required to account for such rents or dues as were derived from local sources , presumably paying the balance , if any , to the common chest of the diocese . The accounts in all cases were sent in to the archdeacon ; and if I may be allowed the expression , the archdeacon would annually present his Budget to the bishop , whose First Lord of the Treasury or Chancellor of the Exchequer he was . This , I say , was the case in Gaul . It seems that no such unification of diocesan revenues ever existed in Britain . If anything of the kind had prevailed among us in Anglo-Saxon times we must have heard of the archdeacon 's work or of the archdeacon 's office . As it is , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the Norman Conquest , and then we hear a great deal too much . But then the titular and territorial archdeacon has become an altogether different kind of functionary from him with whom we are concerned when we speak of the earlier archdeacons in the Gallican Church . ( 2 ) Besides the archdeacons there was another class of clergy whom we hear nothing of in England till late in the eighth century , but of whom we are perpetually hearing in Gaul almost from the earliest times ? I mean the Canons. // The first instance of the very name canons occur-ring in English history is in the report of two bishops who were sent into Britain in 789 by Pope Adrian the First , and who were the first ambassadors or ( if you choose to call them by the term which acquired a certain disagreeable meaning in the later times ) the first legates who came to spy out the land since the famous mission of Augustine two centuries before. = And here again I am compelled to say something to explain who these canons were . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times , of the rivalry between them and the monks , and of their relation to the parish priests , that it is almost impos sible to understand the ecclesiastical history of these times ? or indeed of later times either ? until we get something like a clear notion of who and what these canons were . As I have said before , the Gallican bishops were very wealthy and very powerful territorial magnates ; they were , in fact , what many prelates in Austria are called to this day ? Prince-Bishops . The setting // apart of separate estates for the maintenance of clergy in this or that manor or district was hardly heard of even so late as the fifth century . The earliest authoritative ordinance laying it down that every rural district should have a parsonage-house , and that only after the building of that house should the bishop allow a priest to take possession of the church and officiate there , is to be found in a Capitular of Louis le Debonnaire ? or , as we ought to translate his name , Louis the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same Capitular there follows an ordinance that in future in all new where new churches were built , the tithes should be bestowed upon those same churches ? i.e. , should not be paid into the common chest of the episcopal see . This appears to have been a novel arrange ment , and implies , I think , that a feeling was growing against such centralisation of Church revenues as tended to make the country clergy too absolutely dependent upon their diocesan . Obvi ously the dealing with these huge revenues neces sitated the employment of a large staff of trained subordinates engaged in mere office work , analogous to what we understand among ourselves by the Civil Service . This small army of officials was // occupied mainly in dealing with the official business of the see ; and , as there was a Chancellor of the Exchequer as I have ventured to call him ? the archdeacon ? so also there would be a certain number of heads of departments or chief clerks , who would be required to be more or less in strict personal relations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as being more concerned with office work than with pastoral work , were in the first instance , and indeed for some centuries , called the Episcopal Clerks , or Clerici . They were entrusted with important responsibilities and sometimes very arduous duties ? education , church extension , discipline , and the like , not to speak of the immense correspondence which fell upon them and the delicate diplomacy which they might be called on to undertake at an hour 's notice . These clerici were sure to be the ablest and most efficient ecclesiastics in the diocese , and had their residence in the episcopal house , which soon got to be called the bishop 's Palatium , as the emperor 's residence was called his Palatium , the internal organisation of the one being modelled upon that of the other . In both cases the discipline of the palace was necessarily as strict as the discipline of a man-ofwar ; but in the bishop 's palace that discipline would assume an ecclesiastical and religious character . // The great officials of the bishop 's palace holding high office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain code , differing in different dioceses . But in all cases they lived by a rule , a i:av ( x , v , as the Greek word called it . Not improbably on entering upon their office they " kissed hands , " as the Ministers of the Crown do now , and undertook formally to observe the icaviLv , and so were included among the Canonici . As time went on it became necessary to plant more than one or two of these Government Houses , as we may call them , in various parts of the diocese , with a prior or superior as head ; such houses being supposed to keep up the etiquette , and to observe the rule or icava , v of the episcopal Palatium . Little by little the close connection between these houses , lying at a distance from the central seat of government became weakened . The discipline tended , inevitably , to grow lax where the face of the bishop was seldom seen , and his presence was not to be feared . Gradually , too , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resources , and were allowed to appropriate to their own use ? i.e. , to the support of the community ? the revenues which in the first instance they had been sent to administer for diocesan purposes . Then a worse development ensued . The canons in the outlying houses proREFORE // ceeded to apportion among themselves these estates , and each canon became a tenant for life of his share of the estates . Then came in the practice of non-residence . There was no longer a common table , nor any life in common , and , in point of fact , the canonry or prebend became only a better and more lucrative benefice with little work and a good income ? more or less of a sinecure ; though it must be allowed that such prizes were for the most part bestowed upon the better educated of the clergy ? for the most part they were the prizes which fell to the abler , the more cultivated , the more deserving . Many attempts were made from time to time to restore discipline in these canon 's houses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eighth century , drew up a Rule for his Canonici , and this rule was adopted by other bishops , who , under the authority of Charlemagne 's Admonifio Generalis ( A.D. 789 ) , 1 attempted with more or less success to force it upon their canons . Later , it seems that the canons them-selves here and there showed a desire to return to a better way ; and we find many of these corporations associated , no one knows how , under a pretended rule of St. Augustine , which they professed to follow and conform to . These canons , who observed a certain rule of life , which they were // expected to obey even in small things , got to be called the Canons Regular , or canons living together under a rule ; while the others , who somehow were in possession of the estates , and lived pretty much as they pleased , were known as Secular Canons , or canons who ie'ere li2'ing in the world , and conforming to the secular life under no particular rule or strict canonical discipline . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were the monks or dwellers in the monas-teries ; but about them , for many good reasons , I can enter into no details now . Having indulged in these two digressions by way of introduction , I am the better able to enter now upon the main subject before us . Our sources of information regarding the Anglo-Saxon parish priests are not so meagre as is gene-rally assumed by those who have not given their attention to the subject . They may be said to begin with those documents which belong to the days of Archbishop Theodore , who came among us in 668 , and who continued to preside over the Church of England till 69o.1 Theodore 's Penitential belongs // to a class of documents which the Bishop of Oxford describes as " lists of sins and their penances , " drawn up for a people only partially delivered from heathen abominations and superstitions , and which had already been issued by the Frankish bishops and the Merovingian kings under their influence . These penitentials were , indeed , private or quasi-private compilations , and it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gaul they obtained the force of legislative enactments . But , viewed as re flections of the age in which they were drawn up , they are of inestimable value . Theodore 's Peni tential shows us that the organisation of the Church in Britain was in many respects very unlike that of Gaul , or as we might now call it , Frankland ; there was , indeed , some discipline among the clergy , but there was clearly more laxity than among their brethren on the other side of the Channel . In some important matters they did not conform to the usages and practices of the Roman Church . Sunday was strictly observed . The timber churches were apparently often moved from one place to another . Many of the clergy knew no Latin ; 2 and , by what sounds like a compromise , it was ordered that in future they should be required at least to say the Creed and the Lord these clergy were recognised as the guides and teachers of the people , and that their ministry was accepted with remarkable docility . Their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which these men were discharging their functions there were monasteries , which were the homes of such learning as was to be acquired through the medium of Latin ; seminaries in which the sons of wealthy men like the father of St. Boniface , the apostle of Germany , sent their boys to receive the higher education . But the epistles of St. Boniface show us that outside the cloisters the people at large were instructed in the elements of the Christian faith by the secular priests , and that they were probably the teachers of that native poetry which was always becoming more and more Christian in its character ? such poetry as the people were generally familiar with , such as Boniface himself had learnt in his youth and did not forget in his manhood , such too , as Beda loved and quoted on his deathbed . It was in Theodore 's time that , on the 24th of September , 673 , a council was held at Hertford , where all the Anglo-Saxon bishops except one assembled ; and here , among other things , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annually at a place called Clovesho , a place which recent discoveries have gone far to show was situated near Mildenhall , in Cambridgeshire ; and the records of at least ten of these Clovesho synods have been preserved , bringing us down to the times when the Danes were ravaging the country with fire and sword . At one of these synods , held under the presidency of Archbishop Cuthbert in 747  --  i.e. , about fifty years after Theodore 's death ? the decrees , though , as usual , in great part imported from abroad , contain some enactments of peculiar interest. = The bishops are to visit their several dioceses ( Parochia : ) every year to make themselves known to their people , and to warn them against heathen practices . They are to be careful to ordain no one to the priesthood till they are assured that the candidate is fitted by his life and doctrine to act as a shepherd of souls ( c. 6 ) . The priests themselves are ( c. 8 ) to give themselves heart and life to the ministry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from all worldly callings ; they are to be diligent in visiting their people , and to be sober in their talk and in their conduct ( c. 9 ) . They are to explain the meaning of the Sacrament , translat ing to those who do not understand them the words used in the prayers offered , and especially to teach // them the Creed and the Lord 's Prayer and the spiritual significance of the ritual , in which the people were to bear a part ( c. 1o ) . They are warned against any unauthorised departure from the order of ser-vice . They are not to sing in the churches like the heathen bards did , nor in theatrical fashion to play tricks with sacred words , but to follow the established order of plain song in a simple and serious manner , and if they can not sing ( c. 12 ) they are to read dis-tinctly , and unpretentiously . These and other ordinances of the council the bishops are to make known to all at their visitations , and command all to observe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is enjoined . In the MS. records of this council which have come down to us the names of the bishops only who were present have been preserved . It is otherwise with some other of the synods which were assembled afterwards at Clovesho and elsewhere . Thus , at a Clovesho council held on the 12th of October , 803 , under the presidency of Archbishop ; thelheard , we get what appears to be a complete list of those who were summoned and attended. = Thirteen bishops , including the Primate , were present . The normal number of representatives BEFORE THE REFORMATION 9I from each diocese ( including the bishop of the see ) was seven . But among these seven the abbots of the monasteries in the several dioceses appear to have taken their seats as representatives of the regulars or monastic bodies ; though where there was no monastery , as in the dioceses of Elmham and of Rochester , the six who came with their bishop were all parish priests . From Canterbury the single archdeacon mentioned attends as a supernumerary . The number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secular or parish priests are fifty-five , while the regulars number only twenty-five . Twenty-one years later ? i.e. , when the incursions of the Danes were beginning to cause serious anxiety ? we have the record of another Clovesho synod at which Archbishop Wulfred presided . Eleven bishops attended , and , according to one account , fifty parish priests , though the signatures of only thirty-seven have been preserved . The monasteries by this time had suffered grievously in some parts of the country from the Danes , and we need not be surprised that no more than seven abbots were among the signatories . The significance of these lists is very great . It is clear that at the beginning of the ninth century ? thirty or forty years before Alfred was born ? the parish priests were by no means the poor creatures that a cursory reader of such history as emanated // from the cloisters would lead us to believe they were . On the contrary , there were among them men of consideration and weight who were perfectly qualified to take their places in council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to travel from one end of England to the other that their voices might be heard in the debates , and , moreover , when the religious houses had been harried and burnt by the Vikings , these same priests were ready to fill up the vacant seats in the assemblies of the Church and to rally round their bishops whenever and withersoever they might be summoned to attend and deliver their judgments or tender their advice in times of peril and perplexity . Unhappily , so great has been at all times the exclusiveness and arrogance which have characterised monastic literature , and especially when monks have been writing about the past of their own houses or their own Order , that they have taken little or no account of the parish priests and their doings ; but have adopted when speaking of them " precisely the same tone which is observable in the language of some among ourselves . The very name of secular clergy was to the monk almost a name of reproach ; and , just as among our Nonconformists nowadays no man is a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member of a Dissenting congregation , // so , for centuries , only they who were members of a monastic body and under monastic vows were spoken of as religious . Then , and then only , was he or she ( as the case might be ) said to have " entered religion . " The phrase is still used in the present day . Meanwhile , all through the Anglo-Saxon era we find the parish priests quite able to hold their own as teaching , preaching , working clergymen . In the monasteries the Latin language appears to have been used as a rule , and among them the Roman ritual was universal . There are good reasons for believing that in the parish churches the Latin service was disliked , and even translated into the vernacular ; for everybody in Gaul could speak Latin or understood it . In Britain the people loved their own language ; to them the Roman speech was jargon and something worse . The people could not be induced to learn Latin except in the monasteries and in some few schools more or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the parish priests to keep up the sentiment of the people in favour of their native language , and the people would have translations of the Scriptures , which the parish priests could // supply and did supply ; and that there were among those parish priests no inconsiderable number of men deserving in that age to be called scholars and students is abundantly evident . Bede himself ( ob . 732 ) acknowledges his great obligations to a certain London priest ? I suppose we may call him a London clergyman ? named Nothelm , who had made transcripts for him of valuable documents . Nothelm appears to have been one of the most learned men of his time , and eventually became Archbishop of Canterbury , dying there in 739 . ' In the British Museum , among the Cotton MSS. , we have a remarkable catalogue which a certain Athelstan , in the pride of his heart , drew up of the books which he had collected and was apparently very proud of . Athelstan appears to have lived about a generation after Bede . I hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue to assert and maintain the same till some personage of adequate audacity shall succeed in proving the negative . Athelstan names with a certain - erious joy two important volumes which he says he had obtained from another parish priest named Alfwold. // But Athelstan and Alfwold are only two of many such clergymen as were men of books and study in that eighth century . Alcuin ? of whom it may be said that Charlemagne looked to him for effecting the great educational reform which the illustrious Emperor hoped to bring about ? Alcuin writes of England at this time as the home of libraries and learned men . And this is just what our King Alfred says of his country in the next century , when he deplores the havoc and ruin which the Danes had wrought . In the preface to Gregory 's " Pastorale " he mentions how " before all was spoiled and burned , the churches throughout the whole English nation stood filled with treasures and with books , and also with a great multitude of God 's servants ; " but he adds elsewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a memorable lament occurs , he had received important help , not only from Archbishop Plegmund and Bishop Asser , but from two mass priests ? i.e. , parish priests ? whom he names . But when the great King bewails the decay of learning in Britain during the generation or so preceding his own , we must take such laments with some little reserve , just as we must receive the language of Elfric the grammarian in the next century with all cautious allowance ; for ZElfric himself tells us that a parish priest was his own first // teacher . And we may take it as pretty certain that when iElfric wrote those homilies of his which were so widely circulated , they were the parish priests who bought them or copied them , and preached them in their churches . People came and listened to them too ; and preaching other people 's sermons is not such a very reprehensible practice ? it rather goes a little way to prove that the preachers are not idlers , not drones . And let me , before I pass on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York , was one of these good people who busied themselves in writing sermons for others to preach , and that he tells us himself that he was no monk , but that he began his career as a country parson quietly doing his best for his people , making no bounce and never dreaming of promotion . Nor was the social position of the Saxon working clergy by any means as low as some have been inclined to infer from the silence or the covert sneers of writers who breathed the air of the cloisters . There is in the " Cartularium Saxonicum " a very interesting will , made by a certain priest named Werhard , about the year 832. = He describes himBEFORE // self as a kinsman of Archbishop Wulfred , who had lately died . The Archbishop had purchased some property in Kent and Middlesex , which he made over to Werhard in honourable trust . The income was to be applied , not for the enrichment of any monastery , but for the support of the poor in certain parishes which are named . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us was his patrimony ) , that he bequeaths to Christ Church , Canterbury . The monks at Christ Church took very good care of their evidences , and to this we owe our knowledge of Werhard ; his will was the title to the lands he bequeathed to their house , and if he had not so bequeathed it we should never have heard of him or of Wulfred 's bequest to the poor . Exactly in the same way do we owe our knowledge of another parish priest , Erdulf ( " Cart . " ii. , 589 ) , to whom King Edred , Alfred 's grandson , left a life interest in a considerable estate . The re-version of that estate devolved to the new Minster at Winchester , and Erdulf 's will , as a matter of course , would be deposited among the archives of the monastery . So , again , we owe our knowledge of the bequests made to some parish priests by a great personage named Byhrtric , because Byhrtric left also large legacies to the Canterbury monasteries . The great Alfred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no doubt other rich men did from time to time . If the working clergy suffered , as of course they did , by the frightful ravages of the Danes , they certainly did not suffer to anything approaching the extent that the monasteries suffered . How greatly they suffered may he learnt by the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle , where we read , under the year 87o , that Archbishop Ceolnoth " commanded his private priests , and also some of the Vill priests , that they should help the few monks who remained to do God 's service . . . for , " it adds , " there was strife and sorrow over England ; and therefore the clerks remained with the monks . " I beg you to note these words . The Archbishop 's private priests in the one clause are the clerks of the other , and they are the same Clerici whom we have heard of before as secular canons ; that is , they are the staff-officers or officials of the bishops , while the Vill priests are the country parsons or parish priests , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been said that this entry in the Chronicle marks the extinction of the old monasticism in England . Extinction is , perhaps , too strong a word ; but it is undoubtedly true that in this , the first year of King Alfred 's reign , things were at their worst in the religious houses throughout the land . // I t looks very much as if this measure of the Archbishop 's was a desperate attempt to fill the ruined monasteries , where possible , with the secular or parish clergy , rather than allow the conventual life and the conventual buildings to be abandoned . The attempt may be said to have proved a failure . It was inevitable that it should be a failure ; for the single reason that the secular clergy were as a rule married men , and when they were draughted into the old monasteries they took their wives and children with them . This was not only true of the parish priests , but it was true even of the secular canons , if we may judge from the Rule of Chrodogang . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; nor does the obligation of celibacy appear to have been imposed upon them by any other penalty than such as was enforced in the case of fellows of colleges at Oxford and Cambridge fifty years ago . When , in the tenth century , the great revival of monasticism came about all over Europe and the wave of enthusiasm rolled on to England , then the cry of the monks was loud against the scandal of the old monasteries being filled by the secular canons , and the contest between the one Order and the other went on actually down to the Norman Conquest . Five years before that - event , Edward ioo THE PARISH PRIEST IN ENGLAND the Confessor was engaged in building his famous monastery at Westminster for monks who , with their abbot at their head , officiated at the King 's funeral ; while Harold , who claimed the other 's crown , was building his famous college at Waltham for secular canons , some of whom were , and all might have been , married men . It really seemed a matter of uncertainty clown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day ? the men of Rule , whose idol was the artificial and unnatural life of celibates in the cloister , or the men of Principle , whose contention was that the law of Christ allowed of freedom , and who claimed that Christ 's ministers might be of Paul the celibate or of Peter the married man , and yet both might be of Christ and doing His work in the world . During the first half of the eleventh century there is good reason for believing that the secular clergy , including the parish priests , in England had never before been so numerous . Not only so , but that relatively to the rest of the population they have never since been so rich or occupied so strong a position . In the Domsday Survey hardly more than 1,700 churches are mentioned , but it is agreed on all hands that this represents very inadequately indeed BEFORE THE REFORMATION ror the whole number that must have been in existence at the time of the Conquest . That number must certainly have run into thousands . Every one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tithes and offerings . Every one had its glebe . On the other hand , the monasteries had by no means recovered from the devastation wrought by the Danes . Many of the smaller houses had been entirely blotted out , and it may be doubted whether there were forty monasteries worth mentioning that were at this time in working order from the Tyne to the Exe.l It may indeed almost be said that at this time the parish priests had it all their own way ; and I am afraid that these clergy were none the better for their prosperity , rather that their riches had done them harm in more ways than one . Soon the fashion began of founding new monas teries . The cry was raised that only by the revival of the stricter religious life of the cloister could priests and people be reformed . The tide turned against the seculars . The monasteries rapidly became wealthy corporations enriched by lands and manors . In many instances the ownership of these // manors carried with it the patronage of the churches upon those manors ? i.e. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the abbeys and priories . Then we begin to hear of a very odious form of trading in these benefices . The rectors were in many cases compelled to pay an annual rent or pension to the monastery , the compact being made with the incumbent conditionally upon his being admitted to his cure . Protests were made against these simoniacal bargains and councils legislated against them , but it still went on . Of course the parishes , the parishioners , and the clergy suffered injury and wrong ; but this was as nothing to the mischief wrought by the appropriation of the income of a benefice to the support of a monastery , whereby the monasteries became the rectors of the parish , taking the whole endowment and leaving the inhabitants of the place to the care of a stipendiary . This kind of spoliation went on wholesale for more than two centuries , till at last thoughtful and rightthinking men lifted up their voices against the abomination , and by the middle of the fifteenth century the appropriations began to be discouraged , but not before well-nigh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great tithes and glebe lands . Concurrently with this process of disendowment , BEFORE THE REFORMATION 1o ; the wealth of the clergy had made them fair game for those in power to levy from them all sorts of exactions , civil and ecclesiastical . Twice a year they were compelled , or supposed , to attend the Diocesan Synods , and , whether they attended or not , they had to pay their fees , and perhaps higher fees for non-attendance . By this time , too , the archdeacons had become active diocesan inspectors , and their courts of inquiry were very terrible assemblies , at which heavy dues had to be paid to the officials . You catch a glimpse in Chaucer of the Archdeacon 's Summoner or " Sompnour " in the " Friar 's Tale . " The summoner was a common informer who lived by his vile trade , and woe to the luckless parson who had incurred the enmity of some aggrieved parishioner looking out for a chance of paying off an old grudge against the rector or vicar who had been too zealous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to bribe the summoner not to bring his cause into court , where , even if the parson gained the day , the expenses might easily cripple him for months or years . Then there were the taxes ( for we may as well use our modern language ) , those terrible tenths and fifteenths of which we hear so much . In the year 1294 Edward the First actually demanded half a // year 's income from the clergy , and , dreadful as the impost was , it had to be paid , though how the parsons found the money it is difficult to imagine . By this time , however , the country parsons had almost ceased to be married men , though we meet with them frequently till quite the end of the thirteenth century . After that the archdeacons and the summoners between them effectually put a stop to holy matrimony among the priests of the Lord . Nor did the steady progress of impoverishment of the working clergy end with the appropriations , the fees , and the taxes , ordinary and extraordinary . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were found to be acting very seriously in the direction of lessening the income of the clergy , and especially of the town clergy , so far as their resources were derived from freewill offerings and the like . Finally , the incomes of the clergy derivable from tuition and educational work fell off seriously with the development of the universities . Lads of promise began more and more to be sent from home to take up their residence at Cambridge or Oxford for better tuition than the parochial clergy could provide , and that happened which has come about in our own time ? viz. , that the income of the country parsons greatly decreased when the demand // for clerical private tutors well-nigh came to an encl . It is hardly to be wondered at if , as all these worries and exactions , this gradual shrinkage in the clerical incomes , went on so steadily , we should find indications of the social position of the country clergy beginning to decline towards the end of the fourteenth century . And these indications are not to be mistaken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which go back to the thirteenth century , and which in the main give the succession of incumbents in the East Anglian diocese down to the present day , and examining these lists as I find them in a single volume of Blomefield 's history of the county , the following results must strike any reader The great family of the Bardolfs were lords of the manor of Cantley , on the river Yare , from Norman times down to the reign of Henry the Fourth . As lords of the manor they were patrons of the rectory , and they resided in the parish . The rectors for nearly two centuries were either Bardolfs or bore the names of the great county families . The last of these aristocratic parsons of Cantley , as I may call them , was presented in 1372 . After that date the rectors are evidently plebeians , of whose origin we know nothing . io6 THE PARISH PRIEST IN ENGLAND The same is true in the neighbouring parish of Plumstead Parva . Down to 136o the patrons appear to have always presented one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are taken from a lower stratum . At Barton , again , where the ancient family of the Lovells were resident and patrons of the living till late in the seventeenth century , the first four rectors whose appointment is recorded are Lovells ? that is , the living was a family living , which was always held by some younger brother or poorer kinsman . After 1349 there are no more Lovells to be found among the rectors , nor any one else of whom there is anything to tell . Once more . The rectory of St. Mary Beechamwell was for ages in the gift of presentation of the Chervilles ( another of the proud old houses ) , and for generations they appear to have presented the benefice to one of their own class . After the presentation of Thomas Cherville by his father or brother Robert de Cherville about the middle of the fourteenth century , the parsons are evidently new men , and few of them even bear Norfolk names . If these instances stood alone , they would be suggestive ; but they do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line of research to those who possess or have access to our great county // Histories , or such valuable works as Mr. HingestonRandolph 's " Registers of the Diocese of Exeter . " I can only glance at the subject here . Nevertheless , though the parish priests were growing poorer and poorer from the Conquest to the Reformation , it is noticeable that they never ceased to retain the confidence and esteem of their people from first to last . My impression is that , as they ceased to belong to the gentry class by birth , they grew into more and more favour with the commonalty . In the thousands of early charters ? i.e. , conveyances of land and the like ? which I have had the eccentric pleasure of handling and reading in my leisure hours , the names of the county parsons actually swarm among the feoffees or trustees to whom settled estates , small or large , are conveyed . So , too , in the wills of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries the parish priests are so frequently appointed supervisors of wills that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be trusted for settling any such disputes as might arise between executors and legatees . As for instances of their putting pressure upon the dying that so some benefits might accrue to themselves , I can only say that I have never met with a single instance of anything of the kind , though for . thirty years I have been on the watch for one , and I have examined tog THE PARISH PRIEST IN ENGLAND and made extracts from a good many wills and testaments in my time . There 's no accounting for tastes , and some monomaniacs have a taste even for old wills ! On the other hand , when we come to the wills of the clergy themselves , we see that though among them there were all those differences in wealth , birth , culture , and habits of life which are to be found among the beneficed clergy nowadays , from the successful pluralist who held two or three pieces of preferment simultaneously or the rollicking squarson who hung loosely to his clerical income because he had landed property of his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make two ends meet , or the needy chaplain who had only his few household utensils and half a dozen shabby books to leave behind him , yet it is the rarest thing to meet with a parson 's will in which some legacy is not left to the church in which he officiates . And here let me observe in passing that it is a deep-rooted delusion , against which I have made it my business to protest for many years , that the great landlords forsooth built all our medizoval churches . I hold that to be an utter and mischievous delusion . Everything goes to show that the immense majority of the old churches of England were built not by the great men , but by BEFORE THE REFORMA TION log the small people with the clergy at their head . Where some great noble or county magnate did build a church , there you may always find his mark ; his coat armour- is sure to be carved upon every available stone or beam ; it tells its own tale . But the small folk and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to display , and the sculptor amused himself in something else than heraldic shields carved upon the battlements of a tower . In the famous " Black Book of Swaffham " in Norfolk , where the names of the chief benefactors to the church are set down with rare minutenesses , there appear the names of not less than nine rectors and vicars of the parish who , in a period of less than a century , had very materially contributed to the sustentation of the fabric of the church ( one of the finest in Norfolk ) , and had restored some really splendid gifts in the shape of service books , plate , vestments , candlesticks , and ornaments of all kinds for rendering the ritual and the service of the sanctuary as splendid and imposing as it could be made . John Bury , appointed rector of the parish in 1414 , actually built the chancel as we see it now . He evidently intended to rebuild the whole church , but he was cut short in the middle of his work , and in his will he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He left his successor to complete what IIO THE PARISH PRIEST IN ENGLAND he himself had begun . That successor was a parson of some note in his time , a D.D. , whose name was John Botewright . This gentleman accepted the honourable charge which Mr. Bury had laid upon him , and he continued the building of the church ; but be , too , left the work incomplete , and once again the vicar of the parish , Robert Fuller , did as the other clergy of the town had done before him , spending upon it a sum quite equal to IC500 of our money . I should be glad to discover that when the church was at last finished ( as it is said ) , in the reign of Henry the Seventh , Giovanni de Gigli , whom Le Neve profanely calls John Giggles , an Italian , nonresident rector of Swaffham and a great pluralist , who ended by being Bishop of London ? 1 should , I say , be glad to discover that this Right Rev. Father in God gave of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be very much surprised indeed to hear this kind of good report of him . Such documents as the " Black Book of Swaffham " are of extreme rarity , but evidence confirmatory of the part which the parsons took in the church-building exists in abundance . It only requires to be looked up and looked into . People seem to forget that the churches in // England during the centuries we are discussing belonged to the tarishioners exactly as the Board schools do now , and that this proprietary interest brought with it not only a jealous pride in their churches , but a strong love for and delight in the buildings themselves . Periodically there seems to have burst forth a great craze for church restoration over wide districts , one does not know how . Thus , in the diocese of Exeter , the bishop was called upon to re-dedicate between the years 1259 and 1268 ? actually in nine years ? no less than eighty-eight rebuilt or enlarged churches. , A century later a similar wave of zeal for church-building passed over East Anglia . You may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ churches , which in Norfolk and Suffolk unhappily , as I think , supply the places of edifices erected when ecclesias-tical architecture was in its perfect beauty , and before the decadence of the greatest of all the arts had begun . If a bishop were animated with a zeal for having fine churches in his diocese , he could put quite terrible pressure upon a parish , and put the parishioners to very serious expense . The coming of such a prelate was exactly like one of // Her Majesty 's Inspectors of Schools nowadays . " My Lords require you to enlarge your school and to provide a class-room ! " Alas ! what lamenta tions follow ! Take an instance or two . Bishop Stapeldon had come down and paid a visit to the church of Staverton , near Totnes , in 1301 . He had found some fault with the accommoda tion in the nave of the church , and apparently made some recommendations . When he came again in July , I , his lordship was evidently out of temper and dissatisfied . He would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chancel was too narrow and dark , and the nave was worse . Wherefore he made order that the rector , the vicar , and the parishioners , should remedy these defects without delay , and you may depend upon it it had to be done at whatever inconvenience. = Some years later , the bishop paid a visit to Bradninch , near Collumpton . He found the roof of the church in a bad state ( as Mr. Inspector has found perhaps yours or mine ) , and the parishioners are peremptorily ordered to put it in a condition of complete repair , and are allowed six months to do it in . As for the ways and means , that was their concern ! just about // the same time , again , the bishop appeared at Ilfra-combe. , It had been represented to him that the parish church was too small . His lordship declared that was his opinion also . Wherefore it was ordered that the parishioners should lengthen their church twenty-four feet at least before next Michaelmas twelvemonth . Was there any penalty ? Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ default of carrying out the bishop 's order was a sum of money to be paid to the mother church at Exeter , equivalent to an amount which in our time would be represented by ? 700 or 800 . But how did the unhappy creatures get the money ? For instance , how did the poor people of Broad-hempston ? a little country parish of 2,00o acres ? manage to build a brand new church on a larger scale than the old one , in the year 1401 , and finish it in two years ? How did the parishioners of Buckland Brewer in 1399 , when their church and almost all its contents were destroyed by lightning ? how did they propose to build or repair the sacred edifice ? How did the parishioners of Downe St. Mary in 1413 and many another little place that might be named ? how did they all manage it ; and manage it , too , without being re-duced to beggary ? Why , exactly as you and I // do it now ! The bishop , in cases where the poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were absolutely and utterly unable to bear the expense , gave them leave and licence to go a-begging . And who was the man who had to do the bulk of the work ? And , mind , it was very hard work indeed , in days when the roads were bad and the penny post had not been dreamt of even by the most imaginative . The man who did the work then , as now , was the parson . And how well he did it the houses of God in the land testify from John o ' Groat 's House to the Land 's Encl . Before I close I must needs offer you one or two more hints and suggestions . ( i ) The lists of ordinations in the several dioceses during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries which have come down to us are more numerous than might have been expected . They show that the number of ordained persons of all ranks was very large , and they show us also plainly that instances of parish priests living isolated and lonely lives must have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a precarious livelihood in town and country , and subsisting upon a pittance which only celibates could have managed to exist upon . The // prizes were to the blanks even fewer than they are now . But this had its advantages , such as they were . The beneficed clergy had no difficulty in finding assistance in their duties , and they were never at a loss for companionship . Moreover , licence of non-residence was very easily procured by a parson who wished to spend a year or two at the university . In many cases that licence was renewed from year to year , and it was specially common when a young man had been appointed to a benefice early in his career . In such cases the bishops occasionally insisted on his residing at Cambridge or Oxford for a time . ( 2 ) While he was away there were sure to be two or three or sometimes half a dozen " chaplains " or chantry.priests , to whom the routine work of the parish was entrusted . These men were carefully watched by the churchwardens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who did not spare them . Of course there were many clerical scamps who were a disgrace to their profession and who drifted into the ranks of the loafers . There are scamps in the medical profession , rogues in the legal profession , blacklegs among the financiers , and bankrupts among the most virtuous and upright commercial classes . But where the competition increases for every post and every place of preferrib THE . PARISH PRIEST IN ENGLAND went , there is at least an even chance that the best men come to the fore , and we do n't judge of a class by taking the convicts and ticket-of-leave men as fair specimens of the morale prevalent in the rank of life to which those unfortunate persons respectively belong at their start in life . ( 3 ) The quiet , devout , and conscientious parson , doing his duty day by day among his people , is the last man who attains to notoriety . Unless a clergyman is bent on advertising himself , the less notorious he is the better . Rogues do become notorious as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the police reports . The secular clergy before the Reformation had a very sharp look-out kept upon them , and when they tripped or went astray there were only too many people who were on the watch to expose them . Then they were heard of indeed . It is clear from such books as John Myre 's " Instructions for Parish Priests , " printed by the E.E.T.S. , that there was a much higher standard of feeling in a wide stratum of the people than some would have us believe . Nor were the congregations of the fourteenth century a whit less inclined to be censorious than those of the nineteenth . When the representatives of the parish of Colbroke were questioned authoritatively by their bishop regarding Sir William their vicar in the regular course of his BEFORE THE REFORMATION If visitation in 1301 , they said that he preached " well enough " ( suo naodo ) , that , " as far as lie knew " ( quantum novit ) , he expounded the Gospels to them , but he did not teach them much ( non @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very harmless sort of a humdrum man . There were lies told about him , but they were lies . Pretty much the same answers are given by the chief men in the little town of Colyton . Sir Robert Blund , the vicar , was a good man ( Probus hones ) ; he preached quantuan novit again , but not as much as he ought in their opinion . His predecessor was a man ; he had been wont to have classes for the instruction of all the chaplains and clerks of the Church . ( Note that ! ) But this one was remiss in this duty . Would the lord bishop be pleased to pull him up ? ( behind quod corripiatur . ) Take them all in all , I can not resist the impression , which has become deeper and deeper upon me the more I have read and pondered , that the parochial clergy in England during the centuries between the Conquest and the Reformation numbered amongst them at all times some of the best men of their generation . To begin with , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no time be said of // the monks , who from first to last were much less true subjects of the King than at heart bigoted adherents of the Pope of Rome . Chaucer 's manner of speaking of the poor parson of a town reflects the feeling not only of his own time , but really reflects the estimation in which they were held at all times . Not once , not twice in our history these parish priests are to be found siding with the people against those in power , and chosen by the people to be their spokesmen when their grievances were becoming unbearable . When that great awakening came which in the good Providence of God the friars were permitted to stir , and a new life , and a new enthusiasm , and a new hunger and thirst after holiness thrilled through the throbbing heart of the nation , the response came first from the working clergy , who joined the new Reformers wherever they appeared ? not without some grumbling that the new men absorbed large sums , in the shape of burial and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could ill afford to lose them . To the last the wills of the clergy were full of legacies to the preaching friars . When , again , a new awakening came , and the Lollards went about as they did protesting against errors which were real errors , though in the way of doing it there was all the usual violence and BEFORE T H E REFORMATION j i g exaggeration of men stirred by a fiery earnestness ? again they were the clergy , the working parish priests , who gave that movement its impetus ; and among the parish priests there were those who did not shrink then from giving their bodies to be burned , and who showed noble instances of suffering for conscience ' sake . So , too , when Wycliffe was dreaming of a great religious revolution ? hoping , in fact , for the Millennium which is so long in coming ? they were the poor priests of townlet and village to whom he appealed for sympathy and support , and he did not appeal in vain . It always has been so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving ; the men that carry the truths of the Gospel to the hearts and consciences of a nation ? and more than that , bring those truths into a nation 's hearths and homes ? are not the monks in the cloister , so anxious about their own precious souls that they hide themselves from their fellow-sinners till they become the victims of that pride which apes humility . More and more it is becoming evident that the men who are to act upon the masses must be in personal touch with the masses ? the working clergy in hamlet and village and town . It may be true that the parish priests rarely have // been the intellectual leaders of their generation or the pioneers of science , discovery , or curious learning , though there have been times when their names , even in these matters , have not been unknown . It may , again , be true that for the trained academic intellects and the great scholars who are such by profession and who lead the van of the army of intellectual progress , such are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perhaps , students are few . No ! You must look for them here ? here , where their home is ; here , where you have come to listen to them and be taught by them . The gifted and the privileged few are not to be found in the lonely parsonage or the clergy house , where the ceaseless toilers among the submerged tenth and the dreadful residuum are knocking and pressing at their doors . Yet it must be calamitous , at any time , for the Church and the nation , if the leaders of the blind are growing blinder than the led , and if they who are groping and crying out so piteously for the light should find fewer and fewer of their appointed teachers qualified to show them where such light is to be found . " ROBBING GOD " I I T must have pained many a loyal Churchman during the past month to read some of the speeches delivered at meetings held up and down the country to protest against the Welsh Suspensory Bill. = For myself , I should look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dismay , for more reasons than I care to set down here . But even were I prepared to admit that the alienation of any portion of the revenues of the Church in Wales and the diverting them into any other channel would be an unmixed evil , or were I even convinced that any measure having such an object in view would be necessarily impolitic or actually dishonest , I should still feel called upon to protest against some argument ments that have been resorted to by too many of // the fervid orators who have denounced the Bill , and to put in an earnest caveat against the assumptions made by speakers whose position and learning and unselfish zeal deserve the respect of us all . If it were a mere question of bowing to the authority of our ecclesiastical superiors , and the duty of remaining silent when a powerful consensus of opinion has found a voice which speaks with authority , it would be presumption on the part of Any clergyman in my position to ask for a hearing ; but the interests at stake are so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the discussion that is going on , though I do so with the utmost reluctance and sorely against the grain . I do so now because I am convinced that it is of supreme importance , not only to the Church and Churchmen , but to the nation at large , that at this crisis the army of defence and the army of attack should if possible be warned against taking up positions which are untenable , and so engaging in the conflict without clue consideration of the issues that are really involved . Again and again it has been said , and continues to be said , that the spoliation of the endowments of the Established Church and their redistribution would be robbing God . The expression is one which I can not but think wholly indefensible , look at the // matter in what way we may . Of course I know as well as most men do , that when in the eleventh and twelfth centuries a great or small landowner was moved to surrender a portion of his estates to what is called " pious uses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that X or Y " gave to God and the Church or the abbey of Z " this or that tract of land , or other endowment . I know that such transfer was , after the Conquest , almost invariably made by men or women during their lifetime , and was not the gift of the dead hand , as it is so frequently but erroneously represented to have been . But I know , too , that this expression " giving to God " meant primarily that the donors had performed an act of surrender and sacrifice whereby they deprived themselves of the enjoyment of this or that source of wealth that God might be glorified , and that others might derive benefit by the usufruct of such property as the good men or women had stript themselves of from more or less high and conscientious motives . When , as was often the case , forms of malediction were added upon all who should at any future time alienate or diminish the " free alms , " this addition goes far to show that even in the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always regarded as inviolable . Indeed , as time went on much of the property which had been regarded as essentially inalienable got into strange hands . // But the question has been raised and debated , sometimes from the moral , sometimes from the political point of view , as to whether a gift of this kind was not in its essence a usurpation on the giver 's part ; whether , in fact , he was not conveying more than he had the power to bestow , and claiming rights over his property which are not inherent in ownership . Looked at from the standpoint of the constitutional historian , it may be said that such gifts of lands as we are considering could not be made without the license of the Crown in the first instance , nor without the confirmation of the heirs even for generations after the death of the original donor . That is to say , that every such surrender of ownership , as it is the fashion to call a " gift to God , " was a gift which could only be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which in those ages necessarily took the form of a license from the sovereign , and was a gift requiring the consent of the heirs whose prospective interest was barred by the act of the tenant for life ; the theory being that without such confirmation the land might . revert to the heirs . Moreover , when these grants took effect the property conveyed was in all cases to be enjoyed subject to certain conditions binding upon the // beneficiaries ; the enormous assumption being that the ownership of property carried with it a right to dictate to all posterity what use such property should be turned to . At the time of the Conquest the income derived from tithes and glebe lands in England was devoted to the support of the Ecclesiastical Order . The Secular clergy , as they were called , had compara tively few obligations , and those may be fairly summed up by saying that the clergy were expected to live among the lay folk to discharge certain pastoral , ministerial , and priestly functions , and probably to some extent to serve as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the enrich ment of the monasteries , if not quite unknown , had certainly been but rarely allowed and seldom attempted . With the Conquest the alienation of strictly ecclesiastical endowments began and went on rapidly . The justification of such alienation was based upon two assumptions : ( 1 ) The first was , that such endowments as had been granted to the Church , and the reservation of which had been sanctioned by the State , were intended to secure for the nation not only all that the Seculars ( that is , the parish priests ) were doing or professed to be doing for their people , but some128 " ROBBING GOD " thing more , something much more , which the Seculars were not doing and were not qualified to do . ( 2 ) The second assumption was , that wherever it became apparent that the needs of the nation , the spiritual or the educational needs , could not be adequately supplied by the old functionaries ? while a new order of volunteers had arisen who claimed to be able to supply the new needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to divert endowments held under conditions supposed to be adequate formerly , and to allocate them for the maintenance of the new functionaries . Such alienation was carried out accordingly , that so the requirements of a wider culture , a deeper sense of moral and spiritual responsibility , and a steady advance in our civilisation ( using that word in its widest sense ) might be to some extent provided for and their stability be secured , by at least a grant in aid , from the reserve of ecclesiastical property . Thus when the rage for the cloister life was running its course and monasteries were springing up in every shire it was loudly proclaimed that these institutions were the only possible abodes of holiness . It was said and believed that only among " the religious " ? i.e. , the men and women who // were subject to a rule of discipline , framed so as to minimise worldliness and to train the Regulars in the ways of godliness ? could the conscience , the sentiment of aspiration , and the habits of devotion and self-surrender be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the parish priests had been aiming at . It began to be believed that the nation needed to be taught " the ways of holiness ; " and in proportion as this conviction gained ground , in that proportion did fresh endowments pour in for the enrichment of the new order . The monks and nuns ? rightly or wrongly ? got to be looked upon as a supplementary force who were doing that which the parish priests could not do ; and it was hardly a step further to claim for the newly organised volunteers a share of the ancient revenues which , it was almost broadly asserted , were not doing for the nation all that might be done with them in the interest of the community at large . But these alienations of Church troj5erly did not stop at this point . It would be difficult to say how soon and when first the clergy began to claim immunity from taxation ; but among us at the time of the Conquest they certainly were called upon to contribute towards the defence of the realm , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of providing contingents of armed retainers who should support the King in his wars . Scarcely fifty years after the Conqueror 's death the crusading mania had passed like a conflagration over the Continent of Europe . In process of time it reached us , with what results most people know . A belief prevailed extensively that battle with the infidels was the highest act of piety and selfsacrifice , and , as the child of that mischievous delusion , there grew up the strange institution of ecclesiastical orders of knighthood , among whom the order of the Knights Templars became the most renowned . The Templars were looked upon as the champions of Christendom , the keepers of the Holy Sepulchre , the army of occupation in the Holy Land . Of course they were laymen , and their occupation was war . But the war was a holy war , forsooth ; they were emphatically fighters for God . As such they too put forth their claim to participate in the income derivable from the Ecclesiastical Reserve , and the claim was very soon allowed . The consciences of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of some may have been lifted up with indignation against the impudent fraud , but the twelfth century was not half over before the wealth of the Templars had become the occasion of scandal " ROBBING GOD " 1 31 and offence , and the more so because churches , benefices , and tithes had been extensively alienated in their favour ; the excuse for such alienation , and its justification in Church law , being that the Templars were fighting God 's battles and so were doing for the Church what the clergy could not do for themselves . Another century went by and a new movement began . Originating in the religious upheaval which the enthusiasm of the mendicant orders gave rise to , it speedily took the form of an intellectual awakening . As educationists the Secular clergy had been found wanting : they had not been efficient as the teachers of the people . To some small extent the monks had taken over the work of their rivals in this respect . Perhaps it may be said that the Regulars had posed as " men of light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two or three centuries the monks too had fallen very far behind their ideal . As the homes for the studious , as nurseries for scholars pursuing their researches , as schools for the rising generation , the religious houses too had proved a failure . The few splendid exceptions only proved the rule that the monasteries were doing less than was expected of them in the way of raising the standard of morals , devotion , and , least of all , of learning . // It was found that young Englishmen of exceptional gifts and ambitions were seeking at Paris , at Padua , at Bologna or Palermo , that education in law , medicine , or theology which they could not find at home . Thoughtful and patriotic students and scholars set themselves to supply the want of a higher culture in England , which was making itself felt unmistakably . Walter de Merton led the way , and Merton College was founded . His example was quickly followed , and Cambridge and Oxford became the real homes of learning among us before the fourteenth century was half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrowly ecclesiastical in the studies they promoted , so far from their being theological seminaries as we understand that designation now , so far from being religious houses ? that is , monastic in their character ? it is certain that from two at least of them monks and friars were expressly excluded , and one of the new colleges was founded for students of the Civil and Canon Law , and for such alone . The founders of these colleges were pre-eminently educational reformers . They came forward nobly to head the party of progress in this direction , and they , in their generosity , made large sacrifices of their substance to further the great ends they had in view ? sacrifices which the nation sanctioned by licensing the alienation of lands for the endowments. // But this was not all . Once more the tithes of country parishes , glebe lands , and parsonages were diverted and made over to the new foundations ; the common sense of the community tacitly expressing its conviction that it was for the advantage of the people at large ? yes ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? that the standard of education should be raised , and that ( inasmuch as the great reserve had been handed down to promote the spiritual , moral , and intellectual well-being of the nation ) it was legitimate to subsidise , from the common stock , any of those bringers-in of new things whose lives were devoted to the furtherance of any one of these ends . All this is demonstrable from history . It is not needful , it would be mere waste of time , to prove the point with minute elaboration . To this hour such of our colleges and schools as date back to pre-Reformation days derive large portions of their incomes from Church lands and tithes which for ages had been devoted exclusively to the support of the ministers of the sanctuary . The process has always been going on . Are we now going to denounce the principle which has guided our course for well-nigh a thousand years as sacrilege ? Can we seriously pretend that all these successive diversions of Church property deserved to be stigmatised as robbery ? II 1 T HE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be brought under the influence of Samuel Taylor Coleridge is passing away . The number of those who actually knew him , saw him , heard him , and were subjected to the sway of his attractive personality is now very small . He died when I was a child ; but I had hardly grown up to manhood before I had been taught to reverence his name , to give myself to an enthusiastic study of his writings , and to accept his teaching as the teaching of one whom it was almost always safe and wise to follow as a guide . No man who watches the currents of thought that are setting in this direction or in that , and which are the resultants of forces brought into action by the onward march of discovery and the progress of science , can hold exactly to the views which sufficed for him in his younger days ; for 134 // bigotry in his political or philosophic creed can only be the intellectual vice of him whose mind does not grow . Nevertheless , for myself , I still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his time , and almost the most philosophic Conservative that this country has ever produced . My conviction is still strong that his tractate , " On the Constitution of the Church and State according to the Idea of Each , " is one of those monumental works which no thoughtful man among us ought to leave unread ? and , I may add , unstudied . If the book were always attractive in its every page ; if it did not contain many curious and characteristic weaknesses ? sometimes irritating , sometimes saddening ; if it did not occasionally put a certain strain upon a disciple 's loyalty , it would not be Coleridge 's . But accept it for what it is and what it professes to be ? not a scholastic treatise , but something more if also something less ? and the propositions enunciated seem to me irrefragable , the conclusions arrived at unanswerable . The two fundamental positions laid down by Coleridge are concerned , the one with the true idea of the National Church , the other with the idea of what I have called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Coleridge calls the Nationally . Of the first he says : " The Clerisy of the nation , or National Church , in its primary acceptation and original intention , comprehended the learned of all denominations , the sages and professors of the law and jurisprudence , of medicine and physiology , of music , of military and civil architecture , of the physical sciences , with the mathematical as the common organ of the preceding ; in short , all the so-called liberal arts and sciences , the possession and application of which constitute the civilisation of a country , as well as the theological . " ( 2 ) Of the second ? that is , the Nationally , or what in common parlance we are wont to call Church property ? he says as distinctly and emphatically as before : " I do not assert that the proceeds from the Nationalty can not be rightfully vested except in what we now mean by clergymen and the established clergy . I have everywhere implied the contrary . .. . Had every rood , every peppercorn , every stone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Reformation , ' no right would have been invaded , no principle of justice violated . What the State by law ? that is , by the collective will of its functionaries at any one time assembled ? can do or su Jer to be done , that the State by law can undo or inhibit. " // Let it be noted that these are the words of a thinker who has again and again been called the Tory Philosopher ? whose name for more than seventy years has been a name to conjure by among those who consider themselves and claim to be considered the only true Conservatives ? the thinker whom not a few Progressionists ( because they have never read his writings ) have superciliously derided as a dreamer of whom the best that could be said was that his writings were harmless and his theories consigned to oblivion . Yet Coleridge 's " Church and State " has worked as such leaven always does work , and it would be very hard to say how much its pregnant hints and suggestions have affected the legislation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book appeared a commission of inquiry into the state of the Church of England was issued , and in 1836 the Ecclesiastical Commis sioners became a Corporation with perpetual succes sion and a common seal . It was the beginning of a new era . Since then we have dealt with ecclesias tical property ? the Nationally ? on the assumption that it constitutes a fund which the Legislature had not only the right to administer for the well-being of the people , but that it was the duty of the nation too to guard against its being in any way wastefully // administered . The episcopal and capitular estates have been taken out of the control of those bodies , and readjustment of the revenues has been carried out with a high hand . Restrictions have been imposed upon the granting of leases by the tenants for life . Benefices have been divided or consolidated with small regard to the real or supposed rights of patrons . We have recognised that the Nationally might legitimately be treated as a fund not necessarily limited in its application to the maintenance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitution of our older Universities ; we have imposed new statutes upon the older colleges ; we have very seriously diminished their available incomes ; we have changed the tenure by which Fellowships were held ; we have almost abolished their ecclesiastical character ; we have dealt in the same way with our endowed schools , and at this moment the headmasters of some of the most important among them are laymen . What results have followed upon these changes ? Fifty years ago there were twenty-four professors in the University of Cambridge , of whom five only were laymen . There are now forty professors , of whom , excluding the professors of Divinity , only three are in Holy Orders ; while at Oxford , of the // forty-eight professors , excluding the professors of Divinity , again only three are clergymen . If it were worth while to compare the numbers of lay and " clerical " Fellows of Colleges respectively as they stood in 1843 and as they stand at present , the change that has come over the Universities in half a century would be even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to many , a matter to be mourned over ; it may have , and it has , occasioned melancholy and lugubrious vaticinations ; it may or may not augur ill for the future ; but the facts are not to be gainsaid . Nor can we shut our eyes to another fact ? deplorable or not according to our several points of view ? a fact to which attention has not been drawn with that serious insistence which its significance might well justify ? a fact , too , which it is hardly conceivable should not affect our legislation in the future , because it is the outcome of our legislation in the past . / The leaders in thought and culture , in mathematical and physical science , in history , economics , linguistics , even in classical learning ? the leaders in literature in its widest acceptation ? are no longer to be found among the ordained clergy of the Church of England , but outside their ranks . One fact alone may serve as a most startling confirmation of these assertions . In 1843 there were ninety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who were in Holy Orders . In 1893 the names of no more than sixteen clergymen of the Established Church are to be found in the roll-call of England 's most illustrious brotherhood . It is worse than idle to shut our eyes to all this ? the logic of facts is irresistible . Meanwhile it is no more than their due to protest for the clergy of the Established Church that , as a body , they were never doing their pastoral work better than they are doing it now ; never were they less worldly and mercenary ; never were their lives more exemplary ; never were they making greater sacrifices ; never were they more earnestly devoted to their sacred calling . Their very zeal and unwearied labours have taught the laity to expect ever more and more at their hands . Yet with the increasing claims that have been and are made upon their services , the immense increase of the population brings home to us the certainty that it is no longer possible for the Anglican clergy to discharge all those duties ? the spiritual and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the highest interest of the community , should not be neglected . It is not conceivable that we should stop at the point we have reached . Doubtless , in the old days , the parish priests protested against the alienation of their incomes for " ROBBING GOD " subsidising the monastic orders . They were not likely " to take joyfully the spoiling of their goods " when the great educational movement set in , and the founders of schools and colleges levied large contributions from the Nationally , and to that extent impoverished the parish priests . But in each case the new impropriators proved to be powerful auxiliaries , stimulating the Seculars , elevating their tone , and provoking them to jealousy . In any case , the question was far less whether the alienation of the old endowments and the diversion of them into a new channel of usefulness was defensible , than whether there was not some danger of this being carried too far in favour of the new order . What , then , is the attitude which it behoves us ally ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised for the disestablishment and disendowment of the Church of England ? Surely our first business is to press for an answer to the question , What do these men mean who take it as their shibboleth ? If they mean nothing more and nothing less than indiscriminate pillage , ending in a scramble for the spoils ; if they mean stripping the clergy of their incomes , driving them out from their homes , and leaving the poor of the land to find religious teachers and pastors for themselves ? then their // object is to bring about an incomparable national calamity . The inevitable consequence of such a catastrophe would be that in the domain of morals and religious sentiment , when our nobler emotions and spiritual aspirations and gentler sympathies are appealed to , there the forces of disintegration would have their full play , unchecked , uncontrolled  --  chaos would come again . But that cry may be changed for a better cry ; it may , in God 's providence , be taught to take another form , and it may then express the conviction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step , not backwards into darkness and religious anarchy , but forwards upon the road of intelligent reform . Whatever it may mean , it is the utmost madness and stupidity to attempt to raise against it a louder but scarcely less misleading and mischievous cry , because one which is in its essence an assninptio falsi . Base the title of the Established Church to her endowments upon considerations of the highest political expediency , and you choose ground from which it will be difficult to be dislodged . Appeal to the gratitude of our countrymen , and teach them what the Anglican clergy have been and have done for their ancestors and their fatherland in the past , and you will not appeal in vain . Nay , appeal to the hopes and fears of the future if you will , and , rightly " ROBBING GOD " r4$ instructed , the nation will no longer surrender themselves to those who would " make a desert and call it peace . " But beware how you rashly and stubbornly insist that the formula , the ritual , the discipline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ established , are each and all equally and indubitably of Divine origin , and that to alienate one jot or tittle of her property is to " rob GOD " THE CRY OF THE VILLAGES I AM continually worried by a kind of dream which disturbs my peace of mind by day and by night , and which yet I can not bring myself to believe is anything more than an ignorant and foolish dream , deluding me into the acceptance of half a truth as though that were as true as the whole . Call my dream a delusion if you will , but this is what it says to me with a cruel insistences There is , says the voice in my dream , a great and dreadful law working through all the Universe and operating in the direction of glorifying mere bigness at the expense of littleness , so that the little is for ever being absorbed and consumed , even annihilated by the huge .

My transcendental friends assure me that the Material Universe ? that is the immense aggregate of worlds which are made of matter ? so far from being infinite is demonstrably not infinite ; on the contrary , that it is probably only one of many Universes , held in solution by the much more widely diffused something which is called Ether ; and that there was a time when Matter existed as a vast chaos whose constituent atoms were floating in this all-embracing Ether ; each separate atom self-asserting and yet acting upon and being acted upon by the rest . Then the aforesaid atoms proceeded to combine and cohere into molecules ; the molecules tended to grow into masses , and the masses could not but associate into worlds . Thus , too , worlds were evolved into systems with central suns round which they moved in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vagrant refuse meteors , and occasionally devouring as their prey some unhappy little worldling which per-adventure had been rejoicing in its prosperous independence . Thus the big from the beginning of time has always swallowed up the little , and so it will go on for ever and ever . // Yes 1 And observe , moreover , what an object lesson this little proud planet of ours affords to all beholders ! There were eons during which the living creatures upon its surface ran to Bigness . Monstrous saurians ? mastodons ? what not , here in our northern latitudes ; while down there on the distant Australian continent there grew up grim marsupial lions , voiceless , well-nigh brainless , but enormous , devouring gluttonously the lesser creatures , good only for filling the maws of their bigger brethren .

Nevertheless , you might stretch a point , and give them the credit of knowing just a little about their peculiar one . " I pity his ignorance and despise him , " said Miss Squeers . Could she not have got on without the contempt , and yet afforded the pity ? To any thoughtful student of our social history during the last thirty years , few facts are more worthy of notice than the wholly different way in which our elementary schools are regarded by the . dwellers in the town and country respectively . In // our country villages the school is the be-all and the end-all of human culture . The child who has passed his standards is reckoned a perfectly educated boy or girl , and it must be added that , as a rule , among our elementary teachers themselves there are few who care to dissipate this delusion . In the town , on the other hand , the elementary school is looked upon as the mere beginning and starting point from which all noble endeavours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That the children must be taught , and taught as well as may be , has been assumed as a necessity ; but that having been taught a minimum of elementary knowledge they should be left to take their chance and run wild for the rest of their lives is not to he heard of . Some of them ? perhaps many of them ? came from vicious homes , and live in squalid dens and cellars . Then the Augean stables must be cleansed , and the slums must be got rid of if possible , in the interest of the children that are and of those that are to be . So you set yourselves to improve your toilers ' dwellings , and you erect sanitary dwellings for the poor , and you issue your appeals to the rich for this good cause and that . The more you ask the more you get , till ungrudging benevolence seems actually tending to overtake the needs of your crowded millions . // But part passe with the magnificent activity shown in providing suitable dwellings for the workers , others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endeavours to make the lives of their poor brethren more joyous , more interesting , more rational , more human . You lay out parks and recreation grounds , build museums and art galleries , libraries , and lecture halls . You make vice difficult , and amusement refining . There is nothing in the whole world that can compare with the exhibitions which are open to the poorest in London , and no better music than that which a poor fellow out of work may listen to at his leisure when the bands play . Nor is it only in the great capital of the Empire that all this wealth in the means of innocent enjoyment is provided for the million . Birmingham and Liverpool and Manchester and Sheffield , and many another of our large cities , vie with one another in the conspicuous examples they afford of that magnanimous foresight which is always on the look-out for new channels of beneficence . For let it be remembered that only a small part of all this money spent in advancing the happiness and well-being of the wage-earners has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ granting that the great bulk of the cost of // building and keeping up our schools has come out of rates and taxes , our hospitals in the main are supported by voluntary contributions , and churches " of all denominations " are being built with more or less splendour every year by private munificence . Even colleges and universities are founded and endowed by the grand liberality of rich men here and there and everywhere . What can be more splendid than the starting up of the University of Liverpool , as if by magic , during the too short career of its first accomplished principal , at whose suggestion a dozen or more Liverpool merchants have provided for the maintenance in perpetuity of as many professorial chairs ? Even this glorious generosity seems not unlikely to be surpassed by the men of Birmingham , who have resolved to have another university of their own . But , indeed , the wonderful work done , and the sacrifices made by the citizens of Birmingham in the interest of the working classes , are almost bewildering when one comes to count @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city which as yet only takes the sixth place in the Empire , and whose population hardly amounts to a ninth of the enormous aggregate of London .
