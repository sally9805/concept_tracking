txt RepresentatiNes McCall of Massachusetts and Russell of Texas kept the House interested to-day with speeches on the Hepburn rate bill in which Mr. Russell referred ' to the President , by implication , as a " quitter . " Mr. McCall , who assailed the rate making provisions of the bill , remarked that the agitation grew out of " the Presidential non sequitur , " in his message of December , 1904 . Bryan had hailed ratemaking as a decisive step toward Governrrent ownership . He looked upon it as his own child , and as he was starting around the world he " with paternal solicitude commended the bantling to tho tender care of the President ? ' The Democratic Party followed their leader . As for ? Republicans , they were expected to follow the President , logic or no logic , and " get in line . " Me did not think a commission could be found to meet the ideals of the President The first Canal commissioners received magnificent salaries , yet were unceremoniously dropped a year after the Presi- : dent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even with the aid of a. ten-thousand-dollar press agent , does not seem to command the admiring approval of the country . " The present effort Mr. McCall called " political ratemaking , " and added : " At the rate we are now going , it will not be long before we regulate everything and everybody from Washington . You can not govern the whole universe from a single point and have a shred of liberty survive . " Ntr . Russell is a member of the Committee on Inter-State and Foreign Commerce , ' and , of course , supported the bill . But there are some features , which , as a Democrat , he would like to see changed , and he did not hesitate to criticise . " Whatever else may be said of the railways , they are fighters , and they are not quitters , " he said . " You may whip them the first five days of the week , but they will - fight you just as gamely on Saturday . But did we not have in the President a fighter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charged up San Juan Hill just as gallantly as we thought he would if he had been there ? Laughter . Is the President a quitter ! Let the sequel answer . " The International Railway Congress met in Washington in May , I think , of last year . At that time the President was making a tour of the West . And while that congress was here they flouted a challenge to the President , which was quickly accented by him in a speech he made at Denver before the Chamber of Commerce . The President on the Sfh day of May , I think , spoke before that body to the ' toast , The Nation . ' With high courage he faced his foes with this defiant challenge : " I want to say a word as to a Governmental policy in which I feel this country ought to take a great interest , and which is itself a part of the general policy to which I think our Government must go . I propose a policy of extending the powers of the Inter-State Commerce Commission , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to have the rates that they fix go into effect practically at once . ' " So the battle went on , and the people rained to the President and loved him for the enemies he had made . " But just prior to this session of Congress there began to be rumors - that the President was too good a party man to disrupt his party on the rate question ; that he was a Republican first and patriot afterward , and it began to be reported that scrnebody had surrendered and that there was a white . flag float-1 ing over the White House . At last the President 's message on the rate question came to Congress . Here is what he said : In my judgment the most important provision which such law should contain is that conferring on some competent administrative body the power to decide , upon the case being brought before it , whether a given rate prescribed by a railroad is reasonable and just if it is found to be unreasonable and unjust , then , after full investigation of the complaint , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be lawful to go  --  the maximum reasonable rate , as it is commonly called  --  this decision to go into effect within a reasonable time and to obtain from thence onward , subject ' to reveiw by the courts . ' " Oh , what a fall was there , my countrymen ! To prescribe a maximum reasonable rate , says the President in his message . With that written into the law does anybody doubt that the railways would always prescribe the highest reasonable rate ? To fix a maximum reasonable rate is , in my judgment , to fix the dividing line between reasonableness and extortion . " HOPKINSON SMITH SURPRISED . Ca n't See Why Negroes Hissed Him ? Wrote Only Good of Them . The hissing of his name at the meeting of the Constitutional League in Cooper Union on Thursday night brought forth a warm retort from P. Hopkinson Smith last night . Most of those at the meeting were negroes , and the audience hissed when the author 's name was mentioned with those of Senator Tillman of South Carolina , Gov . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of North Carolina . " I ca n't see why the negroes should have hissed me , " said Mr. Smith to a TIMES reporter last night . " As far as I am concerned , I have written nothing but the best of the negro into my stories , just as has Tom Page . We have both left out the bad . New Yorkers should think of the negroes who are at work to-day eighty feet under the surface of the East River , and should think of them as needing a kind and helpful word . They do n't need agitation , they need kindness and mercy . " , The negroes were compelled to steal to live for a while , and they have given us many criminals of their color . Now we must help them to do better and be better people , must extend to them helpful hands , and we can do that . " What is the use of Boeker Washington teaching them to lay bricks and do carpenter work ? They always did'these things before the war , and they know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to find some other means of dealing with the fieldhand negro to-day , some bond servant scheme to keep him at work and to keep him content , and well cared for . " air- Smith stroked his mustache and pondered before he tackled the negro problem as a problem . " Such works as ' The Clansman , ' he said , " and The Leopard 's Spots ' are doing as much harm to the races as did ' Uncle Tom 's Cabin . ' They have all been written at the wrong time . The Dixon effort , or play , puts into the minds of many people every night the germ of a crime for which the negro is mobbed or lynched . The crime is a creation of the author 's brain . " The negro is never insolent to a Southerner , the Southern white man . There never was any trouble between them . We must hold out a kindly hand to the negro . North or South , and help him . That my name was hissed was a surprise to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his Southern tales . " I 'm at work on several short stories of the South , " he said . " Any long story ? " he was asked . " Colonel Carter of Cartersville " pulled at his gray mustache and looked guilty as he replied : " I ought to be at work on one . " VEST INDIES CUT OFF . No Cable Communication Beyond Ja ? maica  --  Cause Unknown . It was announced yesterday that cable communication with the West Indies was cut off beyond Jamaica . The cause of the interruption is not known . There are three lines to West Indian goinrs beyond Jamaica , two of them extending from Jamaica to Porto Rico and the other from Puerto Plata ( Santo Domingo ) to St. Thomas , Danish West Indies . The Puerto Plata-St . Thomas line and one of the Jamaica-Porto Rico wires have been out of order for some time , so that when the second JamaicaPorto Rico circuit became unworkable there was no means of communication beyond . The points cut off are Porto Rico , St. Thomas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Barbados , and Trinidad .
