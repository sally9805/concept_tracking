txt Prof. Adolf Lorenz , who arrived in this city on Saturday , operated upon two cases Of congenital dislocation yesterday . morning . Both , he said latervin the day , were entirely successful . One was a very hard case , though it took only ten minutes to get the hip bone into the socket . A local doctor Performed a similar operation , following those made by Dr. Lorenz . It was not expected that the famous surgeon would make his first demonstration until to-day at the Hospital of the Ruptured and Crippled , Lexington Avenue and Forty-second Street , but he was up bright and early yesterday , and after a breakfast at the Holland House , walked in company with Dr. Milner to the private hospital of Dr. Carter , at 148 East Thirty-fifth Street , where the operations took place in the operating room on the third floor , in the presence of Drs . D. D. Ashley , Milner , Ogilvy , Carter . and others . These operations were the cause of some friction among the many doctors here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though they entirely exonerate Dr. Lorenz . The latter asked that no account of the operations be made public , but the representative of a newspaper , to the exclusion of all other reporters , was admitted to the operating room and allowed to take photographs . It was said that Dr. Lorenz was operating for a surgeon on some private cases only . A surgeon who is a member of the Reception Committee and was not present at the operation said : " It was arranged that was to take entire charge of the plans for Dr. Lorenz 's visit to New York and make all his engagements . Already there have been hundreds of applications from all parts of the country from doctors who have private patients and want them treated . If it had been thought that Dr. Lorenz would operate today then other doctors would have tried to get some of their patients to him . We thought out of courtesy that he should be permitted to rest to-day . " Dr. Ashley was told that the operations had occasioned some al-feeling among some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These were private cases , and Dr. Lorenz kept his word in every way when he said that his first public demonstration of his method would not take place until to-morrow . The fact that these operations were to take ' place was not supposed to have been known , nor was the place where they were performed to be made public . " None of the other doctors who were present would discuss the matter or talk of the operations . Dr. Lorenz reached Dr. Carter 's private hospital between 20 and 21 o'clock yesterday morning . He at once began to prepare for the operation , and asked if everything was in readiness . He was answered in the affirmative . A white duck suit had been provided for the doctor , but this he declined and took a long apron from his valise which Dr. Muller carried . The other doctors present wore white duck suits . Dr. Lorenz . roll lag up his sleeves , announced . " I am ready ; bring the patient . " THE FIRST OPERATION . Gertrude , the twelve-year-old daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One Hundred and Forty-first Street , was the first selection front three patients . Dr. Lorenz rarely unclertakes a case where the patient is over eight years of age . From her birth Gertrude had been a cripple , and her trouble repeatedly had been diagnosed incorrectly till an X-ray photograph was taken and the dislocation determined . At this age the bones of the hip naturally are harder than at an earlier age , and consequently more difficult to set in place if they have been out of the socket since birth . The girl is an unusually large child , and the dislocation was marked , as for many years she has been forced to walk with a three-inch lift on her shoe . She was accompanied by her father , and though she cried , consented to the operation , and , after being placed upon the table , and the anaesthetic administered , knew nothing more for several hours . When she ; ' awoke she found herself clothed in a plas- , ter paris cast which will remain about her body for several weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When he saw the patient and noted how developed she was the operator remarked that it would require some strength , but the protruding muscles on his arms showed that this was-not lacking . When he began the girl 's leg was shorter than the other and was turned outward . Drs . Muller and Ashley held the patient firmly at the hip . Dr. Lorenz began with a - twisting movement , at the same time nutting his arm about the leg and pulling . Then he forced the leg backward to nearly the level of the face . For ten minutes he twisted and turned and pulled until at length , having got the hip into place be stopped and recovered his breath while Ins assistants began the work of making the plaster parts covering . The patient was Out to bed at once and the anxious father , who was waiting in an adjoining room , was made glad by the assurance 1 that the operation appeared to be a success , Dr. Lorenz had talked little during the operation , but occasionally questions were asked by the doctors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of a five-yearold child , and it took only a few minutes to place . the hip bone right . A third operation was Performed by Dr. Ashley , also with successful results . Dr. Lorenz then returned to the Holland House . where he , with Drs . Muller , Homer , Reginald Sayre , and Virgil Gibney , had 1 luncheon . In the afternoon he went for a sleighride round New York , visiting Central Park and through Riverside Drive . He took dinner at the Holland House . Asked for his impressions of New York , he said : " New York is a grand . big city , and I like it very much . I like the Park . and the Riverside Drive is one of the finest places I ever saw . It was beautiful with snosv to-day , and it refreshed me very much , I am not tired at all . " " EQUAL TO ANY TASK . " The doctor was told by the committee of physicians that he would not be asked to perform more than one operation a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he answered : " I feel strong enough and equal to any task . The people- in this country are inclined to think that I am alone a specialist on congenital dislocation , when I would like to do other work in the orthopaedic line . I will try while I am in New -4 ork to perform a few operations to remedy club feet . I have had as much success in this line as I have had in hip diseases , and I am-most anxious to demonstrate it here . " Dr. ' Lorenz was asked about the operations he . had performed in the morning . " Those were private cases , " he said , " I do not care to talk of them . They were done by request of a doctor whom I have known for a long time . " " Did you regard the case of Gertrude as a hard one ? " he was asked . ' " - Yes ; it was a- very hard one , and T was doubtful if it - would prove successfulbut it did , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctors Hof this country are selecting the hardest cases for you ' : No , I take them just as they come . The harder cases they seem . the more interesting they are . There will be . a case at the Post-Graduate Hospital where both bones of the hip have been dislocated . One has been set here by ' an American doctor , and the other I will try and set into place . " The doctor last night attended the concert in Carnegie Hall . given by the German Leiderkranz and the Anion Society in aid of the German Hospital. - Dr. Lorenz was the guest of Herman Ridder. in whose box he received the officers of the two societies and other prominent GermanAmericans . At 3 o'clock this afternoon he will go to the Hospital for the Ruptured and Crippled , where there are fifteen cases of supposed hip dislocation . Out of this number he will probably select three or four , and may operate upon all of these to-day .

Dr. Lorenz evidently does not believe in alcoholic beverages , and no matter what the occasion is , he will not partake of them in any form whatever , declining even the lightest wines . He prefers strong tea . clear , without sweetening . On Saturday night last Dr. Gibney had prepared an elaborate luncheon for him after the theatre , and there were wines on the table of the choicest brand . It was noticed that he did not touch them , and lie was asked why . He said he cared only for tea .
