txt The climax to the Cockran-Dalzell affair came in the House to-day , and but for the Speaker 's personal participation in the proceedings , in violation of all custom , Cockran might have stampeded the whole body , Republicans as Well as Democrats . John Dalzell went forth against him again , this time prepared for action , heeled from head to foot with evidence . At the end of his hour and thirty-five minutes of elaborate piling up of charges , Cockran tumultuously denied every one of the charges , and offered and demanded the immediate passage of a resolution appointing a committee of five to investigate them . Cockran 's eloquence had so wrought upon the House that if he had succeeded in getting his resolution up it might have been carried . The Republicans succeeded in choking it off by the aid of the Speaker , who insisted on putting it over for a day , declining to rule on an ingenious point of order , fished up in the nick of time by Mr. Payne , until he had examined precedents . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1896 was bought , naming the price at $16,000,000 . He declared that the reason that the Republicans so readily believed the charge that be had been bought was that they knew men were bought in that campaign . The Republican objection to an investigation thus makes an effective contrast with Cockran 's demand for one , and the moral effect of the New Yorker 's victory is conceded to be even greater than that ' of Saturday . One of the Democratic leaders said to-night that if the committee were appointed Mr. Cockran would insist on calling Perry Heath , who was intimately connected with the National Committee of 1896 and its Secretary in 1900 , and that in his present frame of mind Heath might be willing to say a good many things . itt-aa **31;318;TOOLONG The demand for an investigation made a dramatic scene . Daizell 's speech had been not only elaborate*Bilt Itetyliitter . The first part of Coekran 's reply was measured and the Republicans began to gain confidence and to jeer him . Suddenly he awoke , repelled all Dalzell 's charges , treated the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and wound up by waving his resolution in the faces of the Republicans , after a bitter denunciation of their " ruption . " In expectation of the verbal duel the galleries were crowded fully two hours before Dalzell took the fl1oor . The Pennsylvanian spoke for a while in opposition to Cockran 's tariff views . The Democrats listened without any sign of disapprobation or dissent , except when Dalzell said ; " What did the gentleman say in his speech on Saturday ? Much that I shall not stop to quote . " Then they laughed and jeered and shouted : Yes , it might be embarrassing . " " I will answer any question properly put to me , " said Dalzell sharply , " but I will not answer catcalls . " The Republicans applauded and the Democrats subsided . Dalzell then took np the subject of his colloquy with Cockran on Saturday . " I asked the gentleman from New York , " said he , " a civil question . I got a brutal answer . Applause . I am an intense partisan ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Applause . The newspapers say I made an unjustifiable attack on him . On the contrary , he made an unjustifiable and contemptible attack on me . DALZELL 'S ATTACK . " It is the current belief to this day that the gentleman from New York received money for political work , and I am going to support the plausibility of my charge by some facts connected with his history . I make no charges against the gentleman ; I said I was ' informed . ' I am going to prove that I was informed in more ways than one . A matter of this kind does not admit of positive proof , but does admit of proof by circumstantial evidence . " Dalzell went on to charge that Cockran was a greenbacker in the Maine campaign of 1880 . " And yet , " said he , " in the campaign he could not join the Democratic Party because he was for sound money . For sound money in 1896 , traveling all over the country in support of Bryan in 1900 . Greenbacker , sound-money man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and as such became a member of Congress . Ile has been an anti-Tammanyite , and A such he ceased to be a member of Congress . Laughter . He is a Tammanyite now again , and now again he is a member of Congress . Now I ask you whether that checkered career would not have a tendency to make suspicious people think there were other considerations than principle animating a gentleman who has had such a harlequin career ? " Mr. Dalzell . nen read a number of attacks on Cockran from The New York Journal , insinuating irregular ... things of his connection with the Republicans . Next he read an editorial article from The New York Tribune insinuating that Cockran supported Col. McClellan for Mayor from questionable motives . Then came an article in The Philadelphia Press saying that while the Republican Committee did not pay Cockran directly in 1896 , the Palmer and Buckner Committee did . " Now , " said he , " I appeal to you gentlemen to know whether or not , when I was accused of playing politics for profit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been informed that the gentleman from New York practiced poli-.Ics for profit . " Applause . " You were a candidate for Congress in 1856 , " broke in Mr. Sullivan , ( Dem. , Mass. , ) " and Mr. Cockran was not . Did n't you and eyerybody else understand that he meant you were animated by motives of political , ? not pecuniary , profit ? " " No. " said Dalzell , tartly , " and the gen // GANNON IMAM OFF A WOMAN STAMPEDE // tleman from New York is abundantly able to take care of himself without your aid . " " No one will dissent from that proposiUoir after what happened on Saturday , " retorted Sullivan , and the Democrats applauded violently . Mr. Daizell , in conclusion , referring to Cockran 's acceptance of the Congressional nomination , in which the New Yorker had referred to political hoodlumism , said : " If there be any hoodlums among us , they are not the products of American soil . American institutions , or American civilization . They are to be found among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country 's good , and find in the field of American politics prolific sources of advancement and wealth ; men who , without conscience , find opportunity , now with one party and now with another , to find a market for their peculiar wares , among which is not respectability , " Applause . COCIaRAN MAKES REPLY . The moment Cochran rose the Democrats began cheering . " Personally , " he said , " I do not care to engage in any war of abuse with the gentleman from Pennsylvania . And you will observe , " he continued gravely , " how carefully I observe the rules of the House . The gentleman , I say , from Pennsylvania . Laughter . " He has thought proper to justify a charge of infamy against a fellow member by searching in all the nameless channels through which the anonymous calumnies circulate in a political campaign , and with hands not cleaner than those with whom he deals , he hurls then at me . " Mr. Cockran said Mr. Daizell had read garbled extracts from his speeches , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left his party for motives of principle , which the Republicans evidently could not understand . He had never become a free silverite . As to the charge that he was a Greenbacker in 1880 , lie said : " I will not say that it is false , for that is unparliamentary ; so I will say that it is worthy of its source , and that sufficiently describes it . " REPUDIATES CHARGES . - As to the charge that he was paid by the Palmer and Buckner committee , Mr. Cochran denied it sweepingly , and added that , as he was on the stump for and in opposition to Palmer , the Palmer committee could not have paid him . The gentleman , " he continued , " thinks a newspaper rumor worthy of being the basis of an hour 's discussion . There is a rumor of wider circulation than that ; that is that the Presidency was purchased in that very campaign . Applause . I never believed it ; but when the gentleman takes such proof as this , when these idle statements are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not it indicate that he is aware of conditions which make them probable ? Applause . " It is charged that $16,000,000 were expended by the National Committee . Until to-day I rejected that story . In the most depraved period of the Roman decline the empire was sold at auction . It brought a price equivalent , by a strange coincidence , to $16,000,000 of our money . Applause . ? I can always protect myself from the gentleman from Pennsylvania by choosing my own side of the street . Cheers . But no one can protect this Republic from the corruption which the conduct of the Republican majority shows to have taken possession of ? their system . You charge here , by the gentleman 's speech and by your attitude , that a man was bought to support your Presidential candidate , and you do n't realize the infamy of the cenfessin . Cheers . I do not desire to pay the gentleman from Pennsylvania the tribute of abuse . That gentleman says he has reason to believe that I accepted money . Why does he not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agree with me on this declaration of political ethics as binding on us all : If what be said be true , I am unworthy of membership ; if it be false , he is unworthy not merely of membership , but of contact . ' Cheers . Here , waving his resolution for investigation high in the air , Cochran shouted : DEMANDS INVESTIGATION . " This resolution represents my attitude , the attitude of an honest man in the face of something which can not - be described parliamentarily , toward one whose character can not be described because he has illustrated it by his behavior . " Mr : Cochran then read his resolutions . They were as follows : " Whereas , The Hon. John Daizell , a. member of this House and of the Committee on Ways and Means , charged on the floor that William Bourke Cochran , a Representative from New York and a member of the same committee , has been paid money by a political party to support the candidate for the Presidency nominated in opposition to the party with which the said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whereas , The charge , though attacked specifically on the floor by the said William Bourke Cochran. has not been withdrawn by the said John Daizell and " Whereas , Said charge , if true , establishes such conduct as should unfit any man for membership in this House , and if false , should be so declared and its author censured severely ; therefore , be it " Resolved . That a select committee of five members be appointed by the Chair to inquire into the truth of said charge , and to report the testimony , with their conclusions thereon , to this House at its session beginning the first Monday of December next ; be it further " Resolved , That said committee be and is hereby given full power - to compel the attendance of such witnesses , and the production of such papers as the Members thereof may deem necessary to the full and proper discharge of the duty hereby imposed on them . " As Cochran read these resolutions a throng of Democrats left their seats and crowded in front of him . The Republicans sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " added Cochran. " when that resolution is adopted something moro important than my conduct win be made clear . We will see just how the election of 1896 was conducted . Cheers . Whether it was , as I believe , the honest judgment of an intelligent people , or whether it represented , as the gentleman from Pennsylvania would have us believe , the skill in corruption which was manifested by tho Republican managers . Sir , if I thought the attitude of the majority here represented the conscience and morals of this people I would believe that the days of this Republic were numbered . " UPROAR IN THE HOUSE . He then asked unanimous consent that the resolution be passed . Gen. Grosvenor instantly shot up with an objection . Instantly the whole Democratic side burst forth in a storm of jeers and hisses . Baker of New York , leaping to his feet , pointed his ' finger at Grosvenor and shrieked : " You people are afraid , that 's what 's the matter with you . " The Democrats roared their approval . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a speech , pleading with the House not to pass the resolution now , but to go home and " have a night 's sleep on it " " No speech from the Speaker ! Regular order ! " yelled the Democrats . Mr. Cannon , who was red in the face with rage , banged his gavel a dozen times with a deafening noise , and shouted : " Ah , well , the Speaker has a eight to make suggestions . He is not only Speaker ; he is a member of the House . ' Being debarred-from having it considered by unanimous Consent by Grosvenor 's objection , Cochran demanded the resolutions consideration as a privileged one . There was a hot parliamentary mix-up between Cochran , Williams of Mississippi , and Payne of New York . Then Mr. Payne had an inspiration . lie raised the point of order that the charges against Cochran related to a time when he was not a member of the House , and therefore he was net entitled to have the resolution considered privileged . " The Chair , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point of order until he has looked up the authorities . " The Democrats laughed and jeered , but the matter went over as Mr. Cannon had desired .
