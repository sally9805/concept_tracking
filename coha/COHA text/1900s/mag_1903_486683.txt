President Roosevelt , according to the dispatches from Washington , is facing a grave disagreement in his Cabinet . The report of Charles J. Bonaparte and Holmes Conrad on the postal scandals seriously reflects on both the Treasury and the Post-Office Department , and practically calls for the resignation of Robert J. Trace well , Comptroller of the Treasury . Of course , Mr. Payne and Mr. Shaw object ; and Mr. Tracewell is rallying the whole Indiana influence to support him . The difficulty is that , in choosing investigators , the President went " outside the official family , " and picked an Independent Republican and a Gold Standard Democrat ? " two raugwumps " They acted without regard to private or political interests , and purely on the assumption that the post-office business is public businesS ; while the two Cabinet members take the common official attitude that the Government is run for the benefit of office-holders and their friends , and that the man who disturbs them is interfering in private matters . Of course , Mr. Roosevelt can not for a moment give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In these postal scandals he has put his hand to the plough , and he can not look back . He appointed Mr. Bonaparte and Mr Conrad simply in order to get an unbiassed. report . If they find Mr. Tracewell at fault , President Roosevelt is the last man in the country to help shield him . Indeed , the situation offers the President a happy issue out of some of his troubles . The most inefficient and irresponsible member of his Cabinet has , by common agreement , been the Postmaster-General ; and next in order has come Secretary Shaw . If President Roosevelt lets them go , he will gain far more in public approval than he can lose through the defection of their private following . But , gain or lose , his course is clear . The action of the Civil Service Commission in demanding the reinstatement of five employees in the Philadelphia mint who were removed solely for political reasons , is no more surprising than Commissioner Cooley 's report that Philadelphia has the worst-managed Federal offices in the country . Naturally , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the appointments of their heads . It appears that the irregularities pointed out by the Philadelphia Civil Service Association in its last annual report have become more flagrant than ever . Mr. Cooley declares that " Men have been . removed from classified positions without any cause whatever , and nobody cares to give any explanation of how or why it was done " This is precisely what was to have been looked for under the circumstances . An these scandals may be expected to crop out in every place where political reasons have obtained in the appointment of postmasters or heads of departments The situation in Philadelphia has been so notoriously bad that President Roosevelt owes to himself and the public se vice a thoroughgoing series of removals from office and the swore punishment of all offenders . As far as the navy estimates are concerned , Secretary Moody proves himself to be a more pliable official than his recent Republican predecessors . He has not only followed his chief , President Roosevelt , in his large-navy ideas , but has apparently been taken into camp by the extreme imperialist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this country expend the ' enormous sum of $103 , - 000,000 for the support and increase of its war fleet ? $ ' 72,000,000 more than in 1893 , when the navy was still in the process of reconstruction . Now it is larger and stronger than art any time in the peace history of the United States , and still the insensate cry is for more men , more ships , and more guns . To judge by Secretary Moody , a visiting Martian might think this country in the Middle Ages , surrounded by hostile neighbors , and threatened with wars lasting thirty years . Instead , the country is by nature happy and law-abiding , and devoted to the arts of peace , except for a few politicians , shipbuilders , and naval officers . Where to-day is the enemy who menaces our shores ? What nation has a fleet capable of ' attacking our coasts save our cousins , the English , with whom we are on better terms than ever ? Who can maintain that our fleet as it stands to-day is built for defensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and has become a growing menace to our peace and prosperity . Should Mr. Moody 's estimates be accepted by . Congress , we shall be paying two-thirds as much as England does , with her vast battle fleets . Are we aiming to rival her in the mad race to throw ' away millions on death-dealing instruments ? ' Mr. ' Samuel Gompers has given the employers of labor to understand that there must be no cutting of wages in the event of an industrial setback . At the meeting of the Civic Federation on Saturday he said : " If the time comes to suggest to the employer the advisability of cutting or making all attepipt to Cut wages , it will be disputed by us . We will not let that go easily . We will make a stand against it , not only because it is uneconomic and unwise , but because it simply accentuates the industrial crisis , and gives it greater strength . " If the American Federation of Labor , of which Mr , Gompers is the head , maintains this ' attitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unpleasant . His assertion that a cut in wages would be uneconomic is entitled to very little consideration . If general business slackens materially , producers will reduce prices , despite the fulminations of labor organizations , and this means , of course , that the cost of production must be curtailed . But an early step in this direction must be a lowering ' of the wage scale . The reasons are plain . In the first place , economy in this direction is more quickly and easily initiated than in any other . A manufacturer can not ' effect at will a lowering in the cost of his raw materials  --  he has to wait for the world 's market to do that for him . And it is also impossible for him to force an immediate reduction in transportation charges , interest rates , rentals , etc . But he can move promptly and effectively in the matter of labor , and that is the reason why a lowering of wages or a reduction in the number of the employed is always apt to mark the beginning of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the railroads ' have begun to cut wages and to lay off hands , and there has also been a certain amount of closing down in the steel industry . Mr. John Mitchell , at the Chicago meeting of the National Civic Federation , discussed very interestingly the open shop , and union compulsion of employers and non-unionists . He properly held that organized labor has a right to work with the associates it likes , or to refuse to work . But he maintained also a right of " compulsion " as against employers and non-unionists , which he did not define , but admitted was a stage more vigorous than " persuasion . " Of this compulsion , he said it " must be judged on its merits , and must not be decried simply because it is compulsion . " We have no desire to follow Mr. Mitchell in verbal quibbles , . and so , admitting premises that union coercion must be judged on its merits , we call his attention to compulsion as it actually exists . It means in practically all cases violence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the anthracite strike . What does he think of the merits of that form of compulsion ? In Chicago the right to compel non-union teamsters meant the right to beat them Senseless ; in New Yon* t49 P9mPillaien applied to independent housesmiths was the breaking of their ribs by Sam Parks 's " Entertainment Committee . " These are examples of union compulsion as it actually is to-day . Hair-splitting Mr. Mitchell need have no fear that it will not be judged " on its merits . " It is reported that Walking Delegate Farley has confessed to Mr. Jerome the whole story of recent blackmailing operations in the building trades . The confession incriminates Farley himself , Sam Parks , and McCarthy . Scores of holdups are revealed , and the evidence for many indictments is supplied . Mr Jerome felt sure of convicting Parks and McCarthy without Farley's- assistance . The value of the reported revelations , then , is not that they hasten the condemnation of this nest of blackmailers ; it lies rather in the effect that the exposure is likely to have upon the workmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the methods and the results of government by Sam Parks , when they perceive the shamelessness with which he debauched every principle of honest unionism , we are confident that they will repudiate him indignant- ly . Having cleansed the inner rottenness of their organization , they will be likely to listen to President Gompers as he advocates the arbitration plan . A prompt acceptance of this treaty be , tween employers and employed would ensure , in part at least , the restoration of the building industry . Further delay will mean lack of employment through the winter and great suffering among what was formerly our most prosperous class of workmen . Last week 's testimony in the Shipbuilding case brought to public knowledge the memorandum of " bonuses " set aside for promoters . This became a topic of particular interest when Mr. Gates , last year , disclaimed on the witness stand any knowledge of the $26,000,000 of the Steel and Wire Trust 's $90,000,000 stock which had " disappeared " in the promotion . What inquisitive people have long wanted were details as'to the method of showering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we get them . Nine millions of the bonds were to be sold for cash  --  three millions in the United States and six millions " in France and England . " The " French and English " figures will chiefly attract attention because of the wide advertisement given a fortnight ago to the methods of the promoters . Every one has been asking , What did the brilliant negotiators get for their labors with Rogniat , Major Spilsbury , and the rest ? We are not informed what was actually received . What was contemplated is shown by the " memorandum . " For the finding of foreign customers for $6,000,000 Shipbuilding bonds , the promoters were to get $133,000 cash , $700,000 in bonds , and $3,600,000 in preferred and common - stock . After making these allowances , the " memorandum " figures out that there would be left over for other outlay on " promotion " and " commissions on underwriting " the tidy amount of $750,000 bonds , $3,900,000 stock , and $67 , - 000 cash . Workers for clean government in this city have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The completed registration is , at least , satisfactory . To say that it alone settles the doom of Tammany would be foolish . We have seen too many elections triumphantly won by the registration , only to be miserably lost by the actual fall of the ballots Ingenious analysts , it will be remembered , figured out of the registration an infallible Tammany defeat both in 1890 and in 1897 . It is enough to say , at present , that the number of enrolled voters-furnishes good ground for encouragement . If the final registration had remained at the low level of the first two days , we should have considered the odds desperately against us . As it is , the material of victory is evidently in hand , provided that the canvass from now on be such as to compel it The situation does not warrant jubila ? tion as if the fight were all over , but only that hope and fresh courage which lead to redoubled efforts . More than from a large and probably adverse registration is Tammany 's cause suffering from loss of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ill at ease . The rank and file are muttering and apprehensive . They do not know what blunder Murphy will make next . what will be the next damning record to leap to light . The reports we get from every-day Tammany supporters indicate their deep disgust at the way things have gone . Murphy 's coup in kidnapping Grout they speak of as a coup de grace for the organization . McClellan they flippantly refer to as " a dead one " Aside from such internal rumblings of discontent , the outward front of Tammany betrays its disquietude . It has no taking catchwords . It is more apologetic than aggressive . The claims which it makes are riddled as promptly as the lies it , circulates are nailed to the counter . With a formidable revolt of " regular " Brooklyn Democrats on its hands , Tammany feebly protests that national issues are solidifying the party in order to carry the Presidential election next year . After an impartial trial , lasting fifteen days , James H. Tillman , the slayer of N. G. Gonzales , editor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triumphantly acquitted . This is as gross a miscarriage of justice as has ever been witnessed in any part of the Union . The facts in the case are perfectly plain ; they were brought out by the State with the greatest care . But , after an overnight deliberation , a jury of his peers has declared the former Lieutenant-Governor innocent of any crime Its members have thereby served notice on their fellow-citizens that it is sufficient defence for the most dastardly kind of homicide to prove that the victim had attacked his slayer in the public press It is a notification to all South Carolina editors that they must refrain from criticising any low blackguard in public life unless they wish to pay for their utterances with their lives . At the very moment when the South is clamoring to be let alone and allowed to work out its own destiny , one of its sovereign States is stamped by its own citizens as a commonwealth in which unjustifiable murder goes unpunished and homicide is encouraged . Under the present Constitution of Alabama the only voters have been those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceased to operate on the first of last January , but under it there were registered 188,000 white life voters and only 2,000 blacks , if we may rely upon the Montgomery Advertiser 's figures . A new election law has now been passed , and under it some 60,000 more whites will receive the suffrage ; what is to become of the blacks is not stated . A few more may be admitted  --  if the boards of registration see fit . Meanwhile , there is some encouragement in the case of Peter Crenshaw , of which the Advertiser rightly thinks Northern critics should take note . Crenshaw is a negro politician of some repute , and is also an army veteran . The Limestone County registration beard refused to register him because he could not produce his army discharge papers When he obtained copies from Washington the board again arbitrarily refused to give him the suffrage , and he appealed to the Circuit Court . The case was tried before a jury of twelve white men , the State 's defence being based on technicalities , and the jury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ registration as a life voter . The case has been appealed to the Supreme Court . While it is noteworthy as being the only one to go before a jury , it is also a striking example of the inevitable acts of injustice resulting from giving a board of white men the right to say whether colored American citizens , fully qualified under the law , shall or shall not vote It would be unsafe to generalize regarding the financial situation from the Baltimore trust-company failures . They certainly indicate that the " mobilization of credits " has not proved as effective as was predicted . But the important fact is , that the situation ill Baltimore has for a long time past been unique . The methods employed have been extreme , and have occasioned a great deal of criticism , both at home and ' abroad . Commitment 's of- capital were ' made on a scale and in a manner to excite the surprise and reprobation of the ) banking communityof the entire East . Baltimore has simply paid the penalty of over-competition in banking , It has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the result that it has been tempted , as is so often the case in those Circumstances , to employ large amounts of funds in outside ventures of a tentative character . It is not the only city in the United States that has had this experience in the last few years , but it is a capital instance . Steam railroads in Mexico and undeveloped parts of the United States , street railways in the South , breweries , real estate , and other slow assets have absorbed its money . Baltimore has also been heavily involved in industrial ventures of an experimental nature , its losses in connection with the International Mercantile Marine Company being notorious : The difference between Baltimore and other leading financial centres of late has been that , whereas New York and Boston have , like Baltimore , been caught with large holdings of unsold securities , these have been of a class that could be much more easily marketed at a price than those of the former city . In a word , Baltimore is not a fair criterion of the rest of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation admit of a common ? explanation . The decline of both high-grade and purely speculative securities in this country , the forced liquidation of powerful interests in the stock market , the collapse of a long series of industrial combines , and the threatened reduction of dividends on the securities of still others , may be correlated with the great drop in British consols , the general downward tendency of the London stock market for a long time past , the anxiety with which each settlement day is approached in that centre of finance , the additional safeguarding from time to time recently of the gold supplies of the European banks , and possibly last week 's statement of the Bank of France . These phenomena point unmistakably to a world-wide contraction of credit , the first evidences of which were observed in Germany in 1900 . Omitting mention of secondary causes , we get back to the fact that credits have apparently been expanded out of proportion to the gold supply of the world , on which they are based The " capitalizing of the future " of American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great rise in commodity prices , which necessitated a larger amount of credits to transact the same volume of business . We must also add the great increase in bond issues ( both railroad and municipal ) , the vast enlargement of general business , and the extensive speculation in Western lands It looks as if not only Great Britain . but the rest of the world as well , were now paying the penalty of the Boer war . The enormous expansion of the gold output of the world from a yearly average of $162,974,200 in 1891-1895 to $306,724,100 in 1899 furnished the basis for a great enlargement of credits , and , on the strength of this " boom , " enlargement speedily went forward , both in Europe and in the United States . The effect of the closing of the South African mines in 1899 was not immediately apparent ; the impetus previously gained was suffidient to prolong the expansion of credits-for a good many months . Danger signals began , however , to appear in Europe in 1900 , and in this country in 1901 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could not be , for capital had been so generally converted from a floating to a fixed basis that a wide curtailment of credit was not immediately possible without a sudden and drastic effect upon international financial and industrial conditions . However , for a year at least in this country , and for a good many months in Great Britain , the process of retrenchment has been going on . The highest grades of securities  --  that is , the ones most easily disposed of  --  have been liquidated in an almost unprecedented manner , and recently inflated industrial shares have been obliged to seek a market for what they would bring . When this stage is reached , the indications always are that the real corrective of the situation is being applied . Criticism of Elijah the Restorer in New York seems superfluous , because lie has passed judgment upon himself Ills intemperate language , his random imputations of vice , his pettishness before discomfiture due to his own defects of oratory , stamp him definitely as the charlatan , did not his list of securities for investment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It looks as though he would be chaffed cut of town . That has never before happened in New York city to any sincere religious movement , however grotesque its methods . Dowie seems to lack the conviction of a religious leader . The shrewd good sense of this town has refused to consider him as anything but the promoter of Zion City . Only recall in how different a spirit the Salvation Army came to New York They began to lodge the poor and preach to them- ; the women glorified menial service in the tenements . One has only to compare that movement with Dowie 's well-advertised spectacular entry , to see the difference between the real and the sham thing What the Duke of Devonshire-has lost through tardiness he atones for in consistency . Having resigned from the Cabinet , he now accepts the Presidency of the Unionist Free Food League , and takes his stand as the opponent of Messrs . Chamberlain and Balfour on the fiscal matter . In accepting the office , the Duke of Devonshire significantly suggests that the League may wish to " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sir Michael Hicks-Beach , that as yet the new President will engage to go in opposition only on the protection issue . This is pretty clear indication that the Duke expects that the opposition to the champions of the fiscal reforms will become general , and that the Unionist Free Food League , which for the present he regards as " a parliamentary committee , " may at any time become a genuine party of secession . Such certainly is a fair inference from his guarded words of acceptance and from the situation itself . An element of strength is added to the Opposition by this frank declaration of the Duke of Devonshire , while the discrepancy between the large professions of the Chamberlainites and the personal abilities commanded by them becomes more glaring than ever . The followers of Mr. Chamberlain have every reason to be disappointed by Lord Roseberre- Slaeffield speech The fact that he has now committed himself so vigorously to free trade after having last May said that he did not regard free trade " as a part of the Sermon on the Mount , " will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not necessarily open to that construction . Mr. Chamberlain 's fiscal departure came as a great surprise . Free trade and protection were subjects to which the present generation of British statemen had not been compelled to give serious thought , and it is not astonishing that the savage attack on the existing system should for the moment have thrown Lord Rosebery into confusion regarding the true philosophy of tariffs . He now sees the viciousness of Mr. Chamberlain 's attitude , not only from the economic but also from the moral point of view . Previous speakers have pointed out as clearly as Lord Rosebery the weak points in Mr Chamberlain 's programme , but his mastery of the art of discourse makes his Sheffield speech perhaps the most effective utterance so far against a change in the fiscal policy of the nation . The true need of Great Britain , provided it is in a declining state , is , in the opinion of Lord Rosebery , to " cultivate a scientific spirit and better education , and , above all , keep the universe for a reservoir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
