 | One of the reasons why stone houses or buildings look better than structures of other material , is due to the unity of tone in color , which is also negative , and which goes well with its natural surroundings of earth , of grass and trees . Proportion of course is the first requisite in producing a building of pleasing exterior , and then comes color , and the closer to one neutral tone one keeps , the better the artistic effect . Strong contrast in shutters , window casings , cornices , etc , to the body of the house looks cheap and becomes tiresome to see . The somewhat recent fashion of painting shingle roofs green is a good one , and houses painted all green , including chimneys , with the " trimmings " in slightly lighter tone , often look cslremely well . But the green should be dark and neutral , more on the olive order . Stone grays , stone browns and red browns treated similarly are usually very satisfactory .

A dealer in charge of ; in exhibit of English china at the Chicago exposition gave me a piece of information about the care of gold decoration on china . " Wash it in water as hot as you like , " he said , " but do n't put soap on it . Soap dulls the gold and makes it rub off . " - Janet Jones Albert . A pupil of the New England School of Cookery is the author of a new dessert . " I have the misfortune , " she confessed , " of mothering a family who decline to eat any thing which has the suggestion of being a leftover . One of their pet antipathies is stale cake : a cake two days old leaves the table untouched in our house . If you have ever tried to solve the problem of using up stale cake , - , . on know how many , or rather low few , ways there are to dispose of it . The other day I had beautiful success with an experiment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I crumbled it finely , added a few currants chopped fine , citron peel , and chopped English walnuts ; then I flavored it with vanilla and moistened it with a beaten egg . I rolled it into croquettes , which I dipped in egg , then in cake crumbs , dried and rolled exactly like bread crumbs . Afterward , when fried in deep fat , drained on brown paper and served hot with a good wine sauce , they disappeared with alacrity. -C . When my children were babies and beginning to hitch or creep about the floor in cold weather , I made for them drawer legs exactly such as described by Mrs ' . N1 . G.

I bit my nails until I was eighteen years of age , and so badly were they gnawed at times that I could scarcely sleep at night for the pain . This is the way I broke myself . I would let one nail grow out at a time . Take the thumb , for instance . I would gnaw away on all the other fingers , but this particular nail I coaxed into growth , and when it was long enough , I rounded it nicely , tinted it , polished it , and grew so proud of it that I then took another one for treatment . This I treated in the same way , biting freely at any of the other eight , but keeping my thumb manicured nicely , and training No 2 at the same time . In this way my field for nibbling was cut down each  | GOOD HOUSEKEEPING time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This may seem silly to those who have never had this habit , but it assuredly was the way I broke myself , and is nothing more than a practical appeal to the pride . Occasionally , after I thought I was cured , if the nail was broken or snagged , presenting a rough edge , it was impossible to resist gnawing at it , until I formed the habit of immediately trimming it evenly with scissors or nail file. - Martha W. Potter . The annual pay supper of the women 's missionary society of our church has always been a trial and a vexation , until affairs reached a climax . The crowd was large and unruly , and the disgraceful spectacle was witnessed of newcomers standing behind the chairs of those who were seated and clamoring for haste on the part of the diners . In this rush the diners were poorly served , the tables soon lost all semblance of daintiness , the waste of food was outrageous and toilets and tempers suffered . This year a radical change was decided and the sequel proves the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hall where the supper was served , each table capable of accommodating fifty . When the first fifty people had lined up in the anteroom for their supper , they were admitted to Table No t , and the doorkeeper was instructed to prevent any further entries . The fifty were daintily served with oyster stew , crackers , pickles , celery , rolls and butter , and for this first course in the menu , one coupon from tickets was detached . At the end of seven minutes a gong sounded and the first fifty diners advanced decently and in order to Table No 2 . In three minutes Table No i was brushed and reset and the second installment of fifty from the anteroom was admitted and received exactly the same treatment as the first fifty . The few in the anteroom who were in excess of fifty awaited without grumbling , secure in the knowledge that in ten minutes their turn would come . At Table No 2 , the menu was Boston baked beans , pickled cabbage , brown bread , salad and preserves , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven minutes the gong sounded again and the first fifty advanced to Table No 3 , and those at Table No i advanced to Table No z . Three minutes were devoted to brushing and resetting the tables , and then the third installment of fifty was admitted from the anteroom to Table No i . At Table No 3 , the menu included turkey and all its accompaniments , mashed potatoes , cranberry sauce , slaw , olives and hot biscuit and butter , coffee and doughnuts , and a third coupon was detached . At the end of seven minutes , the diners advanced once more , the first fifty ( or as many as desired of this number ) to Table No 4 . Table No 4 was known as an " extra " and to this only holders of " four-coupon " tickets were privileged . At Table No 4 , ice cream , cake , fruits and confectionery were served . Those who did not desire the extra quietly passed from the supper room . This supper , as stated , proved a success . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the tables the diners shared exactly alike and were served simultaneously . The business man with scant time at his disposal secured an ample meal within half an hour , and above all there was no waste of food . Each plate was set before the diner with an impartial and amply sufficient allotment of food , and in almost every case the plate was cleared . Late in the evening as the diners decreased in number , they were admitted in squads of twentyfive and even a lesser number . But the idea of progression was rigidly maintained throughout . We sold our " four-coupon " tickets for fifty cents and the " three-coupon " tickets for thirty-five cents. - Mrs A. R .. *Queer how the smallest trifle helps , if it is just right .

This prevention of the common trouble of losing spoon , ladle , etc , in pan , bowl , or other receptacle , is just too simple for anything ! - Mrs Aplin . The " protest " which appeared in the November Good Housekeeping called forth a hearty cheer from at least one of its readers . The frank and free expression of that protest must be a help to some who cherish the same feelings which the writer holds , but have not the courage to give utterance to them in their own homes . Four years ' experience in Germany ,  | where single beds are a matter of course , under all circumstances , made the establishment of single beds in my home , on our return , an easy matter .

I have a little article which my husband made for me which is highly useful in removing cobwebs or dust which gather on a ceiling .

R. : bit of information given me in the summer , by a fellow boarder , has been of great value to me , and I should be glad to pass it along . To remove stains from white goods , dissolve a rounded tablespoonful of chloride of lime in an eight-quart pail of water , conveniently full . Put the stained article to soak in this water until the stain disappears , squeezing it through the hand occasionally . . A little white dress , hopelessly stained , as I thought , the year before , with pear , was thus treated , and in twenty-four hours the stains had disappeared , with never any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the same way . During busy days , I find this method easier than the care necessary when using stronger solutions , without the risk of injuring the material. -A . G. 411 gave my boy on his ninth birthday a small pair of military brushes . Since then I have never had to remind him , as was daily necessary before , to brush his hair . Children enjoy the sense of ownership , and will gladly perform certain duties , for the sake of using their ' own treasured possessions , when the same r duties are forgotten , and the incentive is lost , if the utensils to he used are the common property of two or more members of the family. - .

I do not lay claim to originating all of these ideas for tally cards , but I think I can safely say that the greater part have the advantage of being new to most people . Some of the prettiest of these tallies are the red silk pincushions made in the shape of hearts . Large white-headed pins are used for the counts .. Then , something on the same idea , and nice for souvenirs afterward , are tiny scent hags . These came to my notice at a card party given by Princeton students . The bags were very effective in their orange and black satin , and they Fvere fastened to black paper tallies by bunches of orange ribbon . Japanese fans with strings hanging from them are pretty . Big glass beads are strung on the strings for counts . For the woman who does n't like to sew , but is quick with brush and pen , there are almost unlimited possibilities . Among these pieces of water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are odd and effective . There are holes punched in the paper through which ribbons bearing ' tiny black penny dolls , or pasteboard seeds , call be fastened , according to the maker 's taste : Then there are cards upon which clippings  | from magazines may be pasted . It is surprising what aid the advertising section lends for this purpose . A few lines added in ink make the little picture look almost like a pen and ink sketch . The birch bark tally is a pretty reminder of summer days . If the bark prove unruly , moisten and press with a hot iron . Then cut it into hearts and clubs , and use an ordinary card punch on the tally the night of the card party. -A . L. J.

Instead of attacking the ugly mark at once , he began about ten inches from it . He stretched a scrap of thin white broadcloth on the end of his finger , dipped it lightly in gasoline and worked quickly around the spot in wheel-like sweeps , getting nearer and nearer the stain , which yielded in a few minutes to gentle but steady rubbing . The gradual approach to cleaning the stain , he explained , did away with all danger of leaving the halo one often has to sponge out after a stain disappears. - C. *Children 's nursery bibs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tied with white linen tape , tied around the neck and under the arms , are very serviceable , washing nicely , and absorbing liquids better than thick or starched fabrics .

We have 12 o'clock dinner , and the day before I want to bake bread I pare two or three more potatoes than I want for dinner , and when cooked mash them into the water in which they were cooked and stir in enough flour to make a batter .

It is a physical impossibility for me to give bread the long , thorough kneading which it requires , but by taking one loaf at a time it is not hard . This makes good , wholesome bread , and it keeps well-Mrs G. S. McKee . When we bought our new range we had a pan made to fit the oven , for baking cookies and biscuits . It is eighteen by eighteen inches in size and the edges are one inch high . It is made of the best sheet iron and cost forty cents . It saves time and fuel to have the oven full at each baking . This , I think , was a Goon HOUSEKEEPING suggestion , and it has proved its worth. - Bettie .

The box holds two hods full of coal , which lasts all day for cooking . Thus my husband can carry in coal once a day and know I will not have any cause for heavy lifting . The rollers could be used on a woodbox as well , though the inclined bottom would of course be of no use . The accompanying sketch shows how the box is constructed. - 1I . W. S.

It was done in a workmanlike manner , and now there is no possible danger with the rods as barriers to protect the delicate china. - Annie C. S. If you will wash the feet of new hose before they are worn you will find their lasting qualities enhanced .

Fasten in a corner three triangular brackets , measuring eight inches on two sides and twelve on the base , resting them on cleats screwed to the wall . Place the highest of these three feet from the ceiling , the second fifteen inches below it , and a third fifteen inches below the second . On the middle shelf is placed the clock .

Should I build another house , even a summer house , I would provide access to the bathroom from the guest room as well as from the hall .

Pour half a cup of hot water into the dish , place over it a closely fitting cover , and set on the stove where the water will boil . In less than a minute the warm water and steam will have done the work and the particles of food that shortly before have seemed to be " grown fast " will wash off as easily as from the serving dishes .

W. S. A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best known tea companies for showing just how the fragrant leaf should be brewed , gave me these points , which I pass on for the benefit of other housekeepers : Measure out the tea , allowing a half teaspoonful for each cup of boiling water , reducing the proportions when several cups are required or increasing them if the tea used is not up to the standard , or if the drinker prefers it extra strong . Use fresh water that has just come to a boil for the first time .. Put the tea in a cloth strainer , and pour through it the bubbling , boiling water . Cover closely with a tea cozy and let the tea brew on the back of the range or at the table from three to five minutes . If the tea is to stand for some time , remove the strainer- with the tea leaves , else the fragrant aroma is dissipated and the tannin extracted .

In giving nourishment to an invalid , do not serve it in cups or glasses similar , to those used for medicine .
