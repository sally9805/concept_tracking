txt When Mr. imilaux , the accomplished Postmaster General of Canada , declares ! that the announcement of the creation ' of the British Pacific Cable Company reduced the rates of the Eastern cables ; from $2.24 a word to $1.05 , and the opening of the line caused a reduction from that figure to 72 cents a word . he made the strongest possible argument for a State-owned cable system between England and Canada . There is no reasonable doubt that the establishment of such a system would instantly bring about a reduction of the cable rate , not only from 25 cents a word to 9 cents , in the same ratio as on the Eastern lines , but in all probability a reduction to 5 cents , or even less . Primarily such a system would be political in its purposes , and the immense benefits of a political nature that would accrue to the British Empire would amply justify the risks of some 1 pecuniary loss . It would place in the hands of the home Government and in those of the various colonies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the widely scattered parts of the mighty dominion . It would arse ) Stimulate intercommunication be- i tween the various members of the Empire and quicken and strengthen the ' ties that bind them in common interest ? I and loyalty . From this point of view I a serviceable cable system . at low rates , within national control is as much a necessity as a navy and a mercantile fleet were thirty years ago . And that necessity is more , far more , than a ! mere material one ; it is closely connected with the development of the national life , the maintenance of the British spirit , the accomplishment of the mission that the race is charged with . On the material side , however , the situation is much more favorable than was the one met by the laying of the Pacific cable . A cable system linking England with Canada would directly serve an already considerable commerce , which , with the steady growth of Canadian enterprise , wealth , and population , is bound to expand indefinitely . To this expansion low cable rates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to estimate that the cable would , from the start , if prudently and intelligently administered , pay a fair return on the cost , while with the inevitable increase of business , rates could still further be lowered and the cost still more easily be met . Nor this alone . An Anglo-Canadian cable system would directly serve the vast field of our own wants . The market for its service would embrace the entire continent , and the demand in that great market would tend continually to become stronger , and to aid in the maintenance of the system at progressively lower rates . The advantages offered commercially in Canada would exist on this side of the long border in far greater degree , and on both sides of that border they would constantly advance . At the same time , the moral benefits of intimate and easy , communi-cation between all bra ncliei I speaking peoples would be extended . As our readers are aware , we are not admirers of State-owned and operated enterprises under ordinary conditions . 1B/of the conditions , so far as concerns England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They justify . from purely political considerations , this particular enterprise , and , that being the case , it would be folly to shut our eyes to the immense advantages of other sorts that would ensue , in which the people of the United States can properly share . Nor need any ode hesitate in indorsing such a plan froM motives of consideration for " vested interests " existing in the present " duopoly , " as Mr. LEMIEUX happily calls it . The combination having the international telegraphs in its grip has forfeited all elaim to consideration . It is maintaining burdensome charges and deliberately impeding the progress of millions of people . It is in a very of the Governments of the peoples most intimately affected to devote their energies toward protecting these peoples from oppression . Mr. LEMIEUX may well say to the English Government , in the words of Queen ICATHErtmE , pleading to HENRY against the exactions of WoLsEY : I would your Highness Would give it quick consideration , for There is no primer business a        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
