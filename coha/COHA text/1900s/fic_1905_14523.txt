MRS . RUMSEY Really ? MRS . THOMAS BONNER Oh , yes  --  my inviting her here this winter was a regularly arranged thing between her mother and me .

RUMSEY It 's very pretty ; and most unusual . MRS . THOMAS BONNER It 's pretty when it goes all right  --  but a bug or a piece of dirt makes it sputter and then it 's simply sloppy till Tom can get under the table and shut it off . I hope every thing 'll go all right to-night . ( Pause ) What 'd he say his name was ?  --  Oh , yes , Orton . MRS . RUMSEY It 's sure to go all right  --  the table is lovely . MRS .

DICK ( Affecting astonishment ) Yes . MRS . THOMAS BONNER Who sent it ? DICK It 's signed " mother . " ( Enter MABEL , R. ) MISS MABEL AINSLIE ( Accusingly ) Dick . DICK ( Emotionally ) Mabel . ( To her with embrace ) MISS MABEL AINSLIE ( Severly ) I thought you were in California ? p. 34 MRS . THOMAS BONNER The poor boy 's just had a telegram saying you were  --  a telegram with bad news of you  --  MISS MABEL AINSLIE ( Suspiciously ) Oh . ( Pause ) DICK ( Weakly ) Ca n't see who 'd do a thing like that . ( Regards telegram with severity ) MISS MABEL AINSLIE ( Putting MRS . BONNER out R. ) Mrs. Bonner , wo n't you talk to  --  ( Pause ) any of your guests , who may come down stairs . Keep them there a minute . MRS . THOMAS BONNER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nervously ) Give me that telegram , Dick . ( DiCK gives telegram . She continues with just a glance at it . Sits by him ) What do you mean , Dick ?  --  have n't you disgraced the family enough already ? You 've cheated every friend of father 's ; and every business associate of poor brother George ; and now you begin on my friends  --  I ca n't stand it  --  Dick  --  I wo n't stand it . DICK I did n't know you were here ? Did I ? p. 35 MISS MABEL AINSLIE Of course you did n't ; but you know these were my friends , Dick  --  Mr. Bonner knows of you only as my brother  --  I did n't think you 'd try to  --  to get money from him and so  --  so dishonestly . ( Displays telegram ) DICK I did n't  --  I came here to the Bevin House to see a man that was stopping there  --  a classmate of mine  --  a sympathetic fellow , that a telegram like that , would appeal to  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know anybody else in the town and  --  and I 've got to have a hundred dollars " Mab " I 've just got to  --  that 's all . MISS MABEL AINSLIE Mother sent you two hundred the day before I came here . DICK That was to " pay up " with . It was gone before I got it  --  you see , Mabel , you 're a girl  --  you have n't any idea of the money a man needs  --  just to look decent , and buy a drink for the men that buy a drink for him . MISS MABEL AINSLIE You could have all you need , Dick , if you 'd only behave . If you 'd only do an honest day 's work for father or for brother George . DICK Have n't I tried that ? Father and George do n't understand  --  they 're business men  --  I ca n't live in Louisville. p. 36 MISS MABEL AINSLIE Why ca n't you , Dick ? A great many do live there . DICK ( Innocently ) Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well ? DICK And nobody lives in Pittsburg that can get away . MISS MABEL AINSLIE That 's nonsense , Dick . DICK No . There 's a society here in New York City called the Pennsylvania society  --  eight hundred strong  --  nearly all of them , men that have escaped from Pittsburg  --  after a fellow 's been a man , Mabel , I do n't mean a married man  --  or one of these " quick lunch , " business men but a man  --  a free man , in New York  --  at liberty to go any place in the town he wants to , he ca n't live in Louisville again or any place like that . ( Pause ) MISS MABEL AINSLIE That 's silly prejudice Dick ; Louisville 's a beautiful little city . DICK Oh , yes , the local papers call it a metropolis  --  I know , but you pay one of them for a full page " ad " ; pay ' em real money , and the next day the editor starts for New York  --  I 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to waste it out there . p. 37 MISS MABEL AINSLIE Oh , Dick why do you behave like this  --  you do n't know what you 're doing to father . He looks seventy instead of fifty-eight and all in six years of this terrible conduct by you . DICK Oh , no  --  they all look that way , Mabel , you simply notice father more than the rest , because you 're with him . What can you expect ? He passes that plate in the new stone church Sunday morning and thinks he 's had a day 's recreation  --  I sized it all up when I used to come home in the old vacation days . It was a body blow even in my Sophomore years , but after the Junior commencement . I whispered myself  --  " Little Dickey , your post office address will be number one New York . " MISS MABEL AINSLIE But where 's your pride , Dick ? You ca n't support yourself in New York . DICK No outsider does at first , but I will . You wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and every few months has brought some awful story of you  --  checks on banks where you had no money  --  George 's name and father 's to other checks they had n't signed  --  DICK I always wired them  --  did n't I ? And always wrote and explained it . Mother understands it . p. 38 MISS MABEL AINSLIE But those things are crimes , Dick dear . You seem so callous to that idea . They 're crimes  --  men have been sent to jail for less offences than yours . DICK Oh , I ca n't go into the ethics of the thing with you , Mab . There 's a certain amount of money coming to me some day is n't there ?  --  When the Governor  --  when he quits ? MISS MABEL AINSLIE Not necessarily . DICK ( Impatient at feminine logic ) Of course not necessarily  --  but naturally ?  --  Well it 'll do me a great deal more good now . MISS MABEL AINSLIE The family does n't think so . DICK The family 's in Louisville  --  I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit up nights and think out a scheme ; the necessary machinery to get some of it to-day instead of sordidly hoping for  --  for anybody 's death  --  you ca n't call that crime ? MISS MABEL AINSLIE The law calls it crime . DICK What is the law ? MISS MABEL AINSLIE ( Posed ) What ? DICK ( Repeating ) What is the law ? p. 39 MISS MABEL AINSLIE ( Struggling ) Well  --  it  --  the law is  --  it 's the rules of conduct for  --  for society . DICK Not at all  --  a law is generally an arbitrary prohibition of something the majority of the people prefer to do . For example  --  " Keep off the grass " ; that 's because most people naturally prefer to get on the grass . Walk on it . And sit on it and roll on it . And you ca n't make it morally wrong by calling it bad names . I 'm no criminal because I ask a little help from the family . MISS MABEL AINSLIE Why , Dick  --  that kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good sense . DICK ( Unnecessarily resentful ) I told you never to say that to me  --  I 'm the only one in the family that has good sense  --  excepting you perhaps . You manage to get down here a month or two every year on some excuse  --  what 's on to-night ? MISS MABEL AINSLIE Mrs. Bonner has some guests to dinner . DICK Stopping here ? MISS MABEL AINSLIE No  --  coming . DICK Where 's your room ? MISS MABEL AINSLIE On the studio gallery  --  just above that door . p. 40 DICK ( Going to door ) Show me . MISS MABEL AINSLIE ( Following ) No , Dick  --  do n't go in the studio . You must go back to the place where you 're staying . Is it far ? DICK About a block . But I 've got to have that hundred by morning . MISS MABEL AINSLIE But not this way , Dick , ( Indicates telegram ) not dishonestly . DICK What other way is there ? MISS MABEL AINSLIE You can work . DICK Not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work some friend . MISS MABEL AINSLIE The family will send it , if they know you 're trying ; if I write them you are . DICK There is n't time for that . I  --  I endorsed a note that 's due in the morning . MISS MABEL AINSLIE Is that so pressing  --  your name on the back of a note ? DICK ' Tis n't my name . MISS MABEL AINSLIE Whose is it ? DICK A friend 's . You see he does n't know it , and if I can take the note up at nine he wo n't need to know it . p. 41 MISS MABEL AINSLIE ( In horror ) You mean you forged a signature ? DICK Yes . MISS MABEL AINSLIE Not father 's nor George 's ? DICK No  --  a friend 's I told you . MISS MABEL AINSLIE Dick ! DICK Now do n't preach about it , Mabel . Help a fellow if you can but do n't nag . MISS MABEL AINSLIE I ca n't help you , Dick . DICK ( Regarding her jewels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( She shakes her head ) or that necklace . MISS MABEL AINSLIE  --  they 're not mine . They 're mother 's . DICK Be yours some day  --  she 's always said so . MISS MABEL AINSLIE I ca n't Dick . DICK I do n't see why you ca n't . MISS MABEL AINSLIE They 're entrusted to my care . DICK Suppose you lost one of them ? MISS MABEL AINSLIE That would be an accident . p. 42 DICK Well have an accident  --  say you lost the ring . MISS MABEL AINSLIE Which would be adding a lie to the dishonesty . DICK Is n't wearing them  --  also a lie ? It 's the pretence that they 're yours when you know they 're not . You 're willing to issue that lie thirty days in the month just to feed your vanity  --  but one little fib  --  the word " lost " instead of " lent "  --  in order to keep me out of the police station and your feminine sense of rectitude rises . You see , Mabel , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have n't good sense . You 're the law makers and the law abiders  --  the people that do n't tell lies but are dev'lish willing to live them . MISS MABEL AINSLIE No , Dick  --  I 'll telegraph home . I 'll do that . DICK There is n't time to telegraph . You see I was counting on this classmate of mine at the Bevin House . He was there yesterday . But my luck  --  I pick the one day in the year that he goes away . Then I come here with that telegram . The one house in America , the one house fully equipped to  --  to doubt it  --  when your hard luck gets to running in a tide like that it becomes ridiculous that 's all  --  ridiculous . ( Telephone rings ) What 's that ? ( He starts nervously ) p. 43 MISS MABEL AINSLIE The telephone . ( Enter MRS . BONNER up R. ) MRS . THOMAS BONNER That 's the ' phone , is n't it ? Excuse me .

DICK Do you room alone ? MISS MABEL AINSLIE Of course I room alone . DICK ( Mutters ; with frown ) You know I could take them from you now by force  --  if I wanted to be ugly  --  you know that , do n't you ? I could step right out there and you would n't dare make a row about it . MISS MABEL AINSLIE Sh  --  MRS . THOMAS BONNER ( Dejectedly ) Oh  --  oh dear  --  well thank you very much . p. 44 DICK Only my decency  --  that 's all . ( Enter MRS . BONNER . ) MRS . THOMAS BONNER What do you think , my dear ? From Mr. Reed  --  they 're all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  all at 42d street  --  not a train running . MISS MABEL AINSLIE How dreadful . MRS . THOMAS BONNER ( Turns to table ) And dinner for ten  --  terrapin  --  larded fillet , and squabs . You know I could sit right down and cry about it . DICK ( Grimly ) I do n't think I 'd cry , Mrs. Bonner about having too much terrapin  --  there are deeper sorrows . MRS . THOMAS BONNER ( After an astonished pause ) Thank you , Dick I wo n't . ( Enter DOCTOR up L. ) DOCTOR HENRY RUMSEY She 's all right , Eva . MRS . THOMAS BONNER Who ? DOCTOR HENRY RUMSEY Nora  --  why , Dick , this is an unexpected pleasure . MRS . THOMAS BONNER Father  --  I 've had a telegram  --  none of the New Yorkers coming . You and mother must help us eat the dinner . p. 45 DOCTOR HENRY RUMSEY I 've had one dinner with the children . MRS . THOMAS BONNER But that was a very light one ; and Dick must stay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . THOMAS BONNER We wo n't be disappointed . We 'll just make an informal picnic of it and have a good time . DICK Well thank you  --  if you insist . ( Louder ) Terrapin for ten .

I was just complaining , Doctor , of my own hard luck  --  but this looks like a good omen  --  does n't it ? ( Indicates table ) DOCTOR HENRY RUMSEY I should say so . You believe in omens , Dick ? DICK Every man with any sporting blood in his veins believes in omens . ( The fountain ceases running properly , and plays full onto DICK 'S breast . ) MRS . THOMAS BONNER Oh  --  there 's a bug in it . DICK ( Fatefully ) Well if it 's only a bug . ( Turns up his collar and takes it ) p. 46 MISS MABEL AINSLIE Stand to one side , Dick . DICK ( Stubbornly ) Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as that . MRS . THOMAS BONNER Dear me  --  how does one turn it off ? ( Rings ) MISS MABEL AINSLIE Dick , that 's foolish .

DICK ( Stung ) Oh  --  well really  --  you see , Mrs. Bonner  --  ( Pause ; and with haunted glare at the fountain ) that was n't a bug . MRS . THOMAS BONNER It does n't matter , does it ? DICK ( Rousing himself ) I think , I wo n't stay , thank you . I 've heard of the Leffingwells  --  they 're rather dressy. p. 48 MRS .

MISS MABEL AINSLIE Mrs. Bonner asked us to light the candles . ( At pantry door ) Oh , butler  --  I think Mrs. Bonner wishes the table lighted now . ORTON ( Off ) Yes , Miss . ( MABEL moves down to window ) p. 50 WALTER CORBIN ( Following ) Is that all our  --  our association has meant ? MISS MABEL AINSLIE It seems so . WALTER CORBIN Does it ? MISS MABEL AINSLIE There was very little mutual obligation in it  --  or  --  or trust . WALTER CORBIN Trust ? MISS MABEL AINSLIE Yes , trust .

WALTER CORBIN ( Following MABEL as they walk ) You spoke of trust between us . The absence of trust was not  --  not my failure , was it ? MISS MABEL AINSLIE I think so  --  I only asked for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you  --  thought you asked only for the facts , but you really asked for the particulars . The fact is that I was entirely innocent of any wrong doing . Assured of that you should trust me. p. 53 MISS MABEL AINSLIE Assured of that  --  ( Pause ) I would trust you . WALTER CORBIN Oh  --  ( Pause ) You doubt it ? MISS MABEL AINSLIE It seems to me that innocence would scarcely have so much to conceal  --  WALTER CORBIN ( Pause ) Hardly a maxim  --  ( Pause ) still a column in most of the sensational papers strikes me as very indifferent secrecy . MISS MABEL AINSLIE None of them had  --  ( Pause ) WALTER CORBIN ( Pause ) Had what ? MISS MABEL AINSLIE None of them had her name . WALTER CORBIN I see  --  ( Pause ) Well none of them should have had it . It was sufficient that their vile implications had one victim . MISS MABEL AINSLIE ( With some resentment ) Victim ? WALTER CORBIN I call myself that  --  MISS MABEL AINSLIE Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've suffered by it in every way  --  ( Slowly ) mentally  --  sentimentally  --  and financially . p. 54 MISS MABEL AINSLIE Financially ? WALTER CORBIN Yes , financially . ( Changing tone ) We turn down these electrics with the candles , do n't we ? MISS MABEL AINSLIE Yes . WALTER CORBIN ( Turning out the electric lights and leaving only candles ) Whenever an owner discussing my plans of his building mentions a fire escape  --  I 'm so disconcerted that I seem completely ignorant and thereby lose his confidence , and sometimes his business  --  all because ( Pause ) a reprobate chose to make me look guilty  --  by  --  in the manner that he did . MISS MABEL AINSLIE ( Pause ) They were at your window , were n't they ? WALTER CORBIN Yes , but they 'd been stolen from the lady 's room and placed there . MISS MABEL AINSLIE Why did her husband behave as he did ? WALTER CORBIN Her husband was misled . MISS MABEL AINSLIE By what ? WALTER CORBIN By the man who tried to manufacture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any man try to do that ? p. 55 WALTER CORBIN For money  --  he discovered that the husband was insanely jealous of the wife and he fed upon that weakness  --  when the husband demanded more than the man 's mere verbal reports , the fellow had to create his own conditions  --  manufacture his evidence  --  Iago had done it with a handkerchief of Desdemona 's . This fellow chose to do it with  --  with a pair of boots . MISS MABEL AINSLIE Why did this Iago try to incite the husband 's suspicious against you ? Why were you his Cassio ? WALTER CORBIN For money I 've told you . MISS MABEL AINSLIE Did n't you know the  --  the gentleman 's wife ? WALTER CORBIN Of course I knew her . MISS MABEL AINSLIE The newspapers said you had been noticeably attentive to her . WALTER CORBIN That I deny . MISS MABEL AINSLIE It seems some one noticed it . WALTER CORBIN I tell you he exaggerated it to get money . MISS MABEL AINSLIE But you knew her . WALTER CORBIN Yes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time complained of your loneliness . You said you were going with no girls  --  that you would n't even have been in Bar Harbor except for business . p. 56 WALTER CORBIN All true  --  all of it . I was attentive to none . This lady I had known casually many years . Our meeting was quite accidental  --  quite . MISS MABEL AINSLIE And you were not attentive to her ? WALTER CORBIN I was not . I danced with her once at the club house  --  once I was a guest on a yacht where she was also a guest  --  two afternoons we were in the same sets in a tennis tournament  --  no more . MISS MABEL AINSLIE Who was she ? WALTER CORBIN I sha n't  --  tell you  --  for many reasons . MISS MABEL AINSLIE What are they ? WALTER CORBIN The least of them is that I promised her husband 's agents I would tell no one . MISS MABEL AINSLIE What is the more important reason ? WALTER CORBIN I think I owe that much to the lady herself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attitude this is for you  --  women forgive men who are really guilty ; and who confess it . MISS MABEL AINSLIE But you do n't confess it . WALTER CORBIN I have nothing to confess . p. 57 MISS MABEL AINSLIE But you have something you could tell . WALTER CORBIN Only the poor lady 's name and what good would that do you ? MISS MABEL AINSLIE I 'd know who she was and if you went back to her  --  that 's what  --  WALTER CORBIN ( Rapidly ) And would you care ? That 's the first hopeful thing you 've said . Well I wo n't go back to her if you call it that  --  I 'll promise you never to be where she is  --  if you 'll only say you believe me . If  --  if we can only be the  --  the same old friends we were . MISS MABEL AINSLIE Old friends ? WALTER CORBIN The sweethearts . ( Embraces her ) Ah ! You do love me , do n't you ? MISS MABEL AINSLIE Do I dare to ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you  --  you in my arms again . MISS MABEL AINSLIE Did n't you know I was here ? WALTER CORBIN Truly no  --  the storm drove me in  --  look at it . ( They turn to the window ) The dear old storm . It seems to laugh with us , does n't it ? p. 58 MISS MABEL AINSLIE Yes , it really does . WALTER CORBIN The worst storm since Roscoe Conklin died . Ca n't you imagine it dancing that  --  swirling snow . MISS MABEL AINSLIE ( Meaningly ) It is dancing . Let 's call it a two step . WALTER CORBIN ( Turning to her ) You angel  --  MISS MABEL AINSLIE ( Standing him off ) Not even in the same town  --  will you ? WALTER CORBIN What ? MISS MABEL AINSLIE Where she is . WALTER CORBIN No  --  not even the same town . ( They embrace . ) MISS MABEL AINSLIE ( Pause ) Does she , live in New York ? WALTER CORBIN Let 's leave that out . You 'll be wanting the street , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . MISS MABEL AINSLIE What is the color of her hair ? WALTER CORBIN Oh  --  I forget ; the usual color I think for a married woman .

NORA ( Going  --  pauses ) You saw it , Miss Ainslee , I 'm sure ; and your young man saw it  --  when I turned on the fountain  --  I did n't even know Mr. Orton was in the room , did I ? MISS MABEL AINSLIE Mr. Orton ? NORA The butler . MISS MABEL AINSLIE I think not  --  I did n't .

The room is twenty feet high  --  Walls are panelled in gray wood ten feet high with gray plaster above . The ceiling is oak beams . Half way up the height on the left is a gallery raking up and down stage , and communicating to sleeping rooms by two doors and a window between the doors . The gallery is reached from the stage by steps in two flights at L. U. corner . Under the gallery is a small door in 3  --  letting to main entrance hall of the house . Below this door on the stage is the arch giving to dining room  --  This door slides  --  Below this arch is the telephone used so often in ACT I. The back wall is glassed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studio windows . The middle light extends from ceiling to within six feet of stage and has a width from the stairway L.  --  to an equal distance from the right wall . The side lights fill the remaining space of the back wall but extends down only to the gallery level . Below the lights the wall is panelled . In the right side of back wall in the paneling is a door to exterior . The right wall has a door in one letting to DR . RUMSEY 'S bed chamber . Another in 3 letting to a bath room . Between these doors is a massive chimney breast of red brick going from floor to ceiling . The massive mantel on oak beams is six feet from floor  --  it is hung underneath with mugs of copper  --  An ordinary man may stand beneath it . The fire-place is in proportion and is fitted with high black iron trimmings . Over the mantel is a painting of a castle . Over the doors are canvasses of various sizes unframed showing animal studies . Similar sketches are on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back A window seat runs from the stairway back almost over to the exterior door . The seat is cushioned on top but filled with canvas stretchers underneath  --  A baby grand piano is in front of the seat , c . A nest of tea tables is below the piano . A couch of the bed variety is in front of fireplace made up with bedding and pillows  --  A draped model stand with drawers and compartments is center . A big easel is up R. C. A draped manikin is between the doors left . The glass at back is fitted with curtains rolling into spring rollers at bottom . These curtains are not practicable but stand at one position thro ' the act . The backing is tree tops covered with snow and ice and arranged to sparkle in moonlight , later . The studio is lighted by a fire ; and by lamps on piano and suspended from gallery , all fitted with electric lamps . Candles in candelabra are on mantel .

DOCTOR HENRY RUMSEY Who is ? MRS . RUMSEY Nora . DOCTOR HENRY RUMSEY I thought the butler was to sleep there . MRS . RUMSEY ( Shakes head ) Eva changed her mind  --  she did n't like the idea of a strange man sleeping in the dining room , so she gave the butler Nora 's room and put Nora there . Tell Mr. Corbin . DOCTOR HENRY RUMSEY You think that 'll interest Mr. Corbin ? MRS . RUMSEY Sh  --  He might take a notion to go in there . DOCTOR HENRY RUMSEY ( Pretending to be shocked ) Why mother !

She thinks it possible that Mr. Bonner may still come in . WALTER CORBIN Yes . MRS . RUMSEY So we 've put the chain on the front door . He 'll have to ring . WALTER CORBIN Very well , I 'll answer it , if he does . MRS . RUMSEY No need . Nora 's in the dining room . WALTER CORBIN ( Snuffing ) I notice ; that 's a very powerful liniment of the Doctor 's .

DOCTOR HENRY RUMSEY Well now that you suggest  --  I  --  MRS . RUMSEY Well ? DOCTOR HENRY RUMSEY She might fetch us the decanter and a syphon or two eh ? ( To CORBIN ) WALTER CORBIN You 're the Doctor . MRS . RUMSEY ( Going ) Yes  --  He 's the Doctor ; and when he has to take his own medicine I 'm pretty familiar with his prescription . ( Exit ) DOCTOR HENRY RUMSEY What do they call it ? A " Dock and Doris . " WALTER CORBIN ( Smiling ) Yes , a " Dock and Doris .

( Gets megaphone from the wall ) If you men are going to talk longer I 'll ask Mr. Corbin to use this . Mrs. Leffingwell and Miss Ainslie have only those thin doors between them and you . DOCTOR HENRY RUMSEY What 's that ? ( Indicates her other hand ) MRS . RUMSEY ( Displaying them ) Mrs. Leffingwell 's boots .

DOCTOR HENRY RUMSEY ( Settled in his chair ) Great thing those megaphones . See in the papers that some fellow in Virginia 's preaching through one of them . WALTER CORBIN Yes , I read that . ( Sits on the couch bed ) DOCTOR HENRY RUMSEY ( In leisurely gossip ) Simply an application of the old fireman 's trumpet . WALTER CORBIN ( Easily ) Same idea . DOCTOR HENRY RUMSEY And the fireman 's trumpet came from the huntsman 's bugle and I suppose the huntsman 's bugle was discovered by some idle boy blowing through a ram 's horn , way back in the tribal times . ( Pause ) That spectrumized wood  --  by jove , is n't that a pretty flame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 83 WALTER CORBIN Like a topaz and emerald blended . DOCTOR HENRY RUMSEY A chemist makes that nowaday 's ; but it was discovered by the fishermen that used to burn the drift wood of old boats , that had been covered with copper . ( Pause ) Whiskey ! ( Holds up glass affectionately ) I 'll wager that the first distillation of whiskey came from some neglected , and accidentally fermented , grain that the owner thought was a total loss . WALTER CORBIN Quite likely . DOCTOR HENRY RUMSEY Undoubtedly ! That horse hair lariat hanging there  --  every plainsman has one to lay around him when he sleeps  --  somebody discovered by accident , that a snake wo n't cross a rope made of horse hair . I 'm seventy two and I 've really come to a state where I expect very little from elaborate preparation and am rather disappointed if the casual accident has n't the kernel of a real benefit in it .

DOCTOR HENRY RUMSEY My profession  --  an accident . WALTER CORBIN You mean your being a doctor was accidental . DOCTOR HENRY RUMSEY No I was a physician and surgeon by intention ; but my going over to Osteopathy . Ever tell you the story ? WALTER CORBIN Never . DOCTOR HENRY RUMSEY I used to have in my stable a little black mare  --  a regular pet . Drove her on my morning round  --  always finished by giving her a lump of sugar  --  One morning I went to buckle a fly net that had come loose at her breast ; she expected the sugar  --  she had on blinders  --  and she turned her head suddenly and struck me right there . ( Indicates left ear . Pause ) I could n't hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time I heard a roaring like Niagara . Did every thing  --  medicine  --  blisters  --  knife  --  no use  --  got a little funny up hero too . ( Taps head ) WALTER CORBIN You mean mentally ? DOCTOR HENRY RUMSEY Yes  --  they were taking me to California ; some sanitarium  --  a bridge washed out on the old North Missouri railroad near a town called Kirksville . Had to lay over there one day . I never knew such heat  --  hundred and ten in the shade . p. 85 WALTER CORBIN Whew ! I would n't have gone in the shade . DOCTOR HENRY RUMSEY Commenced to get violent . Mrs. Rumsey was with me , and in her alarm she called in a doctor there , a long , slab sided fellow , in a linen duster . Two men were holding me by this time  --  the doctor felt round my skull , and neck a minute or two , then suddenly gave my head a wrench , and a crack , and I was a well man , like that . ( Snaps finger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Slight displacement of one of the vertabrae impinging on a nerve . Pressure gone , the trouble was gone . WALTER CORBIN But you 're still hard of hearing ? DOCTOR HENRY RUMSEY Only been so the last four years  --  I practiced medicine thirty years after that accident  --  but to finish my story , that same doctor later developed a new system of therapeutics , based on the theory that the bone structure of the human frame is the base of the health , or ill health . He opened a college , and I went to it . That accident to me , by my little black mare , made me an Osteopathist . WALTER CORBIN You say you were mentally deranged by the accident ? DOCTOR HENRY RUMSEY For a time  --  ( Pause ) perhaps you think permanently . p. 86 WALTER CORBIN Oh , no  --  but tell me  --  this was n't the skull pressing on the brain . DOCTOR HENRY RUMSEY No  --  one of the cervical vertebrae pressing on a nerve . WALTER CORBIN ( Thoughtfully ) M 'm . DOCTOR HENRY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indigestion  --  dyspepsia , caused by a slight irregularity of one dorsal bone . And I 've cured it by a snap of my thumb  --  a quick push of that particular vertebra into line . WALTER CORBIN By jove  --  ( Pause ) And a mental derangement corrected the same way ? DOCTOR HENRY RUMSEY Mine was . WALTER CORBIN ( With increased interest ) What was it he did to you ? DOCTOR HENRY RUMSEY I 'll show you . ( Takes CORBIN 'S head in hands ) WALTER CORBIN No thank you  --  the thing may work conversely . DOCTOR HENRY RUMSEY Well here we are . ( Takes manikin from wall L. and brings it to couch ) Here 's Tom 's manikin . This neck is articulated almost perfectly . He put me on the sleeping car bunk  --  so . ( Puts manikin on couch in the fire light only ) Then he moved my head  --  I learned all this afterwards  --  p. 87 WALTER CORBIN Naturally  --  DOCTOR HENRY RUMSEY He moved my head to the limit one way  --  ( To manikin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Demonstrates to CORBIN ) then a slight pull and a jerk oppositely  --  so ; and the thing was done . WALTER CORBIN Interesting ! ( To manikin ) Feel better ! ( In alarm to DOCTOR ) Why she ca n't speak . DOCTOR HENRY RUMSEY ( Stands under the mantel ) Still the operation was successful . Why , my boy , do you know why the Japanese soldiers outmarch the world ? WALTER CORBIN Rice ? DOCTOR HENRY RUMSEY Rice  --  no  --  Osteopathy . A man tires because his muscle wearies  --  that muscle wearies because its particular vitalizing nerve is benumbed  --  that particular nerve is benumbed at its root , not at the terminus ; and the root of the nerve is in the spine . Mister tired Jap lies down on his back , so . ( Again demonstrates with manikin ) A comrade takes his head and pulls it this way  --  his weight against it slowly , until the operator feels all the vertabrae slip under the pull like a string of beads , one by one . The pressure off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the nerves take new force  --  new life ; and your Jap resumes and out-marches your Caucasian , by ten or twelve miles . p. 88 WALTER CORBIN Well , why do n't we Americans do that for one another ? DOCTOR HENRY RUMSEY Too busy pulling the other extremity . ( Lifts the manikin 's leg ) ( The telephone rings . ) WALTER CORBIN There 's the bell . DOCTOR HENRY RUMSEY Door bell ? WALTER CORBIN Telephone I think . DOCTOR HENRY RUMSEY ( Shaking head and indicating his ears ) I ca n't answer it . ( CORBIN goes to ' phone .
