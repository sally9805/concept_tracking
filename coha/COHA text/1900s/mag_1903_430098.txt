NO one who is interested in the subject of language can have failed to be struck with the prevalence of complaints about the corruption which is overtaking our own speech . There seems to have been in every period of the past , as there is now , a distinct apprehension in the minds of very many worthy persons that the English tongue is always in the condition of approaching collapse , and that arduous efforts must be put forth , and put forth persistently , in order to save it from destruction . In every age there is in one particular a striking similarity in the lamentations of these prophets of woe . They are always pointing to the past with pride . In some preceding period , usually not very remote , they tell us , the language was spoken and written with the greatest purity . It is not an infrequent remark that it had then attained the acme of perfection at which it is capable of arriving . But since that happy time it has been degenerating . Corruptions of all kinds are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violence of a tidal wave . Slang , unnecessary words , ungrammatical locutions , phrases borrowed from foreign tongues , especially from the French , replace and drive out the genuine vernacular . It was not so very unnatural that views of this kind should be expressed in the past , when the nature of language and of the influences that operate upon it was little understood . Men knew nothing of the historical development of the words and grammatical forms they were in the habit of using . They had not the slightest conception out of what impurity had sprung much of the vaunted purity in which they rejoiced . To them the language seemed a sort of intellectual machine which had come into their possession with all its parts finished and elaborated . They were consequently solicitous that nothing should be brought in to impair its imagined perfection . They lived in perpetual dread of agencies that might threaten its integrity . One very favorite idea with them was that it should be rendered what they called " fixed , " in consequence of which it would undergo no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to have a language fixed , it must first of all be dead . In all these delusions great writers of former times largely shared , whether they belonged to England or to other countries . Of the class of men just indicated Dean Swift is in our literature far the greatest representative . The desire for what he deemed the purity of the language amounted with him almost to a passion . To securing it he devoted no small share of thought and attention . One of his earliest utterances upon the subject ? perhaps his earliest ? appeared in the Tatter of September 28 , 1710 . In it he deplored the general ignorance and want of taste exhibited by the writers of the age . These were bringing about the steady corruption of the English tongue . T ? nless some timely remedy was found , he declared that the language would suffer more by the false refinements of the twenty years which had just passed than it had been improved in the foregoing hundred . Swift 's essay was largely taken up with the exemplification of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corrupting the speech . They were of three kinds . The first were abbreviations , in which only the first part of a word was used . The result was to add a further number of monosyllables to a language already overloaded with them . As illustrations of these he gave phiz for physiognomy , hyp for hypo- chondria , mob for mobile , poz for positive , and rep for reputation . Incog for incognito and plenipo for plenipotentiary he expected to see still further docked into inc and plen . Swift was of opinion that the abundance of monosyllables is the disgrace of our language . Accordingly it might be supposed that he would look with favor upon the polysyllables which , according to his account , the war then going on ? that of the Spanish Succession ? was bringing into the tongue . But no one who has once taken the language under his care can ever again be really happy . That way misery lies . To these long words Swift exhibited the same hostile front which he did to the short ones . Among them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , palisadoes , communications , circumvallalions , battalions . These , he thought , would never be able to live many more campaigns ; though even in the special sense of them which he had in mind most of them had been iii existence before he was born . Swift 's third class embraced a number of words " invented , " he said , " by certain pretty fellows , such as banter , bamboozle , country put , and kidney . " Some of these were struggling for the vogue ; others were now in possession of it . " I have done my utmost , " he added , " for some years past to stop the progress of mobb and banter , but have been plainly borne down by numbers and betrayed by those who promised to assist me . " It is somewhat surprising to find kidney included in this list . In the sense of it objected to ? that of " constitution , " " class " ? it had then been employed for about two hundred years . Falstaff 's use of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bully , shuffling , and palming are also other terms of modern art , to use Swift 's phrase , which fell under his condemnation . Swift followed up this attack in 1712 by a public Letter addressed to the Earl of Oxford , the Lord High Treasurer . In it was embodied a proposition for correcting , improving , and ascertaining the English tongue . It ? is a treatise which ought to be read by the whole generation of those of our time who spend anxious days and sit up nights in order to preserve the purity of the speech . Nowhere can a greater discrepancy be found between predictions of what is going to take place and what has actually taken place . In this Letter we are told . that the English language is extremely imperfect . The improvements made in it are by no means in proportion to its daily corruptions . The period which Swift selected as the one in which English received most refinement was that dating from the beginning of the reign of Queen Elizabeth and ending with the breaking out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degeneracy . Corruption came in from the fanatics of the commonwealth , and this had been succeeded by corruption from the fine gentlemen of the court . From both quarters it had made its way into the writings of the best authors . Affected phrases , new conceited terms , had been transferred from the language of high life into the language of plays , and from them had been taken up by men of wit and learning . The poets also had introduced the barbarous custom of abbreviating words , thereby forming harsh , inharmonious sounds that nothing but a Northern ear could endure . These had passed . from verse into prose . " What does your Lordship think , " Swift asked with pain , " of the words drudg 'd , disturb 'd , rebuk't , fledg 'd , and a thousand others everywhere to be met ? . .. Where by leaving out a vowel to save a syllable , we form so jarring a sound and so difficult to utter that I have often wondered how it could ever obtain . " Like other men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the evils he had discovered . This was essentially the project of an academy , though in his Letter he did not put it forth under that name . His idea was that a choice should be made of the persons best qualified to deal with the language . These should meet together and proceed to make such alterations in the speech as they thought requisite . They should then devise a method of ascertaining and fixing it forever . If this were not done , if things went on at the rate they had been going , nobody would be read with pleasure much longer than a few years , and in course of time could hardly be understood without an interpreter . He could  | further promise the prime minister that two hundred years hence some painful compiler , who had been studying the language of Queen Anne 's time , would be able to pick out and transfer into his new history , written in the language of his own time , that Robert , Earl of Oxford , a very wise and excellent man of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account , however , of that statesman 's life , acts , and character , given by contemporary writers like Swift himself , would be dropped because of the antiquated style and manner in which they were delivered . The appeal was ineffectual . In spite of it no body of competent persons was selected by the prime minister to take charge of the English tongue . The truth is , the Earl of Oxford had soon all he could do to keep his own head on his shoulders , and in consequence naturally left the language to look out for itself . It seems to have been amply able to discharge that duty . The two hundred years specified have very nearly gone by , and none of the dire predictions just mentioned have been fulfilled . No need has been found of resorting to the aid of the painful antiquary to decipher the writings of the time . Every word of Swift 's Letter can be understood now as easily as it was on the day it was published . Swift 's opinion , as we have seen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reigns of Elizabeth and the first Stuarts . It was not long , however , before the point of view changed . By the middle of the eighteenth century it became the proper thing to believe that English had reached its perfection in the so-called Augustan period , and that from the accession of George II. , if not earlier , the speech had entered upon a process of decline . It was daily becoming more corrupt . New words and phrases were creeping in which would have filled Addison and Swift and Steele with indignation , if not horror . To this we have a good deal of unimpeachable contemporary testimony . For instance , in 1751 , Lord Orrery brought out a little treatise on the " Life and Writings of Swift . " In it he tells us that in his opinion the language had been brought by that author and his contemporaries to the utmost degree of perfection . He contrast- ed their style , altogether to their advantage , with that of men like Bacon and Milton . Swift , Addison , and Bolingbroke he considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and propriety unknown to their forefathers . But at the time he was writing he assures us the language was every day growing worse and more debased . Singularly enough , one of the expressions that , according to him , indicated this degeneracy was a few ? a locution which had certainly been in frequent use from the fourteenth century , if indeed it does not go back to the Anglo-Saxon . The lack of grammar in the Lord 's Prayer disturbed Orrery mightily , as it had done so many others . In all this he was a fair representative of his time . The views expressed by him were the views which continued to prevail ? in some quarters , it would be more appropriate to say , which continued to rage ? for the rest of the century . As one of their later exponents we turn to a man who retains with us some little reputation as a small poet , and while he lived was deemed by many to be a great philosopher . He was a Scotchman , and Scotchmen have always seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At least they did so in the eighteenth century , when they were at times disposed to look upon it as a foreign tongue . The name of the man here referred to was James Beattie . He was , as has been said , a poet and a philosopher . In the latter capacity he had recommended himself to the religious by a very virulent attack upon the metaphysical speculations of Hume . This gave him great reputation at the time ; for his treatise was written in an agreeable style , and with all that clearness of expression which with many serves as a satisfactory substitute for clearness of ideas . Among other results it brought him the favor of George III. , with whom , like Dr. Johnson , he had a personal interview . The meeting between the professorial and the official defender of the faith took place in 1773 . As became a loyal subject , Beattie was profoundly impressed with the good sense , knowledge , and acuteness of the monarch . One of the topics touched upon was the English language . In it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the philosophical ignorance of the subject . The king asked him if he did not think the language was at that time in a decline . Beattie was forced to reply that such was the melancholy fact . The king agreed , and named the Spectator as one of the best standards of the speech . This was the only proper doctrine to hold then , and Beattie concurred in it with all his heart . It had long been his own opinion . He was a good , genuine conservative , and felt that neither the English tongue nor the English constitution stood in the slightest need of change . Consequently , he was always indulging in a mild form of terror at the ruin impending over the one because of the new ideas coming in , and over the other because of the new words . As for the principal personage in the conversation , his published correspondence has made us aware that the English of the king varied widely at times from the king 's English . The solicitude of Beattie grew upon him as he advanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the composition of a criticism on the style of Addison , so as to show its peculiar merits , and furthermore to lay bare the hazards to which the language was exposed of being debased and corrupted by the innovations which had of late , he said , " found their way into the style of our best and most esteemed writers . " He had prepared a collection of Scotticisms , which of course were expressions to be carefully avoided . He began , however , to be timid about publishing it . While he had been engaged in its compilation many of the words and phrases it contained had been adopted in the speech used south of the Tweed . " Our language ( I mean the English ) is degenerating very fast , " he wrote sorrowfully to a friend in 1785 ; " and many phrases , which I know to be Scottish idioms , have got into it of late years , so that many of my strictures are liable to be opposed by authorities which the world accounts unexceptionable . " As time went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a letter of 1790 , commenting on the annotations made to a recent edition of the Tatter , he described the language employed in them as " full of those newfangled phrases and barbarous idioms that are now so much affected by those who form their style from political pamphlets and those pretended speeches in Parliament that appear in newspapers . Should this jargon continue to gain ground among us , English literature will go to ruin . During the last twenty years , especially since the breaking out of the American war , it has made alarming progress . . .. If I live to execute what I propose on the writings and genius of Addison , I shall at least enter my protest against the practice ; and by exhibiting a copious specimen of the new phraseology , endeavor to make my reader set his heart against it . " On more than one other occasion Beattie expressed the anxiety he felt at the degeneracy then taking place in the English tongue , and his fear of the impossibility of arresting its progress . The speech was not simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a friend , written in August , 1790 , he expressed his gratification that Miss Bowdler approved of the sentiments he entertained as to the increase of the corruption which was bringing about the deterioration of the language . " I begin to fear , " he added , " it will be impossible to check it ; but an attempt would be made if I had leisure and a little more tranquillity of mind . " Time and tranquil mind were apparently both denied . Beattie never completed his treatise on the style of Addison . Accordingly , he never furnished his readers with a list of those neologisms which were stealing into and corrupting the speech . But in 1794 he printed privately some productions in prose and verse of his son , said to have been a youth of great promise , who died in 1790 . Among them were two or three entitled " Dialogues of the Dead . " These dealt with the subject of language , and unquestionably represented Beattie 's own opinions . One of them is the report of an imaginary conversation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disgusted with the expressions used by the tradesman , and begs Mercury to translate his gibberish into English . A few of the words and phrases , then indicated as corruptions , are still strange to us ; but most of them are now used every day by those who are in a state of dis- tress because of the impending ruin of the tongue . It is both suggestive and instructive to learn a little of this new language which had just come into fashion , as Mercury gives Swift to understand . " Instead of life , new , wish for , take , plunge , etc. , " he told him , " you must say existence , novel , desiderate , capture , ingurgitate , etc. , as ? a fever put an end to his existence . ... Instead of a new fashion , you will do well to say a novel fashion . . . . You must on no account speak of taking the enemy 's ships , towns , guns , or baggage : it must be capturing . " This last word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years before . Sort and kind were unfashionable nouns , and indeed quite vulgar ; description , on account of its length and Latin original , was better . Instead of undervaluing your enemies , you set no store by them . Unfriendly and hostile had both given place to inimical . This word is said to have come in at the same time with capture ; but though a great favorite , it was pronounced differently by those who used it . There are many other words and phrases censured , some of which the majority of us would now think we could hardly get along without . Line , meet , marked , feel , and go , we are told , were employed on all occasions , whether they had any meaning or not . Instead of saying conduct , it was fashionable to say line of conduct . You meet a person 's wishes and arguments . You are received with marked applause , or contempt , or admiration . The words am and be were in danger of being forgotten , having been crowded out by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following adjectives , one says he feels anxious , afraid , warm , sick , ashamed . Instead of saying that one 's arguments proved certain things , we must assert that his arguments went to prove . For reformation , again , everybody was learning to say reform , this latter being a French word and the other vile old English . Instead of for the future it had become fashionable to say in future . There were also some current phrases which were not merely ambiguous but unintelligible . Among them were such expressions as scouted the idea , netted a cool thousand , to make up one 's mind . Then there was a tendency to use uncommon terminations . Men said committal instead of commitment , approval instead of approbation , truism for truth , agriculturist for husbandman , and pugilist for boxer . Swift 's patience is represented as finally giving way altogether under the infliction of the following sentence : " We hear it is in contemplation to run up a novel and superb pavilion at Newmarket for Pugilistical exhibitions . " He sees his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the assertion that it would require an hour even of his conversation to wear out the disagreeable impression left in his mind by this abominable detail of vulgarity , pedantry , and barbarism . So much for the eighteenth century . The nineteenth century abounded in men who had very decided opinions as to the debasement which was overtaking the speech and were filled with anxiety about its future . But expression of views of this sort came rarely from writers of ability or learning . To this rule there is one distinguished exception . It is Walter Savage Landor . His observations , both general and particular , on language are to be found in certain of his " Imaginary Conversations . " Of these the first series came out in 1824 . Knowledge of the nature and development of speech had made a good deal of progress during the more than century which had gone by since Swift addressed his letter to Lord Oxford . But not a ray of this additional light ever reached Landor 's ears . He still continued to retain and repeat the crude notions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the craziest class of verbal critics . Necessarily came from him the same doleful representation of the condition and prospects of the speech . In one of his earlier Conversations Landor told us that within another generation the language , with the improper innovations constantly made , would have become so corrupt that writers , if they hoped for life , would find it necessary to mount up near its sources . In one of his latest he affirmed that the English tongue had fallen , for the last half-century , more rapidly into corruption and decomposition than any other ever spoken among men .  | Landor 's specific observations upon usage abound in mistakes of fact and mistakes of inference . Of the various delusions under which he labored , the one most frequently to be observed concerned etymology . He was fully possessed by that devil of derivation which , unlike the evil spirit of Scripture , makes happy him in whom it dwells and vexes only the souls of those with whom he comes in contact . There are some men who seem incapable of comprehending the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which determines the propriety of its use ; not its past meaning , still less its meaning in the tongue from which it came . Of this particular kind of incapacity Landor furnished so many examples in his Conversations that we must restrict ourselves to a very few which can be treated in a few words . He implies that it is ' wrong to say bad or false orthography , because " orthography " means by its derivation right spelling . He informs us that we are at liberty to gather two or more roses , but not to gather one ; for " gather " comes from the same root as together . Examine into is incorrect , because " examine " strictly means " to weigh out . " Further , we are required to believe that it is highly improper to say under the circumstances , though everybody has been saying it for the past two or three centuries . But the Latin circum shows that circumstances are about us , not above us ; it is therefore quite impossible for us to be under them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write averse to . This is a construction which has been in the best of use for three hundred years , and is likely so to continue for hundreds of years to come . But while the rest of us have the right to say it , Landor had not , if he purposed to remain faithful to his principles . The construction with from , not so common in the best usage , was nevertheless unobjectionable , and was open to him . It was his business to use it and not the one with to . To base propriety of present usage upon derivation would render it necessary for an English writer to master three or four languages before he could safely deliver himself in his own . The ridiculousness of such a requirement reveals at once the ridiculousness of the idea that makes an inference of such a nature possible . All that is further needed to enhance the preposterousness of the course is to rest the meaning upon an erroneous derivation . This , Landor , who was in. no sense a scholar as regards his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riot in his observations , unembarrassed by sufficient knowledge to give it even a slight claim to plausibility . Bower , he tells us , is the last syllable of arbour . As a matter of fact bower was in the language some centuries before arbour ? originally ( h ) erbere ? made its appearance in it . Landor indeed was so deplorably ignorant of English etymology that he missed the benefit he would have derived from it to support the views he advocated . " We write island with an s , " he said , in his capacity of spellingreformer , " as if we feared to be thought ignorant of its derivation . " The truth is , we write island with an s because we are ignorant of its derivation . It was not till the sixteenth century that men , under the fancied belief that the word was connected with isle , inserted the s , which hides from us its real origin . One more illustration must suffice of Landor 's efforts to restore usage to its primitive purity . He was unaware that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... it was a plural noun . On the strength of this blunder he was enabled to pronounce the following dictum for the benefit of writers . " While , " he said , " is the time when ; whiles is the times when . " But he never had the slightest doubt as to the correctness of his statements and the truth of his convictions . Exposure of his blunders provoked his wrath , but never shook his self-confidence . The waywardness and wrong-headedness of the views he expressed , joined with the violence of his utterances , give a certain justification to Byron 's designation of him as " that deep-mouthed Boeotian , Savage Landor . " The errors which vitiated his conclusions and those of others before him will constitute the subject of an article in the January number .  |
