These writings , as well as the vast array of popular books - too many for individual mention - have been freely consulted after studies made afield. @# To Sprengel belongs the glory of first exalting flowers above the level of botanical specimens . After studying the wild geranium he became convinced , as he wrote in 1787 , that " the wise Author of Nature has not made even a single hair without a definite design . A hundred years before , one , Nehemias Grew , had said that it was necessary for pollen to reach the stigma of a flower in order that it might set fertile seed , and Linnaeus bad to come to his rescue with conclusive evidence to convince a doubting world that he was right . Sprengel made the next step forward , but his writings lay neglected over seventy years because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a flower is fertilized by insects which carry its pollen from its anthers to its stigma . In spite of his discoveries that the hairs within the wild geranium protect its nectar from rain for the insect benefactor ' s benefit ; that most flowers which secrete nectar have what he termed " honey guides " - spots of bright color , heavy veining , or some such pathfinder for the visitor on the petals ; that sometimes the male flowers , the staminate ones , are separated from the seed-bearing or pistillate ones on distinct plants , he left it to Darwin to show that cross-fertilization by insects , the transfer of pollen from one blossom to another - not from anthers to stigma of the same flower - is the great end to which so much marvelous floral mechanism is adapted . The wind is a wasteful , uncertain pollen distributor . Insects transfer it more economically , especially the more highly organized and industrious ones . In a few instances hummingbirds , as well , unwittingly do the flower ' s bidding while they feast now here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most patient and scientific research , that shed great light on the theory of natural selection a half century before Darwin advanced it , he never knew that flowers are nearly always sterile to pollen of another species when carried to them on the bodies of insect visitors , or that cross-pollenized blossoms defeat the self-pollinated ones in the struggle for survival . These facts Darwin proved in endless experiments. @# Because bees depend absolutely upon flowers , not only for their own food but for that of future generations for whom they labor ; because they are the most diligent of all visitors , and are rarely diverted from one species of flower to another while on their rounds collecting , as they must , both nectar and pollen , it follows they are the most important fertilizing agents . It is estimated that , should they perish , more than half the flowers in the world would be exterminated with them ! Australian farmers imported clover from Europe , and although they had luxuriant fields of it , no seed was set for next year ' s planting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his arrival , their loss was speedily made good. @# Ages before men cultivated gardens , they had tiny helpers they knew not of . Gardeners win all the glory of producing a Lawson pink or a new chrysanthemum ; but only for a few seasons do they select , hybridize , according to their own rules of taste . They take up the work where insects left it off after countless centuries of toil . Thus it is to the night-flying moth , long of tongue , keen of scent , that we are indebted for the deep , white , fragrant Easter lily , for example , and not to the florist ; albeit the moth is in his turn indebted to the lily for the length of his tongue and his keen nerves : neither could have advanced without the other . What long vistas through the ages of creation does not this interdependence of flowers and insects open ! @# Over five hundred flowers in this book have been classified according to color , because it is believed that the novice , with no knowledge of botany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by this method , which has the added advantage of being the simple one adopted by the higher insects ages before books were written . Technicalities have been avoided in the text wherever possible , not to discourage the beginner from entering upon one of the most enjoyable and elevating branches of Nature study . The scientific names and classification follow that method adopted by the International Botanical Congress which has now superseded all others ; nevertheless the titles employed by Gray , with which older botanists in this country are familiar , are also indicated where they differ from the new nomenclature. @# NELTJE BLANCHAN , New York , March , 1900 @# TABLE OF CONTENTS @# Preface List of Illustrations Blue to Purple Flowers Magenta to Pink Flowers White and Greenish Flowers Yellow and Orange Flowers Red and Indefinites Appendices : Fragrant Flowers or Leaves Unpleasantly Scented Plants and Shrubs Conspicuous in Fruit Plant Families Represented @# " Let us content ourselves no longer with being mere ' botanists ' - historians of structural facts .

Happily Kaspar Commelyn died in 1731 , before the joke was perpetrated in " Species Plantarum. " @# In the morning we find the day-flower open and alert-looking , owing to the sharp , erect bracts that give it support ; after noon , or as soon as it has been fertilized by the female bees , that are its chief benefactors while collecting its abundant pollen , the lovely petals roll up , never to open again , and quickly wilt into a wet , shapeless mass , which , if we touch it , leaves a sticky blue fluid on our finger-tips. @# The SLENDER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a more fragile-looking , smaller-flowered , and narrower-leafed species , blooms from August to October , from Pennsylvania southward to tropical America and westward to Texas. @# SPIDERWORT ; WIDOW ' S or JOB ' S TEARS ( Tradescantia Virginiana ) Spiderwort family @# Flowers - Purplish blue , rarely white , showy , ephemeral , 1 to 2 in. broad ; usually several flowers , but more drooping buds , clustered and seated between long blade-like bracts at end of stern .

Distribution - New York and Virginia westward to South Dakota and Arkansas. @# As so very many of our blue flowers are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know we have sent to England at least one native that was considered fit to adorn the grounds of Hampton Court . John Tradescant , gardener to Charles I , for whom the plant and its kin were named , had seeds sent him by a relative in the Virginia colony ; and before long the deep azure blossoms with their golden anthers were seen in gardens on both sides of the Atlantic - another one of the many instances where the possibilities of our wild flowers under cultivation had to be first pointed out to us by Europeans. @# Like its relative the dayflower , the spiderwort opens for part of a day only . In the morning it is wide awake and pert ; early in the afternoon its petals have begun to retreat within the calyx , until presently they become " dissolved in tears , " like Job or the traditional widow . What was flower only a few hours ago is now a fluid jelly that trickles at the touch . Tomorrow fresh buds will open , and a continuous succession of bloom may be relied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widely separated from the anthers and surpasses them , it is probable the flower can not fertilize itself , but is wholly dependent on the female bees and other insects that come to it for pollen . Note the hairs on the stamens provided as footholds for the bees. @# The plant is a cousin of the " Wandering Jew " ( T. repens ) , so commonly grown either in water or earth in American sitting-rooms . In a shady lane within New York city limits , where a few stems were thrown out one spring about five years ago , the entire bank is now covered with the vine , that has rooted by its hairy joints , and , in spite of frosts and blizzards , continues to bear its true-blue flowers throughout the summer. @# PICKEREL WEED ( Pontederia cordata ) Pickerel-weed family @# Flowers - Bright purplish blue , including filaments , anthers , and style ; crowded in a dense spike ; quickly fading ; unpleasantly odorous . Perianth tubular , 2-lipped , parted into 6 irregular lobes , free from ovary ; middle lobe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Stamens 6 , placed at unequal distances on tube , 3 opposite each lip . Pistil 1 , the stigma minutely toothed . Stem : Erect , stout , fleshy , to 4 ft. tall , not often over 2 ft. above water line . Leaves : Several bract-like , sheathing stem at base ; leaf only , midway on flower-stalk , thick , polished , triangular , or arrow-shaped , 4 to 8 in. long , 2 to 6 in. across base . Preferred Habitat - Shallow water of ponds and streams . Flowering Season - June-October . Distribution - Eastern half of United States and Canada. @# Grace of habit and the bright beauty of its long blue spikes of ragged flowers above rich , glossy leaves give a charm to this vigorous wader . Backwoodsmen will tell you that pickerels lay their eggs among the leaves ; but so they do among the sedges , arums , wild rice , and various aquatic plants , like many another fish . Bees and flies , that congregate about the blossoms to feed , may sometimes fly too low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s choice of haunt . Each blossom lasts but a single day ; the upper portion , withering , leaves the base of the perianth to harden about the ovary and protect the solitary seed . But as the gradually lengthened spike keeps up an uninterrupted succession of bloom for months , more than ample provision is made for the perpetuation of the race - a necessity to any plant that refuses to thrive unless it stands in water . Ponds and streams have an unpleasant habit of drying up in summer , and often the pickerel weed looks as brown as a bulrush where it is stranded in the baked mud in August . When seed falls on such ground , if indeed it germinates at all , the young plant naturally withers away. @# In the Bulletin of the Torrey Botanical Club , Mr. W. H. Leggett , who made a careful study of the flower , tells that three forms occur , not on the same , but on different plants , being even more distinctly trimorphic than the purple Loosestrife . As these flowers set no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secure the greatest benefit from their visits are marvelous . Of the three kinds of blossoms , one raises its stigma on a long style reaching to the top of the flower ; a second form lifts its stigma only halfway up , and the third keeps its stigma in the bottom of the tube . Now , there are two sets of stamens , three in each set bearing pollen grains of different size and value . Whenever the stigma is high , the two sets of stamens keep out of its way by occupying the lowest and middle positions , or just where the stigmas occur in the two other forms ; or , let us say , whenever the stigma is in one of the three positions , the different sets of stamens occupy the other two . In a long series of experiments on flowers occurring in two and three forms - dimorphic and trimorphic - Darwin proved that perfect fertility can be obtained only when the stigma in each form is pollenized with grains carried from the stamens of a corresponding height . For example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dusted with pollen from the long stamens , his chest covered from the middle-length stamens , and his tongue and chin from the set in the bottom of the tube nearest the nectary . When he flies off to visit another flower , these parts of his body coming in contact with the stigmas that occupy precisely the position where the stamens were in other individuals , he necessarily brushes off each lot of pollen just where it will do the most good . Pollen brought from high stamens , for example , to a low stigma , even should it reach it , which is scarcely likely , takes little or no effect . Thus cross-fertilization is absolutely essential , and in three-formed flowers there are two chances to one of securing it. @# WILD HYACINTH , SCILLA or SQUILL . QUAMASH ( Quamasia kyacinthina ; Scilla Fraseri of Gray ) Lily family @# Flowers - Several or many , pale violet blue , or rarely white , in a long , loose raceme ; perianth of 6 equal , narrowly oblong , widely spreading divisions , the thread-like filaments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stigma . Scape : 1 to 2 ft. high , from egg-shaped , nearly black bulb , 1 to 1 1/2 in. long . Leaves : Grass-like , shorter than flowering scape , from the base .

Distribution - Pennsylvania and Ohio westward to Minnesota , south to Alabama and Texas. @# Coming with the crocuses , before the snow is off the ground , and remaining long after their regal gold and purple chalices have withered , the Siberian scillas sold by seedsmen here deserve a place in every garden , for their porcelain-blue color is rare as it is charming ; the early date when they bloom makes them especially welcome ; and , once planted and left undisturbed , the bulbs increase rapidly , without injury from overcrowding . Evidently they need little encouragement to run wild . Nevertheless they are not wild scillas , however commonly they may be miscalled so . Certainly ladies ' tresses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has even less right to the name. @# Our true native wild hyacinth , or scilla , is quite a different flower , not so pure a blue as the Siberian scilla , and paler ; yet in the middle West , where it abounds , there are few lovelier sights in spring than a colony of these blossoms directed obliquely upward from slender , swaying scapes among the lush grass . Their upward slant brings the stigma in immediate contact with an incoming visitor ' s pollen-laden body . As the stamens diverge with the spreading of the divisions of the perianth , to which they are attached , the stigma receives pollen brought from another flower , before the visitor dusts himself anew in searching for refreshment , thus effecting cross-pollination . Ants , bees , wasps , flies , butterflies , and beetles may be seen about the wild hyacinth , which is obviously best adapted to the bees . The smallest insects that visit it may possibly defeat Nature ' s plan and obtain nectar without fertilizing the flower , owing to the wide passage between stamens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning , Professor Charles Robertson captured over six hundred insects , representing thirty-eight distinct species , on a patch of wild hyacinths in Illinois. @# The bulb of a MEDITERRANEAN SCILLA ( S. maritima ) furnishes the sourish-sweet syrup of squills used in medicine for bronchial troubles. @# The GRAPE HYACINTH ( Muscari botrycides ) , also known as Baby ' s Breath , because of its delicate faint fragrance , escapes from gardens at slight encouragement to grow wild in the roadsides and meadows from Massachusetts to Virginia and westward to Ohio . Its tiny , deep-blue , globular flowers , stiffly set around a fleshy scape that rises between erect , blade-like , channeled leaves , appear spring after spring wherever the small bulbs have been planted . On the east end of Long Island there are certain meadows literally blued with the little runaways. @# PURPLE TRILLIUM , ILL-SCENTED WAKE-ROBIN or BIRTH-ROOT ( Trillium erectum ) Lily-of-the-Valley family @# Flowers - Solitary , dark , dull purple , or purplish red ; rarely greenish , white , or pinkish ; on erect or slightly inclined footstalk . Calyx @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long , or about length of 3 pointed , oval petals ; stamens 6 ; anthers longer than filaments ; pistil spreading into 3 short , recurved stigmas . Stem : Stout , 8 to i6 in. high , from tuber-like rootstock . Leaves : In a whorl of 3 ; broadly ovate , abruptly pointed , netted-veined . Fruit : A 6-angled , ovate , reddish berry . Preferred Habitat - Rich , moist woods . Flowering Season - April-June . Distribution - Nova Scotia westward to Manitoba , southward to North Carolina and Missouri. @# Some weeks after the jubilant , alert robins have returned from the South , the purple trillium unfurls its unattractive , carrion-scented flower . In the variable colors found in different regions , one can almost trace its evolution from green , white , and red to purple , which , we are told , is the course all flowers must follow to attain to blue . The white and pink forms , however attractive to the eye , are never more agreeable to the nose than the reddish-purple ones . Bees and butterflies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blossom alone , since it secretes no nectar ; and one would naturally infer either that it can fertilize itself without insect aid - a theory which closer study of its organs goes far to disprove - or that the carrion-scent , so repellent to us , is in itself an attraction to certain insects needful for cross-pollination . Which are they ? Beetles have been observed crawling over the flower , but without effecting any methodical result . One inclines to accept Mr. Clarence M. Weed ' s theory of special adaptation to the common green flesh-flies ( Lucilia carnicina ) , which would naturally be attracted to a flower resembling in color and odor a raw beefsteak of uncertain age . These little creatures , seen in every butcher shop throughout the summer , the flower furnishes with a free lunch of pollen in consideration of the transportation of a few grains to another blossom . Absence of the usual floral attractions gives , the carrion flies a practical monopoly of the pollen food , which no doubt tastes as it smells. @# The SESSILE-FLOWERED WAKE-ROBIN ( T. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greenish blossom , narrower of sepal and petals than the preceding , is seated in a whorl of three egg-shaped , sometimes blotched , leaves , possesses a rather pleasant odor ; nevertheless it seems. to have no great attraction for insects . The stigmas , which are very large , almost touch the anthers surrounding them ; therefore the beetles which one frequently sees crawling over them to feed on the pollen so jar them , no doubt , as to self-fertilize the flower ; but it is scarcely probable these slow crawlers often transfer the grains from one blossom to another . A degraded flower like this has little need of color and perfume , one would suppose ; yet it may be even now slowly perfecting its way toward an ideal of which we see a part only complete . In deep , rich , moist woods and thickets the. sessile trillium blooms in April or May , from Pennsylvania , Ohio , and Minnesota southward nearly to the Gulf. @# LARGER BLUE FLAG ; BLUE IRIS ; FLEUR-DE-LIS ; FLOWER-DE-LUCE ( Iris versicolor ) Iris family @# @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violet-blue variegated with yellow , green , or white , and purple veined . Six divisions of the perianth : 3 outer ones spreading , recurved ; 1 of them bearded , much longer and wider than the 3 erect inner divisions ; all united into a short tube . Three stamens under 3 overhanging petal-like divisions of the style , notched at end ; under each notch is a thin plate , smooth on one side , rough and moist ( stigma ) on side turned away from anther . Stem : 2 to 3 ft. high , stout , straight , almost circular , sometimes branching above . Leaves : Erect , sword-shaped , shorter than stem , somewhat hoary , from 1/2 to 1 in. wide , folded , and in a compact flat cluster at base ; bracts usually longer than stem of flower .

Flowering Season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Florida. @# " The fleur-de-lys , which is the flower of chivalry , " says Ruskin , " has a sword for its leaf and a lily for its heart . " When that young and pious Crusader , Louis VII , adopted it for the emblem of his house , spelling was scarcely an exact science , and the fleur-de-Louis soon became corrupted into its present form . Doubtless the royal flower was the white iris , and as li is the Celtic for white , there is room for another theory as to the origin of the name . It is our far more regal looking , but truly democratic blossom , jostling its fellows in the marshes , that is indeed " born in the purple. " @# When Napoleon wished to pose as the true successor of those ancient French kings whose territory included the half of Europe - ignoring every Louis who ever sat on the throne , for their very name and emblem had become odious to the people - he discarded the fleur-de-lis , to replace it with golden bees , the symbol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some relics of gold and fine stones , somewhat resembling an insect in shape , had been found in the tomb of Clovis ' s father , and on the supposition that these had been bees , Napoleon appropriated them for the imperial badge . Henceforth " Napoleonic bees " appeared on his coronation robe and wherever a heraldic emblem could be employed. @# But even in the meadows of France Napoleon need not have looked far from the fleurs-de-lis growing there to find bees . Indeed , this gorgeous flower is thought by scientists to be all that it is for the bees ' benefit , which , of course , is its own also . Abundant moisture , from which to manufacture nectar - a prime necessity with most irises - certainly is for our blue flag . The large showy blossom can not but attract the passing bee , whose favorite color ( according to Sir John Lubbock ) it waves . The bee alights on the convenient , spreading platform , and , guided by the dark veining and golden lines leading to the nectar , sips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now , as he raises his head and withdraws it from the nectary , he must rub it against the pollen-laden anther above , and some of the pollen necessarily falls on the visitor . As the sticky side of the plate ( stigma ) , just under the petal-like division of the style , faces away from the anther , which is below it in any case , the flower is marvelously guarded against fertilization from its own pollen . The bee , flying off to another iris , must first brush past the projecting lip of the over-arching style , and leave on the stigmatic outer surface of the plate some of the pollen brought from the first flower , before reaching the nectary . Thus cross-fertilization is effected ; and Darwin has shown how necessary this is to insure the most vigorous and beautiful offspring . Without this wonderful adaptation of the flower to the requirements of its insect friends , and of the insect to the needs of the flower , both must perish ; the former from hunger , the latter because unable to perpetuate its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beauties of the floral kingdom as designed for his sole delight @# The name iris , meaning a deified rainbow , which was given this group of plants by the ancients , shows a fine appreciation of their superb coloring , their ethereal texture , and the evanescent beauty of the blossom. @# In spite of the name given to another species , the SOUTHERN BLUE FLAG ( I. hexagona ) is really the larger one ; its leaves , which are bright green , and never hoary , often equaling the stem in its height of from two to three feet . The handsome solitary flower , similar to that of the larger blue flag , nevertheless has its broad outer divisions fully an inch larger , and is seated in the axils at the top of the circular stem . The oblong , cylindric , six-angled capsule also contains two rows of seeds in each cavity . From South Carolina and Florida to Kentucky , Missouri , and Texas one finds this iris blooming in the swamps during April and May. @# The SLENDER BLUE FLAG ( I. prismatica @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Brunswick to North Carolina , but mainly near the coast , and often in the same oozy ground with the larger blue flag , may be known by its grass-like leaves , two or three of which usually branch out from the slender flexuous stem ; by its solitary or two blue flowers , variegated with white and veined with yellow , that rear themselves on slender foot-stems ; and by the sharply three-angled , narrow , oblong capsule , in which but one row of seeds is borne in each cavity . This is the most graceful member of a rather stiffly stately family. @# POINTED BLUE-EYED GRASS ; EYE-BRIGHT ; BLUE STAR ( Sisyrinchium angustifolium ) Iris family @# Flowers - From blue to purple , with a yellow center ; a Western variety , white ; usually several buds at the end of stem , between 2 erect unequal bracts ; about 1/2 in. across ; perianth of 6 spreading divisions , each pointed with a bristle from a notch ; stamens 3 , the filaments united to above the middle ; pistil 1 , its tip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pale hoary green , flat , rigid , 2-edged .

The dainty flower , growing in dense tufts , makes up in numbers what it lacks in size and lasting power , flecking our meadows with purplish ultramarine blue in a sunny June morning . Later in the day , apparently there are no blossoms there , for all are tightly closed , never to bloom again . New buds will unfold to tinge the field on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bracts , the lower one of which may be twice the length of the upper one but only one flower opens at a time . Slight variations in this plant have been considered sufficient to differentiate several species formerly included by Gray and other American botanists under the name of S. Bermudiana. @# LARGE or EARLY , PURPLE-FRINGED ORCHIS ( Habenaria grandiflora ; H. fimbriata of Gray ) Orchid family @# Flowers - Pink-purple and pale lilac , sometimes nearly white ; fragrant , alternate , clustered in thick , dense spikes from 3 to 15 in. long .

Distribution - New Brunswick to Ontario ; southward to North Carolina , westward to Michigan. @# Because of the singular and exquisitely unerring adaptations of orchids as a family to their insect visitors , no group of plants has greater interest for the botanist since Darwin interpreted their marvelous mechanism , and Gray , his instant disciple , revealed the hidden purposes of our native American species , no less wonderfully constructed than the most costly exotic in a millionaire ' s hothouse. @# A glance at the spur of this orchid , one of the handsomest and most striking of its clan , and the heavy perfume of the flower , would seem to indicate that only a moth with a long proboscis could reach the nectar secreted at the base of the thread-like passage . Butterflies , attracted by the conspicuous color , sometimes hover about the showy spikes of bloom , but it is probable that , to secure a sip , all but possibly the very largest of them must go to the smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prospect of reward ; for , in these two cases , as in so many others , the flower ' s welcome for an insect is in exact proportion to the length of its visitor ' s tongue . Doubtless it is one of the smaller sphinx moths , such as we see at dusk working about the evening primrose and other flowers deep of chalice , and heavily perfumed to guide visitors to their feast , that is the great purple-fringed orchid ' s benefactor , since the length of its tongue is perfectly adapted to its needs . Attracted by the showy , broad lower petal , his wings ever in rapid motion , the moth proceeds to unroll his proboscis and drain the cup , that is frequently an inch and a half deep . Thrusting in his head , either one or both of his large , projecting eyes are pressed against the sticky button-shaped disks to which the pollen masses are attached by a stalk , and as he raises his head to depart , feeling that he is caught , he gives a little jerk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still fastened to his eyes. @# Even while he is flying to another flower , that is to say , in half a minute , the stalks of the pollen masses bend downward from the perpendicular and slightly toward the center , or just far enough to require the moth , in thrusting his proboscis into the nectary , to strike the glutinous , sticky stigma . Now , withdrawing his head , either or both of the golden clubs he brought in with him will be left on the precise spot where they will fertilize the flower . Sometimes , but rarely , we catch a butterfly or moth from the smaller or larger purple orchids with a pollen mass attached to his tongue , instead of to his eyes ; this is when he does not make his entrance from the exact center - as in these flowers he is not obliged to do - and in order to reach the nectary his tongue necessarily brushes against one of the sticky anther sacs . The performance may be successfully imitated by thrusting some blunt point about the size of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a knitting-needle , into the flower as an insect would enter . Withdraw the pencil , and one or both of the pollen masses will be found sticking to it , and already automatically changing their attitude . In the case of the large , round-leaved orchis , whose greenish-white flowers are fertilized in a similar manner by the sphinx moth , the anther sacs converge , like little horns ; and their change of attitude while they are being carried to fertilize another flower is quite as exquisitely exact. @# Usually in wetter ground than we find its more beautiful big sister growing in , most frequently in swamps and bogs , the SMALLER PURPLE-FRINGED ORCHIS ( H. psycodes ) lifts its perfumed lilac spires . Thither go the butterflies and long-lipped bees to feast in July and August . Inasmuch as without their aid the orchid must perish from its inability to set fertile seed , no wonder it woos its benefactors with a showy mass of color , charming fringes , sweet perfume , and copious draughts of nectar , and makes their visits of the utmost value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no waste of pollen ; that is snugly packed in little bundles , ready to be carried off , but placed where they can not come in contact with the adjoining stigma , since every orchid , almost without exception , refuses to be deteriorated through self-fertilization. @# From New Jersey and Illinois southward , particularly in mountainous regions , if not among the mountains themselves , the FRINGELESS PURPLE ORCHIS ( H. perarnoena ) may be found blooming in moist meadows through July and August . Moisture , from which to manufacture the nectar that orchids rely upon so largely to entice insects to work for them , is naturally a prime necessity ; yet Sprengel attempted to prove that many orchids are gaudy shams and produce no nectar , but exist by an organized system of deception .

He found that many European orchids secrete their nectar between the outer and inner walls of the tube , which a bumblebee can easily pierce , but where Sprengel never thought to look for it . The large lip of this orchis is not fringed , but has a fine picotee edge .

General characteristics of plant resembling wild columbine . Preferred Habitat - Escaped from gardens to woods and fields in Eastern and Middle States . Native of Europe . Flowering Season - May-July. @# A heavier , less graceful flower than either the wild red and yellow columbine or the exquisite , long-spurred , blue and white species ( A. coerulea ) of the Rocky Mountain region ; nevertheless this European immigrant , now making itself at home here , is a charming addition to our flora .

Muller watched a female bumblebee making several vain attempts to sip this blue one . Soon the brilliant idea of biting a hole through each spur flashed through her little brain , and the first experiment proving delightfully successful , she proceeded to bite holes through other flowers without first trying to suck them . Apparently she satisfied her feminine conscience with the reflection that the flower which made dining so difficult for its benefactors deserved no better treatment. @# FIELD or BRANCHED LARKSPUR ; KNIGHT ' S-SPUR ; LARK-HEEL ( Delphinium Consoilda ) Crowfoot family @# Flowers - Blue to pinkish and whitish , 1 to 1 1/2 in. long , hung on slender stems and scattered along spreading branches ; 5 petal-like sepals , the rear one prolonged into long , slender , curving spur ; 2 petals , united .

No more beautiful group of plants contributes to the charm of gardens , woods , and roadsides , where some have escaped cultivation and become naturalized , than the delphinium , that take their name from a fancied resemblance to a dolphin ( delphin ) , given them by Linnaeus in one of his wild flights of imagination . Having lost the power to fertilize themselves , according to Muller , they are pollenized by both bees and butterflies , insects whose tongues have kept pace with the development of certain flowers , such as the larkspur , columbine , and violet , that they may reach into the deep recesses of the spurs where the nectar is hidden from all but benefactors. @# The TALL WILD LARKSPUR ( D. urceolatum ; D. exaltatum of Gray ) waves long , crowded , downy wands of intense purplish blue in the rich woods of Western Pennsylvania , southward to the Carolinas and Alabama , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not to increase the difficulty a bee must have in pressing his lips through the upper and lower petals to reach the nectar at the end of it . First , the stamens successively raise themselves in the passage back of the petals to dust his head ; then , when each has shed its pollen and bent down again , the pistil takes its turn in occupying the place , so that a pollen-laden bee , coming to visit the blossom from an earlier flower ; can scarcely help fertilizing it . It is said there are but two insects in Europe with lips long enough to reach the bottom of the long horn of plenty hung by the BEE LARKSPUR ( D. elatum ) , that we know only in gardens here . Its yellowish bearded lower petals readily deceive one into thinking a bee has just alighted there. @# From April to June the DWARF LARKSPUR or STAGGER-WEED ( D. tricorne ) , which , however , may sometimes grow three feet high , lifts a loose raceme of blue , rarely white , flowers an inch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stem rising from a tuberous root . Its slightly ascending spur , its three widely spreading seed vessels , and the deeply cut leaf of from five to seven divisions are distinguishing characteristics . From Western Pennsylvania and Georgia to Arkansas and Minnesota it is found in rather stiff soil . Butterflies , which prefer erect flowers , have some difficulty to cling while they drain the almost upright spurs , especially the Papilios , which usually suck with their wings in motion . But the bees , to which the delphinium are best adapted , although butterflies visit them quite as frequently , find a convenient landing place prepared for them , and fertilize the flower while they sip with ease. @# More slender , downy , and dwarf of stem than the preceding is the CAROLINA LARKSPUR ( D. Carolinianum ) , whose blue flowers , varying to white , and its very finely cleft leaves , may be found in the South , on prairies in the North and West , and in the Rocky Mountain region. @# LIVER-LEAF ; HEPATICA ; LIVERWORT ; ROUND-LOBED or KIDNEY LIVER-LEAF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ H. triloba of Gray ) Crowfoot family @# Flowers - Blue , lavender , purple , pinkish , or white ; occasionally , not always , fragrant ; 6 to 12 petal-like , colored sepals ( not petals , as they appear to be ) , oval or oblong ; numerous stamens , all bearing anthers ; pistils numerous 3 small , sessile leaves , forming an involucre directly under flower , simulate a calyx , for which they might be mistaken .

You can not tell which the fragrant ones are till you try them . Sometimes it is the large white ones , sometimes the large purple ones , sometimes the small pink ones . The odor is faint and recalls that of the sweet violets . A correspondent , who seems to have carefully observed these fragrant hepaticas , writes me that this gift of odor is constant in the same plant ; that the plant which bears sweet-scented flowers this year will bear them next.

But pollen-feeding flies , and female hive bees which collect it , and the earliest butterflies trifle about the blossoms when the first warm days come . Whether they are rewarded by finding nectar or not is still a mooted question . Possibly the papillae which cover the receptacle secrete nectar , for almost without exception the insect visitors thrust their proboscides down between the spreading filaments as if certain of a sip . None merely feed on the pollen except the flies and the hive bee. @# The SHARP-LOBED LIVER-LEAF ( Hepatica acuta ) differs chiefly from the preceding in having the ends of the lobes of its leaves and the tips of the three leaflets that form its involucre quite sharply pointed . Its range , while perhaps not actually more westerly , appears so , since it is rare in the East , where its cousin is so abundant ; and common in the West , where the round-lobed liver-leaf is scarce . It blooms in March and April . Professor Halsted has noted that this species bears staminate flowers on one plant and pistillate flowers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of both sexes above the same root . The blossoms , which close at night to keep warm , and open in the morning , remain on the beautiful plant for a long time to accommodate the bees and flies that , in this case , are essential to the perpetuation of the species. @# PURPLE VIRGIN ' S BOWER ( Atragene Americana ) Crowfoot family @# Flowers - Showy , purplish blue , about 3 in. across ; 4 sepals , broadly expanded , thin , translucent , strongly veined , very large , simulating petals ; petals small , spoon-shaped ; stamens very numerous ; styles long , persistent , plumed throughout .

No one who sees this broadly expanded blossom could confuse it either with the thick and bell-shaped purple LEATHER-FLOWER ( C. Viorna ) , so exquisitely feathery in fruit , that grows in rich , moist soil from Pennsylvania southward and westward ; or with the far more graceful and deliciously fragrant purple MARSH CLEMATIS ( C. crispa ) of our Southern States .

Sedere , to sit , the root of the generic name , applies with rare appropriateness to this entire group that we usually find seated on garden walls , rocks , or , in Europe , even on the roofs of old buildings . Rooting freely from the joints , our plant forms thrifty tufts where there is little apparent nourishment ; yet its endurance through prolonged drought is remarkable . Long after the farmer ' s scythe , sweeping over the roadside , has laid it low , it thrives on the juices stored up in fleshy leaves and stem until it proves its title to the most lusty of all folk names. @# PURPLE or WATER AVENS ( Geum rivale ) Rose family @# @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in. broad or less , terminal , solitary , nodding ; calyx 5-lobed , purplish , spreading ; 5 petals , abruptly narrowed into claws , forming a cup-shaped corolla ; stamens and pistils of indefinite number ; the styles , jointed and bent in middle , persistent , feathery below .

Self-fertilization must occur , however , if the bees have not removed all the pollen when a blossom closes . When the purple avens opens in Europe , the bees desert even the primrose to feast upon its abundant nectar . Since water is the prime necessity in the manufacture of this sweet , and since insects that feed upon it have so much to do with the multiplication of flowers , it is not surprising that the swamp , which has been called " nature ' s sanctuary , " should have its altars so exquisitely decked . This blossom hangs its head , partly to protect its precious nectar from rain , and partly to make pilfering well nigh impossible to the unwelcome crawling insect that may have braved the forbidding hairy stems @# WILD LUPINE ; OLD MAID ' S BONNETS ; WILD PEA ; SUN DIAL ( Lupinus perennis ) Pea family @# Flowers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ butterfly-shaped corolla consisting of standard , wings , and keel ; about 1/2 in. long , borne in a long raceme at end of stern ; calyx 2-lipped , deeply toothed .

It spreads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ color of June skies , until , as Thoreau says , " the earth is blued with it. " @# What is the advantage gained in the pea-shaped blossom ? As usual , the insect that fertilizes the flower best knows the answer . The corolla has five petals , the upper one called the standard , chiefly a flaunted advertisement ; two side wings , or platforms , to alight on ; and a keel like a miniature boat , formed by the two lower petals , whose edges meet . In this the pistil , stamens , and nectar are concealed and protected . The pressure of a bee ' s weight as he alights on the wings , light as it must be , is nevertheless sufficient to depress and open the keel , which is elastically affected by their motion , and so to expose the pollen just where the long-lipped bee must rub off some against his underside as he sucks the nectar . He actually seems to pump the pollen that has fallen into the forward part of the keel upon himself , as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the elastic wings resume their former position , thus closing the keel to prevent waste of pollen . Take a sweet pea from the garden , press down its wings with the thumb and forefinger to imitate the action of the bee on them ; note how the keel opens to display its treasures , and resumes its customary shape when the pressure is removed. @# The lupine is another of those interesting plants which go to sleep at night . Some members of the genus erect one half of the leaf and droop the other half until it becomes a vertical instead of the horizontal star it is by day . Frequently the leaflets rotate as much as 90 degrees on their own axes . Some lupines fold their leaflets , not at night only , but during the day also there is more or less movement in the leaves . Sun dial , a popular name for the wild lupine , has reference to this peculiarity . The leaf of our species shuts downward around its stem , umbrella fashion , or the leaflets are erected to prevent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some scientists think .

We know some creep along the ground , or under it , a tortoise pace , but a winning one ; that some send their offspring flying away from home , like dandelions and thistles ; and many others with wings and darts are blown by the wind . Berries have their seeds dropped afar by birds . Aquatic plants and those that grow beside running water travel by river and flood . European species reach our shores among the ballast . Darwin raised over sixty wild plants from seed carried in a pellet of mud taken from the leg of a partridge . So on and so on . The imagination delights to picture these floral vagabonds , each with its own clever method of getting a fresh start in the world . But by none of these methods just mentioned do the tick-trefoils spread abroad . Theirs is indeed a by hook or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the seeds lie concealed , has minute crooked bristles , which catch in the clothing of man or beast , so that every herd of sheep , every dog , every man , woman , or child who passes through a patch of trefoils gives them a lift . After a walk through the woods and lanes of late summer and autumn , one ' s clothes reveal scores of tramps that have stolen a ride in the hope of being picked off and dropped amid better conditions in which to rear a family. @# Only the largest bees can easily " explode " the showy tick-trefoil . A bumblebee alights upon a flower , thrusts his head under the base of the standard petal , and forces apart the wing petals with his legs , in order to dislodge them from the standard . This motion causes the keel , also connected with the standard , to snap down violently , thus releasing the column within and sending upward an explosion of pollen on the under surface of the bee . Here we see the wing petals acting as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flies the fertilizing dust - once . The little gun will not " go off " twice . No nectar rewards the visitor , which usually is a pollen-collecting bee . The highly intelligent and important bumblebee has the advantage over his smaller kin in being able to discharge the pollen from both large and smaller flowers. @# The NAKED-FLOWERED TICK-TREFOIL ( M. nudiflora ; D. nudiflorum of Gray ) lifts narrow , few-flowered panicles of rose-purple blooms during July and August . The flowers are much smaller than those of the showy trefoil ; however , when seen in masses , they form conspicuous patches of color in dry woods . Note that there is a flower stalk which is usually leafless and also a leaf-bearing stem rising from the base of the plant , the latter with its leaves all crowded at the top , if you would distinguish this very common species from its multitudinous kin . The trefoliate leaves are pale beneath . The two or three jointed pod rises far above the calyx on its own stalk , as in the next species. @# The POINTED-LEAVED @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has for its distinguishing feature a cluster of leaves high up on the same stem from which rises a stalk bearing a quantity of purple flowers that are large by comparison only . The leaves have leaflets from two to six inches long , rounded on the sides , but acutely pointed , and with scattered hairs above and below . This trefoil is found blooming in dry or rocky woods , throughout a wide range , from June to September. @# Lying outstretched for two to six feet on the dry ground of open woods and copses east of the Mississippi , the PROSTRATE TICK-TREFOIL ( M. Michauxii ; D. rotundifoliurn of Gray ) can certainly be named by its soft hairiness , the almost perfect roundness of its trefoliate leaves , its rather loose racemes of deep purple flowers that spring both from the leaf axils and from the ends of the sometimes branching stem ; and by its three to five jointed pod , which is deeply scalloped on its lower edge and somewhat indented above , as well. @# BLUE , TUFTED , or COW VETCH or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pea family @# Flowers - Blue , later purple ; 1/2 in. long , growing downward in 1-sided spike , 15 to 40 flowered ; calyx oblique , small , with unequal teeth ; corolla butterfly-shaped , consisting of standard , wings , and keel , all oblong ; the first clawed , the second oblique , and adhering to the shorter keel ; 10 stamens , 1 detached from other 9 .

On his departure they resume their original position , to protect both nectar and pollen from rain and pilferers whose bodies are not perfectly adapted to further the flower ' s cross-fertilization . The common bumblebee ( Bombus terrestris ) plays a mean trick , all too frequently , when he bites a hole at the base of the blossom , not only gaining easy access to the sweets for himself , but opening the way for others less intelligent than he , but quite ready to profit by his mischief , and so defeat nature ' s plan . Dr. Ogle observed that the same bee always acts in the same manner , one sucking the nectar legitimately , another always biting a hole to obtain it surreptitiously , the natural inference , of course , being that some bees , like small boys , are naturally depraved. @# In cultivated fields and waste places farther south and westward to the Pacific Coast roams the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , another domesticated weed that has come to us from Europe , where it is extensively grown for fodder . Let no reproach fall on these innocent plants that bear an opprobrious name : the tare of Scripture is altogether different , the bearded darnel of Mediterranean regions , whose leaves deceive one by simulating those of wheat , and whose smaller seeds , instead of nourishing man , poison him . Only one or two light blue-purple flowers grow in the axils of the leaves of our common vetch . The leaf , compounded of from eight to fourteen leaflets , indented at the top , has a long terminal tendril , whose little sharp tip assists the awkward vine , like a grappling hook. @# The AMERICAN VETCH or TARE or PEA VINE ( V.

Distribution - New Jersey to Arctic Circle ; also Northern Europe and Asia. @# Sturdy clumps of the beach pea , growing beyond reach of the tide in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afford the bee the last restaurant where he may regale himself without fear of drowning . From some members of the pea family , as from the wild lupine , for example , his weight , as he moves about , actually pumps the pollen that has fallen into the forward part of the blossom ' s keel onto his body , that he may transfer it to another flower . In some other members his weight so depresses the keel that the stamens are forced out to dust him over , the flower resuming its original position to protect its nectar and the remaining pollen just as soon as the pressure is removed . Other peas , again , burst at his pressure , and discharge their pollen on him . Now , in the beach pea , and similarly in the vetches , the style is hairy on its inner side , to brush out the pollen on the visitor who sets the automatic sweeper in motion as he alights and moves about . So perfectly have many members of this interesting family adapted their structure to the requirements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their automatic mechanism , that they have actually lost the power to fertilize themselves. @# In moist or wet ground throughout a northern range from ocean to ocean , the MARSH VETCHLING ( Lathyrus palustris ) bears its purple , butterfly-shaped flowers , that are the merest trifle over half the size of those of the beach pea . From two to six of these little blossoms are alternately set along the end of the stalk .

Why should the same plant bear two kinds of blossoms and seeds ? Among the foliage of low shrubbery and plants in shady lanes and woodside thickets , we see the delicate , drooping clusters of lilac blossoms hanging where bees can readily discover them and , in pilfering their sweets , transfer their pollen from flower to flower . But in case of failure to intercross these blossoms that are dependent upon insect help to set fertile seed , what then ? Must the plant run the risk of extinction ? Self-fertilization may be an evil , but failure to produce seed at all is surely the greatest one . To guard against such a calamity , insignificant looking flowers that have no petals to open for the enticing of insects , but which fertilize themselves with their own pollen , produce abundant seed close to the ground or under it . Then what need of the showy blossoms hanging in the thicket above ? Close inbreeding in the vegetable world , as in the animal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lilac blossoms of the wild peanut yield comparatively few cross-fertilized seeds , these are quite sufficient to enable the vine to maintain those desired features which are the inheritance from ancestors that struggled in their day and generation after perfection . No plant dares depend upon its cleistogamous or blind flowers alone for offspring ; and in the sixty or more genera containing these curious growths , that usually look like buds arrested in development , every plant that bears them bears also showy flowers dependent upon cross-pollination by insect aid. @# The boy who @# " Drives home the cows from the pasture Up through the long shady lane " @# knows how reluctantly they leave the feast afforded by the wild peanut . Hogs , rooting about in the moist soil where it grows , unearth the hairy pods that should produce next year ' s vines ; hence the poor excuse for branding a charming plant with a repellent folk-name , @# VIOLETS ( Viola ) Violet family @# Lacking perfume only to be a perfectly satisfying flower , the COMMON , PURPLE , MEADOW , or HOODED @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) has nevertheless established itself in the hearts of the people from the Arctic to the Gulf as no sweet-scented , showy , hothouse exotic has ever done . Royal in color as in lavish profusion , it blossoms everywhere - in woods , waysides , meadows , and marshes , but always in finer form in cool , shady dells ; with longer flowering scapes in meadow bogs ; and with longer leaves than wide in swampy woodlands . The heart-shaped , saw-edged leaves , folded toward the center when newly put forth , and the five-petalled , bluish-purple , golden-hearted blossom are too familiar for more detailed description . From the three-cornered stars of the elastic capsules , the seeds are scattered abroad. @# Beards on the spurred lower petal and the two side petals give the bees a foothold when they turn head downward , as some must , to suck nectar . This attitude enables them to receive the pollen dusted on their abdomens , when they jar the flower , at a point nearest their pollen-collecting hairs . It is also an economical advantage to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of exposing it to the pollen-eating interlopers . Among the latter may be classed the bumblebees and butterflies whose long lips and tongues pilfer ad libitum . " For the proper visitors of the bearded violets , " says Professor Robertson , " we must look to the small bees , among which the Osmias are the most important. " @# When science was younger and hair splitting an uncommon indulgence of botanists , the EARLY BLUE VIOLET ( Viola palmata ) was thought to be simply a variety of the common purple violet , whose heart-shaped leaves frequently show a tendency to divide into lobes . But the early blue violet , however roundish or heart-shaped its early leaves may be , has the later ones variously divided into from three to thirteen lobes , often almost as much cut on the sides as the leaves of the bird ' s-foot violet . In dry soil , chiefly in the woods , this violet may be found from Southern Canada westward to Minnesota , and south to northern boundaries of the Gulf States . Only its side petals are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deeply secreted nectar . Many butterflies visit this flower . On entering it a bee must first touch the stigma before any fresh golden pollen is released from the anther cone , and cross-fertilization naturally results. @# In shale and sandy soil , even in the gravel of hillsides , one finds the narrowly divided , finely cut leaves and the bicolored beardless blossom of the BIRD ' S-FOOT VIOLET ( V. pedata ) , pale bluish purple on the lower petals , dark purple on one or two upper ones , and with a heart of gold . The large , velvety , pansy-like blossom and the unusual foliage which rises in rather dense tufts are sufficient to distinguish the plant from its numerous kin . This species produces no cleistogamous or blind flowers . Frequently the bird ' s-foot violet blooms a second time , in autumn , a delightful eccentricity of this family . The spur of its lower petal is long and very slender , and , as might be expected , the longest-tongued bees and butterflies are its most frequent visitors . These receive the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BLUE VIOLET ( V. sororia ) , whose stems and younger leaves , at least , are covered with hairs , and whose purplish-blue flowers are more or less bearded within , prefers a shady but dry situation ; whereas its next of kin , the ARROW-LEAVED VIOLET ( V. sagittata ) , delights in moist but open meadows and marshes . The latter ' s long , arrow , or halberd-shaped leaves , usually entire above the middle , but slightly lobed below it , may rear themselves nine inches high in favorable soil , or in dry uplands perhaps only two inches . The flowering scapes grow as tall as the leaves . All but the lower petal of the large , deep , dark , purplish-blue flower are bearded . This species produces an abundance of late cleistogamous flowers on erect stems . These peculiar greenish flowers without petals , that are so often mistaken for buds or seed vessels ; that never open , but without insect aid ripen quantities of fertile seed , are usually borne , if not actually under ground , then not far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be observed that all species which bear blind flowers rely somewhat on showy , cross-fertilized blossoms also to counteract degeneracy from close inbreeding. @# The OVATE-LEAVED VIOLET ( V. ovata ) , formerly reckoned as a mere variety of the former species , is now accorded a distinct rank . Not all the blossoms , but an occasional clump , has a faint perfume like sweet clover . The leaf is elongated , but rather too round to be halberd-shaped ; the stems are hairy ; and the flowers , which closely resemble those of the arrow-leaved violet , are earlier ; making these two species , which are popularly mistaken for one , among the earliest and commonest of their clan . The dry soil of upland woods and thickets is the ovate-leaved violet ' s preferred habitat. @# In course of time the lovely ENGLISH , MARCH , or SWEET VIOLET , ( V. odorata ) , which has escaped from gardens , and which is now rapidly increasing with the help of seed and runners on the Atlantic and the Pacific coasts , may be established among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ European literature . In France , it has even entered the political field since Napoleon ' s day . Yale University has adopted the violet for its own especial flower , although it is the corn-flower , or bachelor ' s button ( Centaurea cyanus ) that is the true Yale blue . Sprengel , who made a most elaborate study of the violet , condensed the result of his research into the following questions and answers , which are given here because much that he says applies to our own native species , which have been too little studied in the modern scientific spirit : @# " 1 . Why is the flower situated on a long stalk which is upright , but curved downwards at the free end ? In order that it may hang down ; which , firstly , prevents rain from obtaining access to the nectar ; and , secondly , places the stamens in such a position that the pollen falls into the open space between the pistil and the free ends of the stamens . If the flower were upright , the pollen would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the base of the pistil , and would not come in contact with the bee. @# " 2 . Why does the pollen differ from that of most other insect-fertilized flowers ? In most of such flowers the insects themselves remove the pollen from the anthers , and it is therefore important that the pollen should not easily be detached and carried away by the wind . In the present case , on the contrary , it is desirable that it should be looser and dryer , so that it may easily fall into the space between the stamens and the pistil . If it remained attached to the anther , it would not be touched by the bee , and the flower would remain unfertilized. @# " 3 . Why is the base of the style so thin ? In order that the bee may be more easily able to bend the style. @# " 4 . Why is the base of the style bent ? For the same reason . The result of the curvature is that the pistil is much more easily bent than would be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finally , why does the membranous termination of the upper filament overlap the corresponding portions of the two middle stamens ? Because this enables the bee to move the pistil , and thereby to set free the pollen more easily than would be the case under the reverse arrangement. " @# In high altitudes of New England , Colorado. and northward , where the soil is wet and cold , the pale lilac , slightly bearded petals , streaked with darker veins , of the MARSH VIOLET ( V. palustris ) , with its almost round leaves , may be found from May to June . All through the White Mountains one finds it abundant. @# A peculiarity of the DOG or RUNNING VIOLET ( V. Labradorica ) is that its small , heart-shaped leaves are set along the branching stem , and its pale purple blossoms rise from their angles , pansy fashion . From March to May it blooms throughout its wide range in wet , shady places . Its English prototype , called by the same invidious name , was given the prefix " dog , " because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the British mind , is applied in this case for the flower ' s lack of fragrance . When a bee visits this violet , his head coming in contact with the stigma jars it , thus opening the little pollen box , whose contents must fall out on his head and be carried away and rubbed off where it will fertilize the next violet visited. @# SEA LAVENDER ; MARSH ROSEMARY ; CANKER-ROOT ; INK-ROOT ( Limonium Carolinianum ; Statice Limonium of Gray ) Plumbago family @# Flowers - Very tiny , pale , dull lavender , erect , set along upper side of branches .

Thrifty housewives along the coast dry it for winter bouquets , partly for ornament and partly because there is an old wives ' tradition that it keeps away moths . Statice , from the Greek verb to stop , hence an astringent , was the generic name formerly applied to the plants , with whose roots these same old women believed they cured canker sores. @# FRINGED GENTIAN ( Gentiana crinita ) Gentian family @# Flowers - Deep , bright blue , rarely white , several or many , about 2 in. high , stiffly erect , and solitary at ends of very long foot-stalk .

" @# When we come upon a bed of gentians on some sparkling October day , we can but repeat Bryant ' s thoughts and express them prosaically who attempt description . In dark weather this sunshine lover remains shut , to protect its nectar and pollen from possible showers . An elusive plant is this gentian , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after year , for it is an annual whose seeds alone perpetuate it . Seating themselves on the winds when autumn gales shake them from out of the home wall , these little hairy scales ride afar , and those that are so fortunate as to strike into soft , moist soil at the end of the journey , germinate . Because this flower is so rarely beautiful that few can resist the temptation of picking it , it is becoming sadly rare near large settlements. @# The special importance of producing a quantity of fertile seed has led the gentians to adopt proterandry - one of the commonest , because most successful , methods of insuring it . The anthers , coming to maturity early , shed their pollen on the bumblebees that have been first attracted by their favorite color and the enticing fringes before they crawl half way down the tube where they can reach the nectar secreted in the walls . After the pollen has been carried from the early flowers , and the stamens begin to wither , up rises the pistil to be fertilized with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or butterfly . The late development of the pistil accounts for the error often stated , that some gentians have none . No doubt the fringe , which most scientists regard simply as an additional attraction for winged insects , serves a double purpose in entangling the feet of ants and other crawlers that would climb over the edge to pilfer sweets clearly intended for the bumblebee alone. @# Fifteen species of gentian have been gathered during a half-hour walk in Switzerland , where the pastures are spread with sheets of blue . Indeed , one can little realize the beauty of these heavenly flowers who has not seen them among the Alps. @# The FIVE-FLOWERED or STIFF GENTIAN , or AGUE-WEED ( Gentiana quinquefolia ; G. quinqueflora of Gray ) has its five-parted , small , picotee-edged blue flowers arranged in clusters , not exceeding seven , at the ends of the branches or seated in the leaf-axils . The slender , branching , ridged stem may rise only two inches in dry soil ; or perhaps two feet in rich , moist , rocky ground , where it grows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Florida and westward to Missouri is its range , and beginning to bloom in August southward , it may not be found until September in the Catskills , and in October it is still in its glory in Ontario . The colorless , bitter juice of many of the gentian tribe has long been valued as a tonic in medicine . Evidently the butterflies that pilfer this " ague-weed , " and the bees that are its legitimate feasters , find something more delectable in its blue walls. @# A deep , intense blue is the CLOSED , BLIND , or BOTTLE GENTIAN ( G. Andrewsii ) , more truly the color of the " male bluebird ' s back , " to which Thoreau likened the paler fringed gentian . Rarely some degenerate plant bears white flowers . As it is a perennial , we are likely to find it in its old haunts year after year ; nevertheless its winged seeds sail far abroad to seek pastures new . This gentian also shows a preference for moist soil . Gray thought that it expanded slightly , and for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although it is proterandrous , i. e. it matures and sheds its pollen before its stigma is susceptible to any , he believed it finally fertilized itself by the lobes of the stigma curling backward until they touched the anthers . But Gray was doubtless mistaken . Several authorities have recently proved that the flower is adapted to bumblebees . It offers them the last feast of the season , for although it comes into bloom in August southward , farther northward - and it extends from Quebec to the Northwest Territory - it lasts through October. @# Now , how can a bumblebee enter this inhospitable-looking flower ? If he did but know it , it keeps closed for his special benefit , having no fringes or hairs to entangle the feet of crawling pilferers , and no better way of protecting its nectar from rain and marauding butterflies that are not adapted to its needs . But he is a powerful fellow . Watch him alight on a cluster of blossoms , select the younger , nectar-bearing ones , that are distinctly marked white against a light-blue background @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Old flowers from which the nectar has been removed turn deep reddish purple , and the white pathfinders become indistinct . With some difficulty , it is true , the bumblebee ( B. Americanorum ) thrusts his tongue through the valve of the chosen flower where the five plaited lobes overlap one another ; then he pushes with all his might until his head having passed the entrance most of his body follows , leaving only his hind legs and the tip of his abdomen sticking out as he makes the circuit . He has much sense as well as muscle , and does not risk imprisonment in what must prove a tomb by a total and unnecessary disappearance within the bottle . Presently he backs out , brushes the pollen from his head and thorax into his baskets , and is off to fertilize an older , stigmatic flower with the few grains of quickening dust that must remain on his velvety head. @# WILD BLUE PHLOX ( Phlox divaricata ) Phlox family @# Flowers - Pale lilac blue , slightly fragrant , borne on sticky pedicels , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharp teeth . Corolla of 5 flat lobes , indented like the top of a heart , and united into a slender tube ; 5 unequal , straight , short stamens in corolla tube ; 1 pistil with 3 stigmas .

Leaves : Of flowering stem - opposite , oblong , tapering to a point ; of sterile shoots - oblong or egg-shaped , not pointed , 1 to 2 in. long . Preferred habitat - Moist , rocky woods . Flowering Season - April-June . Distribution - Eastern Canada to Florida , Minnesota to Arkansas. @# The merest novice can have no difficulty in naming the flower whose wild and cultivated relations abound throughout North America , the almost exclusive home of the genus , although it is to European horticulturists , as usual the first to see the possibilities in our native flowers , that we owe the gay hybrids in our gardens . Mr. Drummond , a collector from the Botanical Society of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a species from Texas , which became the ancestor of the gorgeous annuals , the Drummond phloxes of commerce today ; and although he died of fever in Cuba before the plants became generally known , not even his kinsman , the author of " Natural Law in the Spiritual World , " has done more to immortalize the family name. @# While the wild blue phlox is sometimes cultivated , it is the GARDEN PHLOX ( P. paniculata ) , common in woods and thickets from Pennsylvania to Illinois and southward , that under a gardener ' s care bears the large terminal clusters of purple , magenta , crimson , pink , and white flowers abundant in old-fashioned , hardy borders . From these it has escaped so freely in many sections of the North and East as to be counted among the local wildflowers . Unless the young offshoots are separated from the parent and given a nook of their own , the flower quickly reverts to the original type . European cultivators claim that the most brilliant colors are obtained by crossing annual with perennial phloxes. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perennial much sought by cultivators , loves the moisture of low woods and the neighborhood of streams in the Middle and Western States when it is free to choose its habitat ; but it , too , has so freely escaped from gardens farther north into dry and dusty roadsides , that anyone who has passed the ruins of Hawthorne ' s little red cottage at Lenox , for example , and seen the way his wife ' s clump of white phlox under his study window has spread to cover an acre of hillside , would suppose it to be luxuriating in its favorite locality . This variety of the species ( var . Candida ) lacks the purplish flecks on stem and lower leaves responsible for the specific name of the type . Pinkish purple or pink blossoms are borne in a rather narrow , elongated panicle on the typical Sweet William. @# Most members of the phlox family resort to the trick of coating the upper stem and the peduncles immediately below the flowers with a sticky secretion in which crawling insects , intent on pilfering sweets , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limed twigs . Butterflies , for whom phloxes have narrowed their tubes to the exclusion of most other insects , are their benefactors ; but long-tongued bees and flies often seek their nectar . Indeed , the number of strictly butterfly-flowers is surprisingly small. @# VIRGINIA COWSLIP ; TREE or SMOOTH LUNGWORT ; BLUE-BELLS ( Mertensia Virginica ) Borage family @# Flowers - Pinkish in bud , afterward purplish blue , fading to light blue ; about 1 in. long , tubular , funnel form , the tube of corolla not crested ; spreading or hanging on slender pedicels in showy , loose clusters at end of smooth stem from 1 to 2 ft. high ; stamens 5 , inserted on corolla ; 1 pistil ; ovary of 4 divisions . Leaves : Large , entire , alternate , veiny , oblong or obovate , the upper ones seated on stem ; lower very large ones diminishing toward base into long petioles ; at first rich , dark purple , afterward pale bluish gray .

Distribution - Southern Canada to South Carolina and Kansas , west to Nebraska ; most abundant in middle West. @# Not to be outdone by its cousins the heliotrope and the forget-me-not , this lovely and far more showy spring flower has found its way into the rockwork and sheltered , moist nooks of many gardens , especially in England , where Mr. W. Robinson , who has appealed for its wider cultivation in that perennially charming book , " The English Flower Garden , " says of the Mertensias : " There is something about them more beautiful in form of foliage and stem , and in the graceful way in which they rise to panicles of blue , than in almost any other family . . . . Handsomest of all is the Virginia cowslip . " And yet Robinson never saw the alluvial meadows in the Ohio Valley blued with lovely masses of the plant in April. @# A great variety of insects visit this blossom , which , being tubular , conducts them straight to the ample feast ; but not until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stigma in their way . The anthers are too widely separated from the stigma to make self-fertilization likely . Occasionally one finds the cowslips perforated by clever bumblebees . As only the females , which are able to sip far deeper cups , are flying when they bloom , they must be either too mischievous or too lazy to drain them in the legitimate manner . Butterflies have only to stand on a flower , not to enter it , in order to sip nectar from the four glands that secrete it abundantly. @# FORGET-ME-NOT ; MOUSE-EAR ; SCORPION GRASS ; SNAKE GRASS ; LOVE ME ( Myosotis Palustris ) Borage family @# Flowers - Pure blue , pinkish , or white , with yellow eye ; flat , 5-lobed , borne in many-flowered , long , often 1-sided racemes .

" @# Tennyson thus ignores the melancholy association of the flower in the popular legend which tells how a lover , when trying to gather some of these blossoms for his sweetheart , fell into a deep pool , and threw a bunch on the bank , calling out , as he sank forever from her sight , " Forget me not .

Happiest of all is the folk-tale of the Persians ; as told by their poet Shiraz : " It was in the golden morning of the early world , when an angel sat weeping outside the closed gates of Paradise . He had fallen from his high estate through loving a daughter of earth , nor was he permitted to enter again until she whom he loved had planted the flowers of the forget-me-not in every corner of the world . He returned to earth and assisted her , and together they went hand in hand . When their task was ended , they entered Paradise together , for the fair woman , without tasting the bitterness of death , became immortal like the angel whose love her beauty had won when she sat by the river twining forget-me-nots in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forget-me-not ' s center that first led Sprengel to believe the conspicuous from rain , and indicates to the fly or bee just where it must probe between stigma and anthers to touch them with opposite sides of its tongue . Since it may probe from any point of the circle , it is quite likely that the side of the tongue that touched a pollen-laden anther in one flower will touch the stigma in the next one visited , and so cross-fertilize it . But forget-me-nots are not wholly dependent on insects . When these fail , a fully mature flower is still able to set fertile seed by shedding its own pollen directly on the stigma. @# The SMALLER FORGET-ME-NOT ( M. laxa ) , formerly accounted a mere variety of palustris , but now defined as a distinct species , is a native , and therefore may serve to show how its European relative here will deteriorate in the dryer atmosphere of the New World .

Distribution - New Brunswick to Virginia , westward to Nebraska ; Europe and Asia. @# In England , from whose gardens this plant escaped long ago , a war of extermination that has been waged against the vigorous , beautiful weed by the farmers has at last driven it to the extremity of the island , where a few stragglers about Penzance testify to the vanquishing of what must once have been a mighty army . From England a few refugees reached here in i683 , no one knows how ; but they proved to be the vanguard of an aggressive and victorious host that quickly overran our open , hospitable country , as if to give vent to revenge for long years of persecution at the hands of Europeans . " It is a fact that all our more pernicious weeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says . John Burroughs . " . . . Perhaps the most notable thing about them , when compared with our native species , is their persistence , not to say pugnacity . They fight for the soil ; they plant colonies here and there , and will not be rooted out . Our native weeds are for the most part shy and harmless , and retreat before civilization . . . . We have hardly a weed we can call our own. " @# Years ago , when simple folk believed God had marked plants with some sign to indicate the special use for which each was intended , they regarded the spotted stem of the bugloss , and its seeds shaped like a serpent ' s head , as certain indications that the herb would cure snake bites . Indeed , the genus takes its name from Echis , the Greek for viper. @# Because it is showy and offers accessible nectar , a great variety of insects visit the blue-weed ; Muller alone observed sixty-seven species about it . We need no longer wonder at its fertility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while the other four project and form a convenient alighting place for visitors , which necessarily dust their under sides with pollen as they enter ; for the red anthers were already ripe when the flower opened . Then , however , the short , immature pistil was kept below . After the stamens have shed their pollen and there can be no longer danger of self-fertilization , it gradually elongates itself beyond the point occupied by them , and divides into two little horns whose stigmatic surfaces an incoming pollen-laden insect can not well fail to strike against . Cross-pollination is so thoroughly secured in this case that the plant has completely lost the power of fertilizing itself . Unwelcome visitors like ants , which would pilfer nectar without rendering any useful service in return , are warded off by the bristly , hairy foliage . Several kinds of female bees seek the bugloss exclusively for food for their larvae as well as for themselves , sweeping up the abundant pollen with their abdominal brushes as they feast without effort. @# BLUE VERVAIN ; WILD HYSSOP ; SIMPLER ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Very small , purplish blue , in numerous slender , erect , compact spikes .

Distribution - United States and Canada in almost every part. @# Seeds below , a circle of insignificant purple-blue flowers in the center , and buds at the top of the vervain ' s slender spires do not produce a striking effect , yet this common plant certainly does not lack beauty . John Burroughs , ever ready to say a kindly , appreciative word for any weed , speaks of its drooping , knotted threads , that " make a pretty etching upon the winter snow . " Bees , the vervain ' s benefactors , are usually seen clinging to the blooming spikes , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s joy from its European sister , the flower has also appropriated much of the tradition and folk-lore centered about that plant which herb-gatherers , or simplers , truly delighted to see , since none was once more salable. @# EUROPEAN VERVAIN ( V. officinalis ) HERB-OF-THE-CROSS , BERBINE , HOLY-HERB , ENCHANTER ' S PLANT , JUNO ' S TEARS , PIGEON-GRASS , LIGHTNING PLANT , SIMPLER ' S JOY , and so on through a long list of popular names for the most part testifying to the plant ' s virtue as a love-philter , bridal token , and general cure-all , has now become naturalized from the Old World on the Atlantic and Pacific Slopes ; and is rapidly appropriating waste arid cultivated ground until , in many places , it is truly troublesome . In general habit like the blue vervain , its flowers are more purplish than blue , and are scattered , not crowded , along the spikes . The leaves are deeply , but less acutely , cut. @# Ages before Christians ascribed healing virtues to the vervain - found growing on Mount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , according to the logic of simple peasant folk - the Druids had counted it among their sacred plants . " When the dog-star arose from unsunned spots " the priests gathered it . Did not Shakespeare ' s witches learn some of their uncanny rites from these reverend men of old ? One is impressed with the striking similarity of many customs recorded of both . Two of the most frequently used ingredients in witches ' cauldrons were the vervain and the rue . " The former probably derived its notoriety from the fact of its being sacred to Thor , an honor which marked it out , like other lightning plants , as peculiarly adapted for occult uses , " says Mr. Thiselton Dyer in his " Folk-lore of Plants . " " Although vervain , therefore , as the enchanter ' s plant , was gathered by witches to do mischief in their incantations , yet , as Aubrey says , it ' hinders witches from their will , ' a circumstance to which Drayton further refers when he speaks of the vervain as ' ' gainst witchcraft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children of Shakespeare ' s time hung vervain and dill with a horseshoe over the door. @# In his eighth Eclogue , Virgil refers to vervain as a charm to recover lost love . Doubtless this was the verbena , the herba sacra employed in ancient Roman sacrifices , according to Pliny . In his day the bridal wreath was of verbena , gathered by the bride herself. @# NARROW-LEAVED VERVAIN ( V. angustifolia ) , like the blue vervain , has a densely crowded spike of tiny purple or blue flowers that quickly give place to seeds , but usually there is only one spike at the end of a branch . The leaves are narrow , lance-shaped , acute , saw-edged , rough . From Massachusetts and Florida westward to Minnesota and Arkansas one finds the plant blooming in dry fields from June to August , after the parsimonious manner of the vervain tribe. @# It is curious that the vervain , or verbena , employed by brides for centuries as the emblem of chastity , should be one of the notorious botanical examples of a willful hybrid . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but verbenas are often difficult to name correctly in every case because of their susceptibility to each other ' s pollen - the reason why the garden verbena may so easily be made to blossom forth into whatever hue the gardener wills . His plants have been obtained , for the most part , from the large-flowered verbena , the beautiful purple , blue , or white species of our Western States ( V. Canadensis ) crossed with brilliant-hued species imported from South America. @# MAD-DOG SKULLCAP or HELMET-FLOWER ; MAD-WEED ; HOODWORT ( Scutellaria lateriflora ) Mint family @# Flowers - Blue , varying to whitish ; several or many , 1/4 in. long , growing in axils of upper leaves or in 1-sided spike-like racemes . Calyx 2-lipped , the upper lip with a helmet-like protuberance ; corolla 2-lipped ; the lower , 3-lobed lip spreading ; the middle lobe larger than the side ones . Stamens , 4 , in pairs , under the upper lip ; upper pair the shorter ; one pistil , the style unequally cleft in two . Stem : Square , smooth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high . Leaves : Opposite , oblong to lance-shaped , thin , toothed , on slender pedicles , 1 to 3 in. long , growing gradually smaller toward top of stem . Fruit : 4 nutlets . Preferred Habitat - Wet , shady ground . Flowering Season - July-September . Distribution - Uneven throughout United States and the British Possessions. @# By the helmet-like appendage on the upper lip of the calyx , which to the imaginative mind of Linnaeus suggested Scutellum ( a little dish ) , which children delight to spring open for a view of the four tiny seeds attached at the base when in fruit , one knows this to be a member of the skullcap tribe , a widely scattered genus of blue and violet two-lipped flowers , some small to the point of insignificance , like the present species , others showy enough for the garden , but all rich in nectar , and eagerly sought by bees . The wide middle lobe of the lower lip forms a convenient platform on which to alight ; the stamens in the roof of a newly opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nectary ; and as the stamens of an older flower wither when they have shed their pollen , and the style then rises to occupy their position , it follows that , in flying from the top of one spike of flowers to the bottom of another , where the older ones are , the visitor , for whom the whole scheme of color , form , and arrangement was planned , deposits on the sticky top of the style some of the pollen he has brought with him and so cross-fertilizes the flower . When the seeds begin to form and the now useless corolla drops off , the helmet-like appendage on the top of the calyx enlarges and meets the lower lip , so enclosing and protecting the tiny nutlets . After their maturity , either the mouth gapes from dryness , or the appendage drops off altogether , from the same cause , to release the seeds . Old herb doctors , who professed to cure hydrophobia with this species , are responsible for its English misnomer. @# Perhaps the most beautiful member of the genus is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corolla , an inch long , has its narrow upper lip shorter than the spreading lower one . The flowers are set opposite each other at the end of the smooth stem , which rises from one to two feet high in the woods throughout a southerly and westerly range . As several other skullcaps have distinctly saw-edged leaves , this plant might have been given a more distinctive adjective , thinks one who did not have the naming of 200 , 000 species ! @# Above dry , sandy soil from New York and Michigan southward the HAIRY SKULLCAP ( S. pilosa ) lifts short racemes of blue flowers that are only half an inch long , and whose lower lip and lobes at either side are shorter than the arched upper lip . Most parts of the plant are covered with down , the lower stem being especially hairy ; and this fact determines the species when connected with its rather distant pairs of indented , veiny leaves , ranging from oblong to egg-shaped , and furnished with petioles which grow gradually shorter toward the top , where pairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let the flowers spring from their axils. @# The LARGER or HYSSOP SKULLCAP ( S. integrifolia ) rarely has a dent in its rounded oblong leaves , which , like the stem , are covered with fine down . Its lovely , bright blue flowers , an inch long , the lips of about equal length , are grouped opposite each other at the top of a stem that never lifts them higher than two feet ; and so their beauty is often concealed in the tall grass of roadsides and meadows and the undergrowth of woods and thickets , where they bloom from May to August , from southern New England to the Gulf of Mexico , westward to Texas. @# This tribe of plants is almost exclusively North American , but the hardy MARSH SKULLCAP or HOODED WILLOW-HERB ( S. galericulata ) , at least , roams over Europe , and Asia also , with the help of runners , as well as seeds that , sinking into the soft earth of swamps and the borders of brooks , find growth easy . The blue flowers which grow singly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long as those of the larger and the showy skullcaps ; the oblong , lance-shaped leaves , which are mostly seated on the branching stem , opposite each other , have low teeth . Why do leaves vary as they do , especially in closely allied species ? " The causes which have led to the different forms of leaves have been , so far as I know , " says Sir John Lubbock , " explained in very few cases : those of the shapes and structure of seeds are tolerably obvious in some species , but in the majority they are still entirely unexplained ; and , even as regards the blossoms themselves , in spite of the numerous and conscientious labors of so many eminent naturalists , there is as yet no single species thoroughly known to us. " @# GROUND IVY or JOY ; GILL-OVER-THE-GROUND ; FIELD BALM ; CREEPING CHARLIE ( Glecoma hederacea ; Nepeta Glechoma of Gray ) Mint family @# Flowers - Light bluish purple , dotted with small specks of reddish violet ; growing singly or in clusters along stem , seated in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; corolla tubular , over 1/2 in. long , 2-lipped , the upper lip 2-lobed , lower lip with 3 spreading lobes , middle one largest ; 4 stamens in pairs under upper lip ; the anther sacs spreading ; pistil with 2-lobed style . Stem : Trailing , rooting at intervals , sometimes 18 in. long , leafy , the branches ascending . Leaves : From 1/2 to 1 1/2 in. across ; smooth , rounded , kidney-shaped , scallop-edged . Preferred Habitat - Waste places , shady ground . Flowering Season - March-May . Distribution - Eastern half of Canada and the United States , from Georgia and Kansas northward. @# Besides the larger flowers , containing both stamens and pistils , borne on this little immigrant , smaller female flowers , containing a pistil only , occur just as they do in thyme , mint , marjoram , and doubtless other members of the great family to which all belong . Muller attempted to prove that these small flowers , being the least showy , are the last to be visited by insects , which , having previously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flowers when they first open , are in a condition to make cross-fertilization certain . So much for the small flower ' s method of making insects serve its end ; the larger flowers have another way . At first they are male ; that is , the pistil is as yet undeveloped and the four stamens are mature , ready to shed pollen on any insect alighting on the lip . Later , when the stamens are past maturity , the pistil elongates itself and is ready for the reception of pollen brought from younger flowers . Many blossoms are male on the first day of opening , and female later , to protect themselves against self-fertilization. @# In Europe , where the aromatic leaves of this little creeper were long ago used for fermenting and clarifying beer , it is known by such names as ale-hoof and gill ale-gill , it is said , being derived from the old French word , guiller , to ferment or make merry . Having trailed across Europe , the persistent hardy plant is now creeping its way over our continent , much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a single leaf caught up in a mouthful of herbage. @# Very closely allied to the ground ivy is the CATMINT or CATNIP ( Nepela Cataria ) , whose pale-purple , or nearly white flowers , dark-spotted , may be most easily named by crushing the coarsely toothed leaves in one ' s hand . It is curious how cats will seek out this hoary-hairy plant in the waste places where it grows and become half-crazed with delight over its aromatic odor. @# SELF-HEAL ; HEAL-ALL ; BLUE CURLS ; HEART-OF-THE-EARTH ; BRUNELLA ( Prunella vulgaris ) Mint family @# Flowers - Purple and violet , in dense spikes , somewhat resembling a clover head ; from 1/2 to 1 in. long in flower , becoming 4 times the length in fruit .

Fruit : 4 nutlets , round and smooth . Preferred Habitat - Fields , roadsides , waste places . Flowering Season - May-October . Distribution - North America , Europe , Asia. @# This humble , rusty green plant , weakly lopping over the surrounding grass , so that often only its insignificant purple , clover-like flower heads are visible , is another of those immigrants from the old countries which , having proved fittest in the fiercer struggle for existence there , has soon after its introduction here exceeded most of our more favored native flowers in numbers . Everywhere we find the heal-all , sometimes dusty and stunted by the roadside , sometimes truly beautiful in its fresh purple , violet , and white when perfectly developed under happy conditions . In England , where most flowers are deeper hued than with us , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this flower ' s successful march across three continents ? As usual , the chief reason is to be found in the facility it offers insects to secure food ; and the quantity of fertile seed it is therefore able to ripen as the result of their visits is its reward . Also , its flowering season is unusually long , and it is a tireless bloomer . It is finical in no respect ; its sprawling stems root easily at the joints , and it is very hardy. @# Several species of bumblebees enter the flower , which being set in dense clusters enables them to suck the nectar from each with the minimum loss of time , the smaller bee spending about two seconds to each . After allowing for the fraction of time it takes him to sweep his eyes and the top of his head with his forelegs to free them from the pollen which must inevitably be shaken from the stamen in the arch of the corolla as he dives deeply after the nectar in the bottom of the throat , and to pass the pollen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickness , from the forelegs to the middle ones , and thence to the hairy " basket " on the hind ones - after making all allowances for such delays , this small worker is able to fertilize all the flowers in the fullest cluster in half a minute ! When the contents of the baskets of two different species of bumblebees caught on this blossom were examined under the microscope , the pollen in one case proved to be heal-all , with some from the goldenrod , and a few grains of a third kind not identified ; and in the other case ; heal-all pollen and a small proportion of some unknown kind . Bees that are evidently out for both nectar and pollen on the same trip have been detected visiting white and yellow flowers on their way from one heal-all cluster to another ; and this fact , together with the presence of more than one kind of pollen in the basket , shows that the generally accepted statement that bees confine themselves to flowers of one kind or color during a trip is not always according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brunella , and the significant one , altered by Linnaeus into the softer sound it now bears , is doubtless derived from the German word , braune , the quinsy . Quaint old Parkinson reads : " This is generally called prunella and brunella from the Germans who called it brunellen , because it cureth that disease which they call die bruen , common to soldiers in campe , but especially in garrison , which is an inflammation of the mouth , throat , and tongue . " Among the old herbalists who pretended to cure every ill that flesh is heir to with it , it was variously known as carpenter ' s herb , sicklewort , hook-heal , slough-heal , and brownwort. @# AMERICAN or MOCK PENNYROYAL ; TICKWEED ; SQUAW MINT ( Hedeoma pulegioides ) Mint family @# Flowers - Very small , bluish purple , clustered in axils of upper leaves .

Corolla 2-lipped , upper lip erect , notched ; lower one 3-cleft , spreading ; 2 anther-bearing stamens under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with 2-cleft style . Stem : Low , erect , branched , square , hairy , 6 to 18 in. high . Leaves : Small , opposite , ovate to oblong , scantily toothed , strongly aromatic , pungent . Preferred Habitat - Dry fields , open woodland . Flowering Season - July-September . Distribution - Cape Breton Island westward to Nebraska , south to Florida. @# However insignificant its flower , this common little plant unmistakably proclaims its presence throughout the neighborhood . So powerful is the pungent aroma of its leaves that dog doctors sprinkle them about freely in the kennels to kill fleas , a pest by no means exterminated in Southern Europe , however , where the true pennyroyal of commerce ( Mentha Pulegium ) is native . Herb gatherers who collect our pennyroyal , that is so similar to the European species it is similarly employed in medicine , say they can scent it from a greater distance than any other plant. @# BASTARD PENNYROYAL , which , like the Self-heal , is sometimes called BLUE CURLS ( Trichostema dichotomum ) , chooses dry fields , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tiny blue flowers , that later change to purple , from July to October . Its balsam-like odor is not agreeable , neither has the plant beauty to recommend it ; yet where it grows , from Maine to Florida , and west to Texas , it is likely to be so common we can not well pass it unnoticed . The low , stiff , slender , much-branched , and rather clammy stem bears opposite , oblong , smooth-edged leaves narrowed into petioles . One , two , or three flowers , borne at the tips of the branches , soon fall off , leaving the 5-cleft calyx to cradle four exposed nutlets. @# From the five-lobed tubular corolla protrude four very long , curling , blue or violet stamens - hair stamens the Greek generic title signifies - and the pretty popular name of blue curls also has reference to these conspicuous filaments that are spirally coiled in the bud. @# In general habit like the two preceding plants , the FALSE PENNYROYAL ( Isanthus brachiatus ) nevertheless prefers that its sandy home should be near streams . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it blooms in midsummer , lifting its small , tubular , pale blue flowers from the axils of pointed , opposite leaves . An unusual characteristic in one of the mint tribe is that the five sharp lobes of its bell-shaped calyx , and the five rounded , spreading lobes of the corolla , are of equal length , hence its Greek name signifying an equal flower. @# WILD or CREEPING THYME ( Thymus Serpyllum ) Mint family @# Flowers - Very small purple or pink purple , fragrant , clustered at ends of branches or in leaf axils .

Nova Scotia to Middle States. @# " I know a bank where the wild thyme blows , Where oxlips and the nodding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweet musk-roses , and with eglantine. " - A Midsummer Night ' s Dream. @# According to Danish tradition , anyone waiting by an elder-bush on Midsummer Night at twelve o ' clock will see the king of fairyland and all his retinue pass by and disport themselves in favorite haunts , among others the mounds of fragrant wild thyme . How well Shakespeare knew his folklore ! @# Thyme is said to have been one of the three plants which made the Virgin Mary ' s bed . Indeed , the European peasants have as many myths as there are quotations from the poets about this classic plant . Its very name denotes that it was used as an incense in Greek temples . No doubt it was the Common Thyme ( T. vulgaris ) , an erect , tall plant cultivated in gardens here as a savory , that Horace says the Romans used so extensively for bee culture. @# Dense cushions of creeping thyme usually contain two forms of blossoms on separate plants - hermaphrodite ( male and female which are much the commoner ; and pistillate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ develop no pollen . The latter are more fertile ; none can fertilize itself . But blossoms so rich in nectar naturally attract quantities of insects - bees and butterflies chiefly . A newly opened hermaphrodite flower , male on the first day , dusts its visitors as they pass the ripe stamens . This pollen they carry to a flower two days old , which , having reached the female stage , receives it on the mature two-cleft stigma , now erect and tall , whereas the stamens are past maturity. @# GARDEN , SPEAR , or MACKEREL MINT ( Mentha spicata ; M. viridis of Gray ) Mint family @# Flowers - Small , pale bluish , or pinkish purple , in whorls , forming terminal , interrupted , narrow spikes , 2 to 4 in. long in fruit , the central one surpassing lateral ones .

Leaves : Opposite , narrowly oblong , acute , saw-edged , aromatic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Distribution - Eastern half of Canada and United States . Also Europe and Asia. @# The poets tell us that Proserpine , Pluto ' s wife , in a fit of jealousy changed a hated rival into the mint plant , whose name Mentha , in its Latin form , or Minthe , the Greek equivalent , is still that of the metamorphosed beauty , a daughter of Cocytus , who was also Pluto ' s wife . Proserpine certainly contrived to keep her rival ' s memory fragrant . But how she must delight in seeing her under the chopping-knife and served up as sauce ! @# It is a curious fact that among the Labiates , or two-lipped blossoms to which thymes and mints belong , there very frequently occur species bearing flowers that are male on the first day ( staminate ) and female , or pistillate , on the second day , and also smaller female flowers on distinct plants . Muller believed this plan was devised to attract insects , first by the more showy hermaphrodite flower , that they might carry its pollen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit last ; but this interesting theory has yet to be proved . Nineteen species of flies , to which the mints are specially adapted , have been taken in the act of transferring pollen . Ten varieties of the lower hymenoptera ( bees , wasps , and others ) commonly resort to the fragrant spikes of bloom. @# PEPPERMINT ( M. piiterita ) , similar in manner of growth to the preceding , is another importation from Europe now thoroughly at home here in wet soil . The volatile oil obtained by distilling its leaves has long been an important item of trade in Wayne County , New York . One has only to crush the leaves in one ' s hand to name the flower. @# Our native WILD MINT ( M. Canadensis ) , common along brook-sides and in moist soil from New Brunswick to Virginia and far westward , has its whorls of small purplish flowers seated in the leaf axils . Its odor is like pennyroyal . The true PENNYROYAL , not to be confused with our spurious woodland annual , is M. Pulegium , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valuable relatives , all perennials , have traveled to become naturalized Americans. @# In dry open woods and thickets and by the roadside , from late August throughout September , we find blooming the aromatic fragrant STONE MINT , SWEET HORSE-MINT , or AMERICAN DITTANY ( Cunila origanoides ; C. Mariana of Gray ) . Its small pink-purple , lilac , or whitish flowers , that are only about half as long as the protruding pair of stamens , are borne in loose terminal clusters at the ends of the stiff , branched , slender , sometimes reddish , stem . A pair of rudimentary , useless stamens remain within the two-lipped tube ; the exserted pair , affording the most convenient alighting place for the visiting flies , dust their undersides with pollen the first day the flower opens ; on the next , the stigma will be ready to receive pollen carried from young flowers. @# NIGHTSHADE ; BLUE BINDWEED ; FELONWORT ; BITTERSWEET ; SCARLET or SNAKE BERRY ; POISON-FLOWER ; WOODY NIGHTSHADE ( Solanum Dulcamara ) Potato family @# Flowers - Blue , purple , or , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 1/2 in. broad , clustered in slender , drooping cymes . Calyx 5-lobed , oblong , persistent on the berry ; corolla deeply , sharply 5-cleft , wheel-shaped , or points curved backward ; 5 stamens inserted on throat , yellow , protruding , the anthers united to form a cone ; stigma small . Stem : Climbing or straggling , woody below , branched , 2 to 8 ft. long . Leaves : Alternate , 2 to 4 in. long , 1 to 2 1/2 in. wide , pointed at the apex , usually heart-shaped at base ; some with 2 distinct leaflets below on the petiole , others have leaflets united with leaf like lower lobes or wings . Fruit : A bright red , oval berry . Preferred Habitat - Moist thickets , fence rows . Flowering Season - May-September . Distribution - United States east of Kansas , north of New Jersey .

Another bittersweet , so-called , festoons the hedgerows with yellow berries which , bursting , show their scarlet-coated seeds . Rose hips and mountain-ash berries , among many other conspicuous bits of color , arrest attention , but not for us were they designed . Now the birds are migrating , and , hungry with their long flight , they gladly stop to feed upon fare so attractive . Hard , indigestible seeds traverse the alimentary canal without alteration and are deposited many miles from the parent that bore them . Nature ' s methods for widely distributing plants can not but stir the dullest imagination. @# The purple pendent flowers of this nightshade secrete no nectar , therefore many insects let them alone ; but it is now believed that no part of the plant is poisonous . Certainly one that claims the potato , tomato , and eggplant among its kin has no right to be dangerous . The BLACK , GARDEN , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , bears jet-black berries that are alleged to be fatal . Nevertheless , female bumblebees , to which its white flowers are specially adapted , visit them to draw out pollen from the chinks of the anthers with their jaws , just as they do in the case of the wild , sensitive plant , and with no more disastrous result . It has been well said that the nightshades are a blessing both to the sick and to the doctors . The present species takes its name from dulcis , sweet , and amaras , bitter , referring to the taste of the juice ; the generic name is derived from solamen , solace or consolation , referring to the relief afforded by the narcotic properties of some of these plants. @# BLUE or WILD TOADFLAX ; BLUE LINARIA ( Linaria Canadensis ) Figwort family @# Flowers - Pale blue to purple , small , irregular , in slender spikes .

Leaves : Small , linear , alternately scattered along stem , or oblong in pairs or threes on leafy sterile shoots . Preferred Habitat - Dry soil , gravel , or sand . Flowering Season - May-October . Distribution - North , Central , and South Americas. @# Sometimes lying prostrate in the dust , sometimes erect , the linaria ' s delicate spikes of bloom wear an air of injured innocence , yet the plant , weak as it looks , has managed to spread over three Americas from ocean to ocean . More beautiful than the rather scrawny flowers are the tufts of cool green foliage made by the sterile shoots that take complete possession of a wide area around the parent plants. @# Unlike its relative butter-and-eggs , the corolla of this toadflax is so contracted that bees can not enter it ; but by inserting their long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , short-tongued bees contrive to reach only a little nectar . The palate , so valuable to the other linaria , has in this one lost its function ; and the larger flies , taking advantage of the flower ' s weakness , pilfer both sweets and pollen . Butterflies , to which a slender spurred flower is especially attractive , visit this one in great numbers , and as they can not regale themselves without touching the anthers and stigma , they may be regarded as the legitimate visitors. @# Wolf , rat , mouse , sow , cow , cat , snake , dragon , dog , toad , are among the many animal prefixes to the names of flowers that the English country people have given for various and often most interesting reasons . Just as dog , used as a prefix , expresses an idea of worthlessness to them , so toad suggests a spurious plant ; the toadflax being made to bear what is meant to be an odious name because before flowering it resembles the true flax , linum , from which the generic title @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FIGWORT ; HEAL-ALL ; PILEWORT ( Scrophularia Marylandica ; S. nodosa of Gray ) Figwort family @# Flowers - Very small , dull green on outside ; vivid , shining brownish purple within ; borne in almost leafless terminal clusters on slender stems ; Calyx 5-parted. ; corolla of 5 rounded lobes , the 2 upper ones erect , side ones ascending , lower one bent downward ; 5 staroens , 4 of them twin-like and bearing anthers , the fifth sterile , a mere scale on roof of the globular corolla tube ; style with knot-like stigma . Stem : From 3 to 10 ft. high , square , with grooved sides , widely. branching . Leaves : From 3 to 12 in. long , oblong , pointed , coarsely toothed , on slender stems , strong smelling . Preferred Habitat - Moist , shady ground . Flowering Season - July-September . Distribution - New York to the Carolinas , westward to Tennessee and Kansas ; possibly beyond. @# An insignificant little flower by itself , conspicuous only because it rears itself in clusters on a level with one ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that makes a blossom charming to the human mind - why has it been elevated by the botanists to the dignity of lending its name to a large and important family , and why is it mentioned at all in a popular flower book beside the more showy ornaments of nature ' s garden ? Both questions have the same answer : Because it is the typical flower of the family , and therefore serves as an illustration of the manner in which many others are fertilized . Beautiful blossoms are by no means always the most important ones. @# It well repays one to observe the relative times of maturing anthers and stigmas in the flowers , as thereby hangs a tale in which some insect plays an interesting role . The figwort matures its stigma at the lip of the style before its anthers have ripened their pollen . Why ? By having the stigma of a newly opened flower thrust forward to the mouth of the corolla , an insect alighting on the lip , which forms his only convenient landing place , must brush against it and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whose anthers are already matured . At this early stage of the flower ' s development its stamens lie curved over in the tube of the corolla ; but presently , as the already fertilized style begins to wither , and its stigma is dry and no longer receptive to pollen , then , since there can be no longer any fear of self-pollination - the horror of so many flowers - the figwort uncurls and elevates its stamens . The insect visitor in search of nectar must get dusted with pollen from the late maturing anthers now ready for him . By this ingenious method the flower becomes cross-fertilized and wastes the least pollen. @# Bees and wasps evidently pursue opposite routes in going to work , the former beginning at the bottom of a spike or raceme , where the older , more mature flowers are , and working upward ; the wasps commencing at the top , among the newly opened ones . In spite of the fact that we usually see hive bees about this plant , pilfering the generous supply of nectar in each tiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flower ' s truest benefactor , since he carries pollen from the older blossoms of the last raceme visited to the projecting stigmas of the newly opened flowers at the top of the next cluster . Manifestly no flower , even though it were especially adapted to wasps , as this one is , could exclude bees . About one-third of all its visitors are wasps. @# HAIRY BEARD-TONGUE ( Pentstemon hirsutus ; P. pubescens of Gray ) Figwort family @# Flowers - Dull violet or lilac and white , about 1 in. long , borne in a loose spike . Calyx 5-parted , the sharply pointed sepals overlapping ; corolla , a gradually inflated tube widening where the mouth divides into a 2-lobed upper lip and a 3-lobed lower lip ; the throat nearly closed by hairy palate at base of lower lip ; sterile fifth stamen densely bearded for half its length ; 4 anther-bearing stamens , the anthers divergent . Stem : 1 to 3 ft. high , erect , downy above . Leaves : Oblong to lance shape , upper ones seated on stem ; lower ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fields , thickets , and open woods . Flowering Season - May-July . Distribution - Ontario to Florida , Manitoba to Texas. @# It is the densely bearded , yellow , fifth stamen ( pente =five , stemon = a stamen ) which gives this flower its scientific name and its chief interest to the structural botanist . From the fact that a blossom has a lip in the center of the lower half of its corolla , that an insect must use as its landing place , comes the necessity for the pistil to occupy a central position . Naturally , a fifth stamen would be only in its way , an encumbrance to be banished in time . In the figwort , for example , we have seen the fifth stamen reduced , from long sterility , to a mere scale on the roof of the corolla tube in other lipped flowers , the useless organ has disappeared ; but in the beard-tongue , it goes through a series of curious curves from the upper to the under side of the flower to get out of the way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helping close the mouth of the flower , which the hairy lip alone could not adequately guard against pilferers . A long-tongued bee , thrusting in his head up to his eyes only , receives the pollen in his face . The blossom is male ( staminate ) in its first stage and female ( pistillate ) in its second. @# While this is the beard-tongue commonly found in the Eastern United States , particularly southward , and one of the most beautiful of its clan , the western species have been selected by the gardeners for hybridizing into those more showy , but often less charming , flowers now quite extensively cultivated . Several varieties of these , having escaped from gardens in the East , are locally common wild. @# The LARGE-FLOWERED BEARD-TONGUE ( P. grandiflorus ) , one of the finest prairie species , whose lavender-blue , bell-shaped corolla is abruptly dilated above the calyx , measures nearly two inches long . Its sterile filament , curved over at the summit , is bearded there only. @# Handsomest of all is the COBEA BEARD-TONGUE , a native of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hairy without , like the leaves , but smooth within . The pale purple blossom , delicately suffused with yellow , and pencilled with red lines - pathfinders for the bees - has the base of its tube creamy white . Few flowers hang from each stout clammy spike. @# The more densely crowded spikes of the large SMOOTH BEARD-TONGUE ( P. glaber ) , a smaller blue or purple flowered , narrower-leaved species , that shows an unusual preference for moist soil throughout its range , is , like the other beard-tongues mentioned , better known to the British gardener , perhaps , than to Americans , who have yet to learn the value of many of their wild flowers under cultivation. @# The tall FOXGLOVE BEARD-TONGUE ( P. digitalis ) , with large , showy white blossoms tinged with purple , the one most commonly grown in gardens here , escapes on the slightest encouragement to run wild again from Maine to Virginia , west to Illinois and Arkansas . Small bees crawl into the broad tube , and butterflies drain the nectar evidently secreted for long-tongued bees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the flower first develops its anthers , whose saw-edges grating against the visitors thorax , aid in sifting out the dry pollen ; and later the style , which when immature clung to the top of the corolla , lowers its receptive stigma to oppose the bee ' s entrance . Professor Robertson has frequently detected the common wasp nipping holes with her sharp jaws in the base of the tube . With remarkable intelligence she invariably chose to insert her tongue at the precise spots where the nectar is stored on either side of the sterile filament. @# BLUE-EYED MARY ; INNOCENCE ; BROAD-LEAVED COLLINSIA ( Collinsia verna ) Figwort family @# Flowers - On slender , weak stalks ; whorled in axils of upper leaves . Blue on lower lip of corolla , its middle lobe folded lengthwise to enclose 4 adhering stamens and pistil ; upper lip white , with scalloped margins ; corolla from 1/2 to 3/4 in. long , its throat about equaling the deeply 5-cleft calyx . Stem : Hoary , slender , simple or branched , from 6 in. to 2 ft. high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acute ones clasping the stem ; lower , ovate ones on short petioles . Fruit : A round capsule to which the enlarged calyx adheres . Preferred Habitat - Moist meadows , woods , and thickets . Flowering Season - April-June . Distribution - Western New York and Pennsylvania to Wisconsin , Kentucky , and Indian Territory. @# Next of kin to the great Paulonia tree , whose deliciously sweet , vanilla-scented , trumpet-shaped violet flowers are happily fast becoming as common here as in their native Japan , what has this fragile , odorless blossom of the meadows in common with it ? Apparently nothing ; but superficial appearances count for little or nothing among scientists , to whom the structure of floral organs is of prime importance ; and analysis instantly shows the close relationship between these dissimilar-looking cousins . Even without analysis one can readily see that the monkey flower is not far removed. @# Because few writers have arisen as yet in the newly settled regions of the middle West and Southwest , where blue-eyed Mary dyes acres of meadow land with her heavenly color , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loudly buzzed by myriads of bees that are her most devoted lovers . " I regard the flower as especially adapted to the early flying bees with abdominal collecting brushes for pollen - i. e. , species of Osmia - and these bees , " says Professor Robertson of Illinois , " although not the exclusive visitors , are far more abundant and important than all the other visitors together . " For them are the brownish marks on the palate provided as pathfinders . At the pressure of their strong heads the palate yields to give them entrance , and at their removal it springs back to protect the pollen against the inroads of flies , mining bees , and beetles . As the longer stamens shed their pollen before the shorter ones mature theirs , bees must visit the flower several times to collect it all. @# MONKEY-FLOWER ( Minulus ringens ) Figwort family @# Flowers - Purple , violet , or lilac , rarely whitish ; about 1 in. long , solitary , borne on slender footstems from axils of upper leaves . Calyx prismatic , 5-angled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 2-lipped ; upper lip 2-lobed , erect ; under lip 3-lobed , spreading ; 4 stamens , a long and a short pair , inserted on corolla tube ; pistil with 2-lobed , plate-like stigma . Stem : Square , erect , usually branched , 1 to 3 ft. high . Leaves : Opposite , oblong to lance-shaped , saw-edged , mostly seated on stem . Preferred Habitat - Swamps , beside streams and ponds . Flowering Season - June-September . Distribution - Manitoba , Nebraska , and Texas , eastward to Atlantic Ocean. @# No wader is the square-stemmed Monkey-flower whose grinning corolla peers at one from grassy tuffets in swamps , from the brookside , the springy soil of low meadows , and damp hollows beside the road ; but moisture it must have to fill its nectary and to soften the ground for the easier transit of its creeping rootstock . Imaginative eyes see what appears to them the gaping ( ringens ) face of a little ape or buffoon ( mimulus ) in this common flower whose drolleries , such as they are , call forth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become pollen-laden during the entertainment. @# Now the advanced stigma of this flower is peculiarly irritable , and closes up on contact with an incoming visitor ' s body , thus exposing the pollen-laden anthers behind it , and , except in rare cases , preventing self-fertilization . Delpino was the first to guess what advantage so sensitive a stigma might mean . Probably the smaller bees find the tube too long for their short tongues . The yellow palate , which partially guards the entrance to the nectary from pilferers , of course serves also as a pathfinder to the long-tongued bees. @# AMERICAN BROOKLIME ( Veronica Americana ) Figwort family @# Flowers - Light blue to white , usually striped with deep blue or purple structure of flower similar to that of V. officinalis , but borne in long , loose racemes branching outward on stems that spring from axils of most of the leaves . Stem : Without hairs , usually branched , 6 in. to 3 ft. long , lying partly on ground and rooting from lower joints . Leaves : Oblong , lance-shaped , saw-edged , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 in. long , 1/4 to 1 in. wide . Fruit : A nearly round , compressed , but not flat , capsule with flat seeds in 2 cells . Preferred Habitat - In brooks , ponds , ditches , swamps . Flowering Season - April-September . Distribution - From Atlantic to Pacific , Alaska to California and New Mexico , Quebec to Pennsylvania. @# This , the perhaps most beautiful native speedwell , whose sheets of blue along the brookside are so frequently mistaken for masses of forget-me-nots by the hasty observer , of course shows marked differences on closer investigation ; its tiny blue flowers are marked with purple pathfinders , and the plant is not hairy , to mention only two . But the poets of England are responsible for most of whatever confusion stills lurks in the popular mind concerning these two flowers . Speedwell , a common medieval benediction from a friend , equivalent to our farewell or adieu , and forget - me-not of similar intent , have been used interchangeably by some writers in connection with parting gifts of small blue flowers . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was most commonly known as the forget-me-not for over two hundred years , or until only fifty years ago . When the " Mayflower " and her sister ships were launched ; " Speedwell " was considered a happier name for a vessel than it proved to be. @# The WATER SPEEDWELL , or PIMPERNEL ( V. Anagallis-aquatica ) , differs from the preceding chiefly in having most of its leaves seated on the stalk , only the lower ones possessing stems , and those short ones . In autumn the increased growth of sterile shoots from runners produce almost circular leaves , often two inches broad , a certain aid to identification. @# Another close relation , the MARSH or SKULLCAP SPEEDWELL ( V. scutellata ) , on the other hand , has long , very slender , acute leaves , their teeth far apart ; and as these three species are the only members of their clan likely to be found in watery places within our limits , a close examination of the leaves of any water-loving plant bearing small four-lobed blue flowers , usually marked with lines of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correctly name the species . None of these blossoms can be carried far after being picked ; they have a tantalizing habit of dropping off , leaving a bouquet of tiny green calices chiefly. @# Many kinds of bees , wasps , flies , and butterflies fertilize all these little flowers , which are first staminate , then pistillate , simply by crawling over them in search of nectar. @# COMMON SPEEDWELL ; FLUELLIN ; PAUL ' S BETONY ; GROUND-HELE ( Veronica officinalis ) Figwort family @# Flowers - Pale blue , very small , crowded on spike-like racemes from axils of leaves , often from alternate axils . Calyx 4-parted ; corolla of 4 lobes , lower lobe commonly narrowest ; 2 divergent stamens inserted at base and on either side of upper corolla lobe ; a knob-like stigma on solitary pistil . Stem : From 3 to 10 in. long , hairy , often prostrate , and rooting at joints . Leaves : Opposite , oblong , obtuse , saw-edged , narrowed at base . Fruit : Compressed heart-shaped capsule , containing numerous flat seeds . Preferred Habitat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Season - May-August . Distribution - From Michigan and Tennessee eastward , also from Ontario to Nova Scotia . Probably an immigrant from Europe and Asia. @# An ancient tradition of the Roman Church relates that when Jesus was on His way to Calvary , He passed the home of a certain Jewish maiden , who , when she saw the drops of agony on His brow , ran after Him along the road to wipe His face with her kerchief . This linen , the monks declared , ever after bore the impress of the sacred features - vera iconica , the true likeness . When the Church wished to canonize the pitying maiden , an abbreviated form of the Latin words was given her , St. Veronica , and her kerchief became one of the most precious relics at St. Peter ' s , where it is said to be still preserved . Medieval flower lovers , whose piety seems to have been eclipsed only by their imaginations , named this little flower from a fancied resemblance to the relic . Of course , special healing virtue was attributed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not go to Rome to be cured by it , naturally the next step was to employ the common , wayside plant that bore the saint ' s name . Mental healers will not be surprised to learn that because of the strong popular belief in its efficacy to cure all fleshly ills , it actually seemed to possess miraculous powers . For scrofula it was said to be the infallible remedy , and presently we find Linnaeus grouping this flower , and all its relatives under the family name of Scrofulariaceae . " What ' s in a name ? " Religion , theology , medicine , folk-lore , metaphysics , what not ? @# One of the most common wild flowers in England is this same familiar little blossom of that lovely shade of blue known by Chinese artists as " the sky after rain . " " The prettiest of all humble roadside flowers I saw , " says Burroughs , in " A Glance at British Wild Flowers . " " It is prettier than the violet , and larger and deeper colored than our houstonia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hepatica , done in indigo blue , and wonted to the grass in the fields and by the waysides. @# ' The little speedwell ' s darling blue ' @# sings Tennyson . I saw it blooming with the daisy and buttercup upon the grave of Carlyle . The tender human and poetic element of his stern , rocky nature was well expressed by it. " @# Only as it grows in masses is the speedwell conspicuous - a sufficient reason for its habit of forming colonies and of gathering its insignificant blossoms together into dense spikes , since by these methods it issues a flaunting advertisement of its nectar . The flower that simplifies dining for insects has its certain reward in rapidly increased and vigorous descendants . To save repetition , the reader interested in the process of fertilization is referred to the account of the Maryland figwort , since many members of the large family to which both belong employ the same method of economizing pollen and insuring fertile seed . In this case visitors have only to crawl over the tiny blossoms. @# From Labrador to Alaska @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in South America , Europe , and Asia , roams the THYME-LEAVED SPEEDWELL ( V. serpyllifolia ) , by the help of its numerous flat seeds , that are easily transported on the wind , and by its branching stem , that lies partly on the ground , rooting where the joints touch earth . The small oval leaves , barely half an inch long , grow in pairs . The tiny blue , or sometimes white , flowers , with dark pathfinders to the nectary , are borne on spike-like racemes at the ends of the stem and branches that rear themselves upward in fields and thickets to display their bloom before the passing bee. @# PALE , or NAKED , or ONE-FLOWERED BROOM-RAPE ( Thalesia uniflora ; Aphyllon uniflorum of Gray ) Broom-rape family @# Flowers - Violet , rarely white , delicately fragrant , solitary at end of erect , glandular peduncles . Calyx hairy , bell-shaped , 5-toothed , not half the length of corolla , which is 1 in. or less long , with curved tube spreading into 2 lips , 5-lobed , yellow-bearded within ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corolla ; 1 pistil . Stem : About 1 in. long , scaly , often entirely underground ; the 1 to 4 brownish scape-like peduncles , on which flowers are borne , from 3 to 8 in. high . Leaves : None . Fruit : An elongated , egg-shaped , 1-celled capsule containing numerous seeds . Preferred Habitat - Damp woods and thickets . Flowering Season - April-June . Distribution - British Possessions and United States from coast to coast , southward to Virginia , and Texas. @# A curious , beautiful parasite , fastened on the roots of honest plants from which it draws its nourishment . The ancestors of this species , having deserted the path of rectitude ages ago to live by piracy , gradually lost the use of their leaves , upon which virtuous plants depend as upon a part of their digestive apparatus ; they grew smaller and smaller , shriveled and dried , until now that the one-flowered broom-rape sucks its food , rendered already digestible through another ' s assimilation , no leaves remain on its brownish scapes . Disuse of any talent in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to inevitable loss : " Unto every one which hath shall be given ; and from him that hath not , even that he hath shall be taken away. " @# HAIRY RUELLIA ( Ruellia ciliosa ) Acanthus family @# Flowers - Pale violet blue , showy , about 2 in. long , solitary or clustered in the axils or at the end of stem . Calyx of 5 bristle-shaped hairy segments ; corolla with very slender tube expanding above in 5 nearly equal obtuse lobes ; stamens 4 ; pistil with recurved style . Stem : Hairy , especially above , erect , 1 to 2 1/2 ft. high . Leaves : Opposite , oblong , narrowed at apex , entire , covered with soft white hairs . Preferred Habitat - Dry soil . Flowering Season - June-September . Distribution - New Jersey southward to the Gulf and westward to Michigan and Nebraska. @# Many charming ruellias from the tropics adorn hothouses and window gardens in winter ; but so far north as the New Jersey pine barrens , and westward where killing frosts occur , this perennial proves to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which so successfully invite insects to transfer their pollen , thereby counteracting the bad effects of close inbreeding , the plant bears inconspicuous cleistogamous or blind ones also . These look like arrested buds that never open ; but , being fertilized with their own pollen , ripen abundant seed nevertheless. @# One frequently finds holes bitten in these flowers , as in so many others long of tube or spur . Bumblebees , among the most intelligent and mischievous of insects , are apt to be the chief offenders ; but wasps are guilty too , and the female carpenter bee , which ordinarily slits holes to extract nectar , has been detected in the act of removing circular pieces of the corolla from this ruellia with which to plug up a thimble-shaped tube in some decayed tree . Here she deposits an egg on top of a layer of baby food , consisting of a paste of pollen and nectar , and seals up the nursery with another bit of leaf or flower , repeating the process until the long tunnel is filled with eggs and food for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparently extinct , and living only in embryo for months . This is the bee which commonly cuts her round plugs from rose leaves. @# The SMOOTH RUELLIA ( R. strepens ) , an earlier bloomer than the preceding , and with a more southerly range , has a shorter , thicker tube to its handsome blue flower , and lacks the hairs which guard its relative from crawling pilferers. @# BLUETS ; INNOCENCE ; HOUSTONIA ; QUAKER LADIES ; QUAKER BONNETS ; VENUS ' PRIDE ( Houstonia caerulea ) Madder family @# Flowers - Very small , light to purplish blue or white , with yellow center , and borne at end of each erect slender stem that rises from 3 to 7 in. high . Corolla funnel-shaped , with 4 oval , pointed , spreading lobes that equal the slender tube in length ; rarely the corolla has more divisions ; 4 stamens inserted on tube of corolla ; 2 stigmas ; calyx 4-lobed . Leaves : Opposite , seated on stem , oblong , tiny ; the lower ones spatulate . Fruit : A 2-lobed pod , broader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeds deeply concave . Root stock : Slender , spreading , forming dense tufts . Preferred Habitat - Moist meadows , wet rocks and banks . Flowering Season - April-July , or sparsely through summer . Distribution - Eastern Canada and United States west to Michigan , south to Georgia and Alabama. @# Millions of these dainty wee flowers , scattered through the grass of moist meadows and by the wayside , reflect the blue and the serenity of heaven in their pure , upturned faces . Where the white variety grows , one might think a light snowfall had powdered the grass , or a milky way of tiny floral stars had streaked a terrestrial path . Linnaeus named the flower for Dr. Houston , a young English physician , botanist , and collector , who died in South America in 1733 , after an exhausting tramp about the Gulf of Mexico. @# To secure cross-fertilization , the object toward which so much marvelous floral organism is directed , this little plant puts forth two forms of blossoms - one with the stamens in the lower portion of the corolla @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the stigmas below , and the stamens elevated to the mouth of the corolla . But the two kinds do not grow in the same patch , seed from either producing after its kind . Many insects visit these blossoms , but chiefly small bees and butterflies . Conspicuous among the latter is the common little meadow fritillary ( Brenthis bellona ) , whose tawny , dark-speckled wings expand and close in apparent ecstasy as he tastes the tiny drop of nectar in each dainty enameled cup . Coming to feast with his tongue dusted from anthers nearest the nectary , he pollenizes the large stigmas of a short-styled blossom without touching its tall anthers . But it is evident that he could not be depended on to fertilize the long-styled form , with its smaller stigma , because of this ability to insert his slender tongue from the side where it avoids contact . Flies and beetles enter the blossoms , but small bees are best adapted as all-round benefactors . This simple-looking blossom , that measures barely half an inch across , is clever enough to multiply its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and therefore one might suppose a wiser , flower dwindles toward extinction. @# John Burroughs found a single bluet in blossom one January , near Washington , when the clump of earth on which it grew was frozen solid . A pot of roots gathered in autumn and placed in a sunny window has sent up a little colony of star-like flowers throughout a winter. @# WILD , COMMON , or CARD TEASEL ; GYPSY COMBS ( Dipsacus sylvestris ) Teasel family @# Flowers - Purple or lilac , small , packed in dense , cylindric heads , 3 to 4 in. long ; growing singly on ends of footstalks , the flowers set among stiffly pointed , slender scales . Calyx cup-shaped , 4-toothed . Corolla 4-lobed ; stamens 4 ; leaves of involucre , slender , bristled , curved upward as high as flower-head or beyond . Stems : 3 to 6 ft. high , stout , branched , leafy , with numerous short prickles . Leaves : Opposite , lance-shaped , seated on stem , with bristles along the stout midrib . Preferred Habitat - Roadsides and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maine to Virginia , westward to Ontario and the Mississippi . Europe and Asia. @# Manufacturers find that no invention can equal the natural teasel head for raising a nap on woolen cloth , because it breaks at any serious obstruction , whereas a metal substitute , in such a case , tears the material . Accordingly , the plant is largely cultivated in the west of England , and quantities that have been imported from France and Germany may be seen in wagons on the way to the factories in any of the woolen-trade towns . After the flower-heads wither , the stems are cut about eight inches long , stripped of prickles , to provide a handle , and after drying , the natural tool is ready for use. @# Bristling with armor , the teasel is not often attacked by browsing cattle . Occasionally even the upper leaf surfaces are dotted over with prickles enough to tear a tender tongue . This is a curious feature , for prickles usually grow out of veins . In the receptacle formed where the bases of the upper leaves grow together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cure for warts , country people say . Venus ' Cup , Bath , or Basin , and Water Thistle , are a few of the teasel ' s folk names earned by its curious little tank . In it many small insects are drowned , and these are supposed to contribute nourishment to the plant ; for Mr. Francis Darwin has noted that protoplasmic filaments reach out into the liquid. @# Owing to the stiff spines which radiate from the flower cluster , the bumblebees , which principally fertilize it , can reach the florets only with their heads , and not pollenize them by merely crawling over them as in the true compositae . But by first maturing its anthers , then when they have shed their pollen , elevating its stigmas , the teasel prevents self-fertilization. @# HAREBELL or HAIRBELL ; BLUE BELLS of SCOTLAND ; LADY ' S THIMBLE ( Campanula rotundifolia ) Bellflower family @# Flowers - Bright blue or violet blue , bell-shaped , 1/2 in. long or over , drooping from hair-like stalks . Calyx of 5-pointed , narrow , spreading lobes ; slender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summit of calyx tube , which is adherent to ovary ; pistil with 3 stigmas in maturity only . Stem : Very slender , 6 in. to 3 ft. high , often several from same root ; simple or branching . Leaves : Lower ones nearly round , usually withered and gone by flowering season ; stem leaves narrow , pointed , seated on stem . Fruit : An egg-shaped , pendent , 3-celled capsule with short openings near base ; seeds very numerous , tiny . Preferred Habitat - Moist rocks , uplands . Flowering Season - June-September . Distribution - Arctic regions of Europe , Asia , and America ; southward on this continent , through Canada to New Jersey and Pennsylvania ; westward to Nebraska , to Arizona in the Rockies , and to California in the Sierra Nevadas. @# The inaccessible crevice of a precipice , moist rocks sprayed with the dashing waters of a lake or some tumbling mountain stream , wind-swept upland meadows , and shady places by the roadside may hold bright bunches of these hardy bells , swaying with exquisite grace on tremulous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountain blasts , however frail they appear . How dainty , slender , tempting these little flowers are ! One gladly risks a watery grave or broken bones to bring down a bunch from its aerial cranny. @# It was a long stride forward in the evolutionary scale when the harebell welded its five once separate petals together ; first at the base , then farther and farther up the sides , until a solid bell-shaped structure resulted . This arrangement which makes insect fertilization a more certain process because none of the pollen is lost through apertures , and because the visitor must enter the flower only at the vital point where the stigmas come in contact with his pollen-laden body , has given to all the flowers that have attained to it , marked ascendency. @# Like most inverted blossoms , the harebell hangs its head to protect its nectar and pollen , not only from rain , but from the intrusion of undesirable crawling insects which would simply brush off its pollen in the grass before reaching the pistil of another flower , and so defeat cross-fertilization , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for winged insects by its bright color , the harebell attracts bees , butterflies , and many others . These visitors can not well walk on the upright petals , and sooner or later must clasp the pistil if they would secure the nectar secreted at the base . In doing so , they will dust themselves and the immature pistil with the pollen from the surrounding anthers ; but a newly opened flower is incapable of fertilization . The pollen , although partially discharged in the unopened bud , is prevented from falling out by a coat of hairs on the upper part of the style . By the time all the pollen has been removed by visitors , however , and the stamens which matured early have withered , the pistil has grown longer , until it looks like the clapper in a bell ; the stigma at its top has separated into three horizontal lobes which , being sticky on the under side , a pollen-laden insect on entering the bell must certainly brush against them and render them fertile . But bumblebees , its chief benefactors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flower ; what then ? Why , the stigmas in that case finally bend backward to reach the left over pollen , and fertilize themselves , obviously the next best thing for them to do . How one ' s reverence increases when one begins to understand , be it ever so little of , the divine plan ! @# " Probably the most striking blue and purple wild flowers we have , " says John Burroughs , " are of European origin . These colors , except with the fall asters and gentians , seem rather unstable in our flora . " This theory is certainly borne out in the case of the RAMPION , EUROPEAN , or CREEPING BELLFLOWER ( C. rapunculoides ) , now detected in the act of escaping from gardens from New Brunswick to Ontario , Southern New York , Pennsylvania , and Ohio , and making itself very much at home in our fields and along the waysides . Compared with the delicate little harebell , it is a plant of rank , rigid habit . Its erect , rather stout stem , set with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a one-sided raceme of widely expanded , purple-blue bells rising about two feet above the ground , has little of the exquisite grace of its cousin . It blooms from July to September . This is the species whose roots are eaten by the omnivorous European peasant. @# One of the few native campanulas , the TALL BELLFLOWER ( C. Americana ) , waves long , slender wands studded with blue or sometimes whitish flowers high above the ground of moist thickets and woods throughout the eastern half of this country , but rarely near the sea . Doubtless the salt air , which intensifies the color of so many flowers , would brighten its rather slatey blue . The corolla , which is flat , round , about an inch across , and deeply cleft into five pointed petals , has the effect of a miniature pinwheel in motion . Mature flowers have the style elongated , bent downward , then curved upward , that the stigmas may certainly be in the way of the visiting insect pollen-laden from an earlier bloomer , and be cross-fertilized . The larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , touch only the upper side of the style , on which they must alight ; but the anthers waste pollen by shedding it on all sides . No insect can take shelter from rain or pass the night in this flower , as he frequently does in its more hospitable relative , the harebell . English gardeners , more appreciative than our own of our native flora , frequently utilize this charming plant in their rockwork , increasing their stock by a division of the dense , leafy rosettes. @# VENUS ' LOOKING-GLASS ; CLASPING BELLFLOWER ( Legouzia perfoliata ; Specularia perfoliata of Gray ) Bellflower family @# Flowers - Violet blue , from 1/2 to 3/4 in. across ; solitary or 2 or 3 together , seated , in axils of upper leaves . Calyx lobes varying from 3 to 5 in earlier and later flowers , acute , rigid ; corolla a 5-spoked wheel ; 5 stamens ; pistil with 3 stigmas . Stem : 6 in. to 2 ft. long , hairy , densely leafy , slender , weak . Leaves : Round , clasped about stem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dry woods . Flowering Season - May-September . Distribution - From British Columbia , Oregon , and Mexico , east to Atlantic Ocean. @# At the top of a gradually lengthened and apparently overburdened leafy stalk , weakly leaning upon surrounding vegetation , a few perfect blossoms spread their violet wheels , while below them insignificant earlier flowers , which , although they have never opened , nor reared their heads above the hollows of the little shell-like leaves where they lie secluded , have , nevertheless , been producing seed without imported pollen while their showy sisters slept . But the later blooms , by attracting insects , set cross-fertilized seed to counteract any evil tendencies that might weaken the species if it depended upon self-fertilization only . When the European Venus ' looking-glass used to be cultivated in gardens here , our grandmothers tell us it was altogether too prolific , crowding out of existence its less fruitful , but more lovely , neighbors. @# The SMALL VENUS ' LOOKING-GLASS ( L. biflora ) , of similar habit to the preceding , but with egg-shaped or oblong leaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slender stem , grows in the South and westward to California. @# GREAT LOBELIA ; BLUE CARDINAL-FLOWER ( Lobelia syphilitica ) Bellflower family @# Flowers - Bright blue , touched with white , fading to pale blue , about 1 in. long , borne on tall , erect , leafy spike . Calyx 5-parted , the lobes sharply cut , hairy . Corolla tubular , open to base on one side , 2-lipped , irregularly 5-lobed , the petals pronounced at maturity only . Stamens 5 , united by their hairy anthers into a tube around the style ; larger anthers smooth . Stem : 1 to 3 ft. high , stout , simple , leafy , slightly hairy . Leaves : Alternate , oblong , tapering , pointed , irregularly toothed , 2 to 6 in. long , 1/2 to 2 in. wide . Preferred Habitat - Moist or wet soil ; beside streams . Flowering Season - July-October Distribution - Ontario and northern United States west to Dakota , south to Kansas and Georgia. @# To the evolutionist , ever on the lookout for connecting links , the lobelias @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the upper side and somewhat flattened , shows the beginning of the tendency toward the strap or ray flowers that are nearly confined to the composites of much later development , of course , than tubular single blossoms . Next to massing their flowers in showy heads , as the composites do , the lobelias have the almost equally advantageous plan of crowding theirs along a stem so as to make a conspicuous advertisement to attract the passing bee and to offer him the special inducement of numerous feeding places close together. @# The handsome GREAT LOBELIA , constantly and invidiously compared with its gorgeous sister the cardinal flower , suffers unfairly . When asked what his favorite color was , Eugene Field replied : " Why , I like any color at all so long as it ' s red ! " Most men , at least , agree with him , and certainly hummingbirds do ; our scarcity of red flowers being due , we must believe , to the scarcity of hummingbirds , which chiefly fertilize them . But how bees love the blue blossoms ! @# @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessarily comes in contact with its own pollen , yet fertilization does not take place , however improbable this may appear . Most orchids , for example , are not susceptible to their own pollen . It would seem as if our lobelia , in elevating its stigma through the ring formed by the united anthers , must come in contact with some of the pollen they have previously discharged from their tips , not only on the bumblebee that shakes it out of them when he jars the flower , but also within the tube . But when the anthers are mature , the two lobes of the still immature stigma are pressed together , and can not be fertilized . Nevertheless , the hairy tips of some of the anthers brush off the pollen grains that may have lodged on the stigma as it passes through the ring in its ascent , thus making surety doubly sure . Only after the stigma projects beyond the ring of anthers does it expand its lobes , which are now ready to receive pollen brought from another later flower by the incoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group of plants for Matthias de l ' Obel , a Flemish botanist , or herbalist more likely , who became physician to James I. of England. @# Preferably in dry , sandy soil or in meadows , and over a wide range , the slender , straight shoots of PALE SPIKED LOBELIA ( L. spicata ) bloom early and throughout the summer months , the inflorescence itself sometimes reaching a height of two feet . At the base of the plant there is usually a tuft of broadly oblong leaves ; those higher up narrow first into spoon-shaped , then into pointed , bracts , along the thick and gradually lengthened spike of scattered bloom . The flowers are oft en pale enough to be called white . Like their relatives , they first ripen their anthers to prevent self-fertilization. @# The lithe , graceful little BROOK LOBELIA ( L. Kalmii ) , whose light-blue flowers , at the end of thread-like footstems , form a loose raceme , sways with a company of its fellows among the grass on wet banks , beside meadow runnels and brooks , particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Territory and southward to New Jersey . It bears an insignificant capsule , not inflated like the Indian tobacco ' s ; and long , narrow , spoon-shaped leaves . Twenty inches is the greatest height this little plant may hope to attain. @# Not only beside water , and in it , but often totally immersed , grows the WATER LOBELIA or GLADIOLE ( L. Dortmanna ) . The slender , hollow , smooth stem rises from a submerged tuft of round , hollow , fleshy leaves longitudinally divided by a partition , and bears at the top a scattered array of pale-blue flowers from August to September. @# INDIAN or WILD TOBACCO ; GAG-ROOT ; ASTHMA-WEED ; BLADDER-POD LOBELIA ( Lobelia inflata ) Bellflower family @# Flowers - Pale blue or violet , small , borne at short intervals in spike-like leafy racemes . Calyx 5-parted , its awl-shaped lobes 1/4 in. long , or as long as the tubular , 2-lipped , 5-cleft , corolla that opens to base of tube on upper side .

Endive and dandelion , the chicory ' s relatives , appear on the table too , in spring , where people have learned the possibilities of salads , as they certainly have in Europe. @# From the depth to which the tap-root penetrates , it is not unlikely the succory derived its name from the Latin succurrere = to run under .

When it is on the wane , the asters , for which it is sometimes mistaken , begin to appear , but an instant ' s comparison shows the difference between the two flowers . After noting the yellow disk in the center of an aster , it is not likely the iron-weed ' s thistle-like head of ray florets only will ever again be confused with it .

( See Self-Heal. ) @# COMMON or SCALY BLAZING STAR ; COLIC-ROOT ; RATTLESNAKE MASTER ; BUTTON SNAKEROOT ( Lacinaria squarrosa ; Liatris squarrosa of Gray ) Thistle family @# Flower-heads - Composite , about 1 in. long , bright purple or rose purple , of tubular florets only , from an involucre of overlapping , rigid , pointed bracts ; each of the few flower-heads from the leaf axils along a slender stem in a wand-like raceme . Stem : 1/2 to 2 ft. high . Leaves : Alternate , narrow , entire . Preferred habitat - Dry , rich soil . Flowering Season - June-September . Distribution - Ontario to the Gulf of Mexico , westward to Nebraska. @# Beginning at the top , the apparently fringed flower-heads open downward along the wand , whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the flowers are perfect and attract long-tongued bees and flies ( especially Exoprosopa fasciata ) and butterflies , which , as they sip from the corolla tube , receive the pollen carried out and exposed on the long divisions of the style . Some people have pretended to cure rattlesnake bites with applications of the globular tuber of this and the next species. @# The LARGE BUTTON SNAKEROOT , BLUE BLAZING STAR , or GAY FEATHER ( L. scariosa ) , may attain six feet , but usually not more than half that height ; and its round flower-heads normally stand well away from the stout stem on foot-stems of their own . The bristling scales of the involucre , often tinged with purple at the tips , are a conspicuous feature . With much the same range and choice of habitat as the last species , this Blazing Star is a later bloomer , coming into flower in August , and helping the goldenrods and asters brighten the landscape throughout the early autumn . The name of gay feather , miscellaneously applied to several blazing stars , is especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others of its class , the DENSE BUTTON SNAKEROOT , DEVIL ' S BIT , ROUGH or BACKACHE ROOT , PRAIRIE PINE or THROATWORT ( L. spicata ) , the commonest species we have , chooses moist soil , even salt marshes near the coast , and low meadows throughout a range nearly corresponding with that of the scaly blazing star . Resembling its relatives in general manner of growth , we note that its oblong involucre , rounded at the base , has blunt , not sharply pointed , bracts ; that the flower-heads are densely set close to the wand for from four to fifteen inches ; that the five to thirteen bright rose-purple florets which compose each head occasionally come white ; that its leaves are long and very narrow , and that October is not too late to find the plant in bloom. @# BLUE and PURPLE ASTERS or STARWORTS Thistle family @# Evolution teaches us that thistles , daisies , sunflowers , asters , and all the triumphant horde of composites were once very different flowers from what we see today . Through ages of natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally arrived at the most successful adaptation of their various parts to their surroundings in the whole floral kingdom , they are now overrunning the earth . Doubtless the aster ' s remote ancestors were simple green leaves around the vital organs , and depended upon the wind , as the grasses do - a most extravagant method - to transfer their pollen . Then some rudimentary flower changed its outer row of stamens into petals , which gradually took on color to attract insects and insure a more economical method of transfer . Gardeners today take advantage of a blossom ' s natural tendency to change stamens into petals when they wish to produce double flowers . As flowers and insects developed side by side , and there came to be a better and better understanding between them of each other ' s requirements , mutual adaptation followed . The flower that offered the best advertisement , as the composites do , by its showy rays ; that secreted nectar in tubular flowers where no useless insect could pilfer it ; that fastened its stamens to the inside wall of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of every insect , unwittingly cross-fertilizing the blossom as he crawled over it ; that massed a great number of these tubular florets together where insects might readily discover them and feast with the least possible loss of time - this flower became the winner in life ' s race . Small wonder that our June fields are white with daisies and the autumn landscape is glorified with goldenrod and asters ! @# Since North America boasts the greater part of the two hundred and fifty asters named by scientists , and as variations in many of our common species frequently occur , the tyro need expect no easy task in identifying every one he meets afield . However , the following are possible acquaintances to everyone : @# In dry , shady places the LARGE or BROAD-LEAVED ASTER ( A. macrophyllus ) , so called from its three or four conspicuous , heart-shaped leaves on long petioles , in a clump next the ground , may be more easily identified by these than by the pale lavender or violet flower-heads of about sixteen rays each which crown its reddish angular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brown. @# In prairie soil , especially about the edges of woods in western New York , southward and westward to Texas and Minnesota , the beautiful SKY-BLUE ASTER ( A. azureus ) blooms from August till after frost . Its slender , stiff , rough stem branches above to display the numerous bright blue flowers , whose ten to twenty rays measure only about a quarter of an inch in length . The upper leaves are reduced to small flat bracts ; the next are linear ; and the lower ones , which approach a heart shape , are rough on both sides , and may be five or six inches long. @# Much more branched and bushy is the COMMON BLUE , BRANCHING , WOOD , or HEART-LEAVED ASTER ( A. cordifolius ) , whose generous masses of small , pale lavender flower-heads look like a mist hanging from one to five feet above the earth in and about the woods and shady roadsides from September even to December in favored places. @# The WAVY or VARIOUS-LEAVED ASTER or SMALL FLEABANE ( A. undulatus ) has a stiff , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rough lowest leaves are heart-shaped and set on long foot-stems ; above these , the leaves have shorter stems , dilating where they clasp the stalk ; the upper leaves , lacking stems , are seated on it , while those of the branches are shaped like tiny awls . The flowers , which measure less than an inch across , often grow along one side of an axis as well as in the usual raceme . Eight to fifteen pale blue to violet rays surround the disks which , yellow at first , become reddish brown in maturity . We find the plant in dry soil , blooming in September and October. @# By no means tardy , the LATE PURPLE ASTER , so-called , or PURPLE DAISY ( A. patens ) , begins to display its purplish-blue , daisy-like flower-heads early in August , and farther north may be found in dry , exposed places only until October . Rarely the solitary flowers , that are an inch across or more , are a deep , rich violet . The twenty to thirty rays which surround the disk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green , shingled cups that terminate each little branch . The thick , somewhat rigid , oblong leaves , tapering at the tip , broaden at the base to clasp the rough , slender stalk . Range similar to the next species. @# Certainly from Massachusetts , northern New York , and Minnesota southward to the Gulf of Mexico one may expect to find the NEW ENGLAND ASTER or STARWORT ( A. Novae-Angliae ) one of the most striking and widely distributed of the tribe , in spite of its local name . It is not unknown in Canada . The branching clusters of violet or magenta-purple flower-heads , from one to two inches across - composites containing as many as forty to fifty purple ray florets around a multitude of perfect five-lobed , tubular , yellow disk florets in a sticky cup - shine out with royal splendor above the swamps , moist fields , and roadsides from August to October . The stout , bristle-hairy stem bears a quantity of alternate lance-shaped leaves lobed at the base where they clasp it. @# In even wetter ground we find the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , SWANWEED , or MEADOW SCABISH ( A. puniceus ) blooming as early as July or as late as November . Its stout , rigid stem , bristling with rigid hairs , may reach a height of eight feet to display the branching clusters of pale violet or lavender flowers . The long , blade-like leaves , usually very rough above and hairy along the midrib beneath , are seated on the stem . The lovely SMOOTH or BLUE ASTER ( A. laevis ) , whose sky-blue or violet flower-heads , about one inch broad , are common through September and October in dry soil and open woods , has strongly clasping , oblong , tapering leaves , rough margined , but rarely with a saw-tooth , toward the top of the stem , while those low down on it gradually narrow into clasping wings. @# In dry , sandy soil , mostly near the coast , from Massachusetts to Delaware , grows one of the loveliest of all this beautiful clan , the LOW , SHOWY , or SEASIDE PURPLE ASTER ( A. spectabilis ) . The stiff , usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two feet . Above , the leaves are blade-like or narrowly oblong , seated on the stem , whereas the tapering , oval basal leaves are furnished with long footstems , as is customary with most asters . The handsome , bright , violet-purple flower-heads , measuring about an inch and a half across , have from fifteen to thirty rays , or only about half as many as the familiar New England aster . Season August to November. @# The low-growing BOG ASTER ( A. nemoralis ) , not to be confused with the much taller Red-stalked species often found growing in the same swamp , and having , like it , flower-heads measuring about an inch and a half across , has rays that vary from light violet purple to rose pink . Its oblong to lance-shaped leaves , only two inches long at best , taper to a point at both ends , and are seated on the stem . We look for this aster in sandy bogs from New Jersey northward and westward during August and September. @# The STIFF or SAVORY-LEAVED ASTER , SANDPAPER , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other asters into a genus by itself , is a low , branching little plant with no basal leaves , but some that are very narrow and blade-like , rigid , entire and one-nerved , ascending the stiff stems . The leaves along the branches are minute and awl-shaped , like those on a branch of pine . Only from ten to fifteen violet ray flowers ( pistillate ) surround the perfect disk florets . From Quebec to the Gulf of Mexico , and westward beyond the Mississippi this prim little shrub grows in tufts on dry or rocky soil , and blooms from July to October. @# ROBIN ' S , or POOR ROBIN ' S , or ROBERT ' S PLANTAIN ; BLUE SPRING DAISY ; DAISY-LEAVED FLEABANE ( Erigeron pulchellus ; E. bellifolium of Gray ) Thistle family @# Flower-heads - Composite , daisy-like , 1 to 1/2 in. across ; the outer circle of about 50 pale bluish-violet ray florets ; the disk florets greenish yellow .

In union there is strength . Each floret still contains , however , its own tiny drop of nectar , its own stamens , its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when an insect alights where he can get the greatest amount of nectar for the least effort , and turns round and round to exhaust each nectary , he is sure to dust the pistils with pollen , and so fertilize an entire flower-head in a trice . The lavender fringe and the hairy involucre and stem serve the end of discouraging crawling insects , which can not transfer pollen from plant to plant , from pilfering sweets that can not be properly paid for . Small wonder that , although the composites have attained to their socialistic practices at a comparatively recent day as evolutionists count time , they have become as individuals and as species the most numerous in the world ; the thistle family , dominant everywhere , containing not less than ten thousand members. @# COMMON or PHILADELPHIA FLEABANE , or SKEVISH ( E. Philadelphicus ) , a smaller edition of Robin ' s plantain , with a more findely cut fringe , its reddish-purple ray florets often numbering one hundred and fifty , may be found in low fields and woods throughout North America , except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family @# Is land fulfilling the primal curse because it brings forth thistles ? So thinks the farmer , no doubt , but not the goldfinches which daintily feed among the fluffy seeds , nor the bees , nor the " painted lady , " which may be seen in all parts of the world where thistles grow , hovering about the beautiful rose-purple flowers . In the prickly cradle of leaves , the caterpillar of this thistle butterfly weaves a web around its main food store. @# When the Danes invaded Scotland , they stole a silent night march upon the Scottish camp by marching barefoot ; but a Dane inadvertently stepped on a thistle , and his sudden , sharp cry , arousing the sleeping Scots , saved them and their country : hence the Scotch emblem. @# From July to November blooms the COMMON , BURR , SPEAR , PLUME , BANK , HORSE , BULL , BLUE , BUTTON , BELL , or ROADSIDE THISTLE ( C. lanceolatus or Circium lanceolatum of Gray ) , a native of Europe and Asia , now a most thoroughly naturalized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its violet flower-heads , about an inch and a half across , and as high as wide , are mostly solitary at the ends of formidable branches , up which few crawling creatures venture . But in the deep tube of each floret there is nectar secreted for the flying visitor who can properly transfer pollen from flower to flower . Such a one suffers no inconvenience from the prickles , but , on the contrary , finds a larger feast saved for him because of them . Dense , matted , wool-like hairs , that cover the bristling stems of most thistles , make climbing mighty unpleasant for ants , which ever delight in pilfering sweets . Perhaps one has the temerity to start upward. @# " Fain would I climb , yet fear to fall . " " If thy heart fail thee , climb not at all , " @# might be the ant ' s passionate outburst to the thistle , and the thistle ' s reply , instead of a Sir Walter and Queen Elizabeth couplet . Long , lance-shaped , deeply cleft , sharply pointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unendurable ; nevertheless the ant bravely mounts to where the bristle-pointed , overlapping scales of the deep green cup hold the luscious flowers . Now his feet becoming entangled in the cottony fibers wound about the scaly armor , and a bristling bodyguard thrusting spears at him in his struggles to escape , death happily releases him . All this tragedy to insure the thistle ' s cross-fertilized seed that , seated on the autumn winds , shall be blown far and wide in quest of happy conditions for the offspring ! @# Sometimes the PASTURE or FRAGRANT THISTLE ( C. odoratus or C. pumilum of Gray ) still further protects its beautiful , odorous purple or whitish flower-head , that often measures three inches across , with a formidable array of prickly small leaves just below it . In case a would-be pilferer breaks through these lines , however , there is a slight glutinous strip on the outside of the bracts that compose the cup wherein the nectar-filled florets are packed ; and here , in sight of Mecca , he meets his death , just as a bird @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose range is only from Maine to Delaware , blooms from July to September. @# Even gentle Professor Gray hurls anathema at the CANADA THISTLE ; " a vile pest " he calls it . As CURSED , CORN , HARD , and CREEPING THISTLE it is variously known here and in Europe , whence it came to overrun our land from Newfoundland to Virginia , westward to Nebraska . By horizontal rootstocks it creeps and forms patches almost impossible to eradicate . The small reddish-purple flower-heads , barely an inch across , usually contain about a hundred florets each . In their tubes the abundant nectar rises high , so that numerous insects , even with the shortest tongues , are able to enjoy it . Not only bees and butterflies , but wasps , flies , and beetles feast diligently . When a floret opens , a quantity of pollen emerges at the upper end of the anther cylinder , pressed up by the growing style . Owing to their slight stickiness and the sharp processes over their entire surface , the pollen grains , which readily cling to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hairy stigma of an older floret . But even should insects not visit the flower ( and in fine weather they swarm about it ) , it is marvelously adapted to fertilize itself . Farmers may well despair of exterminating a plant so perfectly equipped in every part ; to win life ' s battles. @# " The colour of purple. . . was , amongst the ancients , typical of royalty . It was a kind of red richly shot with blue , and the dye producing it was attained from a shell found in considerable numbers off the coast of Tyre , and on the shore near the site of that ancient city , great heaps of such shells are still to be found . The production of the true royal purple dye was a very costly affair , and therefore it was often imitated with a mixture of cochineal and indigo. . . " - J.

" - JULIAN HAWTHORNE. @# " A plant is not to be studied as an absolutely dead thing , but rather as a sentient being . . . . To measure petals , to count stamens , to describe pistils without reference to their functions , or the why and wherefore of their existence , is to content one ' s self with husks in the presence of a feast of fatness - to listen to the rattle of dry bones rather than the heavenly harmonies of life . We have reason to be profoundly thankful for the signs to be seen on every side , that the dreary stuff which was called botany in the teaching of the past will soon cease to masquerade in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s children will study not dried specimens or drier books , but the living things which Nature furnishes in such profusion. . . . @# " The reason of this radical change is not far to seek .

He sees in each of the millions of living forms with which the earth is teeming , the action of many of the laws which are operating in himself ; and has learned that to a great extent his welfare is dependent on these seemingly insignificant relations ; that in ways undreamed of a century ago they affect human progress.

Presently he has feasted enough . Now one can hear him buzzing about inside , trying to find a way out of the trap . Toward the two little gleams of light through apertures at the end of a passage beyond the nectary hairs , he at length finds his way . Narrower and narrower grows the passage until it would seem as if he could never struggle through ; nor can he until his back has rubbed along the sticky , overhanging stigma , which is furnished with minute , rigid , sharply pointed papillae , all directed forward , and placed there for the express purpose of combing out the pollen he has brought from another flower on his back or head .

The smallest bees can squeeze through the passage without paying toll . To those of the Andrena and Halictus tribe the flower is evidently best adapted . Sometimes the largest bumblebees , either unable or unwilling to get out by the legitimate route , bite their way to liberty . Mutilated sacs are not uncommon .

No other blossoms can so well afford to wear magenta , the ugliest shade nature produces , the " lovely rosy purple " of Dutch bulb growers , a color that has an unpleasant effect on not a few American stomachs outside of Hoboken. @# But an orchid , from the amazing cleverness of its operations , is attractive under any circumstances to whomever understands it . This earliest member of the family to appear charms the female bumblebee , to whose anatomy it is especially adapted . The males , whose faces are hairy where the females ' are bare , and therefore not calculated to retain the sticky pollen masses , are not yet flying when the showy orchis blooms . Bombus Americanorum , which can drain the longest spurs , B. separatus , B. terricola , and , rarely , butterflies as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The bee alights on the projecting lip , pushes her head into the mouth of the corolla , and , as she sips the nectar from the horn of plenty , ruptures by the slight pressure a membrane of the pouch where two sticky buttons , to which two pollen masses are attached , lie imbedded . Instantly after contact these adhere to the round bare spots on her face , the viscid cement hardening before her head is fairly withdrawn . Now the diverging pollen masses , that look like antennae , fall from the perpendicular , by remarkable power of contraction , to a horizontal attitude , that they may be in the precise position to fertilize the stigma of the next flower visited - just as if they possessed a reasoning intelligence ! Even after all the pollen has been deposited on the sticky stigmas of various blossoms , stump-like caudicles to which the two little sacs were attached have been found still plastered on a long-suffering bee . But so rich in nectar are the moisture-loving orchids that , to obtain a draught , the sticky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a price to pay .

So in she goes , between the platform and the column overhead , pushing first her head , then brushing her back against the stigma just below the end of the thick column that almost closes the passage . Any powdery pollen she brought on her back from another pogonia must now be brushed off against the sticky stigma . Her feast ended , out she backs . And now a wonderful thing happens . The lid of the anther which is at the end of the column , catching in her shoulders , swings outward on its elastic hinge , releasing a little shower of golden dust , which she must carry on the hairs of her head or back until the sticky stigma of the next pogonia entered kindly wipes it off !

He knows that moisture-loving plants secrete the most nectar . When the head of the bee enters the flower to sip , nothing happens ; but as he raises his head to depart , it can not help lifting the lid of the helmet-shaped anther and so letting fall a few soft pellets of pollen on it .

It is a solitary little flower , standing out from the top of a jointed scape that never rises more than six inches from the solid bulb , hidden in the moss , nor boasts more than one nearly round leaf near its base . The blossom itself suggests one of the lady ' s slipper orchids , with its rosy purple , narrow , pointed sepals and petals clustered at the top above a large , sac-shaped , whitish lip . The latter is divided into two parts , heavily blotched with cinnamon brown , and woolly with a patch of yellow hairs near the point of the division . May - June. @# CALOPOGON ; GRASS PINK ( Limodorum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Flowers - Purplish pink , 1 in. long , 3 to 15 around a long , loose spike . Sepals and petals similar , oval , acute ; the lip on upper side of flower is broad at the summit , tapering into a claw , flexible as if hinged , densely bearded on its face with white , yellow , and magenta hairs ( Calopogon = beautiful beard ) . Column below lip ( ovary not twisted in this exceptional case ) ; sticky stigma at summit of column , and just below it a 2-celled anther , each cell containing 2 pollen masses , the grain lightly connected by threads . Scape : 1 to 1 1/2 ft. high , slender , naked . Leaf : Solitary , long , grass-like , from a round bulb arising from bulb of previous year . Preferred Habitat - Swamps , cranberry bogs , and low meadows . Flowering Season - June-July . Distribution - Newfoundland to Florida , and westward to the Mississippi. @# Fortunately this lovely orchid , one of the most interesting of its highly organized family , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pogonia and other bog-loving relatives growing , the calopogon usually outnumbers them all . Limodorum translated reads meadow-gift ; but we find the flower less frequently in grassy places than those who have waded into its favorite haunts could wish. @# Owing to the crested lip being oddly situated on the upper part of the flower , which appears to be growing upside down in consequence , one might suppose a visiting insect would not choose to alight on it . The pretty club-shaped , vari-colored hairs , which he may mistake for stamens , and which keep his feet from slipping , irresistibly invite him there , however , when , presto ! down drops the fringed lip with startling suddenness . Of course , the bee strikes his back against the column when he falls . Now , there are two slightly upturned little wings on either side of the column , which keep his body from slipping off at either side and necessitate its exit from the end where the stigma smears it with viscid matter . The pressure of the insect on this part starts the pollen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bee slides off the end of the column , the exposed , cobwebby threads to which the pollen grains are attached cling to his sticky body . The sticky substance instantly hardening , the pollen masses , which are drawn out from their pocket as he escapes , are cemented to his abdomen in the precise spot where they must strike against the stigma of the next calopogon he tumbles in ; hence cross-fertilization results . What recompense does the bee get for such rough handling ? None at all , so far as is known . The flower , which secretes no nectar , is doubtless one of those gay deceivers that Sprengel named " Scheinsaftblumen , " only it leads its visitors to look for pollen instead of nectar , on the supposition that the club-shaped hairs on the crests are stamens . The wonder is that the intelligent little bees ( a species of Andrenidae ) , which chiefly are its Victims , have not yet learned to boycott it. @# " Calopogon , " says Professor Robertson , who knows more about the fertilization of American wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a few flowers which move the insect toward the stigma . . . . There is no expenditure in keeping up a supply of nectar , and the flower , although requiring a smooth insect of a certain size and weight , suffers nothing from the visits of those it can not utilize . Then , there is no delay caused by the insect waiting to suck ; but as soon as it alights it is thrown down against the stigma . This occurs so quickly that , while standing net in hand , I have seen insects effect pollination and escape before I could catch them . So many orchids fasten their pollinia upon the faces and tongues of insects that it is interesting to find one which applies them regularly to the first abdominal segment . Mr. Darwin has observed that absence of hair on the tongues of Lepidoptera ( butterflies and moths ) and on the faces of Hymenoptera ( bees ; wasps , etc. ) has led to the more usual adaptations , and sparseness of hair has its influence in this case . Species of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These bees are very smooth , depending for ornament on the metallic sheen of their bodies . An Halictus repeatedly pulled down the labella ( lips ) of flowers from which pollinia had not been removed ; and the only reason I can assign for its failure to extract pollinia is that it is more hairy than the Augochlora. @# COMMON PERSICARIA , PINK KNOTWEED , or JOINT-WEED ; SMARTWEED ( Polygonum Pennsylvanicum ) Buckwheat family @# Flowers - Very small , pink , collected in terminal , dense , narrow , obtuse spikes , 1 to 2 in. long . Calyx pink or greenish , 5-parted , like petals ; no corolla ; stamens 8 or less ; style 2-parted . Stem : 1 to 3 ft. high , simple or branched , often partly red , the joints swollen and sheathed ; the branches above , and peduncles glandular . Leaves : Oblong , lance-shaped , entire edged , 2 to 11 in. long , with stout midrib , sharply tapering at tip , rounded into short petioles below . Preferred Habitat - Waste places , roadsides , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nova Scotia to the Gulf of Mexico ; westward to Texas and Minnesota. @# Everywhere we meet this commonest of plants or some of its similar kin , the erect pink spikes brightening roadsides , rubbish heaps , fields , and waste places , from midsummer to frost . The little flowers , which open without method anywhere on the spike they choose , attract many insects , the smaller bees ( Andrena ) conspicuous among the host . As the spreading divisions of the perianth make nectar-stealing all too easy for ants and other crawlers that would not come in contact with anthers and stigma where they enter a flower near its base , most buckwheat plants whose blossoms secrete sweets protect themselves from theft by coating the upper stems with glandular hairs that effectually discourage the pilferers . Shortly after fertilization , the little rounded , flat-sided fruit begins to form inside the persistent pink calyx . At any time the spike-like racemes contain more bright pink buds and shining seeds than flowers . Familiarity alone breeds contempt for this plant , that certainly possesses much beauty. @# The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a troublesome weed , roams over the whole of North America , except at the extreme north - another illustration of the riotous profusion of European floral immigrants rejoicing in the easier struggle for existence here . Its pink spikes are shorter and less slender than those of the preceding taller , but similar species , and its leaves , which are nearly seated on the stem , have dark triangular or lunar marks near the center in the majority of cases. @# An insignificant little plant , found all over our continent , Europe , and Asia , is the familiar KNOT-GRASS or DOORWEED ( P. aviculare ) , often trailing its leafy , jointed stems over the ground , but at times weakly erect , to display its tiny greenish or white pink-edged flowers , clustered in the axils of oblong , bluish-green leaves that are considerably less than an inch long . Although in bloom from June to October , insects seldom visit it , for it secretes very little , if any , nectar .

But suppose the pond dries up and the plant is left on dry ground , what then ? Now , a remarkable thing happens : protective glandular , sticky hairs appear on the epidermis of the leaves and stems , which were perfectly smooth when the flowers grew in water . Such small wingless insects as might pilfer nectar without bringing to their hostess any pollen from other blossoms are held as fast as on bird-lime . The stem , which sometimes floats , sometimes is immersed , may attain a length of twenty feet ; the rounded , elliptic , petioled leaves may be four inches long or only half that size . From Quebec to New Jersey , and westward to the Pacific , the solitary , showy inflorescence , which does well to attain a height of an inch , may be found during July and August. @# Throughout the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of small , pale pink , flesh-colored , or greenish flowers are sent upward by the MILD WATER PEPPER ( P. hydropiperoides ) . It is like a slender , pale variety of the common pink persicaria . One finds its inconspicuous , but very common , flowers from June to September . The plant , which grows in shallow water , swamps , and moist places throughout the Union and considerably north and south of it , rises three feet or less . The cylindric sheaths around the swollen joints of the stem are fringed with long bristles - a clue to identification . Another similar WATER PEPPER or SMARTWEED ( P. hydropiper ) is so called because of its acrid , biting juice. @# The CLIMBING FALSE BUCKWHEAT ( P. scandens ) straggles over bushes in woods , thickets , and by the waysides throughout a very wide range ; yet its small , dull , greenish-yellow and pinkish flowers , loosely clustered in long pedicelled racemes , are so inconspicuous during August and September , when the showy composites are in their glory , that we give them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart-shaped at the base and pointed at the lip , suggesting those of the morning glory , are on petioles arising from sheaths over the enlarged joints which , in this family , are always a most prominent characteristic - ( Poly = many , gonum = a knee ) . The three outer sepals , keeled when in flower , are irregularly winged when the three-angled , smooth achene hangs from the matured blossom in autumn , the season at which the vine assumes its greatest attractiveness. @# The ARROW-LEAVED TEAR THUMB ( P. sagittatum ) , found in ditches and swampy wet soil , weakly leans on other plants , or climbs over them with the help of the many sharp , recurved prickles which arm its four-angled stem . Even the petioles and underside of the leaf ' s midrib are set with prickles . The light green leaves , that combine the lance and the arrow shapes , take on a beautiful russet-red tint in autumn .

Very slender racemes of tiny , nodding , rose-tinted white flowers , with a dark midrib to each of the five calyx segments , are insignificant of themselves ; but when seen in masses , from July to October , they tinge the upper beaches and sandy meadows with a pink blush that not a few artists have transferred to the foreground of their marine pictures. @# CORN COCKLE ; CORN ROSE ; CORN or RED CAMPION ; CROWN-OF-THE-FIELD ( Agrostemma Githago ; Lychnis Githago of Gray ) Pink family @# Flowers - Magenta or bright purplish crimson , to 3 in. broad , solitary at end of long , stout footstem ; 5 lobes of calyx leaf-like , very long and narrow , exceeding petals .

Also in Europe and Asia. @# " Allons ! allons ! sow ' d cockle , reap ' d no corn , " exclaims Biron in " Love ' s Labor Lost . " Evidently the farmers even in Shakespeare ' s day counted this brilliant blossom the pest it has become in many of our own grain fields just as it was in ancient times , when Job , after solemnly protesting his righteousness , called on his own land to bear record against him if his words were false . " Let thistles grow instead of wheat , and cockle instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the First ' s translators ; but the " noisome weeds " of the original text seem to indicate that these good men were more anxious to give the English people an adequate conception of Job ' s willingness to suffer for his honor ' s sake than to translate literally . Possibly the cockle grew in Southern Asia in Job ' s time : today its range is north. @# Like many another immigrant to our hospitable shores , this vigorous invader shows a tendency to outstrip native blossoms in life ' s race . Having won in the struggle for survival in the old country , where the contest has been most fiercely waged for centuries , it finds life here easy , enjoyable . What are its methods for insuring an abundance of fertile seed ? We see that the tube of the flower is so nearly closed by the stamens and five-styled pistil as to be adapted only to the long , slender tongues of moths and butterflies , for which benefactors it became narrow and deep to reserve the nectar . " A certain night-flying moth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genus exclusively , and its larvae feed on their unripe seeds as a staple . Bees and some long-tongued flies seen about the corn cockle doubtless get pollen only ; but there are few flowers so deep that the longest-tongued bees can not sip them . Butterflies , attracted by the bright color of the flower - and to them color is the most catchy of advertisements - are guided by a few dark lines on the petals to the nectary. @# Soon after the blossom opens , five of the stamens emerge from the tube and shed their pollen on the early visitor . Later , the five other stamens empty the contents of their anthers on more tardy comers . Finally , when all danger of self-fertilization is past , the styles stretch upward , and the butterfly , whose head is dusted with pollen brought from earlier flowers , necessarily leaves some on their sticky surfaces as he takes the leavings in the nectary. @# So much cross-fertilized seed as the plant now produces and scatters through the grain fields may well fill the farmer ' s prosaic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the scarlet of the poppy comparable with the glitter of a silver dollar ; no charm in the heavenly blue of the corn-flower , that likewise preys upon the fertility of his soil ; the vivid flecks of color with which the cockle lights up his fields mean only loss of productiveness in the earth that would yield him greater profit without them . Moreover , seeds of this so-called weed not only darken his wheat when they are threshed out together , but are positively injurious if swallowed in any quantity . Emerson said every plant is called a weed until its usefulness is discovered . Linnaeus called this flower Agrostemma = the crown-of-the-field . Agriculturalists never realize that beauty is in itself a sufficient plea for respected existence . Not a few of the cockle ' s relatives adorn men ' s gardens. @# WILD PINK or CATCHFLY ( Silene Caroliniana ; S.

Alas , for the tiny creatures that try to climb up the rosy tufts to pilfer nectar , they and their relatives are not so innocent as they appear ! While the little crawlers are almost within reach of the cup of sweets , their feet are gummed to the viscid matter that coats it , and here their struggles end as flies ' do on sticky fly-paper , or birds ' on limed twigs .

All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , in sipping it , transfer the pollen from one flower to another , and so help them to produce the most beautiful and robust offspring. @# The pink , which has two sets of stamens of five each , elevates first one set , then the other , for economy ' s sake and to run less risk of failure to get its pollen transferred in case of rain when its friends are not flying . After all the golden dust has been shed , however , up come the three recurved styles from the depth of the tube to receive pollen brought by butterflies from younger flowers . There are few cups so deep that the largest bumblebees can not suck them . Flies which feed on the pink ' s pollen only , sometimes come by mistake to older blossoms in the stigmatic stage , and doubtless cross-fertilize them once in a while. @# In waste places and woods farther southward and westward , and throughout the range of the Wild Pink as well , clusters of the SLEEPY CATCHFLY ( S. antirrhina ) open their tiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At any stage they are mostly calyx , but in fruit this part is much expanded . Swollen , sticky joints are the plant ' s means of defense from crawlers . Season : Summer. @# When moths begin their rounds at dusk , the NIGHT-FLOWERING CATCHFLY ( S. noctiflora ) opens its pinkish or white flowers to emit a fragrance that guides them to a feast prepared for them alone . Day-blooming catchflies have no perfume , nor do they need it ; their color and markings are a sufficient guide to the butterflies . Sticky hairs along the stems of this plant ruthlessly destroy , not flies , but ants chiefly , that would pilfer nectar without being able to render the flower any service . Yet the calyx is beautifully veined , as if to tantalize the crawlers by indicating the path to a banquet hail they may never reach .

Underground runners and abundant seed soon form thrifty colonies . This plant , to which our grandmothers ascribed healing virtues , makes a cleansing , soap-like lather when its bruised leaves are agitated in water. @# Butterflies , which delight in bright colors and distinct markings , find little to charm them here ; but the pale shade of pink or white , easily distinguished in the dark , and the fragrance , strongest after sunset , effectively advertise the flower at dusk when its benefactors begin to fly . The sphinx moth , a frequent visitor , works as rapidly in extracting nectar from the deep tube as any hawk moth , so frequently mistaken for a hummingbird . The little cliff-dwelling bees ( Halictus ) , among others , visit the flowers by day for pollen only . At first five outer stamens protrude slightly from the flower and shed their pollen on the visitor , immediately over the entrance . Afterward , having spread apart to leave the entrance free , the path is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course . Now the styles are still enclosed in the tube but when there is no longer fear of self-fertilization - that is to say , when the pollen has all been carried off , and the stamens have withered - up they come and spread apart to expose their rough upper surfaces to pollen brought from younger flowers by the moths. @# DEPTFORD PINK ( Dianthus Armeria ) Pink family @# Flowers - Pink , with whitish dots , small , borne in small clusters at end of stem .

The Deptford pink , a rather insignificant little European immigrant , without fragrance , has a decided charm , nevertheless , when seen in bright patches among the dry grass of early autumn , with small butterflies , that are its devoted admirers , hovering above. @# PINK OR PALE CORYDALIS ( Capnoides sempervirens ; Corydalis glauca of Gray ) Poppy family @# Flowers - Pink , with yellow tip , about 1/2 in. long , a few borne in a loose , terminal raceme .

Because the lark ( Korydalos ) has a spur , the flower , which boasts a small one also , borrows its Greek name. @# Hildebrand proved by patient experiments that some flowers of this genus have not only lost the power of self-fertilization , but that they produce fertile seed only when pollen from another plant is carried to them .

But most spireas are also able to fertilize themselves , insects failing them. @# An instant ' s comparison shows the steeple bush to be closely related to the fleecy , white meadow-sweet , often found growing near .

When the upper leaf surface is hairy , we know that the plant is protected in this way from perspiring too freely . Doubtless these leaves of the steeple bush , like those of other plants that choose a similar habitat , have woolly hairs beneath as an absorbent to protect their pores from clogging with the vapors that must rise from the damp ground where the plant grows . If these pores were filled with moisture from without , how could they possibly throw off the waste of the plant ? All plants are largely dependent upon free perspiration for health , but especially those whose roots , struck in wet ground , are constantly sending up moisture through the stem and leaves. @# PURPLE-FLOWERING OR VIRGINIA RASPBERRY ( Rubus odoratus ) Rose family @# Flowers - Royal purple or bluish pink , showy , fragrant , 1 to 2 in. broad , loosely clustered at top of stem .

Preferred Habitat - Rocky woods , dells , shady roadsides . Flowering Season - June-August . Distribution - Northern Canada south to Georgia , westward to Michigan and Tennessee. @# To be an unappreciated , unloved relative of the exquisite wild rose , with which this flower is so often likened , must be a similar misfortune to being the untalented son of a great man , or the unhappy author of a successful first book never equaled in later attempts . But where the bright blossoms of the Virginia raspberry burst forth above the roadside tangle and shady woodland dells , even those who despise magenta see beauty in them where abundant green tones all discordant notes into harmony . Purple , as we of today understand the color , the flower is not ; but rather the purple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ petals are a deep , clear purplish rose , that soon fades and dulls with age , or changes into pale , bluish pink when the sun is hot. @# Many yellow stamens help conceal the nectar secreted in a narrow ring between the filaments and the base of the receptacle . Bumblebees , the principal and most efficient visitors , which can reach sweets more readily than most insects , although numerous others help to self-fertilize the flower , bring to the mature stigmas of a newly opened blossom pollen carried on their undersides from the anthers of a flower a day or two older . When the inner row of anthers shed their pollen , some doubtless falls on the stigmas below them , and so spontaneous self-fertilization may occur . Fruit sets quickly ; nevertheless the shrub keeps on flowering nearly all summer . Children often fold the lower leaves , which sometimes measure a foot across , to make drinking-cups. @# QUEEN-OF-THE-PRAIRIE ( Ulmaria rubra ; Spirea lobata of Gray ) Rose family @# Flowers - Deep pink , like the peach blossom , fragrant , about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long footstalk .

Indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as bees have for blue flowers .

Most of our fruit trees and bushes are near relatives of the rose . Five petals and five sepals , then , we always find on roses in a state of nature ; and although the progressive gardener of today has nowhere shown his skill more than in the development of a multitude of petals from stamens in the magnificent roses of fashionable society , the most highly cultivated darling of the greenhouses quickly reverts to the original wild type , setting his work of years at naught , if once it regain its natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eaten by hungry cattle , the rose goes armed into the battle of life with curved , sharp prickles , not true thorns or modified branches , but merely surface appliances which peel off with the bark . To destroy crawling pilferers of pollen , several species coat their calices , at least , with fine hairs or sticky gum ; and to insure wide distribution of offspring , the seeds are packed in the attractive , bright red calyx tube or hip , a favorite food of many birds , which drop them miles away . When shall we ever learn that not even a hair has been added to or taken from a blossom without a lawful cause , and study it accordingly ? Fragrance , abundant pollen , and bright-colored petals naturally attract many insects ; but roses secrete no nectar . Some species of bees , and a common beetle ( Trichius piger ) for example , seem to depend upon certain wild roses exclusively for pollen to feed themselves and their larvae . Bumblebees , to which roses are adapted , require a firmer support than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ center of the flower , where the pistil receives pollen carried by them from other roses . Although the numerous stamens and the pistils mature simultaneously , the former are usually turned outward , that the incoming pollen-laden insect may strike the stigma first . When the large bees cease their visits as they may in long-continued dull or rainy weather , the rose , turning toward the sun , stands more or less obliquely , and some of the pollen must fall on its stigma . Occasional self-fertilization matters little. @# If plants have insect benefactors , they have their foes as well and hordes of tiny aphids , commonly known as green flies or plant lice , moored by their sucking tubes to the tender sprays of roses , wild and cultivated , live by extracting their juices . A curious relationship exists between these little creatures and the ants , which " milk " them by stroking and caressing them with their antennae until they emit a tiny drop of sweet , white fluid . The yellow ant , that lives an almost subterranean life , actually domesticates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appropriates those that live among the bark of trees ; and the common black garden ant ( Lasius niger ) , devoting itself to the aphis of the rose bushes , protects it in extraordinary ways , delightfully described by the author of " Ants , Bees , and Wasps. " @# In literature , ancient and modern , sacred and profane , no flower figures so conspicuously as the rose . To the Romans it was most significant when placed over the door of a public or private banquet hall . Each who passed beneath it bound himself thereby not to disclose anything said or done within ; hence the expression sub rosa , common to this day. @# The PRAIRIE , CLIMBING , or MICHIGAN ROSE ( R. setigera ) lifts clusters of deep , bright pink flowers , that after a while fade almost white , above the thickets and rich prairie soil , from southern Ontario and Wisconsin to the Gulf , as far eastward as Florida . Its distinguishing characteristics are : Stout , widely separated prickles along the stem , that grows several feet long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaflets , acute or obtuse at the apex ; stalks and calyx often glandular ; odorless flowers that , opening in June and July , measure about two and a half inches across , their styles cohering in a smooth column on which bees are tempted to alight ; and a round hip , or seed vessel , formed by the fruiting calyx , which is more or less glandular . From this parent stock several valuable double-flowering roses have been derived , among others the Queen and the Gem of the Prairies , but it is our only native rose that has ever passed into cultivation. @# The SMOOTH , EARLY , or MEADOW ROSE ( R. blanda ) , found blooming in June and July in moist , rocky places from Newfoundland to New Jersey and a thousand miles westward , has a trifle larger and slightly fragrant flowers , at first pink , later pure white . Their styles are separate , not cohering in a column nor projecting as in the climbing rose . This is a leafy , low bush mostly less than three feet high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with only a few weak prickles ; the stipules are rather broad , and the leaf is compounded of from five to seven oval , blunt , and pale green leaflets , often hoary below. @# In swamps and low wet ground from Quebec to Florida , and westward to the Mississippi , the SWAMP ROSE ( R. Carolina ) blooms late in May and on to midsummer . The bush may grow taller than a man , or perhaps only a foot high . It is armed with stout , hooked , rather distant prickles , and few or no bristles . The leaflets , from five to nine , but usually seven , to a leaf , are smooth , pale , or perhaps hairy beneath to protect the pores from filling with moisture arising from the wet ground . Long , sharp calyx lobes , which drop off before the cup swells in fruit into a round , glandular , hairy red hip , are conspicuous among the clustered pink flowers and buds. @# Surely no description of our COMMON , LOW , DWARF , or PASTURE ROSE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed . One ' s acquaintance with flowers must be limited indeed , if it does not include this most abundant of all the wild roses from Ontario to Georgia , and westward to Wisconsin . In light , dry , or rocky soil we find the exquisite , but usually solitary , blossom late in May until July , and , like most roses , it has the pleasant practice of putting forth a stray blossom or two in early autumn . The stamens of this species are turned outward so strongly that self- pollination must very rarely take place. @# Among the following charming wild roses , not natives , but naturalized immigrants from foreign lands , that have escaped from gardens , is Shakespeare ' s CANKER-BLOOM , the lovely DOG ROSE or WILD BRIER ( R. canina ) , that spreads its long , straggling branches along the roadsides and banks , covering the waste lands with its smooth , beautiful foliage , and in June and July with pink or white roses . Because it lacks the fragrance of sweetbrier , which it otherwise closely resembles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mark of contempt . Professor Koch says that long before it was customary to surround gardens with walls , men had rose hedges . " Each of the four great peoples of Asia , " he continues , " possessed its own variety of rose , and carried it during all wanderings , until finally all four became the common property of the four peoples . The great Indo-Germanic stock chose the ' hundred-leaved ' and RED ROSE ( R. Gallica ) ; nevertheless , after the Niebelungen the common dog rose played an important part among the ancient Germans . The DAMASCUS ROSE ( R. Damascena ) , which blooms twice a year , as well as the MUSK ROSE ( R. moschata ) , were cherished by the Semitic or Arabic stock ; while the Turkish-Mongolian people planted by preference the YELLOW ROSE ( R. lutea ) . Eastern Asia ( China and Japan ) is the fatherland of the INDIAN and TEA ROSES. " @# How fragrant are the pages of Chaucer , Spenser , and Shakespeare with the Eglantine ! This delicious plant , known here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aromatic odor from russet glands on the under , downy side of the small leaflets , always a certain means of identification . From eastern Canada to Virginia and Tennessee the plant has happily escaped from man ' s gardens back to Nature ' s. @# In spite of its American Indian name , the lovely white CHEROKEE ROSE ( R. Sinica ) , that runs wild in the South , climbing , rambling and rioting with a truly Oriental abandon and luxuriance , did indeed come from China . Would that our northern thickets and roadsides might be decked with its pure flowers and almost equally beautiful dark , glossy , evergreen leaves ! @# COMMON RED , PURPLE , MEADOW , or HONEYSUCKLE CLOVER ( Trifolium pratense ) Pea family @# Flowers - Magenta , pink , or rarely whitish , sweet-scented , the tubular corollas set in dense round , oval , or egg-shaped heads about 1 in. long , and seated in a sparingly hairy calyx . Stem : 6 in. to 2 ft. high , branching , reclining , or erect , more or less hairy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 , but sometimes of 4 to 11 oval or oblong leaflets , marked with white crescent , often dark-spotted near center ; stipules egg-shaped , sharply pointed , strongly veined , over 1/2 in. long . Preferred Habitat - Fields , meadows , roadsides . Flowering Season - April-November . Distribution - Common throughout Canada and United States. @# Meadows bright with clover-heads among the grasses , daisies , and buttercups in June resound with the murmur of unwearying industry and rapturous enjoyment . Bumblebees by the tens of thousands buzzing above acres of the farmer ' s clover blossoms should be happy in a knowledge of their benefactions , which doubtless concern them not at all . They have never heard the story of the Australians who imported quantities of clover for fodder , and had glorious fields of it that season , but not a seed to plant next year ' s crops , simply because the farmers had failed to import the bumblebee . After her immigration the clovers multiplied prodigiously . No ; the bee ' s happiness rests on her knowledge that only the butterflies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wells of nectar in each tiny floret . Children who have sucked them too appreciate her rapture . If we examine a little flower under the magnifying glass , we shall see why its structure places it in the pea family . Bumblebees so depress the keel either when they sip , or feed on pollen , that their heads and tongues get well dusted with the yellow powder , which they transfer to the stigmas of other flowers ; whereas the butterflies are of doubtful value , if not injurious , since their long , slender tongues easily drain the nectar without depressing the keel . Even if a few grains of pollen should cling to their tongues , it would probably be wiped off as they withdrew them through the narrow slit , where the petals nearly meet , at the mouth of the flower . Bombus terrestris delights in nipping holes at the base of the tube , which other pilferers also profit by . Our country is so much richer in butterflies than Europe , it is scarcely surprising that Professor Robertson found thirteen Lepidoptera out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Muller caught only eight butterflies on it out of a list of thirty-nine visitors in Germany . The fritillaries and the sulphurs are always seen about the clover fields among many others , and the " dusky wings " and the caterpillar of several species feeds almost exclusively on this plant. @# " To live in clover , " from the insect ' s point of view at least , may well mean a life of luxury and affluence . Most peasants in Europe will tell you that a dream about the flower foretells not only a happy marriage , but long life and prosperity . For ages the clover has been counted a mystic plant , and all sorts of good and bad luck were said to attend the finding of variations of its leaves which had more than the common number of leaflets . At evening these leaflets fold downward , the side ones like two hands clasped in prayer , the end one bowed over them . In this fashion the leaves of the white and other clovers also go to sleep , to protect their sensitive surfaces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ZIG-ZAG CLOVER , COW or MARL-GRASS ( T. Medium ) , a native of Europe and Asia , now naturalized in the eastern half of the United States and Canada , may scarcely be told from the common red clover , except by its crooked , angular stems - often provokingly straight - by its unspotted leaves , and the short peduncle in which its heads are elevated above the calyx. @# Farmers here are beginning to learn the value of the beautiful CRIMSON , CARNATION or ITALIAN CLOVER or NAPOLEONS ( T. incarnatum ) , and happily there are many fields and waste places in the East already harboring the brilliant runaways . The narrow heads may be two and a half inches long . A meadow of this fodder plant makes one envious of the very cattle that may spend the summer day wading through acres of its deep bright bloom. @# GOAT ' S RUE ; CAT-GUT ; HOARY PEA or WILD SWEET PEA ( Cracca Virginiana ; Tephrosia Virginiana of Gray ) Pea family @# Flowers - In terminal cluster , each 1/2 in. long or over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purplish-rose wings , and curved keel of greenish yellow tinged with rose ; petals clawed ; 10 stamens ( 9 and 1 ) ; calyx 5-toothed . Stem : Hoary , with white , silky hairs , rather woody , 1 to 2 feet high . Leaves : Compounded of 7 to 25 oblong leaflets . Root : Long , fibrous , tough . Fruit : A hoary , narrow pod , to 2 in. long . Preferred Habitat - Dry , sandy soil , edges of pine woods . Flowering Season - June-July . Distribution - Southern New England , westward to Minnesota , south to Florida , Louisiana , and Mexico. @# Flowers far less showy and attractive than this denizen of sandy wastelands , a cousin of the wisteria vine and the locust tree , have been introduced to American gardens . Striking its long fibrous root deep into the dry soil , the plant spreads in thrifty clumps through heat and drought - and so tough are its fibers they might almost be used for violin strings . As in the case of the lupine , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaves of the hoary pea " go to sleep " at night , but after a manner of their own , i. e. , by lying along the stem and turning on their own bases. @# In similar situations from New York south and southwestward , the MILK PEA ( Galactia regularis ; G. glabella of Gray ) lies prostrate along the ground , the matted , usually branched stems sending up at regular intervals a raceme of rose-purple flowers in July and August from the axil of the trefoliate leaf. @# TRAILING BUSH CLOVER ( Lespedeza procumbens ) Pea family @# Flowers - Purplish pink or violet , veined , the butterfly-shaped ones having standard petal , wings , and keel , clustered at end of peduncles ; the minute flowers lacking a corolla , nearly sessile . Calyx of 5 slender , nearly equal lobes . Stems : Prostrate , trailing , or sometimes ascending , woolly or downy , leafy . Leaves : Clover-like , trefoliate . Fruit : A very small , hairy , flat , rounded , acute pod . Preferred Habitat - Dry soil open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Massachusetts to the Gulf , and westward to the Mississippi. @# Springing upward from a mass of clover-like leaves , these showy little blossoms elevate themselves to arrest , not our attention , but the notice of the passing bee . As the claw of the standard petal and the calyx are short , he need not have a long tongue to drain the nectary pointed out to him by a triangular white mark at the base of the banner . Now , as his weight depresses the incurved keel , wherein the vital organs are protected , the stigma strikes the visitor in advance of the anthers , so that pollen brought on his underside from another flower must come off on this one before he receives fresh pollen to transfer to a third blossom . At first the keel returns to its original position when depressed ; later it loses its elasticity . But besides these showy flowers intended to be cross-fertilized by insects , the bush clovers bear , among the others , insignificant-looking , tightly closed , bud-like ones that produce abundant self-fertilized seed . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from close inbreeding . One usually finds caterpillars of the " dusky wings " butterfly feeding on the foliage and the similar tick trefoils which are its staple . At night the bush clover leaves turn upward , completely changing the aspect of these plants as we know them by day . Michaux named the group of flowers for his patron , Lespedez , a governor of Florida under the Spanish regime. @# Perhaps the commonest of the tribe is the VIOLET BUSH CLOVER ( L. violacea ) , a variable , branching , erect , or spreading plant , sometimes only a foot high , or again three times as tall . Its thin leaves are more elliptic than the decidedly clover-like ones of the preceding species ; its rose-purple flowers are more loosely clustered , and the stems are only sparingly hairy , never woolly. @# On the top of the erect , usually unbranched , but very leafy stem of the WAND-LIKE BUSH CLOVER ( L. frutescens ) , the two kinds of flowers grow in a crowded cluster , and more sparingly from the axils below . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are paler and hairy below . Like the rest of its kin , this bush clover delights in dry soil , particularly in open , sandy places near woods of pine and oak . One readily distinguishes the SLENDER BUSH CLOVER ( L. Virginica ) by the very narrowly oblong leaves along its wand , which bears two kinds of bright rose flowers , clustered at the top chiefly , and in the axils. @# Yellowish-white flowers , about a quarter of an inch long , and with a purplish-rose spot on the standard petal to serve as a pathfinder to the nectary , are crowded in oblong spikes an inch and a half long or less on the HAIRY BUSH CLOVER ( L. hirta ) . The stem , which may attain four feet , or half that height , is usually branched ; and the entire plant is often downy to the point of silkiness. @# Dense clusters of the yellowish-white flowers of the ROUND-HEADED BUSH CLOVER ( L. capitata ) are seated in the upper axils of the silvery-hairy , wand-like stem . Pink streaks at the base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infolded edges guide the bee ' s tongue straight to the opening in the stamen tube through which he sucks. @# WILD or SPOTTED GERANIUM or CRANE ' S-BILL ; ALUM-ROOT ( Geranium maculatum ) Geranium family @# Flowers - Pale magenta , purplish pink , or lavender , regular , 1 to 1 1/2 in. broad , solitary or a pair , borne on elongated peduncles , generally with pair of leaves at their base . Calyx of 5 lapping , pointed sepals ; 5 petals , woolly at base ; 10 stamens ; pistil with 5 styles . Fruit : A slender capsule pointed like a crane ' s bill . In maturity it ejects seeds elastically far from the parent plant . Stem : 1 to 2 ft. high , hairy , slender , simple or branching above .

Flowering Season - April-July . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles. @# Sprengel , who was the first to exalt flowers above the level of mere botanical specimens , had his attention led to the intimate relationship existing between plants and insects by studying out the meaning of the hairy corolla of the common wild geranium of Germany ( G. sylvaticum ) , being convinced , as he wrote in 1787 , that " the wise Author of Nature has not made even a single hair without a definite design . " A hundred years before , Nehemias Grew had said that it was necessary for pollen to reach the stigma of a flower in order that it might set fertile seed ; and Linnaeus had to come to his aid with conclusive evidence to convince a doubting world that this was true . Sprengel made the next step forward , but his writings lay neglected over seventy years because he advanced the then incredible and only partially true statement that a flower is fertilized by insects which carry its pollen from its anthers to its stigma . In spite of his discoveries that the hairs inside the geranium ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s benefit , just as eyebrows keep perspiration from falling into the eye ; that most flowers which secrete nectar have what he termed " honey guides " - spots of bright color , heavy veining , or some such pathfinder on the petals - in spite of the most patient and scientific research that shed great light on natural selection a half-century before Darwin advanced the theory , he left it for the author of " The Origin of Species " to show that cross-fertilization - the transfer of pollen from one blossom to another , not from anthers to stigma of the same flower - is the great end to which so much marvelous mechanism is chiefly adapted . Cross-fertilized blossoms defeat self-fertilized flowers in the struggle for existence. @# No wonder Sprengel ' s theory was disproved by his scornful contemporaries in the very case of his wild geranium , which sheds its pollen before it has developed a stigma to receive any ; therefore no insect that had not brought pollen from an earlier bloom could possibly fertilize this flower . How amazing that he did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which also has lost the power to fertilize itself , not only ripens first the outer , then the inner , row of anthers , but actually drops them off after their pollen has been removed , to overcome the barest chance of self-fertilization as the stigmas become receptive . This is the geranium ' s and many other flowers ' method to compel cross-fertilization by insects . In cold , stormy , cloudy weather a geranium blossom may remain in the male stage several days before becoming female ; while on a warm , sunny day , when plenty of insects are flying , the change sometimes takes place in a few hours . Among others , the common sulphur or puddle butterfly , that sits in swarms on muddy roads and makes the clover fields gay with its bright little wings , pilfers nectar from the geranium without bringing its long tongue in contact with the pollen . Neither do the smaller bees and flies which alight on the petals necessarily come in contact with the anthers and stigmas . Doubtless the larger bees are the flowers ' true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strictly speaking. @# In barren soil , from Canada to the Gulf , and far westward , the CAROLINA CRANE ' S-BILL ( G. Carolinianum ) , an erect , much-branched little plant resembling the spotted geranium in general features , bears more compact clusters of pale rose or whitish flowers , barely half an inch across . As their inner row of anthers comes very close to the stigmas , spontaneous self-fertilization may sometimes occur ; although in fine weather small bees , especially , visit them constantly . The beak of the seed vessel measures nearly an inch long. @# HERB ROBERT ; RED ROBIN ; RED SHANKS ; DRAGON ' S BLOOD ( Geranium Robertianum ) Geranium family @# Flowers - Purplish rose , about 1/2 in. across , borne chiefly in pairs on slender peduncles . Five sepals and petals ; stamens 10 ; pistil with 5 styles . Stem : Weak , slender , much branched , forked , and spreading , slightly hairy , 6 to i8 in. high . Leaves : Strongly scented , opposite , thin , of 3 divisions , much subdivided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beak 1 in. long , awn-pointed . Preferreed Habitat - Rocky , moist woods and shady roadsides Flowering Season - May-October Distribution - Nova Scotia to Pennsylvania , and westward to Missouri. @# Who was the Robert for whom this his " holy herb " was named ? Many suppose that he was St. Robert , a Benedictine monk , to whom the twenty-ninth of April - the day the plant comes into flower in Europe - is dedicated . Others assert that Robert Duke of Normandy , for whom the " Ortus Sanitatis , " a standard medical guide for some hundred of years , was written , is the man honored ; and since there is now no way of deciding the mooted question , we may take our choice. @# Only when the stems are young are they green ; later the plant well earns the name of red shanks , and when its leaves show crimson stains , of dragon ' s blood. @# At any time the herb gives forth a disagreeable odor , but especially when its leaves and stem have been crushed until they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plague . Flies , that never object to a noxious smell , constantly visit the flower , and have their tongues guided through passages between little ridge-like processes on each petal to the nectar secreted by the base of the filaments at the base of each sepal . To prevent self-fertilization the five stigmas are folded close together when the flower opens , nor do they spread apart and become receptive until after the outer row of anthers , then the inner row , have shed their pollen . When the elastic carpels have ripened their seed , bang ! go the little guns , scattering them far and wide. @# WHITE OR TRUE WOODSORREL ; ALLELULA ( Oxalis acetosella ) Wood-sorrel family @# Flowers - White or delicate pink , veined with deep pink , about 1/2 in. long . Five sepals ; 5 spreading petals rounded at tips ; 10 stamens , 5 longer , 5 shorter , all anther-bearing ; 1 pistil with 5 stigmatic styles .

Distribution - Nova Scotia and Manitoba , southward to North Carolina . Also a native of Europe. @# Clumps of these delicate little pinkish blossoms and abundant leaves , cuddled close to the cold earth of northern forests , usually conceal near the dry leaves or moss from which they spring blind flowers that never open - cleistogamous the botanists call them - flowers that lack petals , as if they were immature buds ; that lack odor , nectar , and entrance ; yet they are perfectly mature , self-fertilized , and abundantly fruitful . Fifty-five genera of plants contain one or more species on which these peculiar products are found , the pea family having more than any other , although violets offer perhaps the most familiar instance to most of us . Many of these species bury their offspring below ground ; but the wood-sorrel bears its blind flowers nodding from the top of a curved scape at the base of the plant , where we can readily find them . By having no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to attract insects , and chiefly in saving pollen , they produce seed with literally the closest economy . It is estimated that the average blind flower of the wood-sorrel does its work with four hundred pollen grains , while the prodigal peony scatters with the help of wind and insect visitors over three and a half millions ! @# Yet no plant , however economically inclined , can afford to deteriorate its species through self-fertilization ; therefore , to overcome the evils of in-breeding , the wood-sorrel , like other plants that bear cleistogamous flowers , takes special pains to produce showy blossoms to attract insects , on which they absolutely depend to transfer their pollen from flower to flower . These have their organs so arranged as to make self-fertilization impossible. @# Every child knows how the wood-sorrel " goes to sleep " by drooping its three leaflets until they touch back to back at evening , regaining the horizontal at sunrise - a performance most scientists now agree protects the peculiarly sensitive leaf from cold by radiation . During the day , as well , seedling , scape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed by Darwin in his " Power of Movement in Plants , " which should be read by all interested. @# Oxalis , the Greek for sour , applies to all sorrels because of their acid juice ; but acetosella = vinegar salt , the specific name of this plant , indicates that from it druggists obtain salt of lemons . Twenty pounds of leaves yield between two and three ounces of oxalic acid by crystallization . Names locally given the plant in the Old World are wood sour or sower , cuckoo ' s meat , sour trefoil , and shamrock - for this is St. Patrick ' s own flower , the true shamrock of the ancient Irish , some claim . Alleluia , another folk-name , refers to the joyousness of the Easter season , when the plant comes into bloom in England. @# VIOLET WOOD-SORREL ( Oxalis violacea ) Wood-sorrel family @# Flowers - Pinkish purple , lavender , or pale magenta ; less than 1 in. long ; borne on slender stems in umbels or forking clusters , each containing from 3 to 12 flowers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 5 longer , 5 shorter ) stamens ; 5 styles persistent above 5-celled ovary . Stem : From brownish , scaly bulb 4 to 9 in. high . Leaves : About 1 in. wide , compounded of 3 rounded , clover-like leaflets with prominent midrib , borne at end of slender petioles , springing from root . Preferred Habitat - Rocky and sandy woods . Flowering Season - May-June . Distribution - Northern United States to Rocky Mountains , south to Florida and New Mexico ; more abundant southward. @# Beauty of Leaf and blossom is not the only attraction possessed by this charming little plant . As a family the wood-sorrels have great interest for botanists since Darwin devoted such exhaustive study to their power of movement , and many other scientists have described the several forms assumed by perfect flowers of the same species to secure cross-fertilization . Some members of the clan also bear blind flowers , which have been described in the account of the white wood-sorrel given above . Even the rudimentary leaves of the seedlings " go to sleep " at evening , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The stems , too , are restless ; and as for the mature leaves , every child knows how they droop their three leaflets back to back against the stem at evening , elevating them to the perfect horizontal again by day . Extreme sensitiveness to light has been thought to be the true explanation of so much activity , and yet this is not a satisfactory theory in many cases . It is certain that drooping leaves suffer far less from frost than those whose upper surfaces are flatly exposed to the zenith . This view that the sleep of leaves saves them from being chilled at night by radiation is Darwin ' s own , supported by innumerable experiments ; and probably it would have been advanced by Linnaeus , too , since so many of his observations in " Somnus Plantarum " verify the theory , had the principle of radiation been discovered in his day . The violet wood-sorrel produces two sorts of perfect flowers reciprocally adapted to each other , but on different plants in the same neighborhood . The two are essentially alike , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having high anthers and low stigmas , the other having lower anthers and higher stigmas ; and as the high stigmas are fertile only when pollenized with grains from a flower having high anthers , it is evident insect aid to transfer pollen is indispensable here . Small bees , which visit these blossoms abundantly , are their benefactors ; although there is nothing to prevent pollen from falling on the stigmas of the short-styled form . Hildebrand proved that productiveness is greatest , or exists only , after legitimate fertilization . To accomplish cross-pollination , many plants bear flowers of opposite sexes on different individuals ; but the violet wood-sorrel ' s plan , utilized by the bluet and partridge-vine also , has the advantage in that both kinds of its flowers are fruitful. @# COMMON , FIELD , or PURPLE MILKWORT ; PURPLE POLYGALA ( Polygala viridescens ; P. sanguinca of Gray ) Milkwort family @# Flowers - Numerous , very small , variable ; bright magenta , pink , or almost red , or pale to whiteness , or greenish , clustered in a globular clover-like head , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 15 in. high , smooth , branched above , leafy . Leaves : Alternate , narrowly oblong , entire . Preferred Habitat - Fields and meadows , moist or sandy . Flowering Season - June-September . Distribution - Southern Canada to North Carolina , westward to the Mississippi. @# When these bright clover-like heads and the inconspicuous greenish ones grow together , the difference between them is so striking it is no wonder Linnaeus thought they were borne by two distinct species , sanguinea and viridescens , whereas they are now known to be merely two forms of the same flower . At first glance one might mistake the irregular little blossom for a member of the pea family ; two of the five very unequal sepals - not petals - are colored wings . These bright-hued calyx-parts overlap around the flower-head like tiles on a roof . Within each pair of wings are three petals united into a tube , split on the back , to expose the vital organs to contact with the bee , the milkwort ' s best friend. @# Plants of this genus were named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have milky juice - for it is bitter and clear - but because feeding on them is supposed to increase the flow of cattle ' s milk. @# In sandy swamps , especially near the coast from Maine to the Gulf , and westward to the Mississippi , grows the MARSH or CROSS-LEAVED MILKWORT ( P. cruciata ) . Most of its leaves , especially the lower ones , are in whorls of four , and from July to September its dense , bright purple-pink , white , or greenish flower-heads , the wings awn-pointed , are seated on the ends of the square branching stem of this low , mossy little plant. @# FRINGED MILKWORT or POLYGALA ; FLOWERING WINTERGREEN ; GAY WINGS ( Polygala paucifolia ) Milkwort family @# Flowers - Purplish rose , rarely white , showy , over 1/2 in. long , from 1 to 4 on short , slender peduncles from among upper leaves . Calyx of 5 unequal sepals , of which 2 are wing-like and highly colored like petals . Corolla irregular , its crest finely fringed ; 6 stamens ; pistil . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Prostrate , 6 to 15 in. long , slender , from creeping rootstock , sending up flowering shoots 4 to 7 in. high .

Flowering Season - May-July . Distribution - Northern Canada , southward and westward to Georgia and Illinois. @# Gay companies of these charming , bright little blossoms hidden away in the woods suggest a swarm of tiny mauve butterflies that have settled among the wintergreen leaves . Unlike the common milkwort and many of its kin that grow in clover-like heads , each one of the gay wings has beauty enough to stand alone , Its oddity of structure , its lovely color and enticing fringe , lead one to suspect it of extraordinary desire to woo some insect that will carry its pollen from blossom to blossom and so enable the plant to produce cross-fertilized seed to counteract the evil tendencies resulting from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It has been said that the fringed polygala keeps " one flower for beauty and one for use " ; " one playful flower for the world , another for serious use and posterity " ; but surely the showy flowers , the " giddy sisters , " borne by all cleistogamous species to save them from degenerating through close inbreeding , are no idle , irresponsible beauties . Let us watch a bumblebee as she alights on the convenient fringe which edges the lower petal of this milkwort . Now the weight of her body so depresses the keel , or tubular petals , wherein the stamens and pistil lie protected from the rain and useless insects , that as soon as it is pressed downward a spoon-tipped pistil pushes out the pollen through the slit on the top on the bee ' s abdomen . The stigmatic surface of the pistil is on the opposite side of the spoon , nearest the base of the flower , to guard against self-pollination . After the pollen has been removed , a bumblebee , already dusted from other blossoms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nectar . Indeed , every feature possessed by this pretty flower has been developed for the most serious purpose of life - the salvation of the species. @# Only locally common throughout a wide area , embracing the eastern half of the United States and Canada , is the RACEMED MILKWORT ( P. polygama ) , whose small , purple-pink , but showy flowers , clustered along the upper part of numerous leafy stems , are found in dry soil during June and July . Like the fringed milkwort , this one bears many cleistogamous , or blind flowers , on underground branches , flowers that always set an abundance of fertile self-planted seed in case of failure to form any on the part of their showy sisters , which are utterly dependent upon the bee ' s ministrations . During prolonged stormy weather few insects are abroad. @# SWAMP ROSE-MALLOW ; MALLOW ROSE ( Hibiscus Moscheutos ) Mallow family @# Flowers - Very large , clear rose pink , sometimes white , often with crimson center , 4 to 7 in. across , solitary , or clustered on peduncles at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrow bractlets ; 5 large , veined petals ; stamens united into a valvular column bearing anthers on the outside for much of its length ; 1 pistil partly enclosed in the column , and with five button-tipped stigmatic branches above . Stem : 4 to 7 ft. tall , stout , from perennial root . Leaves : 3 to 7 in. long , tapering , pointed , egg-shaped , densely white , downy beneath lower leaves , or sometimes all , lobed at middle . Preferred Habitat - Brackish marshes , riversides , lake shores , saline situations . Flowering Season - August-September . Distribution - Massachusetts to the Gulf of Mexico , westward to Louisiana ; found locally in the interior , but chiefly along Atlantic seaboard. @# Stately ranks of these magnificent flowers , growing among the tall sedges and " cat-tails " of the marshes , make the most insensate traveler exclaim at their amazing loveliness . To reach them one must don rubber boots and risk sudden seats in the slippery ooze ; nevertheless , with spade in hand to give one support , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roots to transplant to the garden . Here , strange to say , without salt soil or more water than the average garden receives from showers and hose , this handsomest of our wild flowers soon makes itself delightfully at home under cultivation . Such good , deep earth , well enriched and moistened , as the hollyhock thrives in , suits it perfectly . Now we have a better opportunity to note how the bees suck the five nectaries at the base of the petals and collect the abundant pollen of the newly opened flowers , which they perforce transfer to the five button-shaped stigmas intentionally impeding the entrance to older blossoms . Only its cousin the hollyhock , a native of China , can vie with the rose-mallow ' s decorative splendor among the shrubbery ; and the ROSE OF CHINA ( Hibiscus Rosa-Sinensis ) , cultivated in greenhouses here , eclipse it in the beauty of the individual blossom . This latter flower , whose superb scarlet corolla stains black , is employed by the Chinese married women , it is said , to discolor their teeth ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignominy as a dauber for blacking shoes ! @# MARSH MALLOW ( Althaea officinalis ) , a name frequently misapplied to the swamp rose-mallow , is properly given to a much smaller pink flower , measuring only an inch and a half across at the most , and a far rarer one , being a naturalized immigrant from Europe found only in the salt marshes from the Massachusetts coast to New York . It is also known as WYMOTE . This is a bushy , leafy plant , two to four feet high , and covered with velvety down as a protection against the clogging of its pores by the moisture arising from its wet retreats . Plants that live in swamps must " perspire " freely and keep their pores open . From the marsh mallow ' s thick roots the mucilage used in confectionery is obtained , a soothing demulcent long esteemed in medicine . Another relative , the OKRA or GUMBO PLANT of vegetable gardens ( Hibiscus esculentus ) , has mucilage enough in its narrow pods to thicken a potful of soup . Its pale yellow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but not nearly so conspicuous , because of the plant ' s bushy habit of growth . In spite of its name , the ALTHAEA of our gardens , or ROSE OF SHARON ( Hibiscus Syriacus ) , is not so closely allied to Althaea officinalis as to the swamp rose-mallow. @# Another immigrant from Europe and Asia sparingly naturalized in waste places and roadsides in Canada , the United States , and Mexico is the COMMON HIGH MALLOW , CHEESEFLOWER , or ROUND DOCK ( Malva sylvestris ) . Its purplish-rose flowers , from which the French have derived their word mauve , first applied to this plant , appear in small clusters on slender pedicels from the leaf axils along a leafy , rather weak , but ascending stem , maybe only a foot high , or perhaps a yard , throughout the summer months . The leaf , borne on a petiole two to six inches long , is divided into from five to nine shallow , angular , or rounded saw-edged lobes . Country children eat unlimited quantities of the harmless little circular , flattened " cheeses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Malva . Since the flower invites a great number of insects to feast on its nectar , secreted in five little pits ( protected for them from the rain by hairs at the base of the petals ) , and compels its visitors to wipe off pollen brought from the pyramidal group of anthers in a newly opened blossom to the exserted , radiating stigmas of older ones , the mallow produces more cheeses than all the dairies of the world . So rich is its store of nectar that the hive-bee , shut out from a legitimate entrance to the flower when it closes in the late afternoon , climbs up the outside of the calyx , and inserting his tongue between the five petals , empties the nectaries one after another - intelligent rogue that he is ! @# The LOW , DWARF , or RUNNING MALLOW ( M. rotundifolia ) , a very common little weed throughout our territory , Europe , and Asia , depends scarcely at all upon insects to transfer its pollen , as might be inferred from its unattractive pale blue to white flowers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In default of visitors , its pollen-laden anthers , instead of drooping to get out of the way of the stigmas , as in the showy high mallow , remain extended so as to come in contact with the rough , sticky sides of the long curling stigmas . The leaves of this spreading plant , which are nearly round , with five to nine shallow , saw-edged lobes , are thin , and furnished with long petioles ; whereas the flowers which spring from their axils keep close to the main stem . Usually there are about fifteen rounded carpels that go to make up the Dutch , doll , or fairy cheeses , as the seed vessels are called by children . Only once is the mallow mentioned in the Bible , and then as food for the most abject and despised poor ( Job 30 : 4 ) ; but as eighteen species of mallow grow in Palestine , who is the higher critic to name the species eaten ? @# Occasionally we meet by the roadside in Canada , the Eastern , Middle , and Southern States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across , growing in small clusters at the top of a stem a foot or two high , the whole plant emitting a faint odor of musk . If the stem leaves are deeply divided into several narrow , much-cleft segments , and the little cheeses are densely hairy , we may safely call the plant MUSK MALLOW ( M. moschata ) , and expect to find it blooming throughout the summer. @# MARSH ST. - JOHN ' S-WORT ( Triadenum Virginicum ; Elodea Virginica of Gray ) St.-John ' s-wort family @# Flowers - Pale magenta , pink , or flesh color , about 1/2 in. across , in terminal clusters , or from leaf axils . Calyx of 5 equal sepals , persistent on fruit ; 5 petals ; 9 or more stamens united in 3 sets ; pistil of 3 distinct styles . Stem : to 1 1/2 ft. high , simple , leafy . Leaves : Opposite , pale , with black , glandular dots , broadly oblong , entire edged , seated on stem or clasping by heart-shaped base . Fruit : An oblong , acute , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bogs . Flowering Season - July-September . Distribution - Labrador to the Gulf , and westward to Nebraska. @# Late in the summer , after the rather insignificant pink flowers have withered , this low plant , which almost never lacks some color in its green parts , greatly increases its beauty by tinting stems , leaves , and seed vessels with red . Like other members of the family , the flower arranges its stamens in little bundles of three , and when an insect comes to feast on the abundant pollen - no nectar being secreted - he can not avoid rubbing some off on the stigmas that are on a level with the anthers . He may sometimes carry pollen from blossom to blossom , it is true , but certainly the St.-John ' s-wort takes no adequate precautions against self-fertilization at any time . Toward the close of its existence the flower draws its petals together toward the axils , thus bringing anthers and stigmas in contact. @# SPIKED WILLOW-HERB ; LONG PURPLES ; SPIKED or PURPLE LOOSESTRIFE ( Lythrum Salicaria ) Loosestrife family @# Flowers - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 1/2 in. broad , crowded in whorls around long bracted spikes . Calyx tubular , ribbed , 5 to 7 toothed , with small projections between . Corolla of 5 or 6 slightly wrinkled or twisted petals . Stamens , in 2 whorls of 5 or 6 each , and 1 pistil , occurring in three different lengths . Stem : 2 to 3 ft. high , leafy , branched . Leaves : Opposite , or sometimes in whorls of 3 ; lance-shaped , with heart-shaped base clasping stem . Preferred Habitat - Wet meadows , watery places , ditches , and banks of streams . Flowering Season - June-August . Distribution - Eastern Canada to Delaware , and westward through Middle States ; also in Europe. @# Through Darwin ' s patient study of this trimorphic flower , it has assumed so important a place in his theory of the origin of species that its fertilization by insects deserves special attention . On page 5 , the method by which the pickerel weed , another flower whose stamens and pistil occur in three different lengths , should be read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different kinds of yellow and green pollen on its two sets of three stamens ; and when this pollen is applied by insects to the stigmatic surface of three different lengths of pistil , it follows that there are eighteen ways in which it may be transferred . But Darwin proved that only pollen brought from the shortest stamens to the shortest pistil , from the middle-length stamens to the middle-length pistil , and from the long stamens to the long pistil effectually fertilizes the flower . And as all the flowers on any one plant are of the same kind , we have here a marvelous mechanism to secure cross-fertilization . His experiments with this loosestrife also demonstrated that " reproductive organs , when of different length , behave to one another like different species of the same genus in regard both to direct productiveness and the character of the offspring ; and that consequently mutual barrenness , which was once thought conclusive proof of difference of species , is worthless as such , and the last barrier that was raised between species and varieties is broken down . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which secretes abundant nectar at the base of its tube , attracts many insects , among others , bees of larger and middle size , and the butterflies for which it is especially adapted . They alight on the stamens and pistil on the upper side of the flower . Those with the longest tongues stand on one blossom to sip from the next one : this is the butterfly ' s customary attitude . But nearly every visitor comes in contact with at least one set of organs . When Darwin first interpreted the trimorphism of the loosestrife , we can realize something of the enthusiasm such a man must have felt in writing to Gray : " I am almost stark , staring mad over lythrum . . . . For the love of Heaven have a look at some of your species , and if you can get me some seed , do ! " @# Long ago this beautiful plant reached our shores from Europe , and year by year is extending its triumphal march westward , brightening its course of empire through low meadows and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is not a spring flower , even in England ; and so when Shakespeare , whose knowledge of floral nature was second only to that of human nature , wrote of Ophelia , @# " With fantastic garlands did she come , Of crow-flowers , nettles , daisies , and long purples , " @# is it probable he so combined flowers having different seasons of bloom ? Dr. Prior suggests that the purple orchis ( 0. mascula ) might have been the flower Ophelia wore ; but , as long purples has been the folk name of this loosestrife from time immemorial in England , it seems likely that Shakespeare for once may have made a mistake. @# BLUE WAX-WEED ; CLAMMY CUPHEA ; TAR-WEED ( Parsonia petiolata ; Cuphea viscosissima of Gray ) Loosestrife family @# Flowers - Purplish pink , about 1/4 in. across , on short peduncles from leaf axils , solitary or clustered . Calyx sticky , tubular , 12-ribbed , with 6 primary teeth , oblique at mouth , extending into a rounded swelling on upper side at base ; 6 unequal , wrinkled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inserted on calyx throat ; pistil with 2-lobed stigma . Stem : 6 to 20 in. high , branched , very sticky-hairy . Leaves : Opposite , on slender petioles , lance-shaped , rounded at base , harsh to the touch . Preferred Habitat - Dry soil , waste places , fields , roadsides . Flowering Season - July-October . Distribution - Rhode Island to Georgia , westward to Louisiana , Kansas , and Illinois. @# A first cousin of the familiar Mexican cigar plant , or fire-cracker plant ( Cuphea platycentra ) , whose abundant little vermilion tubes , with black-edged lower lip tipped with white , brighten the borders of so many Northern flower-beds . Kyphos , the Greek for curved , from which cuphea was derived , has reference to the peculiar , swollen little seedpod . From a slit on one side of the clammy cuphea ' s capsule the placenta , set with tiny flattened seeds , sticks out like a handle . Probably the flower has already fertilized itself in the bud , although , from the fact that the plant has taken such pains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hairs , one might imagine it was wholly dependent upon winged insects to transfer its pollen . What an unworthy relative of the purple loosestrife , whose elaborate scheme to insure cross-fertilization is one of the botanical wonders ! @# MEADOW-BEAUTY ; DEER GRASS ( Rhexia Virginica ) Meadow-beauty family @# Flowers - Purplish pink , 1 to 1 1/2 in. across , pedicelled , clustered at top of stem . Calyx 4-lobed , tubular or urn-shaped , narrowest at neck ; 4 rounded , spreading petals , joined for half their length ; 8 equal , prominent stamens in 2 rows ; pistil . Stem : 1 to 1 1/2 ft. high , square , more or less hairy , erect , sometimes branching at top . Leaves : Opposite , ascending , seated on stem , oval , acute at tip , mostly 5-nerved , the margins saw-edged . Preferred Habitat - Sandy swamps or near water . Flowering Season - July-September . Distribution - United States , chiefly east of Mississippi. @# Suggesting a brilliant magenta evening primrose in form , the meadow-beauty is likewise a rather niggardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at once ; but where masses adorn our marshes , we can not wonder so effective a plant is exported to European peat gardens . Its lovely sister , the MARYLAND MEADOW-BEAUTY ( R. Mariana ) , a smaller , less brilliant flower , found no farther north than the swamps and pine barrens of New Jersey , also goes abroad to be admired ; yet neither is of any value for cutting , for the delicate petals quickly discolor and drop off when handled . Blossoms so attractively colored naturally have many winged visitors to transfer their pollen . All too soon after fertilization the now useless petals fall , leaving the pretty urn-shaped calyx , with the large yellow protruding stamens , far more conspicuous than some flowers . " Its seed-vessels are perfect little cream pitchers of graceful form , " said Thoreau . Within the smooth capsule the minute seeds are coiled like snail-shells. @# GREAT OR SPIKED WILLOW-HERB ; FIRE-WEED ( Chamaenerion angustifolium ; Epilobium angustifolium of Gray ) Evening Primrose family @# Flowers - Magenta or pink , sometimes pale , or rarely white , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elongated , terminal , spike-like raceme . Calyx tubular , narrow , in 4 segments ; 4 rounded , spreading petals ; 8 stamens ; 1 pistil , hairy at base ; the stigma 4-lobed . Stem : 2 to 8 ft. high , simple , smooth , leafy . Leaves : Narrow , tapering , willow-like , 2 to 6 in. long . Fruit : A slender , curved , violet-tinted capsule , from 2 to 3 in. long , containing numerous seeds attached to tufts of fluffy , white , silky threads . Preferred Habitat - Dry soil , fields , roadsides , especially in burnt-over districts . Flowering Season - June-September . Distribution - From Atlantic to Pacific , with few interruptions ; British Possessions and United States southward to the Carolinas and Arizona . Also Europe and Asia. @# Spikes of these beautiful brilliant flowers towering upward above dry soil , particularly where the woodsman ' s axe and forest fires have devastated the landscape , illustrate Nature ' s abhorrence of ugliness . Other kindly plants have earned the name of fire-weed , but none so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blossoms over the charred trail in the wake of the locomotive . Beginning at the bottom of the long spike , the flowers open in slow succession upward throughout the summer , leaving behind the attractive seed-vessels , which , splitting lengthwise in September , send adrift white silky tufts attached to seeds that will one day cover far distant wastes with beauty . Almost perfect rosettes , made by the young plants , are met with on one ' s winter walks. @# Epi , upon , and lobos , a pod , combine to make a name applicable to many flowers of this family . In general structure the fire-weed closely resembles its relative the evening primrose . Bees , not moths , however , are its benefactors . Coming to a newly opened flower , the bee finds abundant pollen on the anthers and a sip of nectar in the cup below . At this stage the flower keeps its still immature style curved downward and backward lest it should become self-fertilized - an evil ever to be guarded against by ambitious plants . In a few days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretches the style , spreading its four receptive stigmas just where an incoming bee , well dusted from a younger flower , must certainly leave some pollen on their sticky surfaces. @# The GREAT HAIRY WILLOW-HERB ( Epilobium hirsutum ) , whose white tufted seeds came over from Europe in the ballast to be blown over Ontario and the Eastern States , spreads also by underground shoots , until it seems destined to occupy wide areas . In these showy magenta flowers , about one inch across , the stigmas and anthers mature simultaneously but cross-fertilization is usually insured because the former surpass the latter , and naturally are first touched by the insect visitor . In default of visits , however , the stigmas , at length curling backward , come in contact with the pollen-laden anthers . The fire-weed , on the contrary , is unable to fertilize itself. @# A pale magenta-pink or whitish , very small-flowered , branching species , one to two feet high , found in swamps from New Brunswick to the Pacific , and southward to Delaware , is the LINEAR-LEAVED WILLOW-HERB ( F. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , acute leaves , its hoariness throughout , the dingy threads on its tiny seeds , and the occasional bulblets it bears near the base of the stem . It is scarcely to be distinguished by one not well up in field practice from another bog lover , the DOWNY or SOFT WILLOW-HERB ( F. strictum ) , which , however , is a trifle taller , glandular throughout , and with sessile , not petioled , leaves . The PURPLE-LEAVED WILLOW-HERB ( E. coloratum ) , common in low grounds , may best be named by the reddish-brown coma to which its seeds are attached . Both leaves and stem are often highly colored. @# BOG WINTERGREEN ( Pyrola uliginosa ; P. rotundifolia , var. uliginosa of Gray ) Wintergreen family @# Flowers - Magenta pink , fragrant , about 1/2 in. across , 7 to 15 on a leafless scape 6 to 15 in. high . Calyx 5-parted ; 5 concave petals ; 10 stamens ; style curved upward , exserted . Leaves : From the root , broadly oval or round , rather thick and dull , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Season - June . Distribution - Nova Scotia to British Columbia , southward to New York and Colorado. @# Fragrant colonies of this little plant cuddled close to the moss of cool , northern peat bogs draw forth our admiration when we go orchid hunting in early summer . A similar species , the LIVER-LEAF WINTERGREEN ( P. asarifolia ) , with shining , not dull , leaves and rose-colored flowers , not to mention minor differences , is likewise found in swamps and wet woods . These two wintergreens , formerly counted mere varieties of the white-flowered rotundifolia , a lover of dry woods , have now been given specific individuality by later-day systematists . Short-lipped bees and flies may be detected in the act of applying their mouths to the orifices of the anthers through which pollen is shed , and some must be carried to the stigma of another flower. @# PIPSISSEWA ; PRINCE ' S PINE ( Chimaphila umbellata ) Wintergreen family @# Flowers - Flesh-colored , or pinkish , fragrant , waxy , usually with deep pink ring around center , and the anthers colored ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terminal cluster . Calyx 5-cleft ; corolla of 5 concave , rounded , spreading petals ; 10 stamens , the filaments hairy style short , conical , with a round stigma . Stem : Trailing far along ground , creeping , or partly subterranean , sending up sterile and flowering branches 3 to 10 in. high . Leaves : Opposite or in whorls , evergreen , bright , shining , spatulate to lance-shaped , sharply saw-edged . Preferred Habitat - Dry woods , sandy leaf-mould . Flowering Season - June-August . Distribution - British Possessions and the United States north of Georgia from the Atlantic to the Pacific . Also Mexico , Europe , and Asia. @# A lover of winter indeed ( cheima = winter and phileo = to love ) is the prince ' s pine , whose beautiful dark leaves keep their color and gloss in spite of snow and intense cold . A few yards of the trailing stem , easily ripped from the light soil of its woodland home , make a charming indoor decoration , especially when the little brown seed-cases remain . Few flowers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dainty , deliciously fragrant little blossoms. @# The SPOTTED WINTERGREEN , or PIPSISSEWA ( C. maculata ) , closely resembles the prince ' s pine , except that its slightly larger white or pinkish flowers lack the deep pink ring ; and the lance-shaped leaves , with rather distant saw-teeth , are beautifully mottled with white along the veins . When we see short-lipped bees and flies about these flowers , we may be sure their pollen-covered mouths come in contact with the moist stigma on the summit of the little top-shaped style , and so effect cross-fertilization. @# WILD HONEYSUCKLE ; PINK , PURPLE , or WILD AZALEA ; PINXTER-FLOWER ( Azalea nudiflora ) Heath family @# Flowers - Crimson pink , purplish or rose pink , to nearly white , 1 1/2 to 2 in. across , faintly fragrant , clustered , opening before or with the leaves , and developed from cone-like , scaly brown buds . Calyx minute , 5-parted ; corolla funnel-shaped , the tube narrow , hairy , with 5 regular , spreading lobes ; 5 long red stamens ; 1 pistil , declined , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but branching above , 2 to 6 ft. high . Leaves : Usually clustered , deciduous , oblong , acute at both ends , hairy on midrib . Preferred Habitat - Moist , rocky woods , or dry woods and thickets . Flowering Season - April-May . Distribution - Maine to Illinois , and southward to the Gulf. @# Woods and hillsides are glowing with fragrant , rosy masses of this lovely azalea , the Pinxter-bloem or Whitsunday flower of the Dutch colonists , long before the seventh Sunday after Easter . Among our earliest exports , this hardy shrub , the swamp azalea , and the superb flame-colored species of the Alleghanies , were sent early in the eighteenth century to the old country , and there crossed with A. Pontica of southern Europe by the Belgian horticulturalists , to whom we owe the Ghent azaleas , the final triumphs of the hybridizer , that glorify the shrubberies on our own lawns to-day . The azalea became the national flower of Flanders . These hardy species lose their leaves in winter , whereas the hothouse varieties of A. Indica , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , almost if not quite evergreen . A few of the latter stand our northern winters , especially the pure white variety now quite commonly planted in cemetery lots . In that delightfully enthusiastic little book , " The Garden ' s Story , " Mr. Ellwanger says of the Ghent azalea " In it I find a charm presented by no other flower . Its soft tints of buff , sulphur , and primrose ; its dazzling shades of apricot , salmon , orange , and vermilion are always a fresh revelation of color . They have no parallel among flowers , and exist only in opals , sunset skies , and the flush of autumn woods . " Certainly American horticulturists were not clever in allowing the industry of raising these plants from our native stock to thrive on foreign soil. @# Naturally the azalea ' s protruding style forms the most convenient alighting place for the female bee , its chief friend ; and there she leaves a few grains of pollen , brought on her hairy underside from another flower , before again dusting herself there as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the nectary . Honey produced from azaleas by the hive bee is in bad repute . All too soon after fertilization the now useless corolla slides along to the tip of the pistil , where it swings a while before dropping to earth. @# Our beautiful wild honeysuckle , called naked ( nudiflora ) , because very often the flowers appear before the leaves , has a peculiar Japanese grace on that account . Every farmer ' s boy ' s mouth waters at sight of the cool , juicy May-apple , the extraordinary pulpy growth on this plant and the swamp pink . This excrescence seems to have no other use than that of a gratuitous , harmless gift to the thirsty child , from whom it exacts no reward of carrying seeds to plant distant colonies , as the mandrake ' s yellow , tomato-like May-apple does . But let him beware , as he is likely to , of the similar looking , but hollow , stringy apples growing on the bushy Andromeda , which turn black with age. @# From Maine to Florida and westward to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wet places only need we look for the SWAMP PINK or HONEYSUCKLE , WHITE or CLAMMY AZALEA ( A. viscosa ) , a more hairy species than the Pinxter-flower , with a very sticky , glandular corolla tube , and deliciously fragrant blossoms , by no means invariably white . John Burroughs is not the only one who has passed " several patches of swamp honeysuckles , red with blossoms " ( " Wake-Robin " ) . But as this species does not bloom until June and July , when the sun quickly bleaches the delicate flowers , it is true we most frequently find them white , merely tinged with pink . The leaves are well developed before the blossoms appear . Concerning azaleas ' poisonous property , see the discussion under mountain laurel that follows. @# RHODORA ( Rhodora Canadensis ; Rhododendron Rhodora of Gray ) Heath family @# Flowers - Purplish pink , rose , or nearly white , 1 1/2 in. broad or less , in clusters on short , stiff , hairy pedicels , and usually appearing before the leaves , from scaly , terminal buds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2-3 lobed ; lower lip 2-cleft ; 10 stamens ; pistil , the style slightly protruding . Stem : 1 to 3 ft. high , shrubby , branching . Leaves : Deciduous , oval to oblong , dark green above , pale and hairy beneath . Preferred Habitat - Wet hillsides , damp woods , beside sluggish streams , cool bogs . Flowering Season - May . Distribution - Newfoundland to Pennsylvania mountains. @# A superficial glance at this low , little , thin shrub might mistake it for a magenta variety of the leafless Pinxter-flower . It does its best to console the New Englanders for the scarcity of the magnificent rhododendron , with which it was formerly classed . The Sage of Concord , who became so enamored of it that Massachusetts people often speak of it as " Emerson ' s flower , " extols its loveliness in a sonnet : @# " Rhodora ! If the sages ask thee why This charm is wasted on the earth and sky , Tell them , dear , if eyes were made for seeing , Then Beauty is its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GREAT LAUREL ; ROSE TREE , or BAY ( Rhododendron maximum ) Heath family @# Flowers - Rose pink , varying to white , greenish in the throat , spotted with yellow or orange , in broad clusters set like a bouquet among leaves , and developed from scaly , cone-like buds ; pedicels sticky-hairy . Calyx 5-parted , minute ; corolla 5-lobed , broadly bell-shaped , 2 in. broad or less usually 10 stamens , equally spreading ; pistil . Stem : Sometimes a tree attaining a height of 40 ft. , usually 6 to 20 ft. , shrubby , woody . Leaves : Evergreen , drooping in winter , leathery , dark green on both sides , lance-oblong , 4 to 10 in. long , entire edged , narrowing into stout petioles . Preferred Habitat - Mountainous woodland , hillsides near streams . Flowering Season - June-July . Distribution - Uncommon from Ohio and New England to Nova Scotia ; abundant through the Alleghanies to Georgia. @# When this most magnificent of our native shrubs covers whole mountain sides throughout the Alleghany region with bloom , one stands awed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does the rhododendron attain such size or luxuriance . There it produces a tall trunk , and towers among the trees ; it spreads its branches far and wide until they interlock and form almost impenetrable thickets locally called " hells ; " it glorifies the loneliest mountain road with superb bouquets of its delicate flowers set among dark , glossy foliage scarcely less attractive . The mountain in bloom is worth travelling a thousand miles to see. @# Farther south the more purplish-pink or lilac-flowered CAROLINA RHODODENDRON ( R. Catawbiense ) flourishes . This southern shrub , which is perfectly hardy , unlike its northern sister , has been used by cultivators as a basis for producing the fine hybrids now so extensively grown on lawns in this country and Europe . Crossed with the Nepal species ( R. arboreum ) the best results follow . Americans , ever too prone to make the eagle scream on their trips abroad , need not monopolize all the glory for the cultivated rhododendron , as they are apt to do when they see it on fine estates in England . The Himalayas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ours , furnish many of the shrubs of commerce . Our rhododendron produces one of the hardest and strongest of woods , weighing thirty-nine pounds per cubic foot. @# Rhododendrons , azaleas , and laurels fall under a common ban pronounced by bee-keepers . The bees which transfer pollen from blossom to blossom while gathering nectar , manufacture honey said to be poisonous . Cattle know enough to let all this foliage alone . Apparently the ants fear no more evil results from the nectar than the bees themselves ; and were it not for the sticky parts nearest the flowers , on which they crawl to meet their death , the blossom ' s true benefactors would find little refreshment left. @# MOUNTAIN or AMERICAN LAUREL ; CALICO BUSH ; SPOONWOOD ; CALMOUN ; BROAD-LEAVED KALMIA ( Kalmia latifolia ) Heath family @# Flowers - Buds and new flowers bright rose pink , afterward fading white , and only lined with pink , 1 in. across , or less , numerous , in terminal clusters . Calyx small , 5-parted , sticky corolla like a 5-pointed saucer , with 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lodged in each projection ; 1 pistil . Stem : Shrubby , woody , stiffly branched , 2 to 20 ft. high . Leaves : Evergreen , entire , oval to elliptic , pointed at both ends , tapering into petioles . Fruit : A round , brown capsule , with the style long remaining on it . Preferred Habitat - Sandy or rocky woods , especially in hilly or mountainous country . Flowering Season - May-June . Distribution - New Brunswick and Ontario , southward to the Gulf of Mexico , and westward to Ohio. @# It would be well if Americans , imitating the Japanese in making pilgrimages to scenes of supreme natural beauty , visited the mountains , rocky , woody hillsides , ravines , and tree-girt uplands when the laurel is in its glory ; when masses of its pink and white blossoms , set among the dark evergreen leaves , flush the landscape like Aurora , and are reflected from the pools of streams and the serene depths of mountain lakes . Peter Kalm , a Swedish pupil of Linnaeus , who traveled here early in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than that of any other flower . He introduced the plant to Europe , where it is known as kalmia , and extensively cultivated on fine estates that are thrown open to the public during the flowering season . Even a flower is not without honor , save in its own country . We have only to prepare a border of leaf-mould , take up the young plant without injuring the roots or allowing them to dry , hurry them into the ground , and prune back the bush a little , to establish it in our gardens , where it will bloom freely after the second year. @# All the kalmias resort to a most ingenious device for compelling insect visitors to carry their pollen from blossom to blossom . A newly opened flower has its stigma erected where the incoming bee must leave on its sticky surface the four minute orange-like grains carried from the anther of another flower on the hairy underside of her body . Now , each anther is tucked away in one of the ten little pockets of the saucer-shaped blossom , and the elastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above the nectary , the bee has only to descend toward it , when her leg , touching against one of the hair-triggers of the spring trap , pop goes the little anther-gun , discharging pollen from its bores as it flies upward . So delicately is the mechanism adjusted , the slightest jar or rough handling releases the anthers ; but , on the other hand , should insects be excluded by a net stretched over the plant , the flowers will fall off and wither without firing off their pollen-charged guns . At least , this is true in the great majority of tests . As in the case of hothouse flowers no fertile seed is set when nets keep away the laurel ' s benefactors . One has only to touch the hair-trigger with the end of a pin to see how exquisitely delicate is this provision for cross-fertilization. @# However much we may be cautioned by the apiculturalists against honey made from laurel nectar , the bees themselves ignore all warnings and apparently without evil results - happily for flowers dependent upon them and their kin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the standard English work on the subject , writes : " During the celebrated Retreat of the Ten Thousand , as recorded by Xenophon in his ' Anabasis , ' the soldiers regaled themselves upon some honey found near Trebizonde where were many beehives . Intoxication with vomiting was the result . Some were so overcome , he states , as to be incapable of standing . Not a soldier died , but very many were greatly weakened for several days . Tournefort endeavored to ascertain whether this account was corroborated by anything ascertainable in the locality , and had good reason to be satisfied respecting it . He concluded that the honey had been gathered from a shrub growing in the neighborhood of Trebizonde , which is well known there as producing the before-mentioned effects . It is now agreed that the plants were species of rhododendron and azaleas . Lamberti confirms Xenophon ' s account by stating that similar effects are produced by honey of Colchis , where the same shrubs are common . In 1790 , even , fatal cases occurred in America in consequence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by an inquiry instituted under direction of the American government . Happily , our American cousins are now never likely to thus suffer , thanks to drainage , the plow , and the bee-farm. " @# One of the beautiful swallow-tail butterflies lays its eggs on laurel leaves , that the larvae may feed on them later ; yet the foliage often proves deadly to more highly organized creatures . Most cattle know enough to let it alone ; nevertheless some fall victims to it every year . Even the intelligent grouse , hard pressed with hunger when deep snow covers much of their chosen food are sometimes found dead and their crops distended by these leaves . How far more unkind than the bristly armored thistle ' s is the laurel ' s method of protecting itself against destruction ! Even the ant , intent on pilfering sweets secreted for bees , it ruthlessly glues to death against its sticky stems and calices . According to Dr. Barton the Indians drink a decoction of kalmia leaves when they wish to commit suicide. @# As laurel wood is very hard and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is in great demand for various purposes , one of them indicated in the plant ' s popular name of Spoon-wood. @# SHEEP-LAUREL , LAMB-KILL , WICKY , CALF-KILL , SHEEP-POISON NARROW-LEAVED LAUREL ( K. angustifolia ) , and so on through a list of folk names testifying chiefly to the plant ' s wickedness in the pasture , may be especially deadly food for cattle , but it certainly is a feast to the eyes . However much we may admire the small , deep crimson-pink flowers that we find in June and July in moist fields or swampy ground or on the hillsides , few of us will agree with Thoreau , who claimed that it is " handsomer than the mountain laurel . " The low shrub may be only six inches high , or it may attain three feet . The narrow evergreen leaves , pale on the underside , have a tendency to form groups of threes , standing upright when newly put forth , but bent downward with the weight of age . A peculiarity of the plant is that clusters of leaves usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whorls or in clusters at the side of it below. @# The PALE or SWAMP LAUREL ( K. glauca ) , found in cool bogs from Newfoundland to New Jersey and Michigan , and westward to the Pacific Coast , coats the under side of its mostly upright leaves with a smooth whitish bloom like the cabbage ' s . It is a straggling little bush , even lower than the lamb-kill , and an earlier bloomer , putting forth its loose , niggardly clusters of deep rose or lilac-colored flowers in June. @# TRAILING ARBUTUS ; MAYFLOWER ; GROUND LAUREL ( Epigaea repens ) Heath family @# Flowers - Pink , fading to nearly white , very fragrant about 1/2 in. across when expanded , few or many in clusters at ends of branches .

Distribution - Newfoundland to Florida , west to Kentucky , and the Northwest Territory. @# Can words describe the fragrance of the very breath of spring - that delicious commingling of the perfume of arbutus , the odor of pines , and the snow-soaked soil just warming into life ? Those who know the flower only as it is sold in the city streets , tied with wet , dirty string into tight bunches , withered and forlorn , can have little idea of the joy of finding the pink , pearly blossoms freshly opened among the withered leaves of oak and chestnut , moss , and pine needles in which they nestle close to the cold earth in the leafless , windy northern forest . Even in Florida , where broad patches carpet the woods in February , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply because there are no slushy remnants of snow drifts , no reminders of winter hardships in the vicinity . There can be no glad surprise at finding dainty spring flowers in a land of perpetual summer . Little wonder that the Pilgrim Fathers , after the first awful winter on the " stern New England coast , " loved this early messenger of hope and gladness above the frozen ground at Plymouth . In an introductory note to his poem " The Mayflowers , " Whittier states that the name was familiar in England , as the application of it to the historic vessel shows ; but it was applied by the English , and still is , to the hawthorn . Its use in New England in connection with the trailing arbutus dates from a very early day , some claiming that the first Pilgrims so used it in affectionate memory of the vessel and its English flower association. @# " Sad Mayflower I watched by winter stars , And nursed by winter gales , With petals of the sleeted spars , And leaves of frozen sails ! @# @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the frozen sod , And through dead leaves of hope shall spring Afresh the flowers of God ! " @# Some have attempted to show that the Pilgrims did not find the flowers until the last month of spring , and that , therefore , they were named Mayflowers . Certainly the arbutus is not a typical May blossom even in New England . Bryant associates it with the hepatica , our earliest spring flower , in his poem , " The , Twenty-seventh of March " : @# " Within the woods Tufts of ground laurel , creeping underneath The leaves of the last summer , send their sweets Upon the chilly air , and by the oak , The squirrel cups , a graceful company Hide in their bells a soft aerial blue. " @# There is little use trying to coax this shyest of sylvan flowers into our gardens where other members of its family , rhododendrons , laurels , and azaleas make themselves delightfully at home . It is wild as a hawk , an untamable creature that slowly pines to death when brought into contact with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plant by the yard , and others without even the excuse of eking out a paltry income by its sale , have already exterminated it within a wide radius of our Eastern cities . How curious that the majority of people show their appreciation of a flower ' s beauty only by selfishly , ignorantly picking every specimen they can find ! @# In many localities the arbutus sets no fruit , for it is still undergoing evolutionary changes looking toward the perfecting of an elaborate system to insure cross-fertilization . Already it has attained to perfume , nectar , and color to attract quantities of insects , chiefly flies and small female bees but in some flowers the anthers produce no pollen for them to carry , while others are filled with grains , yet all the stigmas in the neighboring clusters may be defective . The styles and the filaments are of several different lengths , showing a tendency toward trimorphism , perhaps , like the wonderful purple loosestrife ; but at present the flower pursues a most wasteful method of distributing pollen , and in different sections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impossible to describe except to the advanced student . They may , however , be best summarized in the words of Professor Asa Gray : " The flowers are of two kinds , each with two modifications ; the two main kinds characterized by the nature and perfection of the stigma , along with more or less abortion of the stamens ; their modifications by the length of the style. " @# When our English cousins speak of the arbutus , they have in mind a very different species from ours . Theirs is the late flowering strawberry-tree , an evergreen shrub with clustering white blossoms and beautiful rough , red berries . Indeed , the name arbutus is derived from the Celtic word Arboise , meaning rough fruit. @# LARGE or AMERICAN CRANBERRY ( Oxycoccus macrocarpus ; Vaccinium macrocarpon of Gray ) Huckleberry family @# Flowers - Light pink , about 1/2 in. across , nodding on slender pedicels from sides and tips of erect branches . Calyx round , 4-or 5-parted ; corolla a long cone in bud , its four or five nearly separate , narrow petals turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anthers united into a protruding cone , its hollow tubes shedding pollen by a pore at tip . Stem : Creeping or trailing , slender , woody , 1 to 3 ft. long , its leafy branches 8 in. high or less . Leaves : Small , alternate , oblong , evergreen , pale beneath , the edges rolled backward . Fruit : An oblong or ovoid , many seeded , juicy red berry ( Oxycoccus = sour berry ) . Preferred Habitat - Bogs ; sandy , swampy meadows . Flowering Season - June-August . Distribution - North Carolina , Michigan , and Minnesota northward and westward. @# A hundred thousand people are interested in the berry of this pretty vine to one who has ever seen its flowers . Yet if the blossom were less attractive , to insects at least , and took less pains to shake out its pollen upon them as they cling to the cone to sip its nectar , few berries would accompany the festive Thanksgiving turkey . Cultivators of the cranberry know how important it is to have the flooded bogs well drained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may cover the plants to the depth of a foot or more all winter and until the 10th of May ; and during the late summer it is often advisable to overflow the bogs to prevent injury of the fine , delicate roots from drought , and to destroy the worm that is the plant ' s worst enemy ; but until the flowers have wooed the bees , flies , and other winged benefactors , and fruit is well formed , every cultivator knows enough not to submerge his bog . With flowers under water there are no insect visitors , consequently no berries . Dense mats of the wiry vines should yield about one hundred and fifty bushels of berries to the acre , under skilful cultivation - a most profitable industry , since the cranberry costs less to cultivate , gather , and market than the strawberry or any of the small perishable fruits . Planted in muck and sand in the garden , the vines yield surprisingly good results . The Cape Cod Bell is the best known market berry . One of the interesting sights to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ autumn is the berry picking that is conducted on an immense scale . Men , women , and children drop all other work ; whole villages are nearly depopulated while daylight lasts ; temporary buildings set up on the edges of the bogs contain throngs of busy people sorting , measuring , and packing fruit ; and lonely railroad stations , piled high with crates , give the branch line its heaviest freight business of the year. @# SHOOTING STAR ; AMERICAN COWSLIP ; PRIDE OF OHIO ( Dodecatheon Meadia ) Primrose family @# Flowers - Purplish pink or yellowish white , the cone tipped with yellow ; few or numerous , hanging on slender , recurved pedicels in an umbel at top of a simple scape 6 in. to 2 ft. high . Calyx deeply 5-parted ; corolla of 5 narrow lobes bent backward and upward ; the tube very short , thickened at throat , and marked with dark reddish-purple dots ; 5 stamens united into a protruding cone ; 1 pistil , protruding beyond them .

Flowering Season - April-May . Distribution - Pennsylvania southward and westward , and from Texas to Manitoba. @# Ages ago Theophrastus called an entirely different plant by this same scientific name , derived from dodeka = twelve , and theos = gods ; and although our plant is native of a land unknown to the ancients , the fanciful Linnaeus imagined he saw in the flowers of its umbel a little congress of their divinities seated around a miniature Olympus ! Who has said science kills imagination ? These handsome , interesting flowers so familiar in the Middle West and Southwest , especially , somewhat resemble the cyclamen in oddity of form , indeed , these prairie wildflowers are not unknown in florists ' shops in Eastern cities. @# Many flowers like the shooting star , cyclamen , and nightshade , with protruding cones made up of united stamens , are so designed that , as the bees must cling to them while sucking nectar , they receive pollen jarred out from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ petals serve three purposes : First , in making the flower more conspicuous ; secondly , in facilitating access to nectar and pollen ; and , finally , in discouraging crawling intruders . Where the short tube is thickened , the bee finds her foothold while she forces her tongue between the anther tips . The nectar is well concealed and quite deeply seated , thanks to the rigid cone . Few bee workers are flying at the shooting star ' s early blooming season . Undoubtedly the female bumblebees , which , by striking the protruding stigma before they jar out any pollen , cross-fertilize it , are the flower ' s benefactors ; but one frequently sees the little yellow puddle butterfly clinging to the pretty blossoms. @# Very different from the bright yellow cowslip of Europe is our odd , misnamed blossom. @# BITTER-BLOOM ; ROSE-PINK ; SQUARE-STEMMED SABBATIA ; ROSY CENTAURY ( Sabbatia angularis ) Gentian family @# Flowers - Clear rose pink , with greenish star in center , rarely white , fragrant , 1 1/2 in. broad or less , usually solitary on long peduncles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corolla of 5 rounded segments ; stamens 5 ; style 2-cleft .

Preferred Habitat - Rich soil , meadows , thickets . Flowering Season - July-August . Distribution - New York to Florida , westward to Ontario , Michigan , and Indian Territory. @# During the drought of midsummer the lovely rose-pink blooms inland with cheerful readiness to adapt itself to harder conditions than most of its moisture-loving kin will tolerate ; but it may be noticed that although we may oftentimes find it growing in dry soil , it never spreads in such luxuriant clusters as when the roots are struck beside meadow runnels and ditches . Probably the plant would be commoner than it is about populous Eastern districts were it not so much sought after as a tonic medicine. @# It was the Centaurea , represented here by the blue ragged sailor of gardens , and not our Centaury , a distinctly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cured a wound in the foot of the Centaur Chiron , made by an arrow hurled by Hercules. @# Three exquisite members of the Sabbatia tribe keep close to the Atlantic coast in salt meadows and marshes , along the borders of brackish rivers , and very rarely in the sand at the edges of fresh-water ponds a little way inland . From Maine to Florida they range , and less frequently are met along the shores of the Gulf of Mexico so far as Louisiana . How bright and dainty and are ! Whole meadows are radiant with their blushing lovliness . Probably if they consented to live far away from the sea , they would lose some of the deep , clear pink from out their lovely petals , since all flowers show a tendency to brighten their colors as they approach the coast . In England some of the same wildflowers we have here are far deeper-hued , owing , no doubt to the fact that they live on a sea-girt , moisture-laden island , and also that the sun never scorches and blanches at the far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be expected , blossoms so bright of hue as the marsh pinks attract many insects . Guided by the yellow eye that serves as a pathfinder to the nectary , they feast on the generour supply of sweets ; but all unwittingly they must pay for their entertainment by carrying pollen from early to later flowers . Like so many other blossoms , the sabbatias guard themselves against the evils of self-fertilization by shedding their pollen before they mature and spread their two-cleft style , which is now ready to receive the golden , quickening dust on its stigmatic inner surfaces. @# The SEA or MARSH PINK , or ROSE OF PLYMOUTH ( S. stellaris ) , whose graceful alternate branching stem attains a height of two feet only under most favorable conditions , from July to September opens a succession of pink flowers that often fade to white . The yellow eye is bordered with carmine . They measure about one inch across , and are usually solitary at the ends of branches , or else sway on slender peduncles from the axils . The upper leaves are narrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approach the root. @# Similar to the Rose of Plymouth is the even more graceful SLENDER MARSH PINK ( S. Campanulata - the S. gracilis of Gray ) , whose upper leaves are almost thread-like in their narrowness . Its five calyx lobes , too , are exceedingly slender , and often as long as the corolla lobes . One of our soldiers in Cuba , during the Spanish War , sent home to his sister in Massachusetts some of these same little flowers in a letter . " You would just love to see the marshes here , " he wrote . " They are filled with beautiful little pink flowers . I wish I knew their names . " That soldier had passed by New England marshes aglow with the blossoms all his life , but he had never noticed them until all his perceptions became quickened by the stimulus of travel and the excitement of war .

Fruit : Two pods about 4 in. long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lanes , and walls . Flowering Season - June-July . Distribution - Northern part of British Possessions south to Georgia , westward to Nebraska. @# Everywhere at the North we come across this interesting , rather shrubby plant , with its pretty but inconspicuous little rose-veined bells suggesting pink lilies-of-the-valley . Now that we have learned to read the faces of flowers , as it were , we instantly suspect by the color , fragrance , pathfinders , and structure that these are artful wilers , intent on gaining ends of their own through their insect admirers . What are they up to ? @# Let us watch . Bees , flies , moths , and butterflies , especially the latter , hover near . Alighting , the butterfly visitor unrolls his long tongue and inserts it where the five pink veins tell him to , for five nectar-bearing glands stand in a ring around the base of the pistil . Now , as he withdraws his slender tongue through one of the V-shaped cavities that make a circle of traps , he may count himself lucky to escape with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This granular dust he is required to rub off against the stigma of the next flower entered . Some bees , too , have been taken with the dogbane ' s pollen cemented to their tongues . But suppose a fly call upon this innocent-looking blossom ? His short tongue , as well as the butterfly ' s , is guided into one of the V-shaped cavities after he has sipped ; but , getting wedged between the trap ' s horny teeth , the poor little victim is held a prisoner there until he slowly dies of starvation in sight of plenty . This is the penalty he must pay for trespassing on the butterfly ' s preserves ! The dogbane , which is perfectly adapted to the butterfly , and dependent upon it for help in producing fertile seed , ruthlessly destroys all poachers that are not big or strong enough to jerk away from its vise-like grasp . One often sees small flies and even moths dead and dangling by the tongue from the wicked little charmers . If the flower assimilated their dead bodies as the pitcher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the fly ' s fate would seem less cruel . To be killed by slow torture and dangled like a scarecrow simply for pilfering a drop of nectar is surely an execution of justice medieval in its severity. @# In July the most splendid of our native beetles , the green dandy ( Eumolpus auratus ) fastens itself to the dogbane ' s foliage in numbers until often the leaves appear to be studded with these brilliant little jewels . " It is not easy , " says William Hamilton Gibson , " to describe its burnished hue , which is either shimmering green , or peacock blue , or purplish-green , or refulgent ruby , according to the position in which it rests . " But it is not golden , as its specific name would imply . It confines itself exclusively to the dogbane . To prevent capture , it has a trick of drawing up its legs and rolling off into the grass its body so cleverly matches. @# From the silky coma on which the small seeds float away from long pods to found new colonies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain structural resemblances in the flowers , one might guess this plant belonged to the milkweed tribe . Formerly it was so classed ; and although the botanists have now removed its family one step away , the milkweed butterflies , especially the Monarch ( Anosia plexippus ) , ignoring the arbitrary dividing line of man , still includes the dogbane on its visiting list . We know that this plant derived its name from the fact that it was considered poisonous to dogs ; and we also know that all the tribe of milkweed butterflies are provided with protective secretions which are distasteful to birds and predaceous insects , enjoying their immunity from attack , it is thought , from the acrid , poisonous character of the foliage on which the caterpillars feed. @# COMMON MIIKWEED or SILKWEED ( Asclepias Syriaca ; A. cornuti of Gray ) Milkweed family @# Flowers - Dull pale greenish purple pink , or brownish pink , borne on pedicels , in many flowered , broad umbels .

Above them an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , containing a nectary , and with a tooth on either side , and an incurved horn projecting from within . Behind the crown the short , stout stamens , united by their filaments in a tube , are inserted on the corolla . Broad anthers united around a thick column of pistils terminating in a large , sticky , 5-angled disk . The anther sacs tipped with a winged membrane ; a waxy , pear-shaped pollen-mass in each sac connected with the stigma in pairs or fours by a dark gland , and suspended by a stalk like a pair of saddle-bags . Stem : Stout , leafy , usually unbranched , 3 to 5 ft. high , juice milky . Leaves : Opposite , oblong , entire-edged smooth above , hairy below , 4 to 9 in. long .

Wonderfully have they perfected their mechanism in every part until no member of the family even attempts to fertilize itself ; hence their triumphal , vigorous march around the earth , the tribe numbering over nineteen hundred species located chiefly in those tropical and warm , temperate regions that teem with insect life. @# Commonest of all with us is this rank weed , which possesses the dignity of a rubber plant . Much more attractive to human eyes , at least , than the dull , pale , brownish-pink umbels of flowers are its exquisite silky seed-tufts . But not so with insects . Knowing that the slightly fragrant blossoms are rich in nectar , bees , wasps , flies , beetles , and butterflies come to feast . Now , the visitor finding his alighting place slippery , his feet claw about in all directions to secure a hold , just as it was planned they should for in his struggles some of his feet must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the flower . His efforts to extricate his foot only draw it into a slot at the end of which lies a little dark-brown body . In a newly opened flower five of these little bodies may be seen between the horns of the crown , at equal distances around it . This tiny brown excrescence is hard and horny , with a notch in its face . It is continuous with and forms the end of the slot in which the visitor ' s foot is caught . Into this he must draw his foot or claw , and finding it rather tightly held , must give a vigorous jerk to get it free . Attached to either side of the little horny piece is a flattened yellow pollen-mass , and so away he flies with a pair of these pollinia , that look like tiny saddle-bags , dangling from his feet . One might think that such rough handling as many insects must submit to from flowers would discourage them from making any more visits ; but the desire for food is a mighty passion . While the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which the saddlebags are attached twists until it brings them together , that , when his feet get caught in other slots , they may be in the position to get broken off in his struggles for freedom precisely where they will fertilize the stigmatic chambers . Now the visitor flies away with the stalks alone sticking to his claws . Bumblebees and hive-bees have been caught with a dozen pollen-masses dangling from a single foot . Outrageous imposition ! @# Does this wonderful mechanism always work to perfection ? Alas ! no . It is a common thing to find dead hive-bees and flies hanging from the flowers . While still struggling to escape , the unhappy victims will be attacked by ants , beetles , and spiders , or killed by heavy showers . Larger and stronger insects than honeybees are required to regularly effect pollination and free themselves , especially when they are so unfortunate as to catch several feet in the grooves . Doubtless it is the bumblebee that can transfer pollen with impunity ; but very many other insects , not perfectly adapted to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Papilios , which suck with their wings in motion , are the most useful , because in using their legs to offset the motion of their wings they rapidly repeat those movements which are necessary to draw the pollinia from the anther cells and insert them in the stigmatic chambers of other flowers . " Large butterflies like Danais , " says Professor Robertson , " hold their wings still in sucking , spending more time on an umbel , but generally carrying pollinia . Small butterflies are worse than useless . They remain long on the umbels sucking , but resting their feet superficially on the flowers. @# Since several moths were found entrapped , pollination must often be brought about by night-flying Lepidoptera . As a rule , Diptera ( flies ) either do not transfer pollinia at all , or become hopelessly entangled when they do . " Occasionally pollen-masses are found on the tongues of insects , especially on those of bees and wasps , which move about with their unruly member sticking out . Probably no one has ever made the exhaustive and absorbingly interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than any written description of the milkweed blossom ' s mechanism is a simple experiment . If you have neither time nor patience to sit in the hot sun , magnifying glass in hand , and watch for an unwary insect to get caught , take an ordinary housefly , and hold it by the wings so that it may claw at one of the newly opened flowers from which no pollinia have been removed . It tries frantically to hold on , and with a little direction it may be led to catch its claws in the slots of the flower . Now pull it gently away , and you will find a pair of saddlebags slung over his foot by a slender curved stalk . If you are rarely skilful , you may induce your fly to withdraw the pollinia from all five slots on as many of his feet . And they are not to be thrown or scraped off , let the fly try as hard as he pleases . You may now invite the fly to take a walk on another flower in which he will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @# Dr. Kerner thought the milky juice in milkweed plants , especially abundant in the uppermost leaves and stems , serves to protect the flowers from useless crawling pilferers . He once started a number of ants to climb up a milky stalk . When they neared the summit , he noticed that at each movement the terminal hooks of their feet cut through the tender epiderm , and from the little clefts the milky juice began to flow , bedraggling their feet and the hind part of their bodies . " The ants were much impeded in their movements , " he writes , " and in order to rid themselves of the annoyance , drew their feet through their mouths . Their movements however , which accompanied these efforts , simply resulted in making fresh fissures and fresh discharges of milky juice , so that the position of the ants became each moment worse and worse . Many escaped by getting to the edge of a leaf and dropping to the ground . Others tried this method of escape too late , for the air soon hardened the milky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all the strugglings of the ants to free themselves from the viscid matter were in vain . " Nature ' s methods of preserving a flower ' s nectar for the insects that are especially adapted to fertilize it , and of punishing all useless intruders , often shock us yet justice is ever stern , ever kind in the largest sense. @# If the asclepias really do kill some insects with their juice , others doubtless owe their lives to it . Among the " protected " insects are the milkweed butterflies and their caterpillars , which are provided with secretions that are distasteful to birds and predaceous insects . " These acrid secretions are probably due to the character of the plants upon which the caterpillars feed , " says Dr. Holland , in his beautiful and invaluable " Butterfly Book . " " Enjoying on this account immunity from attack , they have all , in the process of time , been mimicked by species in other genera which have not the same immunity .

" @# Like the dandelion , thistle , and other triumphant strugglers for survival , the milkweed sends its offspring adrift on the winds to found fresh colonies afar . Children delight in making pompons for their hats by removing the silky seed-tufts from pods before they burst , and winding them , one by one , on slender stems with fine thread .

From Eastern Massachusetts to Virginia , and westward to the Mississippi , or beyond , it is to be found in dry fields , woods , and thickets. @# The SWAMP MILKWEED ( A. incarnata ) , on the other hand , rears its intense purplish-red or pinkish hoods in wet places . Its leaves are lance-shaped or oblong-lanceolate , whereas the purple milkweed ' s leaves are oblong or ovate-oblong . This is a smooth plant ; and a similar species once reckoned as a mere variety ( A. pulchra ) is the HAIRY MILKWEED . It differs chiefly in having some hairs on the under side of its leaves , and a great many hairs on its stem . Both plants bear erect , rather slender , tapering pods. @# The POKE or TALL MILKWEED ( A. exaltata - A. phytolaecoides of Gray ) may attain a height of six feet if the moist soil in which it grows be exactly to its liking .

Usually there are no leaves on the lower part . Small terminal umbels of delicate pink and white fragrant flowers , which appear from May till July , give place to very narrow pointed pods in late summer .

Calyx of 5 sepals , concealed by 2 large bracts at base . Corolla 5-lobed , the 5 included stamens inserted on its tube ; style with 2 oblong stigmas . Stem : Smooth or hairy , 3 to 10 ft. long , twining or trailing over ground . Leaves : Triangular or arrow-shaped , 2 to 5 in. long , on slender petioles . Preferred Habitat - Wayside hedges , thickets , fields , walls . Flowering Season - June-September . Distribution - Nova Scotia to North Carolina , westward to Nebraska . Europe and Asia. @# No one need be told that the pretty , bell-shaped pink and white flower on the vigorous vine clambering over stone walls and winding about the shrubbery of wayside thickets in a suffocating embrace is akin to the morning-glory of the garden trellis ( C. major ) . An exceedingly rapid climber , the twining stem often describes a complete circle in two hours , turning against the sun , or just contrary to the hands of a watch . Late in the season , when an abundance of seed has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer hours , also in rainy weather ; but early in the summer , at least , it must attend to business only while the sun shines and its benefactors are flying . Usually it closes at sundown . On moonlight nights , however , the hospitable blossom keeps open for the benefit of certain moths . In Europe the plant ' s range is supposed to be limited to that of a crepuscular moth ( Sphinx convolvuli ) , and where that benefactor is rare , as in England , the bindweed sets few seeds where it does not occur , as in Scotland , this convolvulus is seldom found wild ; whereas in Italy Delpino tells of catching numbers of the moths in hedges overgrown with the common plant , by standing with thumb and forefinger over a flower , ready to close it when the insect has entered . We know that every floral clock is regulated by the hours of flight of its insect friends . When they have retired , the flowers close to protect nectar and pollen from useless pilferers . In this country various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the white streaks , or pathfinders , they crawl into the deep tube and sip through one of the five narrow passages leading to the nectary . A transverse section of the flower cut to show these five passages standing in a circle around the central ovary looks like the end of a five-barreled revolver . Insects without a suitably long proboscis are , of course , excluded by this arrangement. @# From July until hard frost look for that exquisite little beetle , Cassida aurichalcea , like a drop of molten gold , clinging beneath the bindweed ' s leaves . The small perforations reveal his hiding places . " But you must be quick if you would capture him , " says William Hamilton Gibson , " for he is off in a spangling streak of glitter . Nor is this golden sheen all the resource of the little insect ; for in the space of a few seconds , as you hold him in your hand , he has become a milky , iridescent opal , and now mother-of-pearl , and finally crawls before you in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all this wonderful luster . Even on the morning-glory in our gardens we may sometimes find these jeweled mites , or their fork-tailed , black larvae , or the tiny chrysalids suspended by their tails , although it is the wild bindweed that is ever their favorite abiding place. @# The small FIELD BINDWEED ( C. arvensis ) , a common immigrant from Europe , which has taken up its abode from Nova Scotia and Ontario southward to New Jersey , and westward to Kansas , trails over the ground with a deathless persistency which fills farmers with dismay . It is like a small edition of the hedge bind weed , only its calyx lacks the leaf-like bracts at its base , its slender stem rarely exceeds two feet in length , and the little pink and white flowers often grow in pairs . Their habit of closing both in the evening and in rainy weather indicates that they are adapted for diurnal insects only ; but if the bell hang down , or if the corolla drop off , the pollen must fall on the stigma and effect self-fertilization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bindweed , attracted by the peculiar fragrance , and led by the white streaks to the orange-colored under surface of the ovary , where the nectar lies concealed . Stigmas and anthers mature at the same time ; but as the former are slightly the longer , they receive pollen brought from another flower before the visitor gets freshly dusted. @# GROUND OR MOSS PINK ( Phlox subulata ) Phlox family @# Flowers - Very numerous , small , deep purplish pink , lavender or rose , varying to white , with a darker eye , growing in simple cymes , or solitary in a Western variety . Calyx with 5 slender teeth ; corolla salver-form with 5 spreading lobes ; 5 stamens inserted on corolla tube ; style 3-lobed . Stems : Rarely exceeding 6 in. in height , tufted like mats , much branched , plentifully set with awl-shaped , evergreen leaves barely 1/2 in. long , growing in tufts at joints of stem . Preferred Habitat - Rocky ground , hillsides . Flowering Season - April-June Distribution - Southern New York to Florida , westward to Michigan and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evergreen mats with which Nature carpets dry , sandy , and rocky hillsides , is often completely hidden beneath its wealth of flowers . Far beyond its natural range , as well as within it , the moss pink glows in gardens , cemeteries and parks , wherever there are rocks to conceal or sterile wastes to beautify . Very slight encouragement induces it to run wild . There are great rocks in Central Park , New York , worth travelling miles to see in early May , when their stern faces are flushed and smiling with these blossoms. @# Another low ground species is the CRAWLING PHLOX ( P. reptans ) . It rarely exceeds six inches in height ; nevertheless its larger pink , purple , or white flowers , clustered after the manner of the tall garden phloxes , are among the most showy to be found in the spring woods . A number of sterile shoots with obovate leaves , tapering toward the base , rise from the runners and set off the brilliant blossoms among their neat foliage . From Pennsylvania southward and westward is its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , was long ago transplanted from Nature ' s gardens into man ' s. @# Large patches of the DOWNY PHLOX ( P. pilosa ) brighten dry prairie land with its pinkish blossoms in late spring . Britton and Brown ' s botany gives its range as " Ontario to Manitoba , New Jersey , Florida , Arkansas , and Texas . " The plant does its best to attain a height of two feet ; usually its flowers are much nearer the ground . Butterflies , the principal visitors of most phloxes , although long-tongued bees and even flies can sip their nectar , are ever seen hovering above them and transferring pollen , although in this species the style is so short pollen must often fall into the tube and self-fertilize the stigma . To protect the flowers from useless crawling visitors , the calices are coated with sticky matter , and the stems are downy. @# OBEDIENT PLANT ; FALSE DRAGONHEAD ; LION ' S HEART ( Physostegia Virginiana ) Mint family @# Flowers - Pale magenta , purplish rose , or flesh-colored , often variegated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dense spikes from 4 to 8 in. long . Calyx a 5-toothed oblong bell , swollen and remaining open in fruit , held up by lance-shaped bracts . Corolla tubular and much enlarged where it divides into 2 lips , the upper lip concave , rounded , entire , the lower lip 3 lobed . Stamens 4 , in two pairs under roof of upper lip , the filaments hairy ; 1 pistil . Stem : 1 to 4 ft. high , simple or branched above , leafy . Leaves : Opposite , firm , oblong to oblong-lanceolate , narrowing at base , deeply saw-edged . Preferred Habitat - Moist soil . Flowering Season - July-September . Distribution - Quebec to the Northwest Territory , southward to the Gulf of Mexico as far west as Texas. @# Bright patches of this curious flower enliven railroad ditches , gutters , moist meadows and brooksides - curious , for it has the peculiarity of remaining in any position in which it is placed . With one puff a child can easily blow the blossoms to the opposite side of the spike , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The flowers are made to assume their definite position , " says Professor W. W. Bailey in the " Botanical Gazette , " " by friction of the pedicels against the subtending bracts . Remove the bracts , and they at once fall limp. " @# of course the plant has some better reason for this peculiar obedience to every breath that blows than to amuse windy-cheeked boys and girls . Is not the ready movement useful during stormy weather in turning the mouth of the flower away from driving rain , and in fair days , when insects are abroad , in presenting its gaping lips where they can best alight ? We all know that insects , like birds , make long flights most easily with the wind , but in rising and alighting it is their practice to turn against it . When bees , for example , are out for food on windy days , and must make frequent stops for refreshment among the flowers , they will be found going against the wind , possibly to catch the whiffs of fragrance borne on it that guide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise and alight readily . One always sees bumblebees conspicuous among the obedient plant ' s visitors . After the anthers have shed their pollen - and tiny teeth at the edges of the outer pair aid its complete removal by insects - the stigma comes up to occupy their place under the roof . Certainly this flower ; which is so ill-adapted to fertilize itself , has every reason to court insect messengers in fair and stormy ' weather. @# MOTHERWORT ( Leonurus Cardiaca ) Mint family. @# Flowers - Dull purple pink , pale purple , or white , small , clustered in axils of upper leaves . Calyx tubular , bell-shaped , with 5 rigid awl-like teeth ; corolla 2-lipped , upper lip arched , woolly without ; lower lip 3-lobed , spreading , mottled ; the tube with oblique ring of hairs inside . Four twin-like stamens , anterior pair longer , reaching under upper lip ; style 2-cleft at summit . Stem : 2 to 5 ft. tall , straight , branched , leafy , purplish .

Naturalized from Europe and Asia. @# " One is tempted to say that the most human plants , after all , are the weeds , " says John Burroughs . " How they cling to man and follow him around the world , and spring up wherever he sets foot How they crowd around his barns and dwellings , and throng his garden , and jostle and override each other in their strife to be near him ! Some of them are so domestic and familiar , and so harmless withal , that one comes to regard them with positive affection . Motherwort , catnip , plantain , tansy , wild mustard - what a homely , human look they have ! They are an integral part of every old homestead . Your smart , new place will wait long before they draw near it. " @# @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One nearly always sees them clinging to the close whorls of flowers that are strung along the stem , and of course transferring pollen , in recompense , as they journey on . A more credulous generation imported the plant for its alleged healing virtues . What is the significance of its Greek name , meaning a lion ' s tail ? Let no one suggest , by a far-stretched metaphor , that our grandmothers , in Revolutionary days , enjoyed pulling it to vent their animosity against the British. @# WILD BERGAMOT ( Monarda fisiulosa ) Mint family @# Flowers - Extremely variable , purplish , lavender , magenta , rose , pink , yellowish pink , or whitish , dotted ; clustered in a solitary , nearly flat terminal head . Calyx tubular , narrow , 5-toothed , very hairy within . Corolla 1 to 1 1/2 in. long , tubular , 2-lipped , upper lip erect , toothed ; lower lip spreading , 3-lobed , middle lobe longest ; 2 anther-bearing stamens protruding ; 1 pistil ; the style 2-lobed .

Preferred Habitat - Open woods , thickets , dry rocky hills . Flowering Season - June-September . Distribution - Eastern Canada and Maine , westward to Minnesota , south to Gulf of Mexico. @# Half a dozen different shades of bloom worn by this handsome , robust perennial afford an excellent illustration of the trials that beset one who would arbitrarily group flowers according to color . If the capricious blossom shows a decided preference for any shade , it is for magenta , the royal purple of the ancients , scarcely tolerated now except by Hoboken Dutch and the belles of the kitchen , whose Sunday hats are resplendent with intense effects. @# Only a few bergamot flowers open at a time ; the rest of the slightly rounded head , thickly set with hairy calices , looks as if it might be placed in a glass cup and make an excellent pen wiper . If the cultivated human eye ( and stomach ) revolt at magenta , It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ecstasy over the gay flowers ; indeed , they are the principal visitors and benefactors , for the erect corollas , exposed organs , and level-topped heads are well adapted to their requirements . That exquisite little feathered jewel , the ruby-throated hummingbird , flashes about the bright patches an instant , and is gone ; but he too has paid for his feast in transferring pollen . Insects which land anywhere they please on the flowers , receive pollen on various places , just as in the case of the scarlet Oswego tea , of similar formation . Small bees , which if unable to drain the brimming tubes of nectar , at least sip from them and help themselves to pollen also , without paying the flower ' s price ; and certain mischievous wasps , forever bent on nipping holes in tubes they can not honestly drain , give a score of other pilferers an opportunity to steal sweets. @# SNAKE-HEAD ; TURTLE-HEAD ; BALMONY ; SHELL-FLOWER ; COD-HEAD ( Chelone glabra ) Figwort family @# Flowers - White tinged with pink , or all white , about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Calyx 5-parted , bracted at base ; corolla irregular , broadly tubular , 2-lipped ; upper lip arched , swollen , slightly notched ; lower lip 3-lobed , spreading , woolly within ; 5 stamens , sterile , 4 in pairs , anther-bearing , woolly ; 1 pistil .

Distribution - Newfoundland to Florida , and half way across the continent. @# It requires something of a struggle for even so strong and vigorous an insect as the bumblebee to gain admission to this inhospitable-looking flower before maturity ; and even he abandons the attempt over and over again in its earliest stage before the little heart-shaped anthers are prepared to dust him over . As they mature , it opens slightly , but his weight alone is insufficient to bend down the stiff , yet elastic , lower lip . Energetic prying admits first his head , then he squeezes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally disappears inside . At the moment when he is forcing his way in , causing the lower lip to spring up and down , the eyeless turtle seems to chew and chew until the most sedate beholder must smile at the paradoxical show . Of course it is the bee that is feeding , though the flower would seem to be masticating the bee with the keenest relish The counterfeit tortoise soon disgorges its lively mouthful , however , and away flies the bee , carrying pollen on his velvety back to rub on the stigma of an older flower . After the anthers have shed their pollen and become effete , the stigma matures , and occupies their place . By this time the flower presents a wider entrance , and as the moisture-loving plant keeps the nectaries abundantly filled , what is to prevent insects too small to come in contact with anthers and stigma in the roof from pilfering to their heart ' s content ? The woolly throat discourages many , to be sure ; but the turtle-head , like its cousins the beard-tongues , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act as a drop-bar across the base of the flower . The long-tongued bumblebee can get his drink over the bar , but smaller , unwelcome visitors are literally barred out. @# If bees are the preferred visitors of the turtle-head , why do we find the Baltimore butterfly , that very beautiful , but freaky , creature ( Melitaea phaeton ) hovering near ? - that is , when we find it at all ; for where it is present , it swarms , and keeps away from other localities altogether . On the under side of the leaves we shall often see patches of its crimson eggs . Later the caterpillars use the plant as their main , if not exclusive , food store . They are the innocent culprits which nine times out of ten mutilate the foliage. @# LARGE PURPLE GERARDIA ( Gerardia purpurea ) Figwort family @# Flowers - Bright purplish pink , deep magenta , or pale to whitish , about 1 in. long and broad , growing along the rigid , spreading branches . Calyx 5-toothed ; corolla funnel-form , the tube much inflated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spotted within , or sometimes downy ; 4 stamens in pairs , the filaments hairy ; 1 pistil . Stem : 1 to 2 1/2 ft. high , slender , branches erect or spreading . Leaves : Opposite , very narrow , 1 to 1 1/2 in. long . Preferred Habitat - Low fields and meadows ; moist , sandy soil . Flowering Season - August-October . Distribution - Northern United States to Florida , chiefly along Atlantic coast. @# Low-lying meadows gay with gerardias were never seen by that quaint old botanist and surgeon , John Gerarde , author of the famous " Herball or General Historie of Plants , " a folio of nearly fourteen hundred pages , published in London toward the close of Queen Elizabeth ' s reign . He died without knowing how much he was to be honored by Linnaeus in giving his name to this charming American genus. @# Large patches of the lavender-pink gerardia , peeping above the grass , make the wayfarer pause to feast his eyes , while the practical bee , meanwhile , takes a more substantial meal within the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down while sucking , using the hairs on the filaments as footholds . Naturally he receives the pollen on his underside - just where it will be rubbed off against the stigma impeding his entrance to the next funnel visited . Any of the very dry pollen that may have fallen on the hairy filaments drops upon him. @# " And ' t is my faith that every flower Enjoys the air it breathes , " @# chanted Wordsworth . It is a special pity to gather the gerardias , which , as they grow , seem to enjoy life to the full , and when picked , to be so miserable they turn black as they dry . Like their relatives the foxgloves , they are difficult to transplant , because it is said they are more or less parasitic , fastening their roots on those of other plants . When robbery becomes flagrant , Nature brands sinners in the vegetable kingdom by taking away their color , and perhaps their leaves , as in the case of the broom-rape and Indian pipe ; but the fair faces of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committed under cover of darkness in the soil below. @# The SMALL-FLOWERED GERARDIA ( G. Paupercula ) so like the preceding species it was once thought to be a mere variety , ranges westward as far as Wisconsin , especially about the Great Lakes . But it is a lower plant , with more erect branches , smaller flowers , quite woolly within , and with a decided preference for bogs as well as low meadows. @# In salt marshes along the Atlantic Coast and the Gulf of Mexico , from Maine to Louisiana , the SEA-SIDE GERARDIA ( G. maritima ) flowers in midsummer , or a few weeks ahead of the autumnal , upland species . The plant , which rarely exceeds a foot in height , is sometimes only four inches above ground ; and although at the North the paler magenta blossoms are only about half the length of the purple gerardias , in the South they are sometimes quite as long. @# In dry woods and thickets , on banks and hills from Quebec to Georgia , and westward to the Mississippi we find the SLENDER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spotted , compressed corolla about half an inch long ; its very slender , low stem set with exceedingly narrow leaves. @# TWIN-FLOWER ; GROUND VINE ( Linnaea borealis ) Honeysuckle family @# Flowers - Delicate pink or white tinged with rose , bell-shaped , about 1/2 in. long , fragrant , nodding in pairs on slender , curved pedicels from an erect peduncle , 2-bracted where they join . Calyx 5-toothed , sticky ; corolla 5-lobed , bell-shaped , hairy within ; 4 stamens in pairs inserted near base of tube ; 1 pistil . Stem : Trailing , 6 in. to 2 ft. long ; the branches erect . Leaves : Opposite , rounded , petioled , evergreen . Preferred Habitat - Deep , cool , mossy woods . Flowering Season - May-July . Distribution - Northern parts of America , Europe , and Asia . In the United States southward as far as the mountains of Maryland , and the Sierra Nevadas in California. @# With the consent of modest Linnaeus himself , Dr. Gronovius selected this typical woodland blossom to transmit the great master ' s flame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flowers. " @# But small and shy as it is , does Nature ' s garden contain a lovelier sight than scores of these deliciously fragrant pink bells swaying above a carpet of the little evergreen leaves in the dim aisle of some deep , cool , lonely forest ? Trailing over prostrate logs and mossy rocks , racing with the partridge vine among the ferns and dwarf cornels , the plant sends up " twin-born heads " that seem more fair and sweet than the most showy pampered darlings of the millionaire ' s conservatory . Little wonder that Linnaeus loved these little twin sisters , or that Emerson enshrined them in his verse. @# Contrary to popular impression , this vine , that suggests the dim old forest and exhales the very breath of the spring woods , will consent to run about our rock gardens , although it seems almost a sacrilege to move it from natural surroundings so impressively beautiful . Unlike the arbutus , which remains ever a wildling , pining slowly to death on close contact with civilization , the twin-flower thrives in light , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while only in the morning . By nodding its head the flower protects its precious contents from rain , the hairs inside exclude small pilferers ; but bees , attracted by the fragrance and color , are guided to the nectary by five dark lines and a patch of orange color near it. @# JOE-PYE WEED ; TRUMPET WEED ; PURPLE THOROUGHWORT ; GRAVEL or KIDNEY-ROOT ; TALL or PURPLE BONESET ( Eupatorium purpureum ) Thistle family @# Flower-heads - Pale or dull magenta or lavender pink , slightly fragrant , of tubular florets only , very numerous , in large , terminal , loose , compound clusters , generally elongated . Several series of pink overlapping bracts form the oblong involucre from which the tubular floret and its protruding fringe of style-branches arise . Stem : 3 to 10 ft. high , green or purplish , leafy , usually branching toward top . Leaves : In whorls of 3 to 6 ( usually 4 ) , oval to lance-shaped , saw-edged , petioled , thin , rough . Preferred Habitat - Moist soil , meadows , woods , low ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Gulf of Mexico , westward to Manitoba and Texas. @# Towering above the surrounding vegetation of low-lying meadows , this vigorous composite spreads clusters of soft , fringy bloom that , however deep or pale of tint , are ever conspicuous advertisements , even when the goldenrods , sunflowers , and asters enter into close competition for insect trade . Slight fragrance , which to the delicate perception of butterflies is doubtless heavy enough , the florets ' color and slender tubular form indicate an adaptation to them , and they are by far the most abundant visitors , which is not to say that long-tongued bees and flies never reach the nectar and transfer pollen , for they do . But an excellent place for the butterfly collector to carry his net is to a patch of Joe-Pye weed in September . As the spreading style-branches that fringe each tiny floret are furnished with hairs for three-quarters of their length , the pollen caught in them comes in contact with the alighting visitor . Later , the lower portion of the style-branches , that is covered with stigmatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receive pollen carried from younger flowers when the visitor sips his reward . If the hairs still contain pollen when the stigmatic part of the style is exposed , insects self-fertilize the flower ; and if in stormy , weather no insects are flying , the flower is nevertheless able to fertilize itself , because the hairy fringe must often come in contact with the stigmas of neighboring florets . It is only when we study flowers with reference to their motives and methods that we understand why one is abundant and another rare . Composites long ago utilized many principles of success in life that the triumphant Anglo-Saxon carries into larger affairs today. @# Joe-Pye , an Indian medicine-man of New England , earned fame and fortune by curing typhus fever and other horrors with decoctions made from this plant. @# COMMON BURDOCK ; COCKLE-BUR ; BEGGARS BUTTONS ; CLOT-BUR ; CUCKOO BUTTON ( Arctium minus ; Lappa officinalis : var. minor of Gray ) Thistle family @# Flower-heads - Composite of tubular florets only , about 1/2 in. broad ; magenta varying to purplish or white ; the prominent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hooked bristles . Stem : 2 to 5 ft. high , simple or branching , coarse . Leaves : Large , the lower ones often 1 ft. long , broadly ovate , entire edged , pale or loosely cottony beneath , on hollow petioles . Preferred Habitat - Waste ground , waysides , fields , barnyards . Flowering Season - July-October . Distribution - Common throughout our area . Naturalized from Europe. @# A larger burdock than this ( A. Lappa ) may be more common in a few localities of the East , but wherever one wanders , this plebeian boldly asserts itself . In close-cropped pastures it still flourishes with the well-armed thistles and mulleins , for the great leaves contain an exceedingly bitter , sour juice , distasteful to grazers . Nevertheless the unpaid cattle , like every other beast and man , must nolens volens transplant the burs far away from the parent plant to found new colonies . Literally by hook or by crook they steal a ride on every switching tail , every hairy dog and woolly sheep , every trouser-leg or petticoat . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burs , aid them in their insatiate love of travel . Wherever man goes , they follow , until , having crossed Europe - with the Romans ? - they are now at home throughout this continent . Their vitality is amazing ; persecution with scythe and plow may retard , but never check their victorious march . Opportunity for a seed to germinate may not come until late in the summer ; but at once the plant sets to work putting forth flowers and maturing seed , losing no time in developing superfluous stalk and branches . Butterflies , which , like the Hoboken Dutch , ever delight in magenta , and bees of various kinds , find these flowers , with a slight fragrance as an additional attraction , generous entertainers. @# Pink , of all colors , is the most unstable in our flora , and the most likely to fade . Magentas incline to purple , on the one hand , or to pure pink on the other , and delicate shades quickly blanch when long exposed to the sun ' s rays . Thus we frequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , azalea , bouncing Bet , and turtle-head . Albinos , too , regularly occur in numerous species . Many colored flowers show a tendency among individuals to revert to the white type of their ancestors . The reader should bear these facts in mind , and search for his unidentified flower in the previous section or in the following one if this group does not contain it. @# @# WHITE AND GREENISH FLOWERS @# " The transition from wind-fertilization to insect-fertilization and the first traces of adaptation to insects , could only be due to the influence of quite short-lipped insects with feebly developed color sense . The most primitive flowers are therefore for the most part simple , widely open , regular , devoid of nectar or with their nectar unconcealed and easily accessible , and greenish , white , or yellow in color . . . . Lepidoptera , by the thinness , sometimes by the length , of their tongues , were able to produce special modifications . Through their agency were developed flowers with long and narrow tubes , whose colors and time of opening were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " - Hermann Muller. @# " Of all colors , white is the prevailing one ; and of white flowers a considerably larger proportion smell sweetly than of any other color , namely , 14. 6 per cent ; of red only 8. 2 per cent are odoriferous . The fact of a large proportion of white flowers smelling sweetly may depend in part on those which are fertilized by moths requiring the double aid of conspicuousness in the dusk and of odor . So great is the economy of Nature , that most flowers which are fertilized by crepuscular or nocturnal insects emit their odor chiefly or exclusively in the evening. " - Charles Darwin. @# WATER-PLANTAIN ( Alisma Plantago-aquatica ) Water-plantain family @# Flowers - Very small and numerous , white , or pale pink , whorled in bracted clusters forming a large , loose panicle 6 to 15 in. long on a usually solitary scape 1/2 to 3 ft. high . Calyx of 3 sepals corolla of 3 deciduous petals ; 6 or more stamens ; many carpels in a ring on a small flat receptacle . Leaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several ribs , or lance-shaped or grass-like , petioled , all from root . Perferred Habitat - Shallow water , mud , marshes . Flowering Season - June-September . Distribution - North America , Europe , Asia. @# Unlike its far more showy , decorative cousin the arrow-head , this wee-blossomed plant , whose misty white panicles rise with compensating generosity the world around , bears only perfect , regular flowers . Twelve infinitesimal drops of nectar , secreted in a fleshy ring around the center , are eagerly sought by flies . As the anthers point obliquely outward and away from the stigmas , an incoming fly , bearing pollen on his under side , usually alights in the center , and leaves some of the vitalizing dust just where it is most needed . But a " fly starting from a petal , " says Muller , " usually applies its tongue to the nectar-drops one by one , and after each it strokes an anther with its labellae ; in so doing it may bring various parts of its body in contact with the anthers . As a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the anthers are not those which come in contact with the stigmas in the same flower . " Any plant that lives in shallow water , which may dry up as summer advances , is under special necessity to produce an extra quantity of cross-fertilized seed to guard against extinction during drought . For the same reason it bears several kinds of leaves adapted to its environment : broad ones that spread their surfaces to the sunshine , and long grass-like ones to glide through currents of water that would tear those of any other shape . What diversity of leaf-form and structure we meet daily , and yet how very little does the wisest man of science understand of the reasons underlying such marvellous adaptability ! @# BROAD-LEAVED ARROWHEAD ( Sagittaria latifolia ; S. variabilis of Gray ) Water-plantain family @# Flowers - White , 1 to 1 1/2 in. wide , in 3-bracted whorls of 3 , borne near the summit of a leafless scape 4 in. to 4 ft. tall . Calyx of 3 sepals corolla of 3 rounded , spreading petals . Stamens and pistils numerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imperfect in lower pistillate flowers . Leaves : Exceedingly variable ; those under water usually long and grasslike ; upper ones sharply arrow-shaped or blunt and broad , spongy or leathery , on long petioles . Preferred Habitat - Shallow water and mud . Flowering Season - July-September . Distribution - From Mexico northward throughout our area to the circumpolar regions. @# Wading into shallow water or standing on some muddy shore , like a heron , this striking plant , so often found in that bird ' s haunts , is quite as decorative in a picture , and , happily , far more approachable in life . Indeed , one of the comforts of botany as compared with bird study is that we may get close enough to the flowers to observe their last detail , whereas the bird we have followed laboriously over hill and dale , through briers and swamps , darts away beyond the range of field-glasses with tantalizing swiftness. @# While no single plant is yet thoroughly known to scientists , in spite of the years of study devoted by specialists to separate groups , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majestic order of movement of the heavenly bodies , he exclaimed , " Oh God , I think Thy thoughts after Thee ! " - the expression of a discipleship every reverent soul must be conscious of in penetrating , be it ever so little a way , into the inner meaning of the humblest wayside weed. @# Fragile , delicate , pure white , golden-centered flowers of the arrowhead , usually clustered about the top of the scape , naturally are the first to attract the attention whether of man or insect . Below these , dull green , unattractive collections of pistils , which by courtesy only may be called flowers , also form little groups of three . Like the Quakers at meeting , the male and female arrowhead flowers are separated , often on distinct plants . Of course the insect visitors - bees and flies chiefly - alight on the showy staminate blossoms first , and transfer pollen from them to the dull pistillate ones later , as it was intended they should , to prevent self-fertilization . How endless are the devices of the flowers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cross-pollinate them ! The most minute detail of the mechanism involved , which the microscope reveals , only increases our interest and wonder. @# Any plant which elects to grow in shallow water must be amphibious ; it must be able to breathe beneath the surface as the fish do , and also be adapted to thrive without those parts that correspond to gills ; for ponds and streams have an unpleasant way of drying up in summer , leaving it stranded on the shore . This accounts in part for the variable leaves on the arrowhead , those underneath the water being long and ribbon-like , to bring the greatest possible area into contact with the air with which the water is charged . Broad leaves would be torn to shreds by the current through which grass-like blades glide harmlessly ; but when this plant grows on shore , having no longer use for its lower ribbons , it loses them , and expands only broad arrow-shaped surfaces to the sunny air , leaves to be supplied with carbonic acid to assimilate , and sunshine to turn off the oxygen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ARUM ; MARSH CALLA ( Calla palustris ) Arum family @# Flowers - Minute , greenish yellow , clustered on a cylinder-like , fleshy spadix about 1 in. long , partly enfolded by a large , white , oval , pointed , erect spathe , the whole resembling a small calla lily open in front . The solitary " flower " on a scape as long as the petioles of leaves , and , like them , sheathed at base . Leaves : Thick , somewhat heart-shaped , their spreading or erect petioles 4 to 8 in. long . Fruit : Red berries clustered in a head . Preferred Habitat - Cool Northern bogs ; in or beside sluggish water . Flowering Season - May-June . Distribution - Nova Scotia southward to Virginia , westward to Minnesota and Iowa. @# At a glance one knows this beautiful denizen of Northern bogs and ditches to be a poor relation of the stately Ethiopian calla lily of our greenhouses . Where the arum grows in rich , cool retreats , it is apt to be abundant , its slender rootstocks running hither and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place is carpeted with its handsome dark leaves , from which the pure white " flowers " arise ; and yet many flower lovers well up in field practice know it not . Thoreau , for example , was no longer young when he first saw , or , rather , noticed it . " Having found this in one place , " he wrote , " I now find it in another . Many an object is not seen , though it falls within the range of our visual ray , because it does not come within the range of our intellectual ray . So , in the largest sense , we find only the world we look for. " @# Now , the true flowers of the arum and all its spadix-bearing kin are so minute that one scarcely notices them where they are clustered on the club-shaped column in the center of the apparent " flower . " The beautiful white banner of the marsh calla , or the green and maroon striped pulpit from which Jack preaches , is no more the flower proper than the papery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arum the white advertisement flaunted before flying insects is not even essential to the florets ' existence , except as it helps them attract their pollen-carrying friends . Almost all waterside plants , it will be noticed , depend chiefly upon flies and midges , and these lack aesthetic taste . " Such plants have usually acquired small and inconspicuous separate flowers , " says Grant Allen ; " and then , to make up for their loss in attractiveness , like cheap sweetmeats , they have very largely increased their numbers . Or , to put the matter more simply and physically , in waterside situations those plants succeed best which have a relatively large number of individually small and unnoticeable flowers massed together into large and closely serried bundles . Hence , in such situations , there is a tendency for petals to be suppressed , and for blossoms to grow minute ; because the large and bright flowers seldom succeed in attracting big land insects like bees or butterflies , while the small and thick-set ones usually do succeed in attracting a great many little flitting midges . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of smell than by sight , resort to the petalless , insignificant florets of the ill-scented marsh calla in numbers ; and as the uppermost clusters are staminate only , while the lower florets contain stamens and pistil , it follows they must often effect cross-pollination as they crawl over the spadix . But here is no trap to catch the tiny benefactors such as is set by wicked Jack-in-the-pulpit , or the skunk-cabbage , or another cousin , a still more terrible executioner , the cuckoo-pint ( Arum maculatum ) of Europe. @# Few coroner ' s inquests are held over the dead bodies of our feathered friends ; and it is not known whether the innocent-looking marsh calla really poisons the birds on which it depends to carry its bright seeds afar or not . The cuckoo-pint , as is well known , destroys the winged messenger bearing its offspring to plant fresh colonies in a distant bog , because the decayed body of the bird acts as the best possible fertilizer into which the seedling may strike its roots . Most of our noxious weeds , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Heaven deliver us from this cannibalistic pest ! @# The very common GREEN ARROW-ARUM ( Peltandra Virginica ) , found in shallow water , ditches , swamps , and the muddy shores of ponds throughout the eastern half of the United States , attracts us more by its stately growth and the beauty of its bright , lustrous green arrow-shaped leaves ( which have been found thirty inches long ) , than by the insignificant florets clustered on the spadix within a long pointed green sheath that closely enfolds it . Pistillate florets cover it for only about one-fourth its length . To them flies carry pollen from the staminate florets covering the rest of the spadix . After the club is set with green berries - green , for this plant has no need to attract birds with bright red ones - the flower stalk curves , bends downward , and the pointed leathery sheath acting as an auger , it bores a hole into the soft mud in which the seeds germinate with the help of their surrounding jelly as a fertilizer. @# AMERICAN WHITE HELLEBORE ; INDIAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Flowers - Dingy , pale yellowish or whitish green , growing greener with age , 1 in. or less across , very numerous , in stiff-branching , spike-like , dense-flowered panicles .

Pliny told how the horses , oxen , and swine of his day were killed by eating the foliage of the black hellebore .

Grace of line , rather than beauty of blossom , gives them both their chief charm .

Later in summer , when hungry birds wander through the woods with increased families , the wild spikenard offers them branching clusters of pale red speckled berries , whereas the latter plant feasts them with blue-black fruit , in the hope that they will drop the seeds miles away. @# By clustering its small , slightly fragrant flowers at the end of its stem , the wild spikenard offers a more taking advertisement to its insect friends than its cousin can show . A few flies and beetles visit them ; but apparently the less specialized bees , chiefly those of the Halictus tribe , which predominate in May , are the principal guests . These alight in the center of the widely expanded blossoms set on the upper side of the branching raceme so as to make their nectar and pollen easily accessible ; and as the newly opened flower has its stigma already receptive to pollen brought to it while its own anthers are closed , it follows the plant is dependent upon the bees ' help , as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ STAR-FLOWERED SOLOMON ' S SEAL ( V. stellata ) , found from the Atlantic to the Pacific , from Newfoundland as far south as Kansas , has larger , but fewer , flowers than the wild spikenard , at the end of its erect , low-growing stem . Where the two species grow together - and they often do - it will be noticed that the star-flowered one frequently forms colonies on rich , moist banks , its leaves partly clasp the stem , and its berries , which may be entirely black , are more frequently green , with six black stripes. @# The TWO-LEAVED SOLOMON ' S SEAL , or FALSE LILY-OF-THE-VALLEY ( Unifolium Canadense ) , very common in moist woods and thickets North and West , is a curious little plant , sometimes with only a solitary , long-petioled leaf ; but where many of these sterile plants grow together , forming shining beds .

" We may suppose , " says Professor Robertson , " that the pendulous position of the flowers owes its origin to the fact that it renders them less convenient to other insects , but equally convenient to the higher bees which are the most efficient pollinators ; and that the resulting protection to pollen and nectar is merely an incidental effect .

It is a variable , capricious plant , with a stout or slender stem , perhaps only one foot high , or again towering above the tallest man ' s head ; the oval leaves also vary greatly in breadth and length ; and a solitary flower may droop from an axil , or perhaps eight dingy greenish cylinders may hang in a cluster . But the plant is always smooth throughout . Even the incurved filaments which obstruct the entrance to this flower are smooth where those of the preceding species are rough-hairy . The style is so short that it may never come in contact with the anthers , although the winged visitors must often leave pollen of the same flower on the stigma. @# EARLY or DWARF WAKE-ROBIN ( Trillium nivale ) Lily-of-the-Valley family @# Flowers - Solitary , pure white , about 1 in. long , on an erect or curved peduncle , from a whorl of 3 leaves at summit of stem . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oval or oblong petals ; 6 stamens , the anthers about as long as filaments ; 3 slender styles stigmatic along inner side .

The broadly rhombic leaves , tapering to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the usual whorl of three , at the summit of the stem , which may attain a foot and a half in height ; from the center the decorative flower arises on a long peduncle . At first the entrance to the blossom is closed by the long anthers which much exceed the filaments ; and hive-bees , among other insects , in collecting pollen , transfer it to older and now expanded flowers , in which the low stigmas appear between the tall separated stamens . Nectar stored in septal glands at the base invites the visitor laden with pollen from young flowers to come in contact with the three late maturing stigmas . The berry is black . From Quebec to Florida and far westward we find this tardy wake-robin in May or June. @# Certainly the commonest trillium in the East , although it thrives as far westward as Ontario and Missouri , and south to Georgia , is the NODDING WAKE-ROBIN ( T. cernuum ) , whose white or pinkish flower droops from its peduncle until it is all but hidden under the whorl of broadly rhombic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as long as the sepals - that is to say , half an inch long or over - curve backward at maturity . According to Miss Carter , who studied the flower in the Botanical Garden at South Hadley , Mass. , it is slightly proterandrous , maturing its anthers first , but with a chance of spontaneous self-pollination by the stigmas recurving to meet the shorter stamens . She saw bumblebees visiting it for nectar . In late summer an egg-shaped , pendulous red-purple berry swings from the summit . One finds the plant in bloom from April to June , according to the climate of its long range , @# Perhaps the most strikingly beautiful member of the tribe is the PAINTED TRILLIUM ( T. undulatum ; T. erythrocarpum of Gray ) . At the summit of the slender stem , rising perhaps only eight inches , or maybe twice as high , this charming flower spreads its long , wavy-edged , waxy-white petals veined and striped with deep pink or wine color .

Distribution - From British Columbia to the Atlantic ; eastern half of the United States southward to the Carolinas. @# Wonderfully interesting structure and the comparative rarity of this orchid , rather than superficial beauty , are responsible for the thrill of pleasure one experiences at the sight of the spike of unpretentious flowers . Two great leaves , sometimes as large as dinner plates , attract the eye to where they glisten on the ground . The spur of the blossom , the nectary , " implies a welcome to a tongue two inches long , and will reward none other , " says William Hamilton Gibson . " This clearly shuts out the bees , butterflies , and smaller moths . What insect , then , is here implied ? The sphinx moth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larger individual might sip the nectar , it is true , but its longer tongue would reach the base of the tube without effecting the slightest contact with the pollen , which is , of course , the desideratum . " How the moth , in sipping the nectar , thrusts his head against the sticky buttons to which the pollen messes are attached , and , in trying to release himself , loosens them ; how he flies off with these little clubs sticking to his eyes ; how they automatically adjust themselves to the attitude where they will come in contact with the stigma of the next flower visited , and so cross-fertilize it , has been told in the account of the great purple-fringed orchis of similar construction . To that species the interested reader is , therefore , referred ; or , better still , to the luminous description by Dr. Asa Gray. @# WHITE-FRINGED ORCHIS ( Habenaria blephariglottis ) Orchid family @# Flowers - Pure white , fragrant , borne on a spike from 3 to 6 in. long .

Not for man , but for the bee , the moth , and the butterfly , are orchids where they are and what they are . The white-fringed orchis grows in watery places that it may more easily manufacture nectar , and protect itself from crawling pilferers ; its flowers are clustered on a spike , their lips are fringed , they have been given fragrance and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on whose removal by an insect benefactor that will carry pollen from flower to flower as he feeds depends their chance of producing fertile seed . It is probable the flower is white that night-flying moths may see it shine in the gloaming . From the length and slenderness of its spur it is doubtless adapted to the sphinx moth. @# At the entrance to the nectary , two sticky disks stand on guard , ready to fasten themselves to the eyes of the first moth that inserts his tongue ; and he finds on withdrawing his head that two pollen-masses attached to these disks have been removed with them . This plastering over of insects ' eyes by the orchids might be serious business , indeed , were not the lepidoptera gifted with numerous pairs . The fragrance of many orchids , however , would be a sufficient guide even to a blind insect . With the pollen-masses sticking to his forehead , the moth enters another flower and necessarily rubs off some grains from the pollen masses , that have changed their attitude during his flight that they may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In almost the same way the similar Yellow-Fringed Orchis ( H. ciliaris ) and the great green orchids compel insects to work for them. @# A larger-flowered species , the PRAIRIE WHITE-FRINGED ORCHIS ( H. lepicophea ) , found in bloom in June and July , on moist , open ground from western New York to Minnesota and Arkansas , differs from the preceding chiefly in having larger and greenish-white flowers , the lip cleft into wedge-shaped segments deeply fringed .

Let us not note for the present what happens in the older flowers , but begin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when the bee has alighted on the spreading lip of a newly opened blossom toward the top of the spire . As nectar is already secreted for her in its receptacle , she thrusts her tongue through the channel provided to guide it aright , and by the slight contact with the furrowed rostellum , it splits , and releases a boat-shaped disk standing vertically on its stern in the passage . Within the boat is an extremely sticky cement that hardens almost instantly on exposure to the air . The splitting of the rostellum , curiously enough , never happens without insect aid ; but if a bristle or needle be passed over it ever so lightly , a stream of sticky , milky fluid exudes , hardens , and the boat-shaped disk , with pollen masses attached , may be withdrawn on the bristle just as the bee removes them with her tongue . Each pollinium consists of two leaves of pollen united for about half their length in the middle with elastic threads . As the pollinia are attached parallel to the disk , they stick parallel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fold up her proboscis under her head , if she choose , without inconvenience from the pollen masses , or without danger of loosening them . Now , having finished sucking the newly opened flowers at the top of the spike , away she flies to an older flower at the bottom of another one . Here a marvelous thing has happened . The passage which , when the flower first expanded , scarcely permitted a bristle to pass , has now widened through the automatic downward movement of the colu//
