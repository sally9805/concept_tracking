 | IT may be doubted whether contemporary Germany possesses a sculptor of such surpassing genius that his work will , to future generations , stand as the perfect artistic embodiment of the whole variety of ideals that actuate modern life . It may even be doubted whether there is a German sculptor living who , in brilliant suggestiveness , can be compared with Rodin , or who is the equal of Meunier in democratic universality , or of Augustus Saint-Gaudens in refined modernness of feeling . But it certainly can not be doubted that there is an astonishing vigor and virility in contemporary German sculpture , a passionate reaching out for new forms and new ideas , a genuine striving for a truly national style . And it is high time that Americans should open their eyes to this revival of plastic art in Germany and stop gaging German sculpture by the productions of tame academic correctness or pompous inanity which were the fashion thirty years ago . Fortunately the exhibition of German art which is to take place in the Metropolitan Museum of Art nett winter will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contemporary German painting , representative works of the most recent German sculpture also . At no time , perhaps , during the last hundred years was German art more justly subjected to hostile criticism than during the decade following the Franco-German War . That was the time when the Fatherland was being deluged by a flood of turgid glorifications , in bronze and marble and sandstone , of national prowess and martial triumphs . The Siegessaule at Berlin , with its barbarous rings of cannon encircling the shaft of the column and with the gilded and uncouth Victory clumsily overtopping it , is perhaps the saddest reminder of this era of perverted taste . But even the best of these German " Soldiers ' Monuments , " the " Germania " on the Niederwald by Johannes Schilling , although possessing a certain romantic glamour and charm , is conspicuously lacking in true monumentality and historic impressiveness . And among the more recent works of this class the equestrian statues of the old Emperor William , so profusely scattered over the length and breadth of the empire , are for the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of character on which the greatness of the first German emperor rested ; the majority of them must be designated as pretentious trumperies , flimsy showpieces , hollow imitations of princely splendor and magnificence . It would be invidious to deny that at the very seat of this courtly school of plastic art , namely Berlin , there has been produced during the last decade , by the side of much that is theatrical and flippant , a considerable body of sculptural work worthy of serious con-sideration and clearly indicative of an artistic revival . The prevailing character , to be sure , of this new Berlin art is decorative and ornamental . Reinhold Begas , the acknowledged master of the school , is a man of great versatility and re-sourcefulness , of an exuberant imagination , and of remarkable cleverness in matters of detail . What he lacks is the sure grasp of essentials , the unperturbed vision of the one thing needful , the earnestness of purpose which , disdaining outward flourishes and paraphernalia , creates from within . His Schiller statue in front of the Royal Theater , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his Bismarck monument on the Ronigsplatz , are surely interesting and spirited productions . But do they bring out the innermost and abiding traits of the men whom they are meant to hand down to posterity ? This Schiller , in his long flowing gown , with laurel wreath and manuscript , is he the poet of the German people , the upholder of national ideals ? This imperator on his gallant steed , led by a graceful maiden form , placed on an elaborate pedestal that is surrounded by floating ' Victories , roaring lions , standards , cannon , and chariots ? this is the good patriarchal ruler whose life was simplicity and unpretentiousness itself ? And this choleric Bismarck standing in an excited attitude in the midst of fantastic allegories and mythological beasts ? this is the founder of the new empire ? The German people , with true instinct for what is genuine and sound , have declined to accept these monuments as representing their own view of national heroes . These monuments are decidedly not adequate embodiments of great historic characters . Their value is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clash , striking observation of detail , gracefulness of outline , intensity of movement , and brilliancy of grouping ? all of which makes them pleasing to the eye and imparts to the spectator a certain amount of that satisfaction which the successful reproduction of the forms of nature arouses in us . And in this there seems to lie the chief merit of this whole Berlin school of sculpture . All of Begas 's own work shows this prevailing quality ; most strikingly so , perhaps , in his monumental fountain on the south side of the royal castle , a work of truly astounding  | exuberance of imagination and fascinating lifelikeness of presentation . Here Begas seems at his best . And something of the same sort we find in the best work of other Berlin masters , such as Rudolf Siemering , known in this country by his ambitious Washington monument at Philadelphia ; or Fritz Schaper , the author of the beautiful Goethe monument in the Thiergarten at Berlin ; or even Gustav Eberlein , although in Eberlein a fatal tendency for mannerisms and operatic effects spoils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of artists ( their number might easily be doubled and trebled ) chosen by the present emperor to embellish his capital with a superabundance of plastic monuments . Their shortcomings have been sufficiently indicated ; but it seems only fair to say that the violent invectives directed against them by the majority of German art critics seem hardly justified . The composite effect of their activity , if not great , is decidedly pleasing and agreeable . As a piece of impressive pageantry , the Siegesallee , in which so many of these artists were set to work in order to produce a monumental pedigree of the house of Hohenzollern , has few equals in other capitals of the world . And although one may regret that the limitation of their task to members of the Brandenburg dynasty prevented the sculptors of the Siegesallee from achieving something in the broadest sense national , yet even as it is this out-of-door gallery of portrait-statues contains not a few types of striking individuality and genuinely human interest . It remains to speak of two sculptors of the Berlin group who , if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in true artistic feel-  | ing and power : Louis Tuaillon and Hugo Lederer . Tuaillon has , I believe , not produced much , but two at least among his works are of such surpassing excellence that they outweigh scores of productions by more fertile artists : his " Amazon " and the equestrian statue of the Emperor Frederick . The " Amazon , " which has lately been transferred from the courtyard of the National Gallery to a more suitable place in the Thiergarten , is one of those perfect works of art which need no commentary and which arouse above all the feeling of the absolute fittingness of every detail and the inevitableness of each circumstance . This lithe and elastic rider lightly perched on her muscular but slightly built steed seems indeed a daughter of the steppe ; she seems one with her faithful horse ; her own glance , as well as that of the horse , is directed into the far distance . Is an enemy ap-proaching ? Are friendly troopers in sight ? Such questions are immaterial ; enough that the whole group expresses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolute certainty that both horse and rider will do exactly what is required when the moment of action comes . Here is indeed something which , in its own field , can not be surpassed , although it has a worthy parallel in the exquisite bronze statuette of an Amazon by Franz Stuck . And can there be any doubt as to the genuine greatness of Tuaillon 's equestrian monument of the Emperor Frederick , by the presentation of which to his native city a public-spirited citizen of Bremen has tried to undo the defacing of the splendid old market-place of the Hanse town through one of the most hideous Emperor William monuments in existence ? The noble Frederick is not represented as a general : military achievements and honors were , after all . not what this most enlightened of princes aspired to . He is not represented as a ruler : fate did not allow him to direct the destiny of his people for more than the briefest time . He is represented as a man . almost naked , only with the lightest suggestion of the costume of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superb body and every line of this noble brow bespeaks his imperial dignity and his royal mind . Here again there is a climax of art : this is the second German emperor as he will live in the imagination of posterity , a kingly man , a hero of humanity . Hugo Lederer , the other Berlin sculptor who can not be classed with anyone else but stands out as a figure all by himself , is a man in the middle thirties . He , too , has  | produced comparatively little . Among his minor works there is a group entitled " Fate " ? a woman of heroic proportions and relentless movement dragging two prostrate human figures along with her , a conception which , in spite of its fantastic character , is carried out with true instinct for monumental effect . He has also done one of the very best monumental fountain statues that Germany possesses : the " Student " on the fountain in the courtyard of the University of Breslau , a naked , athletic youth , fencing-sword in hand , just ready for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truly Michelangelesque boldness of design . But the work which gives to Lederer his unique position , not only among German sculptors but among all the artists of Europe and America , is his Bismarck monument at Hamburg . I am not exaggerating when I call this monument one of the greatest plastic achievements of all times . The city of Hamburg some ten years ago opened a competition for a Bismarck monument of gigantic size . It was to be placed on the Stintfang , a hill on the outskirts of the business section of the town , commanding a view over the harbor and the river Elbe ; and , like the Statue of Liberty in New York harbor , it was to be a landmark for incoming and outgoing ships and a solemn palladium of the greatness and might of the new German empire . Lederer competed , and , in spite of a heated and acrimonious opposition , his designs were finally accepted . There are not a few such colossal landmarks of national greatness on German soil . Among older monuments of this kind might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germania " on the Niederwald , and the Hermann statue in the Teutoburg Forest ; among the more recent , the Bismarck tower on Lake Ramberg and the Emperor William memorial on the banks of the river Weser where it breaks through the Forth . Westphalica . Most of these monuments are either simply enlarged statues , in which case the size of the statue presents an irreconcilable conflict with its inner limitations ; or they are mainly architectural structures in which the plastic decorations play an entirely subordinate part . Lederer alone has welded architecture and sculpture together . By making the statue the predominating feature  | of the whole , but treating the statue in an architectural rather than a sculptural manner , he has created a monument which has the character both of a tower and of a giant and thus exerts a truly superhuman spell . It is clear that an individualized portraitstatue of Bismarck , however much enlarged , would not have been able to produce such an effect . What Lederer needed was a col-@# lective Bismarck , a Bismarck containing all the fundamental traits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the same time raised into the timeless sphere of the legend ? Bismarck as a type , a symbol . The selection of the form which Lederer gave to this symbol was a clear stroke of genius . In the marketplace of many a German town there is to be seen an interesting relic of medieval tradition ? a huge knightly figure in sandstone or granite , iron clad from head to foot , holding a broadsword in front of him . These Roland statues , as they are called , take their name from the legendary paladin of Charlemagne , whose heroic death in the battle of Roncesvalles became in the early middle ages a favorite subject of ballad and epic poetry . Their frequent occurrence in German cities is explained by the fact that in the later middle ages Roland came to be looked upon as a guardian of city freedom and justice , and his image as a symbol of municipal law and sovereignty . This legendary tradition Lederer combined with the conception of Bismarck as a historical character : he made Bismarck the Roland of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into existence the extraordinary monument which now greets  | the stranger on approaching Hamburg from the North Sea , just as Phidias 's " Athena " is said from the Acropolis to have greeted the skipper on sailing around Cape Sunium . And no one who has seen it will ever be able to forget it . The height of the whole structure is about one hundred and thirty feet . A round foundation of roughly hewn blocks leads to a platform from which there rises another round towerlike understructure , articulated by eight projecting pillars , on the surface of which there are seen in relief the heroic outlines of naked men , repeating in a great variety of movements the one theme of power and vitality . From this understructure there rises the pedestal proper , again round and towerlike and encircled by columns standing half free . And above this is the colossal granite figure itself , continuing the tower motive and yet adding to it a new and superior power . Like the Roland of old , Bismarck is steeled from head to foot ; like Roland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but instead of lifting it , as Roland usually does , he places it before him on the ground and rests both his hands on the hilt . And , again in distinction from the Roland motif , a wide heavy mantle falls over his shoulders and his back clown to the ground , thus adding to the massiveness of the figure and also forming the background for two colossal eagles that @#  | are cowering at the right and left , hiding the side view of the legs up to the knee . Thus the whole gigantic figure is held together by a wonderful unity . It seems like a plastic outgrowth of the architectural understructure . No part of the body stands out from the rest with undue emphasis ; nowhere are we distracted by too much or too elaborate detail . No attempt has been made to obliterate t h e fissures between the granite blocks that compose the mighty figure ; each block is seen in clear outline , and thus the whole structure appears almost as the result of the upbuilding forces of nature herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which forces itself irresistibly upon the spectator . And above all this the head of Bismarck . Not the head of Bismarck at a particular moment . Not the choleric Bis marck , or the cynic , or the boisterous humorist , or the parliamentary thunderer , or the aggressive diplomat , or the triumphant statesman . It is the head of the eternal Bismarck , the Bismarck that will go down into the legend of the centuries . It is not covered with a helmet ; no vein on the forehead no line of the face , forces itself into prominence ; but the great structural forms are brought out with unerring energy , and the eves exert , even from this towerlike height , that spell which no one who saw their flash in the living man will ever be able to efface from his memory . Thus it is that this head , in size so insignificant a portion of the whole monument , yet dominates every part of it . Thus it is that this one colossal man seems to relegate into nothingness everything that surrounds him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streets with their busy throngs . Here something has been achieved comparable only to the stu-pendous symbolism of ancient Egyptian art , and perhaps superior to it . It is not easy to do justice to the rest of contemporary German sculpture when one comes from Lederer 's " Bismarck . " And yet there is enough of aspiration and achievement in other directions to make one feel that a new day has indeed dawned for Ger man plastic art as a whole . Only two other representatives of this new life can here be characterized . There are some German art critics who see in Adolf Hildebrand the greatest German sculptor of to-day . So much is certain , that since the days of Thorwaldsen and Rauch no other German sculptor has come nearer the ideal of classic beauty than he . It NEN FATE really seems as to_the reincarnated a r , or Lysippus . Sleeping Shepher. his " Ball Placer .

His " Drinking Boy , " his " Sleeping Shepherd , " his " Water-Carrier , " his " Ball Player , " and , above all , his " Hermes , " are technically perfect representations of the human body . There is neither too much nor too little of detail ; every muscle , every part of the body , follows exactly the laws of composite movement ; and this movement is never exaggerated , never eccentric ; it always results in a graceful balance between tension and relaxation , in a harmonious blending of contrasting motives . And the same merits are to be found in the one monumental structure on a large scale executed by Hildebrand , the Wittelsbach fountain at Munich , the city with which the artist , next to Florence , has been most closely identified . It would , however , be a mistake to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His wonderfully individualized portrait-busts show that he fully enters into the inner forces of life . I doubt whether since the days of the early Italian Renaissance there has been produced a gallery of plastic heads comparable in psychological refinement , in grasp of essentials , in noble realism , to Hildebrand 's marble and bronze busts of the late Duke of Weimar , of Duke Karl Theodor of Bavaria , of Bis-  | marck , Bocklin , Dellinger , Brahms , Hans von Billow , Helmholtz , Pettenkofer , Wilhelm Bode , and many other nameless personages , women as well as men . Never is there any striving in these busts for sensational effects , never is there undue emphasis on the accidental and the transient . The great fundamental traits of character are brought out with unfailing power ; a whole life seems here concentrated in the mold of a forehead , in the lines of a mouth . Perhaps the finest of all are the heads of Biicklin and Dellinger . Whole volumes of psychological analysis might be written about these men without accomplishing what Hildebrand accomplishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the reproduction of life in its most spiritualized form . In all this Hildebrand shows himself a truly great artist . But we also see the limitation of his power . He is great in the reproduction of life . He is not a creator of life in the very highest sense . His imagination is largely receptive ? scientific , one might say . It collects data , it selects the essentials , it presents the results of analysis in perfect synthetic form . But it does not produce symbols , such as Lederer has produced in his Bismarck . It does not lead into new paths , as Rodin 's clairvoyant im-agination does . And so , with the signal exception of his portraitbusts , Hildebrand 's art has no special appeal to the modern man . It does not stir longings in us . It gives us precious possessions . but it does not revolutionize our inner self : it does not make us tremble with the awe of the infinite , it does not arouse in us the passion of the spirit . just here lies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of whose plastic activity this sketch may fittingly be closed : Max Klinger . Klinger , it may at once be admitted , is not a perfect master of form . With the exception , perhaps , of some of his marvelous etchings , he has not produced a work of art , either in painting or sculpture , which completely satisfies our sensuous nature , which does not , by some fanciful whim , some naturalistic tour de force , some excess of imagination , mar the pure joy of " disinterested contemplation . " What a strange whimsical conception to represent an Amphitrite as a torso , without arms ! What a be-wildering , benumbing , grossly ma-terialistic effect there is exerted by the naturalistic tints of his " Salome , " technically marvelous as it is ! And the group called Drama " ? what riddles , what puzzles , are here forced upon us ! It has been described by a distinguished art critic in the following words : " Dark of countenance and with desperate tension of his bent , doubled-up @#  | body a naked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tree . A naked woman , whom he seems to be defending , lies prostrate on the ground and clutches with fading strength a protruding lock ; she is held up , supported , comforted by another , youthful woman-form , cowering on the lower side of the rock . Strength and beauty united in struggle and suffering , that is the ' drama ' which Klinger in his marble figures places before us and which everyone standing before this group can not help living through with them . " I think this very description , accurate and complete as it is , is sufficient proof of the violence , the grotesqueness , the wilfulness of this extraordinary group . And even in his greatest work , in his " Beethoven , " now forming the chief treasure of the Museum of Leipzig , his native town , Klinger distracts us and bewilders us by the exuberance of his fantastic energy . This superabundance of costly materials , this juxtaposition of bronze and gold and ivory , of opal and onyx and manycolored marble , and this wealth of allegorical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heads peeping out from Beethoven 's throne ? all this takes away front the monumental effect of the group as a whole . These defects of Klinger 's art are patent and must be admitted , and yet the fact remains that in no man has the overflowing vitality , the restless striving of modern Ger- many for high achievement , come forth with greater intensity and momentum than in Klinger . Klinger is one of those men , like Bocklin , like Wagner , who challenge and startle our imagination . Such men may arouse our protest , they may shock our sensibilities , they may put us in a fighting mood , but they can not leave us cold . They ineyitably free us from mental inertia , they transform us , they stir in us the striving for a higher personality , they perform that revolutionizing function of art which Schiller has so nobly expressed in his essay , " On the Use of the Chorus in Tragedy " : " True art has for her object not merely to afford a transient pleasure , to excite to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make us intrinsically and absolutely free ; and this she accomplishes by awakening , exercising , and perfecting in us a power to remove to an objective distance the world of the senses , which otherwise only burdens us as a dead weight , as a blind force , to change it into the free working of our spirit , and thus to master matter by means of the idea . " In none of his works has Klinger come nearer this ideal than in his " Beethoven . " As Lederer has transformed Bismarck into the legendary figure of the medieval Roland , as Tuaillon surrounds the Emperor Frederick with the free humanity of a Marcus Aurelius , so Klinger idealizes Beethoven into a mythical hero of classic antiquity . He places him on a throne the plastic decorations of which combine Greek and Christian symbols of deepest human longing and suffering ? the fall of man , Tanta us , the Danaides ? and also , in the frieze of charm-  | ing angel faces , show the triumph of the human soul over dark despair . He detaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surroundings , deprives him of the artificiality of modern dress , leaves his chest and armperfectly , bare , and throws a toga-like garment over legs and knees only . And , finally , he gives him , in the eagle cowering at his feet , an Olympian , Zeus-like attribute . As I have already stated , at first sight at least this variety of motives and detail bewilders us . And yet , even in this confusion of accessories there is a certain symphonic swing which lifts us into the spirit of the whole . We feel a strange , musical intoxication , we expect wonders ; and thus we are put into the mood for the spell which the dominant figure exercises . It is not the joy of creation which is embodied here ; it is the fierce throes , the Titanic struggle , of a great birth . It is the Beethoven of the " Eroica , " the man who has called himself the " unhappiest of all mortals , " the man in whose bosom chaos battled with the music of the spheres . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here we are carried into the realm of the soul ; here there is awakened in our own self an endless longing for expression , for form , for the ideal . I said at the beginning of this article that contemporary Germany might perhaps not possess any individual sculptor of such surpassing genius that his work would , to future generations , embody the whole variety of modern life . But if we single out the three greatest of the sculptures mentioned in this brief survey ? Tuaillon 's " Emperor Frederick , " Lederer 's " Bismarck , " and Klinger 's " Beetlioven " ? we may truly say that here there is a collective achievement in which the genius of modern Germany has found a complete and enduring expression . @#
