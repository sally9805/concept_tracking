We have been in towns where everything had a shiftless air , in country places where fences were all down , the ground overgrown with weeds and bushes , and the barns and houses unpainted , ? in short , where desolation and failure stared one in the face at every turn . Avoid association with a slipshod , ambitionless person , as you would with a person tainted with smallpox . He is afflicted with a moral disease , which may , in spite of his determination to resist it , have a blighting influence on his life . How quickly an undecided , vacillating man communicates his uncertainty and vacillation to those about him . Every one who works for him , unless unusually well poised , catches his disease . lie never quite knows what he wants to do ; he is always on the fence . Of course , his employees will not decide things for him . Everything about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole atmosphere is loaded with indecision . Orders are half executed , letters are half finished , repairs wait for more definite orders , and everything " hangs fire . " There is a negative air about the place . An employer of this kind is continually BLIGHT OF SHIFTLESSNESS lot out of patience with those employed by him when the trouble is that he does not let them know decisively what he wants and expects them to do . A habit of vacillation is most demoralizing to success and character-building . People who are forever weighing and balancing and considering , and never deciding questions until compelled to , are always weaklings . The power of decision after a while becomes perfectly demoralized , and the victim loses not only the confidence in his own judgment , but also the power this gives over men and circumstances . Undecided people who always suspend judgment and defer giving opinions carry a negative atmosphere in their very presence . They inspire doubt in regard to their own ability . The decided man carries a positive atmosphere . He impresses you with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presence carries confidence and conviction . You feel that a man confronts you and not a weakling . He knows what he thinks , and says it ; he knows what he wants to do , and does it . A character in " The Little Minister " announced his intention of cutting down a certain hindering tree . He never " got at it , " the tree // widened and grew tall , the man aged , and still the tree stood . " I grew old , " he said , " looking for an ax . " An artist had a magnificent conception of a Madonna , and he talked enthusiastically about it to friends , but his moods , or his studies , or the light , or his exact idea of the pose never quite suited , and he never painted it . Still the thought of it possessed him till he could do nothing else . When death came , it found him lamenting that the glorious vision he had constantly seen in imagination was never put on canvas to delight others and make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sights is that of a man who is forever hanging in the balance , powerless to fling himself with force on either side . The great prizes of life are lost by vacillating . A man who starts out in business in a halfhearted way , without enthusiasm or confidence in his ability to succeed , is sure to be a failure . Nothing great is ever accomplished without enthusiasm , energetic persistence , and determination to do the right thing regardless of obstacles . A weak , vacillating person , a halfhearted man , excites no admiration or enthusiasm . Nobody believes in him . It is the posiBLIGHT // tive , energetic , dead-in-earnest man who creates confidence ; and without the confidence of others , it is difficult to succeed . No matter what you undertake , do it in a whole-hearted way , be all there . Concentrate all your power on it , if you are only writing a letter , or doing the chores . Be a whole man at whatever you attempt , otherwise you will form loose , indolent habits , which will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world is full of people who bemoan their hard luck and are constantly pitying themselves because fate is against them , because they can not succeed as others do . The real cause of their failure is lack of heart . They do not throw their whole souls into their work . They only touch their employment with the tips of their fingers . They are half-hearted , absent-minded and lack energy , push , perseverance ; they have no ambition-fires to melt the obstacles in their pathways , to weld together into one continuous chain the links of their efforts . Futile endeavor , half-hearted efforts , never accomplished anything . It takes the fire of determination , energy , push , and good judgment to accomplish that which counts . It is the enthusiastic man , with fire in his blood // and ginger in his brain , who makes things move , and pushes to the front . We see the half-hearted floating aimlessly with every current . They have lost their grip , and are pushed aside by the more vigorous and determined ; they lose hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are tossed about on the sea of life . One of the most dangerous things that can happen to young people is losing sight of the ideal ? unconsciously drifting down from a high level ? until they become half content with mediocrity , inferiority , and practically satisfied to drift along in a humdrum way , merely " marking time , " conscious of inferiority of purpose and aim , and yet without the energy or propelling power to force themselves into a higher condition of things . Oh , the blighting , blasting effect which follows the loss of an ideal , or the fading out of a purpose ! One of the most disheartening and discouraging things about helping young people is the difficulty of arousing them to a realization of their hopeless condition when they have once lost sight of life 's aim . All was easy when they left school and started out with great expectations . But after they have met a few disappointments and failures , they show no stamina // or backbone to rebound from their fall , and so they lie flat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race through no fault of their own , but the vast majority of those who cease to climb and give up ( often right in sight of their goal ) , do so from some weakness or defect . Many of them lack continuity of purpose or persistency ; others lack courage or determination . Many of these unfortunates would attain at least something of real success by merely sticking to their tasks . XVI . THE POWER OF DECISION THE young man in demand everywhere to-day is the one who can create something , the man of productive power . There are many who can do routine work , follow prescribed lines , carry out in detail a program mapped out by others ; but the man of original force , of constructive energy , who can start out in untrodden paths and blaze the way for others , is as rare as he is valuable . There is always a premium on the thinker , the man of original ideas and methods and real productive force . Insurance companies are scouring the country for such men ; merchants are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them as leaders : they are wanted in law , in the business world , in the field of science , in all walks of life . The man who makes up his mind quickly and firmly has an infinitely better chance of success than the one who is always hovering on the brink of hesitation and uncertainty . The temptation to open up and reconsider should be cut off immediately , for to be weak zo6 // in your power of decision is to be shorn of most of your strength . One of the most dangerous habits in which a youth can indulge is that of weighing , balancing , reconsidering , and making up his mind , and yet again reconsidering , balancing , and weighing all the arguments for and against , until the untrusted brain becomes confused and incapable of clear judgment . Such a habit is one of the greatest dissipators of mental power , and the man who allows himself to become its victim is foredoomed to failure . A young man who starts out to succeed must resolve firmly that he will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the consequences of mistakes rather than be forever digging up matters de novo . He should make up his mind not to act hastily or without proper consideration of the thing in hand , but to use his best judgment in arriving at a decision , and then , without hesitation or reconsideration of the arguments for or against , try to execute it with all his might . If he finds he has made a mistake , he must not be discouraged ; he has had a new experience which will prove helpful to him in the future , and the benefit accruing to him from the practise of self-reliance and prompt , unwavering decision , rob YOUNG MAN ENTERING BUSINESS will be of infinitely greater value to him than a successful move would have been had he hesitated , weighed , considered and reconsidered , and changed his mind over and over again in foolish uncertainty before making a final decision . Many people of otherwise great ability do not succeed to any extent because of this weakness of their power of decision . They seem incapable of acting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighbors before they can tell what to do about the simplest thing . They must think it over and over until the brain grows weary of the treadmill round forced upon it ; and the more they think it over , the more consultations they have about it , the less able are they to reach any conclusion . So they go through life , halting , vacillating , uncertain , robbed of their strength , deprived of the large success they were fitted by their ability to win , because of this fatal lack of power to decide for themselves and to decide promptly . Men of great achievement are characterized by their ability to grasp situations quickly and act promptly . Their vision is clear , they understand conditions Thoroughly , and they act without hesitancy or doubt of results ; hence , in THE POWER OF DECISION Iog most instances , they carry their purposes to a successful issue . Those who accomplish great things do not do so by unusual straining or an exhausting output of mental or physical energy . J. Pierpont Morgan , for example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not seem to exert any great effort . He achieves his ends with apparent ease , because of the lucidity of his ideas and his strong grasp upon situations . The steel tools driven by the great cams in our shipbuilding yards go through solid steel plates with as much ease , seemingly , as the fingers of a cook go through yielding dough , because of the huge balance wheels whose mighty momentum , without jarring or straining , overcomes all obstacles . So great workers compass vast results by the momentum of their intellects , their clear comprehension of conditions , and their ready mastery of complicated situations . Such minds as these are self-contained , selfreliant , confident . They do not buttonhole every friend or acquaintance they chance to meet and ask his advice or opinion in regard to their plans . They do not consult subordinates or equals ; they simply look over the ground and study it carefully , as a skilful Ito YOUNG MAN ENTERING BUSINESS general studies his plan of the battleground before he leads his army to action , and then they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and firmness of decision are always positive . They know what they want , and are never on the fence . They do not waste their time shillyshallying , seeking advice , balancing opinions , or splitting hairs . They decide upon a course of action , and then pursue it without hesitation or wavering . A noticeable example of this stamp of mind is General Kitchener , the great English soldier , one of the most remarkable personalities of our time . Silent , stern , immovable , when a purpose is once formed , this hero of many hard-won battles is a sphinx-like type of concentrated power . He forms his plans unaided , and executes them with the precision and force of a huge engine . His chief of staff was the only one who knew anything of his intended movements when he started one day on an important expedition during the war in South Africa . He simply ordered a locomotive , a guard van , and a carload of " Tomrnies . " Orders were given to clear the track . Everything had to stand aside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ POWER OF DECISION III graphed ahead . He arrived on the spot without previous notice , and no general in the army knew when or where he might appear . Another incident of his South African campaign is strikingly characteristic of the man . About six o'clock one morning he paid an unheralded visit to the Mount Nelson Hotel , Cape Town , scanned the register , and found there the navies of officers who should have been on duty . Without a word to any one , he went personally to the rooms of the offenders and left the following notice : " A special train leaves for the front at 10.00 A.M. ; the troop-ship leaves at 4.00 P.M. for England ; you have your choice , sir . " He would listen to no excuses , no parleying , no apologizing ; that was his ultimatum , and every officer knew what he meant . He wields an absolute power over those under him because of his positiveness , his selfpossession , his consciousness of being equal to any emergency , whatever it may be . Everything about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of make-up . Free from petty vanity or any desire for praise or flattery , he has a frank contempt for all social distinctions and frivolities . His personality has all the impressiveness of some great natural force , 1 12 YOUNG MAN ENTERING BUSINESS working out its purpose silently , effectively , and with the certainty of doom . The conquering general is not always an en-. dearing character , it is true , his subordinates often fear rather than love him ; but he possesses in an eminent degree self-confidence , concentration , firmness , promptness , decision , and ability to grasp situations and act quickly which every one who would be successful must cultivate . XVII . THE VALUE OF BUSINESS TRAINING BUSINESS is king . The professions or specialties tend to narrow and dwarf the ndividual , crushing out originality and individuality . Nature is opposed to onesided development , and the man who trains only one part of his mind to do one thing pays a very heavy penalty for his specialization . A symmetrical , full-rounded development is what Nature is after . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specialties . It gives an all-round development . Solid , level-headed men , as a rule , are business men . Their education is general ; they are constantly on the alert to take advantage of every opportunity . Any system of training which does not exercise all of the faculties of the mind tends to kill the practical faculties . Specialists and professional men do not have as great common sense as business men , who have an all-round training . Onehalf of the college graduates at the present time enter business . Not very long ago about half of our college graduates studied law . It was I13 // considered the popular thing then to go into one of the learned professions . It took great courage for a boy in college to announce that he would enter a business career . Half a century ago going into business was not a very attractive proposition ; but the new civilization , the enormous commercial development of our country , has made business king , and glittering prizes are held up everywhere in business lines . Although commercial pursuits may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is unnecessary to say that the wider the scope of one 's knowledge the greater are one 's opportunities in any business . The best preparation for a business career is direct experience with a firm in the line one wishes to follow . By entering a business while young , and working up from one position to another , a boy will get a practical working knowledge of that business . Those who can stand sifting usually win . " Nearly every person in our employ , " said a great merchant , " is started at the foot of the ladder . With these it is the old story of their care of the interests of their employers redounding to their own interests . Let the young man who is beginning life remember this principle , and his future is // assured . As a rule , the boy or girl who applies to us receives a hearing and if worthy and persistent obtains a position sooner or later . " The young man who is in demand is the one who has mastered the details , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking for the man who has sufficient mental grasp to comprehend the entire situation , and who is industrious and determined enough to carry out a plan minutely energetically , and promptly . It is intense application , a persistent devotion to business alone , which will give success in this century . The boy who starts out to learn a business should be content with nothing short of a complete mastery of the whole situation . No essential point should be too small for his attention , no labor too hard for him to undertake , no obstacles too great to surmount . Everywhere we see youth , unwilling to pay the full price for success , trying to pick the flowers out of an occupation or a profession , but omitting all that is hard , ugly , and disagreeable . This is as if soldiers were to go through a hostile country leaving a stronghold here and there unconquered to harass them perpetually by firing on their rear and picking off their men , The only way to insure 1 16 YOUNG MAN ENTERING BUSINESS victory is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overcome . " Side-tracked by ignorance , for the lack of a little more preparation , " would be a fitting epitaph over the grave of many a failure . In every department of endeavor we find men switched off , obliged to stop just this side of their laurels , because they did not follow the main track of thorough preparation in their youth . In the patent office at Washington one is impressed by the great number of embryo inventions that are practically useless , simply because of the patentee 's ignorance . While he had inventive ability , he did not possess the technical knowledge which would have enabled him to take the next step needed to make his idea successful . Had he not cut his schooling short , he would not have been obliged to stop at the critical point . It is a sad sight to see our employment offices thronged with young men of strong physique , robust health , and intelligent personality , hunting for work . They can not keep a position long , because they have no reserve force to draw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and at every step they are made conscious of their shortcomings . Nobody cares to // retain them in their service , because they can not do anything well or thoroughly . The Spanish have a proverb which says : " An unobserving man would go through a forest without seeing firewood . " So some youths do not seem to see anything going on about them . The difference in the capacity of boys to absorb knowledge is astonishing . One boy will work in a store for years , and know little about how the business is done ; he does n't keep his eyes open , or does n't see things , while another boy will learn most of the details of the business in three months . I have known of a boy in a law office , for example , getting very little salary , who from three years of office work carried away so much knowledge of the actual methods of doing things and of law itself that , with comparatively little additional study at a law school , he was admitted to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law offices for years , and carried away nothing but foolishness and small salaries . It is all in the boy . One boy is success-organized ; he sees things , he grasps situations , and is all the time storing up knowledge , revising improvements and new systems of doing things . Another boy is just the reverse . // I once had in my employ a splendid young man , earnest , faithful , and honest , but he could never get up or on because he did not seem to have any capacity for absorbing knowledge . It seemed to be almost impossible to get new ideas into his head . He would do the routine work with the utmost faithfulness , was always on time , and was never idle , but he utterly lacked this capacity of growth and expansion from absorption . I have employed other boys who seemed to take in every situation at a glance , and they would advance by leaps and bounds , as it were , simply because their minds were open to impressions and active in assimilating and applying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thirsty person drinks water . They looked upon business as a school in which they were bound to stand at the head of the class . An ambitious boy realizes that to rise in the world he must know the business he has chosen through and through , from top to bottom . He keeps his eyes open ; nothing escapes his attention ; he is always alert , all the time absorbing and reaching out for knowledge , experience , methods , and system . He does not think so much of the little VALUE OF BUSINESS TRAINING iig money he gets as of the opportunity to learn his trade or profession . To be where he can observe all that is done , in close touch with the men at the head of affairs , where he can learn all the details , and where he can study and compare methods , and acquire the secret of his employer 's success , ? these things , he realizes , are worth many times more to him than his salary . He is satisfied with getting enough to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get drill and discipline . When he gets through at night , a shrewd , ambitious boy realizes that what he has carried away with his eyes during the day , what he has got by keeping his mind alert , and by his deductions as to the best methods of handling the business , are worth many times more to him than the few dimes paid to him for his day 's work . He knows that , if it is in him , he will be able in a single day in the future to make more , perhaps , than his whole year 's present salary . It is knowing how to do things that is of value . Hundreds of boys in this country to-day are bemoaning their small salaries and lack of opportunities , when they are right in the whirlpool of business or trade , the finest school // possible for them . If they would keep their eyes open and their minds alert and learn to see things and absorb knowledge , they would no longer complain of " no chance , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realize that they have been set on the road to fortune , and that by sturdy trudging they can arrive in triumph at the goal . XVIII . " JUST GETTING ALONG " H , just getting along , " " just , making a living , " " holding my own , " ? such are the replies young men frequently make when asked how they are progressing . Practically , these are confessions of stagnation . " Merely holding one 's own , " " just getting along , " or making a bare living , is not making a life , or a success . It may not always be possible for you to increase your income or better yourself materially , but it is always possible to keep adding to the real riches of life . If each to-morrow is to find us farther along than to-day , it must be an advance on yesterday . We must bring an enthusiastic spirit , an out-reaching effort of mind and heart to everything we do . Our work will reflect this mental attitude . Such a spirit will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold our own . The great deeds of the world , the triumphs of the race , have not been accomplished by men who were content merely to hold their own or " just get along , " but by men who I2I // were dominated by their purpose , filled with an overmastering enthusiasm which swept everything before it , as a mountain torrent sweeps aside or overleaps every obstacle that would bar its progress in its mad rush to the sea . Think of an artist starting out to paint a great picture in an indifferent , half-hearted sort of way , satisfied to put forth only a small part of his energy , content " just to get along " each day ! Imagine a poet attempting to write an immortal poem , an author attempting to write a book that should live , or a scientist trying to cope with an intricate problem by the solution of which he hoped to bless humanity , working in a listless , careless , indifferent manner ! Horace Greeley said that the best product of labor is a high-minded workman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man there is life , hope , and a large future . He cares not for diffiiculties ; they but increase his determination to move forward . " Just getting along " is no part of such a man 's vocabulary . He grows , he moves ahead each day , by sheer force of will , even though it be only a small distance . B ( Zt he moves ; that is the main thing . He palpitates with life and energy " JUST GETTING ALONG " 123 that will not let him remain satisfied with merely holding his own . Go to work as Ole Bull went to his violin . People marveled at the maestro 's power over his instrument . They forgot that away back in his infancy almost he had fallen in love with a violin . They did not think of a boy only eight years old who would steal out of bed at midnight and risk a whipping from an irate father , while he tried to make his precious little red violin reproduce the melody that haunted him . Even when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , caress it , and then breathe his very soul into it . The instrument responded to his slightest touch , and with it he swayed multitudes , as forests are swayed by the tempests ; he lulled thousands to gentle moods , as the fragrance of soft winds among flowers soothes the body to rest . Without this passionate devotion to his lifework would Ole Bull have triumphed over his father 's punishments and opposition , over poverty , illness , and almost inconceivable obstacles , until he became the greatest violinist of his time ? Lukewarm water would never generate enough energy to move a locomotive an eighth of an inch . A young man whose effort and // determination reach no farther than the lukewarm stage will be as flat a failure , no matter what his ability , as would be the best locomotive boiler in the world if the water it carried were not kept constantly at the boiling point . Many people never get fully awakened . Go into a large store or factory and watch the people work . Many of them look as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are but partially aroused , mere dwarfs of the possible man or woman . They have never discovered their powers . Having found that they can get along with a moderate degree of activity , they are content to do so , using the least possible physical and mental effort . The same thing is true of most of the other people we meet in life ,  --  they seem to need a few sharp words from some friend to put them in full motion . They do not know their own capabilities . They have never made a tour of investigation and discovery in the Great Within of themselves to see what continents of power they really have , but are content to cultivate their little islands of energy here and there , just enough to provide for their daily wants . They dwell in the valleys , and never climb to the mountain-tops to take a wide view of themselves and the possibilities around them . " JUST GETTING ALONG " 125 No youth ever amounts to much until he is thoroughly aroused and dead in earnest , until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feels that his work counts in the grand total of human effort . Some people , however , are natural dependents . They do not chafe tinder restraint . They feel lost if thrown upon their own resources . They have no self-reliance . They must lean upon others , must have others do their thinking and planning . They have not developed self-assertion , or individuality . Indeed , many of them have a talent for self-effacement . They shrink from responsibility , and crave the advice , direction , and protection of others . All occupations and avenues of endeavor are overcrowded to the indolent , the nerveless , and the incompetent . There is no room anywhere for a lazy man without sufficient ambition to enable him to rise . The world is looking for the man who can produce results , the leader , the aggressive man , the man who has a purpose . No field is overcrowded for the original man who can think for himself and is not afraid of hard work . The young men who are crying that there is no chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not succeed anywhere . // The cry of overcrowded positions is a bugbear only to the weak and the incompetent . Those who feel the power within them to make their place in the world never give " no chance " as an excuse for inaction . You can hardly imagine a boy saying : " I am going to be a second-class man . I do n't want to be a first-class man and get the good jobs , the high pay . Second-class jobs are good enough for me . " Such a boy would be regarded as lacking in sense , if not in sanity . You can get to he a second-class man , however , by not trying with all your might to be a firstclass one . Thousands do that all the time , so that second-class men are a drug on the market . Second-class things are only wanted when first-class can not be had . You wear first-class clothes if you can pay for them , eat first-class meat , first-class bread , and first-class butter ; or , if you do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are no more wanted than any other second-class commodity . They are only taken and used when the better article is scarce or too high-priced . For work that really amounts to anything first-class men are required . There are many things that characterize a " JUST GETTING ALONG " 127 second-class man . A man menaced by dissipation , whose understanding is dull and slow , whose growth has been stunted , is a secondclass man , if , indeed , he is not third-class . A man who through his amusements in his hours of leisure , exhausts his strength and vitality , vitiates his blood , wears his nerves till his limbs tremble like leaves in the wind , is only half a man , and could in no sense be called first-class . Everybody knows the things that make these second-class characteristics . Boys smoke cigarettes to be smart and to imitate older boys . Then they keep on because they have created an appetite as unnatural as it is harmful . Men get drunk for all sorts of reasons ; but , whatever the reason , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dissipation in other forms makes second-class men . Every fault you allow to become a habit , to get control over you , helps to make you second-class , and puts you at a disadvantage in the race for honor , position , wealth , and happiness . Carelessness as to health fills the ranks of the inferior . The submerged classes that the economists talk about are those that are below the high-water mark of the best manhood and womanhood . Sometimes they are second-rate or third-rate people because // those who are responsible for their being and care during their minor years were so before them , but more and more is it becoming one 's own fault if , all through life , he remains second-class . Education of some sort , and a pretty good sort , too , is possible to practically every one in our land . Failure to get the best education available , whether it be in books or in business training , is sure to relegate one to the ranks of the second-class . The only place a man can ornament @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credit , is the one he conquers , the position he masters by the force of his character , that to which he has attained by his own persistent effort . What good will a position do you which you have not conquered ? Suppose your father puts you in a place above others , a position which , perhaps , some of those others have fairly won by years of faithful , efficient service , ? of what advantage will it be to you if you can not dominate the situation , and are not able to hold it by right of merit ? What sort of figure will you cut in your own eyes and in the eyes of those over whom you are placed , when your ignorance and incompetence are constantly putting you at a disad-vantage ? " JUST GETTING ALONG " 129 It is pitiable to see the son of a rich man boosted into a place because his father owns the store , or has stock in the concern , when there are scores of young men under him who have fought their way inch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the position . If he has a spark of right feeling , he can not help feeling contempt for himself . He must realize that he is , in some sort , a thief , if he considers that he is not only monopolizing a position which really belongs to some one who has worked years to obtain it , but that he is also trying to hold something he has never earned , ? that he is occupying his place , not by merit , but by favor . How can he retain his selfrespect when he knows that he is strutting in borrowed plumes , that he does not deserve what he is enjoying ? Remember , especially , those of you who are impatient and uneasy at your slow progress , that the very strength and efficiency which will enable you to fill adequately the positions which you aim at , and the power to hold them with credit to yourselves when you have succeeded in attaining them , are generated on the way up from the bottom to the top . The successive steps to them are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there and maintain your balance . Nothing is of any real value to you which you do not get by your own efforts , and do not hold by virtue of merit . XIX . PROMOTION FROM EXCEPTIONAL WORK HE rise of Charles M. Schwab from a stage-driver in the mountains of Pennsylvania to the head of a gigantic combination of capital and industry marks him as a man of great force of character and wonderful resource . Let those who would follow in the footsteps of Mr. Schwab remember this : he was not looking for a large salary at any time in his career , but his aim was to improve every chance . When he worked for the Carnegie Steel Company as a day laborer , he said : " If I get a chance , I mean to be the president of this concern some day . I will show my employer that I am anxious to earn promotion . I am going to do more than I am paid for , ? more than is expected of me . " With this wonderful spirit of determination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Can any one wonder that such a rare combination should succeed ? Mr. Schwab had a poor start in life . His school education was of the ordinary kind , ' 3 ' // and , at fifteen years of age he was driving a stage that ran into the mountain towns from Cresson , Pennsylvania . Two years later he was working for two dollars and fifty cents a week . But he was always looking for a chance , and a little later it came . Men were wanted to drive stakes for an engineer corps engaged in building the Carnegie Steel Works . One dollar a clay was offered . Schwab got the chance to earn that dollar a day and took it . A short time afterwards he became an engineer , and then the chief engineer . At twentyfive he was the superintendent of the Homestead works , and at thirty he was in charge of both . At thirty-nine he was the president of the United States Steel Corporation , and today is president of the Bethlehem Steel Company . ' ' hen Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the belief that he was more than a laborer ; for he felt that he was a leader . He did not put the slightest faith in the theory that great institutions are detrimental to a young man 's future , and that , therefore , he should become discontented and linger by the wayside until fate or politics should change the country . He knew that with determination , hard work , and a persist- // ency that never lets go , he could become a factor in the world . His life-story is not only fascinating , but also extremely useful from the standpoint of example . His career has forcibly illustrated the dignity of labor . He has introduced a beautiful , cheerful optimism into his work , and has done everything so thoroughly that he has always been in demand for something a little higher up . There have been no great jumps in his career , for every step has been a logical and well-earned advance . As a rule it is the employee who does something out of the ordinary , something which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promoted quickly , sometimes even over the heads of those who have been in the business much longer than he has . He takes more pains with his work , does it more rapidly , shows more interest in his employer 's affairs , evinces more intelligence and originality in his methods , or in some other way especially commends himself to his employer 's attention as one worthy of promotion . Employers are not blind to what is going on around them , they are always watching those under them . They know who shirks , who watches the clock , who clips a few min134 YOUNG MAN ENTERING BUSINESS utes here and there from his employer 's time , who comes a little late in the morning and goes a little earlier in the evening ; in other words , they keep thoroughly posted in regard to the work and general conduct of their employees . Every employer appreciates faithfulness and reliability , and soon learns to know those whom he can trust and those he can not . No matter whether he has seen a clerk shirk his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instinctively feels it . There are many people who , though they may not lie to or deceive us , yet because they habitually do these things , we instinctively distrust them . Something tells us that they are not quite reliable . In the same way an employer reads the character of his employees . He knows those who will shirk when they get an opportunity ; he can pick out those who will work while they feel they are being observed , but who will dawdle when the master 's eye is not upon them , and are not absolutely reliable . An employee who will not , under any circumstances , neglect his work , who is faithful to his duty whether his employer is around or not , is always appreciated . Absolute reliability in an employee is indispensable , if he expects to advance . No employer likes to be // surrounded with those in whom he lacks confidence . He wants to feel that , whether he is present or absent , the work will go on just the same ; that , if anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is away . The employee who advances rapidly is the one always on the watch to promote his employer 's interests , the one who tries in every way possible to supplement him , to make his work lighter , to carry out his plans . Therefore , faithfulness , absolute reliability , a single eye to the employer 's interest , and close , careful industry are the keys to promotion . If you would advance rapidly in your position , or get on faster in the world , do n't acquire a habit of waiting to be told what to do . Anticipate the wants of your employer . Use your common sense and ingenuity in trying to solve the problems that come up from day to day . Nobody ever advances who constantly waits for directions . It is the man who decides promptly and with precision , without being told what is to be clone , and then does it , who gets on in the world . A habit of doing nothing without orders or directions is paralyzing to one 's faculties and death to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delusion that to imitate the actions and methods of those above you is all that your position requires . It is original work that commands attention . Keep your eyes wide open for the things which need to be done , and do them before you are asked to . You may think that actions which are not prompted by the presence of your employer will never be heard of by him . Put aside this delusion . There are innumerable ways in which an employee 's habits of work are brought to the attention of his employer . The youth who is stingy with his services , who is a " minute boy , " who watches the clock for fear he will do a little more work than he is paid for , who does not study his employer 's interests and suggest improvements simply because he is not paid for it , who is mean and ungenerous to his fellow-employees , who is constantly telling them that they are foolish to do this or that which does not come directly in their routine of duties , ? such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ educated , will never advance . His selfishness will forever bar his promotion . Many a youth who wonders why he does not get on faster would be surprised if // he were told by his employer that it is because of his selfishness . Generosity of service , tolerance , good will toward others , and absence of jealousy or envy of competitors are qualities which every employer admires , and they often have quite as much to do with advancement as ability . We often see a five-thousand-dollar man in a one-thousand-dollar situation , and wonder why it is so . That is , we often see a young man with splendid abilities and fine education ; a man who , in many respects , is much superior to the manager or foreman over him , yet who is kept down by some bad habit , some little weakness , or some little defect somewhere . Young people do not seem to realize that the strength of a chain lies in its weakest not in its strongest link . We are all apt to be proud of our strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but we are sensitive about the weak ones ; we do not like to dwell upon our deficiencies . Consequently , the weak links grow weaker and weaker , until they finally break . Many a young man has been kept down by what probably seems a small thing to him , as lack of accuracy . He can not be depended upon to do anything quite right . His work always needs " going over " // by some one else . He can not be relied upon . He half does things . How many bookkeepers are getting small salaries in poor situations , because they lack accuracy ; their figures can not be depended upon ! For this reason they would be practically worthless in a bank or other large concern . They may be able in other respects , and well educated , but this single defect mars their usefulness and destroys their chances of success . In many instances young people do not try to do their work as well as it can be done , because they get small pay . They do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indifferent characters . They do not know that their whole destiny is locked up in the character of their work , that the very structure of the mind may be ruined by the pernicious habit of half doing things . Then , again , people soon lose confidence in slipshod workers ; they are never trusted . Botched work is usually associated with a botched mental , and even moral , make-up . We are supposed to be all of a piece , and are judged by samples of what we do . George Eliot , in " Middlemarch , " was drawing a picture from life when she described the gradual collapse of Mr. Vincy 's prosperity from the // time he began to use the cheap dyes recommended by his sham religious brother-in-law , which were soon found to rot the silks for which he had once been so famous . On the other hand , the man who , like Adam Bede , always drives a nail straight and planes a board true , is the one whom men employ at good wages , and who is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked for immortality have done their work as well as it could be done . The Athenian architects of the Parthenon finished the upper side of the matchless frieze as perfectly as the lower side , because the goddess Minerva would see that side also . An old sculptor when remonstrated with for being so particular about them , said of the backs of his carvings , which were out of all possible chance of inspection , " But the gods will see them . " " In the elder days of art Builders wrought with greatest care Each minute and unseen part , For the gods see everywhere . " Slipshod work always means a slipshod man or woman . Unless you put the best of yourself into whatever you do , your character will // deteriorate . Nobody has confidence in a man who half does things . Banks do not want his notes . No one wishes to leave property in his care . He is never wanted upon boards of directors , trustees , or important committees . In fact , he is at a discount in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a slipshod woman , ? a woman who half does things , ? and see how the contagion has spread to all the children . Slackness , half-finished work , confusion , disorder , and discomfort are everywhere visible . The children of such a home will carry the contagion farther ; they will take it into their work , and their character , their success , their happiness , will be blighted by the inherited taint . A habit of half doing things , or of doing them in a slipshod manner , will soon leave its demoralizing mark on the character . The mind soon becomes accustomed to low ideals , and little by little the fine edge of conscience is blunted . If the characters of criminals , of tramps , and of the great army of unemployed and sidetracked people were analyzed , it would be found that most of these people have been accustomed to half do things . It is seldom that a PROMOTION ' 4 ' person who does whatever he undertakes to do as well as it can be done is out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defect . It is a fact that , although there are hundreds of thousands out of employment , almost every great concern in the country is constantly on the lookout for better employees , better clerks , better book-keepers , better stenographers , better service everywhere . When an employer wishes to promote any of his clerks , he looks for the one who does his work in the most complete and satisfactory manner . This is usually the great test of fitness . Every employer dislikes slipshod and slovenly methods . He wants orderly , systematic , painstaking employees . If we were to ask employers all over this country what , in their opinion , is the greatest impediment to the advancement of young people , I believe the majority of them would say : " The habit of half doing things . " This is a slipshod age . " Poorly done , " " half done , " " done in a careless manner , " is written all over modern life . Buildings fall down almost before they are completed , clothing comes to pieces before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and all through mer142 YOUNG MAN ENTERING BUSINESS cantile and professional life the same slipshodness is visible . The man who is never quite sure ? who thinks , guesses , or imagines about the amount or the distance , who comes somewhere near , but never is quite certain ? rarely gets very far in this world . It is the accurate man , the painstaking man who is exact , who attains to the highest success . The boy who half learns his lessons , who skims through his examinations , who is slovenly in his habits , who lacks system and order , and does things in a halfhearted way , is almost sure to be a failure in life . The habits formed in boyhood characterize the man . He is continually looking for something , and never knows exactly where anything is . He never knows where he stands . His books are inaccurate , and he can not tell whether he is solvent or not . He is a little late at the bank ; his paper goes to protest and he loses his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through life . Such a man is not only a failure , but he demoralizes everything and every one about him . His employees fall into his slovenly ways , and never think it worth while to do anything just right , because their employer does not do so himself . They become careless , inaccurate , and habitually negligent . // These defects and weaknesses permeate the whole establishment , until , finally , the man 's business goes to ruin . Then he is unable to trace the blame to its true source , and bemoans himself as a victim of ill luck . I wish it were possible to impress upon young people the importance of doing everything to a finish , of doing the smallest thing as well as it can be done . Those who early in life acquire this habit will always enjoy that peace of mind and that peculiar sense of contentment and satisfaction which can only come from the consciousness of doing things completely . No reward is comparable to the inward assurance that we have done our best . The man or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " not only spoils work , but spoils life . " If I could give but one word of advice to those who are trying to get on in the world , I should say , " cultivate a love of excellence . " It is surprising how the mind and character expand and grow upward by the application of this stimulus . Nothing has more to do with developing a strong character and ability of a high order than constant cultivation of a love of excellence , a determination to do to a finish whatever we undertake . It is not enough // to do a thing pretty well ; it should be done as well as it can be done . " Oh , that is good enough ! " has been the unsafe stone in the foundation of many a life which has caused the building to topple . A habit of incompleteness formed when young is the secret of innumerable failures . Cultivating an upward tendency in all that we do , holding steadily a high ideal in the mind , is a perpetual stimulus to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love of excellence . There is a great satisfaction in doing things just right . It is a perpetual tonic to feel each night that you have not been slurring things during the day , that you have done everything you attempted just as well as it could be done . This sense of completeness , of things well done , has a most salutary influence in strengthening the character , and bringing all the faculties into harmony , in qualifying us for better and higher work . I should advise a youth starting out in the world to take as his motto , " Perfection to the finish , " for its adoption early in life may mean all the difference between success and failure . People laughed at Stradivarius for spending months and months in making a violin . They thought he was throwing his time away . But // to-day a " Stradivarius , " wherever found , is worth from five to ten thousand dollars , or several times its weight in gold . Everything that has immortality stamped upon it has been done in the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can be done is not only the quickest way to advancement , but it has a very great influence upon one 's character and self-respect . If for no other motive than to maintain our self-respect , we should never allow ourselves to get into a habit of half doing things . The world wants your best , and you should resolve early in life never to give anything but the best of which you are capable . Put your best thought , your best work , your best energy into everything you do . Make up your mind that you will never do anything by halves , no matter what others may do . Your life is worth too much to be thrown away in half doing things , or botching anything you undertake . XX . THE TIMID MAN There is something sublime in the youth who possesses the spirit of fearlessness and boldness , who has great faith in his ability to do and dare . The world takes us at our own valuation . It believes in the man who believes in himself , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who is never certain of himself , who can not rely on his own judgment , who looks to others for advice , and is afraid to go ahead on his own initiative . It is the man with a positive nature , the man who believes that he is equal to the emergency , who believes he can do the thing he attempts , that wins the confidence of his fellow-man . People believe in him because he is brave and self-sufficient . Those who accomplish great things in the world are as a rule bold , aggressive , and selfconfident . They dare to step out from the crowd , and be original . They are not afraid to be generals . There is little room in this crowding , competing age for the timid , vacillating youth . 146 // He who would succeed to-day must not only be brave , but must also dare to take chances . He who waits for certainty never wins . No youth can hope to succeed who is timid , who lacks faith in himself , who has not the courage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before he ventures . It is natural for the world to believe in men who believe in themselves , who have confidence that they can accomplish things . It is the positive personality , the man who believes that he is equal to the emergency , who gains the confidence of others . " Nature arms each man with such faculties as enable him to do some feat impossible to any other , " says Emerson . The great tendency of modern life , with its enormous combinations , its concentration of interests and effort , is to annihilate individuality ; but the great duty each one owes to himself is to preserve and develop it . He must not allow his education , his employment , or his environment to rob him of his distinctive personality , or efface the stamp placed upon him by the divine hand to distinguish him from all other men . It is his duty to preserve his individuality as he would his character , for it is a part of himself . // The trouble with most of us is that we are content @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yet , since no two human beings are made alike , no one can quite take the place of another , nor can he do quite as easily or quite as well the thing which the other was made to do . It is futile as well as disastrous to try to mold ourselves to a different pattern from what Nature intended for us . It is better to be an original shoemaker than an imitation congressman , or a thumb nail edition of some great lawyer . Whatever you are , or whatever you do , be yourself ? be original . Do n't be a negative copy of any one . The man who does things , who brings about results , who feels within himself the power of achievement , and is determined to make himself known in the world , never waits to see what the crowd is going to do . He does not ask advice of everybody he knows , or wait for precedents . He lays out his own plans , thinks his own thoughts , directs his own energies , plays the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask for an impossible hand . He does not complain because obstacles appear in his path ; and when he comes to them he goes through them , not over them or around them . He never whines or grumbles ; he simply keeps // to his task , and works in a vigorous , manly way . He goes about everything he undertakes with a determination that insures victory . It takes courage and originality to step out from the crowd and act independently , ? to jump into deep water , as it were , to swim or sink . Man was made to hold up his head , to assert his God-given birthright , ? to be a man . Success is as much his normal element as water is the normal element of a fish . He was not made to live in an atmosphere of doubt , to be haunted and dogged through life by fear and uncertainty . Slavery , a life of servitude or subjection , is no man 's normal state . The normal man exhales force from every pore ; his very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strikes a blow ; his eye and his bearing carry conviction in them ; he conquers even in silence . Let us be masters of circumstances and surroundings , not their slaves . Let us fight poor , weak , sick thoughts as enemies of happiness and success . The thought that one is a victim of circumstances , that his success and happiness depend on chance , ? the habit of looking on one 's self as a poor , miserable , fallen creature , ? is demoralizing to mind and 15o YOUNG MAN ENTERING BUSINESS body , and absolutely destructive of all noble character-building . The world stands aside for the man who has a program , a mission , a calling to do that which he feels a throbbing compulsion within him to do . Stoutly affirm your ability to do what you undertake . Every affirmation strengthens your position . One of the best strengtheners of character and developers of stamina generally is to assume the part you wish to play ; to assert stoutly the possession of whatever you lack . If you are deficient in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to assert vigorously these qualities as your own by a divine right . Be thoroughly convinced that they belong to you , ? that you should possess them and that you do . Then you will strengthen your success-position wonderfully . Grant had this positive quality ? a firm conviction that he could accomplish whatever he undertook . There was nothing negative in him . He did not stop in the midst of a great crisis to consider if failure were possible ; he did not doubt , but constantly affirmed , and was always on the positive side . It is the positive Lincolns , Washingtons , and // Grants who achieve results . The positive man is wanted everywhere , ? the man with the plus qualities of leadership . He is fearless , courageous ; his conviction is born of the consciousness of strength . Never allow yourself to admit that you are inferior to the emergency confronting you , for this is to invite defeat . Stoutly affirm that you can do the thing . The moment you harbor a doubt of your ability , that moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weakness , deficiency , or lack of ability , or harbor doubt , you weaken your self-confidence , and that is to weaken the very foundation , the very possibility of your success . // man on the street by the way he carries himself . If he is a leader , every step , every movement indicates it ; there is assurance in his hearing , he walks as if he were master of himself , as if he believed in his ability to do things , to bring about results . His self-confident air is an index of the success he has attained . On the other hand , it is easy to pick out the failure . There is no decision in his step , his uncertain gait indicates lack of confidence in himself ; his dress , his bearing , everything points toward incompetence . His shiftlessness is pictured in every movement of his body . There is nothing uncertain , nothing negative , in the make-up of the successful man . He is positive to the backbone . He does not need bolstering up ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moment he looks upon you . It is not so much what he says as what he does not say : his very silence carries power . You feel that there is a large reserve back of everything he says or does . On the other hand , the man who has never accomplished anything , the man who lacks confidence in himself , has no reserves . He always impresses you as a man pushed to the // wall , as one who has said his last word and put forth his last effort . It is wonderful what a power self-confidence has to marshal all the faculties and unite their strength in one mighty cable . No matter how many talents a man may possess , if he be lacking in self-confidence , he can never use them to the best advantage ; he can not unify their action and harmonize their power so as to bring them to bear effectively upon any one point . In order to succeed in life , it is just as necessary to have self-trust as to have ability ; and if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best means of acquiring it is to assume that you already have it . Carry yourself with a self-confident air , and you will not only inspire others with a belief in your ability , but you will also come to believe in yourself . When customers do not come and the shelves are creaking under the weight of unsold goods , when clerks are standing around idle , while rents and heavy bills are falling due , a merchant 's soul is tried , and temper and business capacity are tested to the utmost . Then we can see what kind of man he is , and of what mettle he is made . If he is cross and disagreeable and loses his temper over // trifles which he would not ordinarily notice ; if he finds fault with everybody and everything and intimates by every act and word that he blames his employees for the hard times , we may know that he has not learned the supreme lesson of life ? self-control under fire . It is easy to be pleasant and agreeable when the sun shines , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but when business is dull , when bills are maturing and nothing coming in to meet them , when difficulties , perhaps disaster and ruin , are staring one in the face , it takes courage and sterling character to he buoyant , to look cheerful , and to have a smile for everybody . When everything you have in the business world seems slipping from you , and ? in spite of all your efforts to stem the tide ? you are losing the financial and commercial standing it has taken you years to build up , it taxes your philosophy , and even your spiritual nature , to be serene and cheerful even in your home . But it is in such an extremity as this that a business men should , if ever , be calm and collected . A cheerful face , a hopeful , confident air , and a determination to make the best possible out of the situation have often tided a // man over a crisis in his business , when the least exhibition of moroseness , anxiety , or doubt would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Employees are quick to detect doubt , anxiety , or fear in their employer . If he is downhearted and discouraged , his mood will communicate itself to every one who works for him . The customer , in turn , will be affected by the gloomy atmosphere of the store , and will go elsewhere . Thousands of concerns have gone down during panics or periods of business depression simply because the owners did not know how to control themselves or to conceal their doubts and fears in regard to the condition of their " affairs . Discouragement is the great destroyer of ambition . It must be crushed and eliminated as if it were a plague . I never knew a man to be successful who was always talking about business being bad . Never allow yourself to dwell on the dark side of anything . You should refuse to talk about ' depressed markets or hard times . Learn to talk up , not down . Many business men become chronic grumblers and faultfinders . Times are always hard with them . Other men get into a pessimistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is // impossible for such people to prosper . Success is a delicate plant , and requires encouragement and sunshine . Regard yourself as superior to the evils which surround you . Learn to dominate your environment , to rise above depressing influences . Look for the bright side of things , not the dark and gloomy side . The world likes sunny , hopeful , buoyant characters ; it shuns lugubrious prophets , who see only failure and disaster everywhere . The hopeful , cheerful men and women , who see success and longevity in their callings , are the ones who are sought after . It is as natural to try to avoid disagreeable , unpleasant people as it is to try to escape from the clouds and shadows into the sunlight . The man who would win must carry in his very presence an air of assurance , the certainty of a conqueror . People admire a confident man . They can trust him . They hate doubt or vacillation . It is the balanced man that wins , not the one who goes about as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had a chance . It is the strong , aggressive character that creates enthusiastn and radiates confidence . The man who wins in life 's battle wears an // air of confidence that shows superiority in his very expression . His bearing imparts force , and gives a sense of power . The expression of the vanquished , the loser in life 's battle , is that of doubt , of lack of confidence ; there is no assurance in his step , no aggressiveness in his mien . As a spring can never rise higher than its source , so one can never attain a greater success than he believes he can . When you have found your niche , ? when you realize that you are working along the line of your strongest faculties instead of your weakest , ? do not allow anything to divert you from your choice . No matter what difficulties may arise , no matter how much harder your work may be than you anticipated , do not waver or turn back . Stand firm by your choice . Remember that there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the roses . It is at such seasons that your manhood must ' assert itself , that the strength of your purpose must be proved . Do not , however dark or discouraging the outlook , admit the possibility of defeat . Set your face toward your goal , and stoutly affirm and reaffirm your confidence in your ability to succeed . This keeping one 's self up to the suc16o YOUNG MAN ENTERING BUSINESS cess standard , and maintaining , in all its dignity and integrity , one 's self-sufficiency to accomplish the thing undertaken , is proof of a strong character . Never permit any one or anything to undermine your self-confidence . Never admit to yourself , even in thought , that there may be a possibility of your failure . This constant affirmation , this persistent dwelling upon the possible , or plus , phase of success , and never admitting the negative , will tend to strengthen , to render impregnable , the great purpose , the one unwavering aim , which brings victory . Many fail because their self-confidence becomes shaky ; they allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , until they become uncertain of themselves , and ultimately lose altogether that buoyant faith in their ability to succeed without which no great thing was ever accomplished . What though you are poor , or your environment unfavorable ? these things should incite you to greater effort . Stoutly deny the power of adversity or poverty to keep you down , constantly assert your superiority to your environment , believe firmly that you were made to dominate your surroundings , that you are the master and not the slave of cir- // cumstances , and condition will soon improve . This very domination in thought , this assumption of power , this affirmation of belief in your ability to succeed , the mental attitude which claims success on the highest plane as an inalienable birthright , will strengthen the whole nature and give wonderful power to the combination of faculties which doubt , fear , and lack of confidence undermine . Many a man has accomplished his object by this determined adherence to faith in his ability to succeed , when everything but his determination and confidence in himself has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birthright as he would cling to his honor . XXII . BORN TO CONQUER SOME men seem born to conquest . Wherever they are they dominate and cornmand the situation . These natural victors have great self-confidence ; they know that they are able to overcome obstacles , that achievement is their birthright . They go through life taking it for granted that they shall control their surroundings ; they are convinced that there is but one power in the universe , and that they are a part of that power . They act as if they had their trolley pole upon the great trolley wire of infinite power , and that they are equal to any task , no matter how great . Such people are optimistic ; they never doubt or hesitate ; they have no anxiety about the morrow ; they do not worry , and are not over-anxious ; they feel that they can do the things they undertake , and do them well . They are the people who accomplish the great things of the world ; the giants , who turn neither to the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but through them , and are always equal to the occasion . x6z // A man of this stamp , who has a firm conviction that there lies within him such native strength , such ability to do things , who has a passion for achievement and is thoroughly convinced that he has vigor and courage , will seldom fail . He needs only to remember that whatever he does must be governed by right . Fear of failure or lack of confidence in one 's ability is one of the most potent causes of failure . The youth who expects to get on in the world must make up his mind that , come what may , he will succeed . He must have a firm conviction that he was made for success , that success is his birthright , a right of which he can not be deprived by any combination of adverse circumstances . The greatest artist in the world could not paint the face of a Madonna with an image of depravity constantly held in his mind . You can not expect to be loved if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and jealousy , and for the same reason you can not succeed if you surround yourself with an atmosphere of doubt . If teachers and parents could only realize the infinite possibilities they can bring within the reach of the child by impressing him at // the outset with faith in himself , in his power to succeed , it would revolutionize our civilization . If you are a teacher , try to impress success-thoughts upon your pupil . Teach him that he is a success-acorn , and that the Creator intended him to unfold into an oak , ? not a gnarled or dwarfed oak , but a magnificent giant of the forest that will furnish shade for man and beast and timber for a ship or a house . Impress upon the child your faith in him ; tell him that you expect great things of him in the future , and charge him not to disappoint you . A few encouraging words as to the author 's possible success from his teacher in the academy have never ceased to have an uplifting and inspiring influence upon his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teacher ; for , when every one else had despaired of his amounting to anything , when on all sides he was spoken of as a " dunce , " the teacher still encouraged him by word and action . Through his teacher 's faith in him , he became one of the world 's celebrated poets . Thousands of men in this country owe their success almost wholly to the inspiration which came from the confidence of parent or teacher or friend in their ability . When disBORN // couragements crowded upon them and they were almost ready to give up , the thought of the disappointment of those who believed in them and had faith in their success spurred them on to renewed efforts . We little realize how we can assist our friends by constantly encouraging and suggesting healthy thoughts to them , believing in them , and inspiring them at every opportunity . The greatest help does not come from money or other material aid . A warm grasp of the hand , a cheering word or thought , an expression of sympathy and encouragement , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon ourselves . The giver is often helped more than the receiver . It is estimated that it takes at least twentyeight years to bring the human body with all its faculties to the highest state of perfection and vigor . If the Creator of the universe takes more than a quarter of a century to develop this , the greatest of His works , how mighty and vast must be the purposes for which He has designed it ! The human machine is full of arguments to prove that it was intended for a long life and // for wonderful accomplishment . It is an intricate piece of mechanism packed full of details , each one a convincing reason why man should succeed . Everywhere throughout this perfect system there are the most marvelous devices for the adaptability of means to ends . Failure , like disease , is abnormal . Nothing is more depressing than holding for years the thought of defeat , or that you are unlucky and are not intended for success as others are . That success is the normal condition is shown by the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been in delicate health for years , upon suddenly or unexpectedly achieving some signal success , immediately improve in health . The mind reacts upon the body , and there is a rebound from the old depressed condition to the vital , the normal , the healthy . Holding a success-thought brightens your outlook and scatters your specters of doubt and fear , and sends an electric current of hope and power through you that will revolutionize your possibilities and transform you into a new being . Activity is as natural to man as harmony to music . His whole anatomy was made for achievement . Every nerve and fiber in him , // every brain cell , every function , every faculty , is fitted for high purposes , and points to success as his natural goal . The Creator made man a success-machine , and failure is as abnormal to him as discord is to harmony . God never made a man for failure . We are success-organized , success-tuned , achievementplanned . The Creator never made a human being to live in poverty or wretchedness ; there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for happiness . There are ten thousand reasons for this wrapped up in his constitution , in his physiology , in his environment . Prosperity , abundance , and affluence are parts of man 's inheritance . In this land of opportunity it is a disgrace for a healthy man to live in abject poverty . It is a libel upon his character , a disgrace to civilization . Failure and poverty are diseases unknown to the man made in the image of the Creator . XXIII . GETTING TO THE POINT DIRECTNESS is a cardinal virtue of the man who succeeds . He does not go over a thing , or around it , but to it and through it . If he calls to see you on business , he does not spend fifteen minutes in introducing his subject ; he does not waste your time on preliminaries or non-essentials , but proceeds to attend to the business in hand , strikes directly to the heart of it ; and as soon as he finishes ? stops . If there is anything that a successful business or professional man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private office by " hook or crook , ? and proceeds to talk about all sorts of things except the one thing for which he called . He inquires after one 's health , and the health of one 's family , and asks various other questions not pertaining to the business , but does not broach the subject of his errand until he has almost exhausted the patience of his auditor . Many a man has failed to get a hearing on a worthy and commendable proposition merely because he has bored some capitalist , i68 // or impressed him by his indirection as being , impracticable . The quality of directness is characteristic of all men of great executive ability , because they value time too much to squander it in useless and meaningless conversation ; it is an indispensable quality of the leader or manager of all large enterprises . Many a man has gone down to failure because he lacked ability to arrive quickly and effectively at a conclusion . While he was deliberating and balancing and " beating about the bush , " the opportunity to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indirectness has ruined many a rising lawyer . The justices of the Supreme Court of the United States say that it is one of the most difficult things with which . they have to contend . Young lawyers , too much impressed with the importance of a Supreme Court appearance , give long introductions , spin out oratory , explain self-evident points , and send forth copias verborum until ' they weary the court and hurt their own causes . It is not oratorical display , not verbiage , not wellrounded periods , but direct , clean-cut English that judges want , ? facts , clearly , briefly , and decisively stated . // It does not matter how much ability , education , influence , or cleverness you may have , if you lack the art of coming to the point quickly and decisively , of focusing yourself immediately , you can never be very successful . We know many young men who were graduated with honors from college , and who have always impressed us as youths of great possibilities and great promise ; yet , somehow , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always about to do something ; they are usually just going to come to the point , but fall a little short of it . Men who are wellbred , well-educated , and superbly equipped have often disappointed their relatives , their friends , and themselves , simply because they lacked directness , or the faculty of focusing their ability upon one point . In selecting a boy from a score of applicants , a shrewd employer will take the one who gets to his subject directly , states it concisely , with the fewest words , outlines his position briefly , and stands or falls by it , and does not bore him by telling of the great things he has accomplished or of what he can do . Robert C. Ogden , John Wanamaker 's partner , says that he has found in his experience // that one of the principal things that keeps young men down is the habit of talking too much . He declares that it is the silent man , the man who thinks a great deal and says very little , who is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When old Commodore Vanderbilt was asked for his secret of success , his answer was : " Keep your mouth shut . " XXIV . MISERS OF TIME UCCESSFUL men have ever been misers of their time . To get rid of timewasters , to keep them from sapping that which gold can not buy , is one of the greatest problems with every busy man of affairs . Men who direct affairs , whether their own business or a department of another 's , must learn to judge the business value of callers . They must learn tactfully to end interviews that have passed the limits of utility . Chatting on general subjects during business hours is a sure means of spoiling one 's executive efficiency , robbing one 's employer , or even ruining one 's own business . Men who are famous as executives seem to have an instinct for deciding instantly , when a caller is announced , how much time to give him . Ex-President Roosevelt is a fine example of such a man . When a man enters his office , he grasps him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but along with the cordial greeting is a plain expression that business is business , and that other " dear friends " I72 // are waiting . Most of his visitors , therefore , state their errands concisely , and retire quickly without unnecessary delay . The president of a certain large institution is known for the cordial welcome he gives to his callers , but he has remarkable tact in leading them immediately to the business in hand . As soon as that is concluded , he rises graciously and shakes the caller 's hand , assuring him that he regrets not having more time to give to him , and the caller , though really dismissed at the will of the busy man , goes away feeling that he has been handsomely treated , even if he has not been talking to him for over three minutes . The heads of large banks and insurance companies and the high-salaried trusts officers are men with this faculty well developed . Influential promoters , men of combining powers , grasp , comprehension , and executive ability , are always men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their directness and conciseness . Every word they speak counts ; they look upon their time as capital , and will not allow it to be unnecessarily infringed upon . These prompt , direct , executive men make some enemies , of course , but they accomplish results ? . they do things . They believe in // military discipline in their business , and do not want anything to do with people who do not mean business . One of the most valuable assets of a business man is the power of compelling those with whom he has transactions to be brief . This is an indication of the successful man . Only those who have learned the value of time can appreciate its importance , and so guard against its being encroached upon by thoughtless or over-talkative people . Perhaps nb one in the business world today furnishes such a striking example of the power of inducing brevity in others as J. Pierpont Morgan . His enemies accuse him of rudeness in this respect , but it is merely a business principle . Until recently he was nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the morning , and rarely left until five o'clock in the evening . It has been estimated that his time is actually worth twenty dollars a minute , but he values it as much more than this himself , and it is difficult to get five minutes with him unless one has very important business to transact . He does not shut himself up in a private office , guarded by several secretaries and buffers , as many great business men seem to be obliged to do in order // to protect themselves . He sits at his desk in an open room , in which are many other desks and workers , where he manipulates enormous combinations and deals with vast plans . He is nearly always accessible to those who wish to see him for business purposes , but woe to the man who attempts to approach him during business hours without sufficient reason . Mr. Morgan has a marvelous instinct for measuring men and finding out instantly what they want . There is no beating about the bush with him . He strikes for the marrow instantly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself to be made a victim by that numerous class of people who have no particular business of their own , but like to " drop in " and waste the precious minutes of a busy man . XXV . HEALTH AS CAPITAL HE who aims at high achievement must keep himself in prime condition , always ready for life 's great con tests . He must train himself for victory , as a college athlete trains for games or races in which he wishes to excel . The college boat crews which contest for athletic honors every year train hard and long all the winter and spring . They are obliged to abstain from all kinds of stimulants and from many articles of food which they like , eating only that which makes muscle and strength of sinew . They are compelled to keep regular hours , to observe a prescribed regime in eating , drinking , sleeping , and exercising . For many months they will store up the utmost possible reserve of nerve force , vitality , and physical endurance . What has been the object of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of systematic living ? Merely that the men may be able to withstand the strain of a twenty-minute contest ! But the tremendous exertion called for during this brief period 176 // exhausts a large part of the reserve force upon which victory depends . An inexperienced man would say , " What is the use of depriving one 's self , during all these months , of even the slightest pleasure ? What is the good of early retiring , of daily exercising , of running , rowing , punching the bag , or of gymnasium practise generally , if all the power developed is to be used in less than a half-hour 's contest ? " But I presume that every college student who takes part in a boat-race , or other contest , wishes many times that he had trained more rigidly , that he had accumulated a greater reserve force for these few minutes ' expenditure upon which the winning of the prize depends . Every year we hear youths say , " What is the use of spending all these years in preparing for and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these years of drill in mathematics , in science , in history , in languages , in the emergencies of life ? Ninety-nine times out of a hundred a knowledge of the fundamental principles of mathematics , an ordinary vocabulary , and the simplest knowledge of history , of geography , of political economy , of civics , and of languages will answer , " // True ; yet for great emergencies , for the larger contests of life , in which the prizes go to the most competent , to the most highly trained , these youths will find that the years of drill and discipline were not too prolonged to assure success . They will rather wish that they had given more time , that they had put more energy and thoroughness than they did into the momentous work of storing mental and physical reserve power to meet all the emergencies of a lifetime . One of the great problems of a successful life is to learn how to utilize to the best possible advantage all the brain and physical force generated . Most people waste a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force , in a way which they themselves would utterly condemn if , instead , they had wasted money . Although there is nothing else in the world so valuable to a success candidate as to be able to use all his power in the most effective way , yet , as a matter of fact , it is the very thing of which he is most lavish . He throws it away , as a rule , as if it were water . The average man not only wastes much of his energy , but takes such inadequate care of the wonderful machine which produces his sucHEALTH // cess-capital that he does not have half as much " vim " as he should . Men waste their brain and nerve capital in a thousand ways . There is a terrible loss in most lives through fretting and useless worry . The friction which this worse than useless habit causes in the delicate life machinery is appalling . Men are seldom satisfied , no matter how much they may accomplish , but are constantly spurring themselves to do more , until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as it might be if they took time to rest and renew their powers . All of their vigor is wasted in the very excess of ambitious stimulus . They also drain away their energies in overwork , in robbing themselves of sleep , nourishing food , or healthful exercise , and finally break down with nervous prostration , or some other weakness , from which it may take years of precious time to recover . What folly it is for one to goad himself until his brain , from sheer weariness , refuses to work , until his jaded faculties rebel , and his judgment is so weakened that whatever he does lacks virility ! What advantage is there in working when one 's mental machinery is out of order ? ? ? when , from friction in the I 18o YOUNG MAN ENTERING BUSINESS bearings , induced by fatigue , the fagged , jaded brain and worn-out nervous system can produce nothing that does not bear the stamp of their exhaustion ? No level-headed business man would think he could draw every cent of his capital out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet thousands of young men think they can draw every bit of energy , all the savings of vitality , out of their physical banks , and still succeed ! If a youth is not careful of his physical and mental capital , if he does not conserve his energy by avoiding , from the start , everything that would rob him of the heritage of a sound mind in a sound body , or his creative energy , not all the ambition nor all the will power he can command will save him from failure . I very frequently see an old man ? old , although his years do not number more than thirty . When he began his career , he had a powerful brain , great ability , and a superb physique ; in fact , he had one of the largest natural capitals that any young man ever started out in life with , yet he was practically bankrupt before he had reached middle life ? bankrupt physically , mentally , and morally . // When I first knew him he was a man of magnificent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vitality and cheerful philosophy of life . But I soon saw that the little enemies of success were sapping his physical vigor , and making great leaks in his mental reservoir . The whole strength of the man was being undermined by some secret forces which gradually robbed him of the power to perform his work satisfactorily , and , as a natural result , of self-confidence and self-respect , leaving him but the blurred shadow of his former manhood . With the loss of confidence in himself followed , as a matter of course , the loss of confidence in him of others . He lost position after position , until now the man of once magnificent possibilities and great promise stands a total wreck , the mere shadow of the man he might have been . He is only thirty years old , yet with but a fraction of his manhood left , with mental energy squandered , and with physical power dissipated ! Drink and vicious companions were the twin evils that destroyed his prospects and made him an old man before he reached middle life . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything about you ; if little things irri182 YOUNG MAN ENTERING BUSINESS tate you ; if trifles upset you ; if you go to pieces , so to speak , when anything goes wrong in your business , you may be pretty sure that there is some enemy at work in your system , that your energy is being exhausted in some way , and that your vitality is at a low ebb . Look for the cause at once . Perhaps you have been smoking too many cigarettes or cigars . Few things exhaust energy or lower vitality so rapidly as excessive smoking . Perhaps you are burning both ends of your candle , sitting up late at night , going to parties or theaters every evening , and trying to keep up with your work or your studies during the day , handicapped by loss of sleep and consequent dulness or inertia . If you feel irritable and out of sorts on getting up in the morning , and are disposed to be fractious and fretful all day , there can be no doubt that there is something seriously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from some mental disturbance . It may be worry or excessive anxiety about your business , your family affairs , or some other matter . Whatever the cause , you must find and remove it , or allow it to wreck your life . // You can not do good work if the nervous system is shattered . If the nerve centers are systematically robbed of nourishment or demoralized by mental or physical dissipation , the whole machinery of body and mind is thrown out of order . No defective machine can turn out good work , and the longer one tries to use it , while some serious obstacle is clogging the wheels , the greater will be the damage it suffers and the more difficult to put it in proper repair . Few hard workers realize the danger of working when the nerve cells have exhausted their vitality . No good engineer would think of running a delicate piece of complicated machinery when the lubricant is used up . He would know that the moment the oil has ceased to be effective , and the bearings begin to chafe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be destroyed , and the friction and discord will soon ruin the delicate adjustment of the machine . But hundreds of level-headed men ( in other respects ) , who are engineers of the most marvelous pieces of machinery ever devised , even by the great Creator-machinist , ? machines fearfully and wonderfully wrought , ? run their human , throbbing en184 YOUNG MAN ENTERING BUSINESS gines , which are so delicate that a particle of dust or friction anywhere may throw the whole fabric out of harmony for days or weeks , without proper cleaning or lubrication . I know some business men who are not naturally very strong , and yet , by systematic self-training , regular diet , and plenty of sleep , they manage to accomplish infinitely more than many men who are much more brainy and much stronger . They always manage to come to their business fresh , vigorous , and strong . They will not allow anything to break into their hours for sleep or interfere with the regularity of their meals or daily exercise . Regularity in living accounts for one 's power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day 's work as the prize fighter enters the ring ? in superb condition . Nature makes no exceptions in your case . She does not take into consideration your loss of sleep , lack of exercise , or wretched diet ; she demands that you shall ever be at the top of your condition . No excuses or apologies will go with her . If you have violated her law , you must pay the penalty , though you sit on a throne . Many a man would not think of starting // out on a day 's journey unless his carriage wheels were well oiled ; he would not think of starting his complicated machinery in the factory in the morning until the bearings were in good condition and all possible friction guarded against ; but he thinks nothing of starting up the greatest piece of machinery the Creator has made , with ten thousand complications and conditions , without proper lubrication , without a sufficient supply of fuel , of rest , or of motive power . In the first place , delicate machinery , when improperly lubricated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his intricate mechanism will not only do poor work when out of order , but that it will also soon be completely ruined beyond repair . But still he seems to think he can start the cells of his brain into action without proper recuperation by sleep , recreation , or rest , and crowds through the day with heated bearings , with friction in the journals , and still hopes to do perfect work . He expects to start his complicated , delicate , digestive apparatus in the morning in perfect condition , when it was insulted the night before by a conglomerate banquet composed of all sorts of indigestible , incompatible dishes ; and if it fails to take care of this // hideous mass without a groan or a quibble he resorts to his physician and expects that , without removing the cause , a drug will set him right . I-le might as well administer castor oil to a thief , expecting it to cure him of dishonesty . Plenty of sleep and abundant recreation out of doors , especially in the country , are the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which long-continued good work is impossible . Nerve specialists say that a great many suicides are the direct results of exhausted brain cells . When you find yourself becoming morose and despondent , when you are conscious that the zest of life is evaporating , that you are losing the edge of your former keen interest in things generally , and that your life is becoming a bore , you may be pretty sure that you need more sleep , that you need country or outdoor exercise . If you get these , you will find that all the old enthusiasm will return . A few days of exercise in the country , rambling over the hills and meadows , will erase the dark pictures which haunt you , and will restore buoyancy to your animal spirits . No man is in an absolutely normal condition // until he enjoys bare living , and feels that existence itself is a precious boon . No one is normal who does not feel thankful , every day , that he is alive and that he can think and act with vigor and affectiveness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who would make the most of life must learn " to be good to himself " ; that is , while he should strain every nerve to develop himself to the utmost , he must remember that his success will depend very largely upon the care he takes of his success-machine , ? that is , of himself . Many so-called successful men are their own worst enemies . They would never think of abusing a horse or any other dumb animal as they impose upon themselves . They go without eating , are irregular at meals , and rob themselves of sleep and recreation ; in fact , they violate every law of their physical and mental natures , and yet wonder why they are gray-haired , dyspeptic , and broken-down before middle life . They can not understand why their ambition and greed to get on in the world should not be the measure of their strength , and so they go on forcing their brains to work when every particle of nervous energy which was stored up the previous twenty-four hours has been exhausted . 188 // It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you cut off five , ten , or fifteen years of your life by foolish indiscretion , abusing yourself by overworking , or depriving yourself of needed rest , ? by not knowing exactly how much you can stand , ? or whether you save those precious years by obedience to the laws of health . There is nothing else so valuable as one 's physical and mental energy , which should be preserved at any cost . In other words , nothing is dear which we can possibly afford that will in any way help us to get on in the world faster and better . Personal power is a great thing to achieve and maintain . Everywhere in city and country , we see men and women , especially men , old at thirty or thirty-five , their shoulders stooped , their hair gray , and their spirits broken . They have no elasticity in their step , no buoyancy in their bearing . They destroyed their possibilities in their over-reaching ambition to become wealthy or famous ? to outdistance all competitors . Their lives have become dry and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be in their physical and mental prime . Thousands of well-meaning men deprive // themselves of needed nourishing , force-giving food , by trying to economize . Such men stand at lunch-counters and hastily swallow a sandwich and a glass of milk , to economize time and money ; when they owe it to themselves and to their highest well-being to go to a good restaurant or hotel , take time enough to eat a nutritious , properly cooked , and properly served meal , and give the stomach time to begin the process of assimilation before resuming work . There is not only no economy in this , but it is the worst kind of extravagance . The greatest economy a success-candidate can practise is to store up the largest amount of success-force , vitality , nervous and mental energy , in his constitution , for effective and efficient achievement . To rob one 's self of the food material which gives this magic force is like killing the goose which lays golden eggs . Many a man has mocked a magnificent natural ability with mediocre achievement , simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failing to supply the motive-power to run it . Thousands of men , through not taking proper care of themselves , have died amid the wreck of disappointed ambitions , having failed // to carry out one-tenth of what they expected and had the ability to accomplish . Would you not think that man insane who , possessing a reservoir of precious elixir of life , should bore gimlet holes through it , here and there , and let the life-power run to waste ? Yet this is exactly what thousands of us are doing . We start out with a great pond or lake of life-power , and let the major part of it escape through the leaks made in the reservoir by our own carelessness or ignorance . We are all the time cutting off our successpossibilities by wasting , here and there , life 's force and energy , robbing ourselves of the reserve which alone would make great achievement possible ; and yet we wonder why we do not succeed . Lack of sleep , lack of exercise in the open air , lack of nourishing food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing our work in the spirit of drudgery , ? all these things are leaks which sap our energy and rob us of the great reserve of life-force which enables one to achieve results . The carriage and position of the body , during both the day and the night , have much to do with one 's figure , health , and appearance . How quickly one can distinguish an army or Tye YOUNG MAN ENTERING BUSINESS navy officer on the street , though he is a stranger ! How many would give a fortune to possess such a figure and bearing ! And yet almost any one who has not some natural deformity can acquire it , by observing a few simple rules and practising a few easy exercises . As you know , it takes but a few weeks or months of discipline and drill to change uncouth , slouchy , raw recruits , into fine , erect , and dignified soldiers . Always , when standing or walking , hold yourself as erect as possible ; throw the shoulders back and down , elevate the chest a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When standing , the weight of the body should fall upon the ball of the foot , neither upon the heel nor the toe . Follow these simple rules strictly , and you will greatly improve your figure and bearing . A habit of carrying the body in an erect , dignified , and graceful manner also affects the general health and self-respect . Do not bend the legs too much when walking ; let the weight fall slightly more on the toe first . Swing the arms naturally , but not too much . Be careful not to bob up and down . A graceful walker seems to glide easily along . Curves are always graceful , and an // angular , jerky movement is always ungainly . Grace is an acquirable quality , but we must remember that Nature abhors angles and spasmodic movements ; she always uses curves which are most graceful and delicate . The reason why woman is more beautiful than man is because her form is made up of graceful curves . There are no angles whatever in a model female figure . Most people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , this fault is very nearly universal , except in those who have been trained . It is impossible to slouch about on chairs or on a sofa all clay , and then expect to have a good bearing and poise when standing or walking . Again , slouchy positions will very soon react upon the mind , and produce mental shiftlessness and slouchiness in thought . Every faculty and function sympathizes with every other , and a defect in one affects all . No one can do good reading , writing , or thinking in any but an erect position . The thought immediately sympathizes with the body . A habit of reading in bed , or when lying down , or in a careless position , slouching clown in one 's chair with the feet up , will very soon tell upon the quality of the thoughts . // It is impossible to do good thinking in these positions . The body must be in an erect and dignified posture without being cramped by position or dress . No one can think well without freedom and ease . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stooping , unnatural position . Such a posture interferes with the circulation of the blood and gives the heart a much larger amount of work to do . This active and often overworked organ requires extra power to force the current of life through the entire body every two minutes , when the body is in an unnatural attitude . What would you think of an engineer who would try to economize on lubricating oil , at the expense of his machinery or engine ? We should say that he is very foolish , but many of us do much more foolish things ; for , while we do not economize on that which would injure inanimate machinery , we economize in cheerfulness , in recreation , in play , in healthful amusements , which would lubricate life 's mechanism and make it last longer . XXVII . WASTING OUR ENERGY-CAPITAL WE start out in life with a definite amount of possible energy . We can spend it as we please ; but , even with the best intentions , many people use up a large part of their capital in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? trifles which have nothing whatever to do with their success . If we could only learn to control our thought-force , and to expend it where it is needed , instead of allowing it to ooze out or to leak away in driblets on unimportant matters , what marvels we would accomplish ! How prodigal most young people are of their physical and mental forces ! How little they appreciate their value ! On every hand we see young men and women squandering their vital energy as if a perpetual supply were insured , as if the fountain of youth would never run dry . They fling away their force as wastefully as the waters of a spring flood overflow into the surrounding country . But when the flood-tide 195 // of youth is past , when they begin to feel the dryness of age , they realize the preciousness of what they squandered so recklessly . In some places , where the water supply is abundant in spring , the streams dry up completely in summer . The only possible way of securing water power to work the mills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spring floods by means of dams . Even so the great floods of mental and physical force come to us in the spring of youth . The drain upon them begins in middle or later life . If men had a higher regard for their energy there would be less occasion for the present unfortunate fact that when they reach middle life employers can not use them . Anything which destroys mental vigor also destroys creative energy , without which adequate success is impossible . The man who squanders his vitality , whether it be by physical or mental dissipation , overwork , or indolence , loses his originality ; and when he ceases to be original , he ceases to achieve . It may seem a little thing to a youth to sacrifice a portion of his sleep , night after night , for the sake of some form of entertainment , but he buys the indulgence , which he calls // pleasure , at the cost of a certain amount of formative power . The man who drinks to excess does not realize that he purchases the temporary gratification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objectively , would stagger him . If he could see , before he becomes its victim , the devitalizing forces which the drink habit sets in motion ; if he could look into his brain and note the growth of the first tiny seeds of decay sown there ; if it were possible for him to view through a microscope the corrosive action going on in his veins and arteries , sapping his blood and stealing the elasticity from his muscles ; in short , if he could see himself being reduced gradually from a vigorous human being to the physical and mental level of jellyfish , he would shrink with horror from the sight . All our faculties , physical and mental , are welded into one complex machine , so fine and sensitive that discord or friction in any part affects the whole . No matter where or what our weak spot may be , it will be reflected in what we do , in what we write , in what we say , in our very innermost thoughts . It is a part of our being , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , will " blab. " // The vacillator , the man who swings back and forth like a pendulum , never taking a firm , independent stand on any question , not even on those which affect him most deeply , depletes by his vacillation his mental force to such an extent that he becomes incapable of acting on his own impulse , and loses irrevocably whatever stock of creative energy he might have had at the outset . A violent temper , leading as it does to frequent outbursts of passion , tends to wear out the nervous system , and in time robs its possessor of the power of initiative . Every jarring element in the machinery of our bodies , be it poor health , bad temper , prevarication , indolence , vacillation , or any of the lesser faults which to many appear so insignificant , will prove as disastrous to our efforts to attain success as would so many weights attached to his person to a man competing for a prize in a foot race . No young man can hope to advance rapidly who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a requisite to employment . No one wants to employ a youth who lacks push . He must be alive to and in touch with the spirit of the hour , or he is not wanted anywhere . The enterprising employer wants ' // every employee to share his spirit . The unenterprising business man feels all the more keenly the need of assistance from those who can make up for his failing . Force , pushing , dynamic qualities are everywhere in eager demand , while the dawdling , incompetent , unprogressive wait in vain for a start or for promotion . Many a man has bought his comfort at the cost of the achievement of his aims . Few people are willing to be incommoded or to submit to discomforts , even for the sake of future blessings . They would succeed if they could do so in an easy and pleasant way ; but the moment they have to sacrifice their ease or their comfort , they shrink from the effort . It is astonishing what people will give up in order to get comfort , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They will let golden opportunities slip by , procrastinating for the sake of their comfort until the chances have gone . They do not like to get up early in the morning , because they are so comfortable in bed . They do not like to go out in a storm or in cold weather , because it is so cozy at home or in their offices ; and so they lose many a chance . Many people can be bought by comfort when hardly any200 YOUNG MAN ENTERING BUSINESS thing else would tempt them . They think so much of their ease that they can not bear to exert themselves . Love of comfort and ease must be classed among the great success-hinderers . People like to do pleasant , easy things . They can not bear to take pains , or to put themselves out in any unusual way , if they can possibly avoid it . Thousands of people are earning small salaries to-day because they can not bear to exert themselves to win promotion . They prefer to remain on a low rung of life 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rather than to put forth the efforts that would carry them upward . Success is not excelling or equalling some one else , but coming up to the level of your best . He who is faithful is also successful . The wife of an Englishman , who , in spite of his blindness , had become eminent as a musician , philanthropist , and mathematician , replying to some complimentary allusions to her husband , said : " He is not more clever than other men , but this he has done : he has made the most of his capacities and opportunities . " In that reply she had given a full definition of true success . The best lesson in culture is to learn to give
