There are two ways of dealing with a large subject , the method of scholarship and the method of literature . Of the first , an excellent example is Warton 's " History of English Poetry , " a book which was so well made more than a hundred years ago that it still holds its own , in spite of the great advances in English scholarship and criticism since Thomas Warton 's time . Of the large subject treated with learning , with judgment , and with style , no book in English surpasses Green 's " Short History of the English People . " The first impression that is left on reading Mr. Einstein 's account of " The Italian Renaissance in England , " ? an impression that is but deepened by a more careful examination of the book , ? is , that the subject is entirely too large for a thesis . Any graduate student is bound to come to grief with a subject that comprehends two centuries of time and two great literatures . To cope with so vast a theme there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one who has read widely at first hand . And then to sufficiency of equipment there should be added critical acumen and a sense of the relative value of things . It is the play of Hamlet with Hamlet left out , to discuss the Italian Renaissance in England , crowding the whole of the great drama within the space of three pages . So the Italianization of Shakesneare vets here hot three naves more In addition to immaturity , Mr. Einstein labors under the further disadvantage of not being to the manner born in either of the literatures he is writing about . The external point of view is curiously marked . The discussion of English poetry is timid , dry , and wholly inadequate ; while there is absolutely nothing in the treatment of English politics which would suggest that the Tudors had something to do with the development of the modern state . Machiavelli and Elizabeth to the contrary , the English Constitution is as conspicuously absent from Mr. Einstein 's book as the Elizabethan drama . On the other hand , the chapter on the Italian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dearth of humor in these pages , if it is not foreign , suggests at least the Baker 's perplexity " I said it in Hebrew , ? I said it in Dutch , ? I said it in German and Greek ; But I wholly forgot ( and it vexes me much ) That English is what you speak i " No man of English strain , and no Italian , could possibly have walked through these two centuries of grandly humorous literature without even once cracking a smile . There is one bit of unconscious humor , where the fear of brigands and the inconveniences of travel are naively urged to explain the fact that the Elizabethan travellers in Italy made no account of the landscape . The English traveller affords a good illustration of the author 's heavy manner of treating an attractive theme . Almost every Englishman of note during the reigns of Elizabeth and James made the tour to Italy . They were statesmen , diplomatists , poets , artists , scholars , men of fashion and of leisure . The literature of the time is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home on all sorts of subjects . But the great body of this literature ( which often bubbles over with fun ) is a closed book to Mr. Einstein , who confines his attention to two or three early guide books . He quotes Dallington 's " Method for Travel , " but does not mention Fynes Moryson , nor Lithgow , nor Coryate . He knows Sidney as a traveller , but not Crashaw , Donne , Harington , Lord Herbert of Cherbury , Howell , Killigrew , Milton , Peacham , Thomas Sackville , Sir Henry Wotton , and literally scores of famous Elizabethans . Mr. Einstein has fallen into a good many errors of fact and of opinion . Names of persons are frequently inaccurate . For example , William Latimer ( p. 38 ) is introduced ( p. 30 )  | and indexed ( p. 416 ) as Thomas Latimer ; William Selling ( p. 29 ) should be William Tilley , of Selling ; Cardinal Guala ( Guala Bicchieri , raised to the purple by Innocent III. ) is called Cardinal Gualli ( p. 179 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obsolete English , that he " conferred Chesterton Rectory to the monastery of St. Andrews . " Lord Buckhurst is spoken of ( p. 275 ) and indexed ( p. 412 ) by his title , one of his titles , only ; his name , Thomas Sackville , nowhere appears . " Even a woman miniaturist , Alice Carmellian " ( p. 196 ) is not recognized as Ellis Carmyan , mentioned on page 77 , as a masque decorator . The " Dietionary of National Biography " records this person 's name as Alice , or Ellis , Carmylyon , and gives five variant spellings , ? Alice Carmillian , Alys Carmyllion , Alis Carmylion , Ellis Carmyan , and Elysys the painter . As to Alice Carmylyon 's being a miniaturist , the " Dietionary " says : " It does not appear what foundation John Gough Nichols has for his remark that she appears to have been a painter in miniature . ' " Upon the point of sex , the same authority decides that there is " no conclusive evidence either way . " A variation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or herself , is Mr. Einstein 's making two different persons masquerade as one . On page 352 Unico Aretino is supposed to be Pietro Aretino . This is confounding the fairly respectable , if rather conceited , Unico with the eminently unrespectable Pietro . Bernardo Accolti , of Arezzo , was called the " Unico Aretino , " from his " unique " faculty for extemporizing verse . Pietro Aretino 's name was Pietro Bacci . These two persons did live at the same time , and in the same city . But Francesco Patrizi , Bishop of Gaeta ( died 1494 ) comes to life again ( p. 293 ) as Francesco Patrizi ( 1529-1597 ) , and no bishop . Francesco Patrizi , Bishop of Gaeta , wrote " De Regno et Regis Institutione " ( Paris , 1567 ) , a book which was translated by Richard Robinson , in 1576 , as " A Moral Methode of Civile Policie , " etc . The other Francesco Patrizi wrote , " Della Ilistoria diece dialoghi . . . ne ' quali si ragiona di tutte le @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ et all ' osservarla " ( Venetia , 1560 ) . Thomas Blundeville translated lated this book , in 1574 , under the title , " The true order and Methode of wryting and reading Hystories according to the Precepts of Francisco Patricio , " etc . Mr. Einstein mentions the'first work on pages 293 and 301 ; the other work is the one referred to on pages 309 and 313 . But on page 417 all the references are assigned to one person , F. Patrizi . Again , it fills the judicious reader with misgivings to meet with many familiar titles which have been here transformed , and deformed . The Latin title just cited reads ( p. 293 ) " De Ilegno et Regio Institutione . " George Pettie 's alliterative title " A Petite Pallace of Pettie his Pleasure , " becomes unintelligible ( p. 364 ) in " Pettie 's Palace of Pettie his Pleasure . " A well-known book Mr. Einstein knows as J. R. Green 's " Short History of England " ( p. 292 ) . The most extraordinary made-up title occurs on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiction , produces a little fiction of his own . He says : " Perimides and Philomela , for instance , was so closely imitated from Boccaccio that it ? amounted almost to a translation " ; and as authority for this statement , the " Publications of the Modern Language Association " ( 1898 , p. 250 ) is alleged . Turning to the " Publications " for 1895 , ( " Elizabethan Translations from the Italian " ) , on page 275 there is entered Robert Greene 's " Perimides the Blacke ? Smith " ; and a few pages farther on ( p. 278 ) , " Philomela , the Lady Fitzwaters Nightingale . " On page 250 , in the preface to this article , which is on prose romances from the Italian , Greene 's imitation of Boccaccio is mentioned , and these romances are instanced as examples . Mr. Einstein has run the two titles into one , and then given a reference that is wrong as to source , year , and paging . Can Mr. Einstein have read the novels of Robert Greene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mind as to titles , to have to note of Mr. Einstein that the work which has helped him most in writing his book , the " Publications of the Modern Language Association , " he calls everywhere ( he cites it four times only ) the " Proceedings " of that society . The " Proceedings " is the report of the annual meeting of the Association , published every year in No. 4 of the " Publications . " No one of Mr. Einstein 's four references will be found in any of the " Proceedings . " It is not the case , as stated on page 81 , that Giovanni della Casa 's " Galatheo " was translated into French and Spanish before its appearance in English , in 1596 . Robert Peterson 's translation of " Galatheo " was printed in London , in 1576 , with a dedication to the Earl of Leicester . The British Museum possesses a copy of this imprint ; and an exemplar , imper- feet in some respects , is owned in this country by Harvard University . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paris , 1562 ) did precede Peterson 's ; but the first Spanish translation , a very rare book , is dated nine years later . It is , " Tratado Ziamado Galath , eo . . . Traduzido de lengua Toscana en Castellano por el Doctor Domingo de Bezerra " ( Venetia , 1585 ) . A familiar Cellini story turns up ( p. 196 ) , attributed to Torrigiano , whose " irascible ternperament , " it is said , " did not long permit him to enjoy quiet among ' those beasts the English , ' as he was wont to call them . " There is a hasty reading here of J. A. Gotch ( " Early Renaissance Architecture in England , " p. 7 ) . Gotch attributes this characterization of the English correctly to Cellini , and quotes it accurately , " beasts of English , " queue bestie di quelli ingh , ilesi ( " Vita di Benvenuto Cellini , " c. 15. b . ) . Mr. Einstein 's habit of inaccuracy passes over into matters of opinion . He says ( p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of two louing Italians Gualfrido and Barnardo le vayne " was " falsely stated to be a translation to mislead the reader . " The " Dictionary of National Biography , " under Drout 's name , says : " Collier doubts whether Drout really translated the story from the Italian , and suggests that Drout describes it as a translation so that he might take advantage of the popularity of Italian novels . " Mr. Einstein gives no authority for his statement . If he has based it upon Collier , it has but a shaky foundation , for surely a doubt and a suggestion of John Payne Collier do not make a matter of f act . The point is important because it illustrates the curious facility of conjectures to get taken for facts ' by the next writer on the subject . Mr. Einstein himself is rather given to conjectures , as when ( p. 74 ) he says that Saviolo on quarrels , or " perhaps some similar sentence . . . first suggested the dramatic possibilities of Romeo and Juliet , " ? " Romeo and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antiquity and distinguished pedigree , in Latin , and even in Greek , Italian , French , Spanish , and English . Or when ( p. 168 ) , repeating R. L. Douglas ( Introduction to " Certain Tragical Discourses of Bandello , " Tudor Translations , 1898 , p. xlvii ) , he says that Ascham , in tensuring English translations of Italian books , " had probably in mind Fenton 's translation of Bandello , dedicated to Lady Mary Sidney . " As a matter of fact , Fenton translated thirteen novels only , and all of those from the French of Belleforest . It Roger Ascham had any one book in mind , it was much more likely to have been Painter 's " Palace of Pleasure . " This is evident from the interpolation at the end of the first part of " The Seholemaster , " which , from internal evidence , must have been written about 1568 , the year after the appearance of Painter 's Second Tome . At that time , Painter had published ninety-four novels , largely from the Italian . Volume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Volume II. , thirty-four novels , a Bandello book . The index leaves much to be desired . Very few titles get into it at all , and a large majority of persons are indexed without their Christian names or initials . This leads to the confusion of persons , even by the author himself . Names in the foot-notes now and then stray into the index , but most of them are omitted . Many of the foot-notes are inaccurate . The references at the bottom of page 92 are cited as from " Castiglione " ; they refer in fact to Thomas Hoby 's translation of Castiglione , " The Book of the Courtier " ( probably the " Tudor Translations " reprint , 1900 ) . Mrs. T. R. Green ( pp. 258 and 259 ) should read Mrs. J. R. Green . Richard Mulcaster 's " The First Part of the Elementarie " is cited ( p. 164 ) simply " Elementary , " without author 's name , without date , without the original spelling . So vague a reference is useless . Many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the author 's youth and haste . They might have been avoided by sounder knowledge and closer attention , to details . A very serious fault has been noticed by the London " Athenmum . " The English reviewer points out , that in the making of his book Mr. Einstein has been indebted , more than his own statement of the case would seem to indicate , to an earlier work , " Elizabethan Translations from the Italian . " The facts referred to by " The Atheneum " are these : There appeared in the " Publications of the Modern Language Association , " 1895-1899 , four articles on " Elizabethan Translations from the Italian . " Of the 187 Printed Sources of information set forth in Mr. Einstein 's bibliography , 106 , or more than half , are to be found in the " Elizabethan Translations from the Italian . " There can be no doubt about Mr. Einstein 's having found them there , for he uses material from the " Elizabethan Transla- tions from the Italian " in his text and foot notes more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first time collected and annotated in " Elizabethan Translations from the Italian " are quoted in Mr. Einstein 's foot-notes withou reference to the source of authority . Further some 72 of these works are mentioned in Mr Einstein 's text , most of them without any foot notes . On page 336 of the " Elizabethan Transla Lions " a quotation from Roger Ascham is im mediately followed by one from Dr. Johnson on page 108 of the " Italian Renaissance in England " the same juxtaposition of authori ties occurs , but the references cite the origina works . On pages 61 and 62 of the " Elizabethan Translations " there is a discussion of the in fluence of the Mantuan on Shakespeare and Spenser ; the same subject is treated on pages 347 and 348 of the " Italian Renaissance in England , " with the same references , but cited as from the original , except that a quotation from Drake 's " Shakspeare and his Times , " is transferred to the more recent " Life o Shakspere " by Mr. Sidney Lee . The ident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concatenation of persons as Mantuanus , Shakespeare , Alexander Barclay e'Eneas Sylvius Piccolomini , and F. Kluge Surely Mr. Einstein has failed to meet the moral obligations here involved by acknowl edging his indebtedness to the " Elizabethan Translations from the Italian " twice only throughout his book , and by the cursory sen tence in his preface which probably led to " The Athenaeum 's " criticism . Nor is it the author of " Elizabethan Trans lations from the Italian alone who may justly y object to Mr. Einstein 's too free borrowing For the Italianization of Spenser , Mr. Einstein closely follows an article by Professor R. E Neil Dodge on Spencer 's Imitations from ? Ariosto. ? calls the paper " Imitations from Ariosto , " and cites it " Proceedings sic Modern Language Association , 1897 .

While it is the scholar 's happy privilege to use freely the published results of the labors of others , this privilege carries with it the equally happy duty of acknowledging its exercise . To neglect the duty is to abuse the privilege .  |
