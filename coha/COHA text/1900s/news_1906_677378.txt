txt Rice has submitted his estimate of the cost of elevated and sub- I way connections for the East River bridges and tunnels , with statements of the travel likely to be accommodated by routes between their terminals . It is no disparagement of these particular estimates to say that they are not finalities . Contractors ' bids do not accompany them , and indeed could not be prepared from the data published . The cost of construction of an elevated loop is put at $1,800,000 . But it is necessary to add the damages to abutting property caused by elevated railway construction , and the cost of escalators to a structure high enough to be double-decked . Subway construction benefits adjoining property , but without taking any credit upon this account the comparative costs are $3,550,000 for the elevated route , and $4,750,000 for the subway . The difference might be offset against the fact that the elevated road could be built sooner by one year , or in half the time . On the other hand , the elevated loop is a temporary provision , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure with lower costs of maintenance . Are the accommodations worth the money ? The first impulse is to say that the conditions are so bad , and the interests involved are so large , that cost is a secondary consideration . But this impulse is checked by Engineer Rion 's statement regarding the traffic ) which would be accommodated by either plan . It is smaller than anybody had guessed , so much smaller that it is merely common prudence to balance the cost with the worth of what the money will buy . Only 15 per cent , of the Brooklyn Bridge traffic would be accommodated by the new routes , and 25 per cent . of the Williamsburg travel . The balance either walk to their destinations , or proceed in such different directions that the proposed loops would not benefit them . These considerations do not apply to the movement of the cars . All cars would traverse the new routes , and whatever expedites the car movement has some uncertain effect in facilitating travel . Still the propotal to expend millions to promote the movement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remark will , be perceived readily by the railways if it be proposed that they , instead of the city , shall expend the money . Is it to be believed that the elevated railway would expend several millions to provide switching facilities , or that , having done so , it would ever abandon them ? Both questions ought to be answered affirmatively before the city assents to the erection of the objectionable structure , and even if both points were safeguarded assent would only doubtfully be warranted in view of the small benefit to travel . Before it would be possible to build either route the In - terborough tunnel will afford greater relief to the Brooklyn Bridge traffic . When once this discussion is settled it may be surmised that the Brooklyn elevated road will find some way to bring its cars across the Williamsburg Bridge , either running them through the Subway , or to a stub terminal in Manhattan . The latter plan is not a good one , but it would relieve all responsible of the reproach of tracks standing idle years after the opening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
