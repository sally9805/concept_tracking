 | AS a basis for his brilliant contribution to the last number of this magazine , Mr. David Graham Phillips began by imagining the death of Mr. Rockefeller . Something over two centuries ago , Algernon Sydney gave his head to block and ax on Tower Hill for " Imagining the Death " of James II . There is , however -- this is writ to comfort nervous ones -- no dread inference against the safety of Mr. Phillips to be drawn from the great republican 's downright taking off , since we of America about a century later fought at Concord and Yorktown for the privilege ? and won it ? of " imagining " whatever we would of a Stuart or a Rockefeller or any other ruler to the end of time . Besides , as he phrased it , there was nothing rudely treasonable in Mr. Phillips ' supposition , naught that marked him as traitor even to good taste . Indeed , he so far softened surmise as to give it the consistency of compliment by permitting in Mr. Rockefeller 's favor the possibility of a most polite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making his exit by those usual doctorand-deathbed methods which through much vulgar repetition have grown threadbare and commonplace , might be caught up in a chariot of fire ? after a celebrated Scriptural precedent ? and , angel-attended , whisked away to his reward . Having thus happily got rid of the Monarch of Standard Oil , and drawn a very natural breath of relief at his success , Mr. Phillips presses forward . Recalling the son , and remembering that billion of gold the father has left behind him , Mr. Phillips sweeps on in a river of lucid broad conjecture as to " What he the son could do with it the billion . " With that same son and that same billion as the raw materials wherewith to work , it is now my task by appointment of this magazine to write " What he will do with it " ; and while the views I shall express may offend folk of a certain sensitive interest and be condemned by them as no better nor other than the sullen , lowbrewed word of pessimism , I 've read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or rather demerits of gold in its effects upon mankind , if what I am to say prove not the truer prophecy of the two . And at that ? to urge a fhaal syllable of self-compliment ? my labors are bound in the nature of things to be more difficult and less graceful than were those of Mr. Phillips . By the exigencies of our different and differing assignments , he was allowed to indulge in every license of the poetic , while I must confine my narrow wanderings to the prosiest of  | practical prose . His generous fancy could fix its eye upon some star of optimism , and soar aloft ; mine , bending its cheerless gaze upon the ground , is made to plod without so much as a rushlight or smallest wick of hope to show the way . He was free to dip his pen in every color of what rainbow goes with man as he might be ; I must work with those grays and drabs and blacks that belong with man as he is . However , I too much cherish myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What will young Mr. Rockefeller do with his billion ? Or , if the above query place a cart before a horse , what will his billion do with him ? It is proper to state curiosity both ways ; for if one but scan closely the procession of life as it passes , it will be observed that the money more often possesses the man than the man the money . Recurring to the question , whichever way you choose to put it , there are two matters to be thought of before you may come by an answer . You must consider young Mr. Rockefeller in his strengths and his weaknesses . Also , in similar fashion , you must consider the billion . If it were a hod of bricks and a boy , and the question were whether the boy could get the bricks to the scaffold , you would see at once that to frame reply you must come by the measures of both . The world has some conception of a mere man . It meets him and matches itself against him in struggles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is neither so common nor so well understood . To begin with , it is almost impossible to crowd its outlines within the frontiers of an ordinary imagination . And scant marvel ! The Wandering Jew drove the weary Christ from his door-step . " Thou shalt walk the earth till I return , " said the Savior , by way of punishment . That the sentence was operative has as a proposition some color of support , there being more or less word that as late as 1830 the immortal tramp was observed and recognized in London town . Assuming then that the Wandering Jew is still abroad upon the earth , L DO WITH IT 307 had the Roman government as a reward for his cruelty granted him an annual pension of five hundred thousand dollars , and paid that half-million every faithful year throughout all the long centuries down to present time , and if on his side the peripatetic pensioner had saved every obol until now , he would n't have a billion dollars . In point of fact and fortune , young Mr. Rockefeller , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For all his almost two thousand years , his annual income of a half-million , and his frugal saving of every groat , that deathless outcast could only write himself the " Second richest man on earth . " So much in the hope that you may gain from it some notion of the sinister length and breadth , not to add thickness , of a billion dollars ? being the present Rockefeller hoard . And now that we have our hod of bricks , let us turn to the boy who is to carry it . There is no apology required when folk sit down to a survey of young Mr. Rockefeller . Think of the power with which that billion is to clothe his hand ! With such a lever of Archimedes , and using as his fulcrum the native avarice of men , he might overturn a throne . Men not only may but should weigh him as to all the inborn good or ill he promises , for the same reason and by the same right that seamen canvass winds and clouds to argue therefrom the coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortune of this inquiry , if not of young Mr. Rockefeller , that for years on end an accommodating press has printed the least as well as the greatest of his comings in and goings out . What he said , what he did ; his business , his sports ; his health , his sickness , have one and all been granted exhaustive relation . That man would be dull beyond conception who at this day could not in hair-line give a portrait of young Mr. Rockefeller in what might be described as his capacity , general or special , for evil or for good . He has touched the middle years of life ; he has lived long enough to express himself . Alexander conquered a world before he was as old as young Mr. Rockefeller . Caesar remade  | the map of Europe , Keats wrote " Endymion , " Perry whipped Barclay on Lake Erie and composed his laconism " I 've met the enemy and he is ours , " Sydney gave the world his sonnets and got himself killed at Zutphen , Byron was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Napoleon defeated it , and the oldest among them the junior of young Mr. Rockefeller . No , if he were any volcano of genius , some smoke or some flame from him would long ago have been visible on the horizon of a world 's affairs . We should have had some word beyond the mere mention of his Bible-class , or that billion with which the future will equip him . " But , " cries some alarmist , " young Mr. Rockefeller 's father is still alive . You ca n't estimate how far the elder Rockefeller acts for the son 's repression . Once he is his own master , and that billion waiting docile to his touch , with none to molest him or make him afraid , who shall foretell his action ? He may assert himself in manners not dreamed of , and with forces never to be guessed . We , living in the Pompeii of our ignorance , even now may be camped at the base of another Vesuvius , to which the death of the elder Rockefeller is to become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its lavas will swallow us up . " Our hectic one may be at peace ; his excitement is altogether misplaced . The elder Rockefeller , however gigantic when considered as a bushel , would hardly , and for over a decade , serve to hide such a light as he describes . Take it from me , who am not without reasons for the thought , that young Mr. Rockefeller , looked at from every angle , offers only a spectacle of the passive and the innocuous . Without virtues as without vices , he is the sublimation of the mediocre ? the negative in apogee ? a climax of the commonplace . Were a world to ask itself questions about young Mr. Rockefeller , what would it hear ? In all that has been printed of him , was it said that he liked books or gems or pictures or tapestries or statues , or was in any sort given to hterature or music or art ? Does he care for flowers ? Has he a poet favorite over the rest ? Is he eager for travel , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fad for politics ? What sentiment or what anxiety concerning government ? city , state or national ? has he ever expressed ? What sport does he affect ? ? is it with gun or dog or rod or horse or boat ? What are his relaxations ? ? theater , society ? Or does he find his pleasure in doing good , and in easing the sore shoulders of overburdened men ? The answer in every case is No , And if you should turn to the darker side and , speaking in the sense personal , ask what wrong he does , you would have no more for your trouble . For black or for white he has no activities , no initiatives , no aggressions , no emotions . His nature , shallow , narrow , blurred , is as rippleless as a duck-pond and as much without a current . It will wreck nothing , wanting the depth ; no storm can toss it into perilous billows , for there is n't enough of it . Neither good nor bad , I might say of young Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he was ? a bigger man : He is like a bucket of spring-water , pure , not poisonous ; and yet not of a quantity to put out a fire or swim a boat or turn the wheel of any mill of moment . He has no sense of humor , no imagination . There is nothing of the acid in him ; no gunpowder , no naphtha , to explode or take fire . He will invent nothing , discover nothing , do nothing , be nothing . With an instinct in favor of the safe , he will stick close to the conventional , adhere to the precedental . He will say nothing that has n't been said , think nothing that has n't been thought , do nothing that has n't been done ; and of what has been said and thought and done he will say and think and do only a little . From all of which it is deducible that , whatever the boat or wherever the voyage , he will go as a passenger , never as a sailor . There may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's billion ; there will be none discoverable , rest sure , in young Mr. Rockefeller himself . There are but two theaters of effort in which young Mr. Rockefeller has  | appeared . One was Wall Street , and the other was his Bible-class . Once and only once he entered Wall Street as a lamb , and proceeded to gamble in stocks . He did n't long remain . The oldsters took the wool off him so fast that he caught a chill , and went bleating back to the family fold . This single plunge into the whirlpool of affairs would not be worth a notice only that it confirms the impression of the colorless weakness above rehearsed . Let us consider young Mr. Rockefeller in connection with that famous Bible-class . The church has ever been the hunting ground of hypocrites , and it is the Bible that most warns us against scribe and pharisee . The world , remembering how often Satan clothes his servants in the livery of heaven , sniffs at every pretense of religion , and particularly when made in a loud voice and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world bears in mind that nine times in ten when it bought a gold brick the goods came wrapped in a tract . Who shall blame the world for its hatred of hypocrites ? And yet the world-and this is in defense of a certain sort of hypocrite , the Rockefeller sort ? should realize how there may be men who , while deluding others , also delude themselves . They are their own dupes , and although foul in the sight of other men are fair in their own . They read where the Scriptures declare that the congregation of hypocrites shall be desolate and fire shall consume the tabernacle of bribery " ; but it never strikes them that they themselves are threatened . These dull ones , who know not themselves , are in a way innocent . True , they are most discouraging , and by the very fact of their presence keep good folk out of the church . They so plainly love the tents of the ungodly ; have such obvious appetites for the flesh-pots ! Their moral skin is so exceeding thick ! These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all about them , will offer you a sparkling example across table with a glassful of wine . They will talk ? not act ? of local poverty and its relief , with sixty-cent cigars between their lips , and see in it no contradiction . At dinners to cost twenty dollars a cover , over vintages cheap at twelve dollars the quart , they debate the freezing and starving not a half-mile away , and discover in such action nothing of the incongruous . Naturally says a world looking on : " If these be Christians , and not as him who ' covereth his face with fatness and maketh collops of fat on his flanks , ' why do n't they issue forth from their palaces to cost a king 's ransom , and with a fragment of their riches , lift ? be it even for one day ? the burden of some struggling , cold-nipped , hungerbeaten wretch ? There live ones who are not Christians , and dwell a long flight-shot from it in truth , and yet this wan business of other people 's hunger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The world is right . There is much in those purblind churchly Rockefeller ones to distaste . They illustrate the truth that the professedly good are never very good , nor those excellent by cold design of a best excellence . For the most part , without knowing it , they are moved wholly of a smug vanity . They are pleasingly puffed with themselves . They look often in the glass and seldom from the window ; and are nothing better than stall-fed even if innocent hypocrites , with the scribes and the pharisees ? all unknowingly ? their models . Those are the ones whom a world most furiously denounces . And yet , it is in my mind that the world , in a majority of these instances , reads the motive wrong . Our Rockefellers are so much like poets that they are born , not made , and there is a deal that is false that is not intentionally false . These folk regard themselves as beyond a stain . It is all in the point of view , and every man 's point of view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can much change the born nature of a man . Training ? education ? environment ? A film , a wash , a pressure . Plant corn in a hothouse , give it the care of orchid or of rose , yet shall it come forth corn . Retrieve  | the pigling of a day from the breast of its mother ; bestow upon it such training or education or environment as you prefer ; robe it in silks , sweeten it with baths , feed it milk and lilies . Do this one year , two years , four years , what space you please . Then make your pupil loose . That pigling , lusty now and grown , will hie him to the nearest mud-hole and wallow therein ; he will shoulder among his fellows and shout and sing for draft ; he will guttle his mess with his feet in the trough , and then sleep stertorously and offensively therein . Training ? You ca n't train Nature out of herself . You may put on the pressure of an environment , and compel a pretense , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Also , by that training or education or environment , or all three , you may teach the one thus trained or pressed upon to delude himself . Being held back from vice , he will decide that he is virtuous , and never once perceive how , in what he does as well as in what he fails to do , he is driven to every field of conduct and held there under guard . Born in a cage , he defines liberty as possessing bars , and can imagine freedom only with a fence . Now , I have reason for saying these things ; I say them in a measure to defend and explain myself . In those Bibleclass exercises , which are the hebdomadal joy of young Mr. Rockefeller , the world believes that he acts the role of hypocrite . I do n't think he does . In my opinion , he has simply led himself astray . We have n't his point of view ; we could n't have without having his billion . No man sees himself . He is as one who looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house he 's in , while the same is visible , from ridge-pole to water-table , to the man across the street . I can well understand how young Mr. Rockefeller has never once been confronted by his own image . The chances are ? and this is true of all that he owns less real knowledge of himself than of any other man with whom he is acquainted . We are apt to feel fully aware of ourselves . In that we grossly flatter self ; and the proof is that we daily give to others advice that we ourselves never take , and offer to our neighbor counsel upon which we turn our own backs . There is nothing more enervating. more blighting , than a cradle full of gold , and that young Mr. Rockefeller was born into the midst of millions has not helped but hurt him . The sons of rich men ? this is the rule ? never own the strength of those sires who heaped together the family fortune . And he who stops and thinks will see how this must be so . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exists no worth-while hint of seamanship in sunny weather and a favoring breeze . It was those tempests that the fathers encountered while collecting their fortunes which stiffened their thews ; it is massing those tempests that serves to soften and make flaccid the sons . These thoughts are not original ; there was never a wise one , and whether he were Solomon or Epicurus or Montaigne or Bacon , who did n't say the same thing . They call wealth the leech of virtue ; and tell how it saps and subtracts from what is best in a man . They warn you that glorious public gifts and benevolent or educational institutions ? they must have had our moderns in mind ? are but painted sepulchers , sacrifices without salt , soon to corrupt and inwardly decay . Also , they show how abundance , not want , is the mother of avarice , and that to carry a load of money is to carry a load of fear . It was the ancients who , to exhibit the cruel dulness of riches , drew the portrait of Plutus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a horror of sunlight , he sits on his ebon throne ; by his side Proserpina , not wooed but kidnapped . On one hand the Furies , on the other the Fates ; while from beneath the midnight throne gushes that river of sorrow , the Cocytus , whose source is the tears of humanity . Plutus ? what a symbol of the twentieth-century rich man with his twentieth-century trust ! In a manner as hit-or-miss as were our grandmothers ' rag-carpets , I have set forth the boneless weakness of young Mr. Rockefeller , and named its certain causes . As corollary thereto and speaking @#  | article , I am driven to say that he will do nothing with his heritage of a billion . For centuries , wealthy Venetians , dying , have left legacies to the pigeons of St. Mark . Those little fowls which the traveler sees fluttering in and out of the old tower , are among the richest folk in Venice . And yet what answer would the traveler invoke were he to ask , " What do they do with their big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do nothing with it . It is managed for them , and they eat its profits in grain without so much as knowing of its existence . What is true of the rich pigeons of St. Mark will have its partial parallel in the future story of young Mr. Rockefeller . He inherits a billion ! Had he inherited the Hudson , he would have as much control to regulate its current , depth and course . It is the second query that concerns us . What will the billion do , not alone with young Mr. Rockefeller , but with us ? It will do " business . " Corporations are a pet artifice of Satan . They so easily permit a man to escape with his conscience unseared , while enjoying the fruits of sin . The man only owns the stock and takes his dividends . If extortion or bribery or murder be committed in the production of those dividends , it is the company , not the man , that is guilty . The man defends himself ; he will show you how personally he has done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't aware of its action . All he did was own the stock and accept the dividends . Ay ! he will quote Scripture , as was done in an hour when thousands of pulpits defended black slavery in this land . Roundly , young Mr. Rockefeller 's billion ? which , as I 've shown , is to be as far beyond the touch of his personal command as the north wind ? will find investment in the bonds and stocks of trusts . Young Mr. Rockefeller , for the looks of the thing and to satisfy what fragmentary energies remain with him , may wear the titles of president , vicepresident and director in those trusts . The titles will mean nothing ; the presence of his name will have no effect . Those Juggernaut trusts will go on crushing , crushing , crushing , whether he be on or off the official list . Young Mr. Rockefeller 's billion will furnish ribs and backbone and wide jaws for many saurian trusts . These , being created , will follow the hungry purpose of their creation , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them taking more and giving less . One day the end , the inevitable end , will come . The earth was not made for trusts but for man , and in the last , rest sure , man will redeem his own from out their jaws . Speaking of trusts , I can not see why the very rich should either construct or foster them . The crashing finish seems so obvious and so sure . Even now the vast , dull public is beginning to stir and grope about for facts . It is learning that mere riches in a country do n't mean prosperity , and how the latter depends , not upon wealth , but upon its distribution . A community of one thousand souls and each with fifty thousand dollars ? an aggregate of fifty millions ? would be a tale to tell of a people prosperous . But a community of one thousand souls where one individual possessed fifty millions , and the remaining nine hundred and ninety-nine not one dollar among them , would mark a den where all the serpents of slavery , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You who read should study trusts , for the trusts are studying you . They are vines of rapacity clambering on the trellis of the people 's needs . They foster anarchy , prepare disorder , since to a majority of mankind they do n't leave destinies worth an honest working out . As I 've said , I marvel at the blindness of the trusts , and of the fat handful of arrogants behind them . Verily , there is an insanity of avarice that takes without want and seizes beyond power to enjoy . It is insanity ? as much as any that yells in padded cells to-night . In the raving madness of the modern money-rush , honor , conscience , justice , wisdom , prudence , all are trodden underfoot . The trusts go on and on ; they gather one million , fifty millions , five hundred millions , a billion ? giving it to  | one man ? and still charge crazily forward . There is no boundary to present voracity , no limit to the senseless heat for gold . The trusts have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luxury , into regions where dwell only anxiety and danger , and where no good thing ever walks . ' These creatures of a lupine avarice should take thought for themselves . They are so busy , dragging down the profitable hours as wolves drag down the deer , that they see not their own peril . They should beware . In their doctrine of " All for the trusts and nothing for humanity ! " they dig pits for their own feet . They deal with and defy no feeble race ? the Anglo-Dane . Revolution is its lesson ; it has ground dynasties beneath the heel of its hate ; kings have not dared to look it between the eyes in the day of its anger . The trusts are not discreet when they render desperate such a people . Young Mr. Rockefeller 's billion will head the trust procession . He will ride with it and hold such relation toward it as a raja in his howdah holds.toward the elephant that carries him . He will take his ease on silken cushion while some mahout of a manager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , he is not to be envied . Money does n't mean happiness ; poverty does n't mean grief . Some of the world 's most unhappy men and women are worth a million . Money is no guarantee ; a man can be unhappy for so many reasons , and happy for so few . Also , Third Avenue laughs oftener than Fifth . Young Mr. Rockefeller , at ignorant ease in his howdah on the back of his billion , his mahout manager in control ? ankus in hand , knees jammed close behind the great ears of that billion ? will lead the march of elephantine trusts . And because in the laws of the natural it has been written that what we most fear we shall most invite , those trusts in their marching will provoke that Public Ownership of railways , and streetcars , and gas , and electric lights , and water , and telegraph , and telephone , from which they shrink . What will young Mr. Rockefeller do with his billion ? He will do nothing . But the billion , moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a voracious dishonesty , will keep on devouring men until its victims take to that Public Ownership of public utilities , which is as the sword and the shield proffered of the situation , for their defense and trust destruction .
