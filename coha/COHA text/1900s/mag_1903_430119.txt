 |p925  THE curtain screening the more intimate life and manners of the Turk was first lifted by the white hand of an English ambassadress . In 1717 Lady Mary Wortley Montagu went to Constantinople to fall in love with everything Turkish . In the warmth of her ardor she painted the East as the most perfect of countries . The climate , she vowed , was " delightful in the extremest degree . " Turkey was the country where she found " women the freest , men the most faithful , religion the purest , and manners the most polite . " If its beys , pashas , and effendis betrayed tendencies to an " amiable atheism , " it was only that they might prove themselves the better wits . This clever Englishwoman , to whom no subject was dull , was also " charmed with many points of the Turkish law ? to our shame be it spoken , better designed and better executed than ours . " Morality , iniced , in that " heathenish " country she found was at so surprisingly high a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For over a century and a half Lady Mary 's sprightly pictures of the life of Turkish women have remained as the true Western ideals of the mysterious East . In a , hundred and fifty years what changes ! The Turk is now become the " unspeakable . " Turkey is the nation above all others It which hands must be uplifted , eyes virtuously rolled , and the political garment withheld from compromising contact . Yet when one comes to know him , even a little , the Turk is found to be : : ether so very terrible nor so hardened in h : s brutality as we had supposed him . Whatever may be one 's personal conviction concerning Turkey 's deeds or her misdeeds , the interest this curious and fascinating country presents is perdurable . More closely allied to European sympathies and tastes than the more wholly alien races of China and India , Turkey is also compellingly attractive , and particularly to Americans , as still preserving to our eyes and ears certain vanished forms and customs . " Our private life must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , is the curtain that is rung down before the eager , searching Western gaze . Turkish interiors , both moral and domestic , are hedged about as by a triple wall . In spite of the innovations , changes , and reforms introduced by foreign models , the Turk continues to perpetuate , more or less unconsciously , the traditions of his fathers . To hold tight to the secret of one 's inner life ? this is in the blood of the Turk . Frankness is as foreign to the Moslem nature as is a subtle complexity of thought to the American . In these more emancipated days Turkish reserve is occasionally seen to lower its vizor . On the slightest suspicion of indiscreet intrusion the movable face of the helmet is , however , quickly sealed tight to its clasp . A Turk nowadays may speak of his wife ; he counts on your discretion to consider his mention cf her as unuttered.  |p926  MONOGAMY ON THE INCREASE IN TURKEY ALTHOUGH of late years , among Turks highly placed , it has come to be considered as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this laudable increase in the practice of monogamy does not tend to a complete emancipation from certain well-established Moslem traditions . The mention of one 's wife to a foreigner is nowadays made the easier when one may truthfully speak of her in the singular number . A Turk may , after some months of semi-intimacy , talk somewhat freely , indeed , of his domestic life , provided always his household is modeled after the European plan of life . The social line is drawn at the point of asking even a lady to call . Frequent visiting between European and Turkish wives , when these are in the singular number , is possible only after a somewhat prolonged residence and much friendly intercourse . To the casual visitor there is an unexpected embarrassment in finding almost all the Turks one meets in society married to one wife only . The singularity of this singleness is as trying , apparently , to the Turk , on certain occasions , as it is eminently disappointing to the European . " I do so hope the Minister of -- -may grant me the honor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the charming aplomb characteristic of the American woman . " F -- -Pasha would be too delighted , I am sure ; only , as it happens , his Excellency has no harem in the sense in which , I presume , most foreigners understand our word , " was the courteous reply of the minor official to whom the remark was addressed . " He has but one wife , as , indeed , we mostly all have . " " Has n't any one a harem ? " The cry was almost tearful . " F -- -Pasha has a great many children , " continued this disappointed investigator of Turkish customs . " Yes , he has eleven living . His wife is very fond of children . " " Is she Turkish ? " " No ; she is a Circassian lady of very good family . " " Ah-h , a Circassian ! She must be very beautiful ; the boys are so handsome , " the pretty American remarked in a mollified tone . From a romantic traveler 's point of view , if Turks persist in marrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least to find them marrying a Circassian slave was a trifle more solacing than to have found the single wife of correct Turkish descent . The young aide-de-camp smiled as he made answer : " Yes , you are quite right ; we mostly marry Circassians , and almost all our children are beautiful . " There are still enough harems throughout Turkey sufficiently equipped with a plurality of wives to satisfy the most exacting of travelers in search of sensation . Even in Constantinople there are pashas and effendis rich enough to keep up the old standards of Moslem marital pomp . The majority , however , of the upper ten thousand practise , at least outwardly , the European fashion of monogamy . A FINANCIAL AND A SOCIAL REASON FOR MONOGAMY THAT this fashion will continue and increase there is little doubt . Fortunes at best are among the most uncertain of possessions in a land where exile and banishment are as likely to happen as birth and death . The most extravagant gift with which a Turk may present himself is , therefore , a properly stocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a separate establishment . Each establishment must have its own slaves , cooks , and equipage . Each wife or odalisk must , if she be in the height of the present fashion , have her piano , her French gowns , and foreign tutors for her sons and daughters ; and she must , besides , be able to dispense a large and continuous hospitality , ever ready to return the Gargantuan feasts , the grand luncheon-parties , and the al fresco fetes which form the social dissipation of the smart Osmanli feminine world . No one of the wives may be slighted . Each has her legal rights , clearly , exactly defined by scriptural and accepted law . These rights are many ? so numerous , indeed , that after a review of them it is the European rather than the Osmanli women who seem to be still in bondage . As no Turk can with safety withhold from his wives their enforceable rights , he naturally thinks many times before burdening himself with several . Unless his fortune be unusually large , he contents himself with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ideal marital state . The rich young Turks , also , have traveled ; they have seen the young girls and the clever married women of France , Germany , England , and Austria . On their return to their own country they feel the loss of such stimulating feminine charm- and of such intellectual comradeship . A whole harem of beautiful women is not as satisfying as is the company of one woman who may be a companion as well as mistress and wife . The young Turk is also in his turn an imitator , a student of foreign ways , of life , and of manners . The European , he notes , has ( at least , at one and the same time ) but one wife . But this single wife is surely better than many , for he may present her , introduce her , she may go everywhere , even do everything , in matters of pleasure or sport , that he does . The European or the American wife is not one wife ; she is a hundred . She multiplies herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to have but one wife is at once more chic and more amusing . But where will the young Turk find such an one among the young Turkish maidens suggested to him by his parents ? These young girls will have been well brought up according to the Turkish standards of education . These standards are based , however , upon more or less harem , not Continental , matrimonial modes of life . Will he look among the beautiful Circassians , whose loveliness is still , as every Turk knows , as easily to be purchased as is a new thoroughbred ? Beautiful , even clever in her own way , as the chosen Circassian may be , still the purchased woman represents the old conditions , the old harem , demoralizing , stupefying , unregenerate conditions . THE ADVANTAGES OF MARRYING A SLAVE FOR various and excellent reasons , however , beautiful slaves , Circassians or Georgians , are still often preferred as wives by Turks of good standing to the free maidens of their own race . Marriage with a Turkish young girl is almost as expensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are lavish sums necessary for the giving of the numerous wedding presents . The length and expense of wedding festivities themselves might well daunt the stoutest heart . Marriage with a slave , on the contrary , entails no greater outlay than the purchase-money . If chosen from the household of a great lady , such a wife stands as good a chance of being well educated and well bred as a high-born Turkish maiden , for the feminine heads of the best households take great pride in the training and education of their slaves , the more beautiful among them receiving a proportionately higher degree of ewer The Turk who mimics a slave marries no one else . The dreaded specter of the mother-in-law is one be need never fear . The bride 's family , having been convenieody lost asd forgotten many years before , whenever present itself at the right moment for slaking trouble . Once the slave is legally married , she takes her place , with all the social rights and privileges of an Osmanli wife . The true family life of the Turk begins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more wives . THE MODERN TURKISH GENTLEMAN MEANWHILE , among the Turkish men , as every one knows , the transformation of the exclusive Oriental into the accomplished European is already become the universal pattern of a Turkish gentleman . Whatever his party , whether he belong to the old or the young Turkey party , the Turk of any pretension to style or to social state clothes himself in certain of the European modes of thought , as he does , sartorially , in European dress . Whatever the laws governing the standard of manners in Turkish life may be , their results prove them to be beyond criticism . The Turk has not only perfect manners , but he also has this peculiarity among other Eastern nations : however lowly his birth , once he has " arrived , " he is transformed into an aristocrat of deeply inrooted conservative tendencies , who yet presents , outwardly , a most engaging , sympathetic plasticity . Those whose lineage has ancestral distinction reveal a most engaging social equipment . " Whenever I want to talk to a man who understands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a beautiful woman recently to me in Rome . " He is as clever as a Frenchman , as versatile as our American men , and he has the sympathetic quality of a woman . "  |p928  A PREMIUM ON DOMESTIC LIFE DOMESTIC life , our writers would have us believe , is beginning to be one of the lost joys among Western nations . The pace of our feverish , strenuous , excited existence is too rapid to give time for the quieter , duller tread about the family hearth . In Turkey the charms and pleasures of family life are not only enjoyed to the full : they are the more relished because of the comparative dullness of all outside pleasures . Outside of his home , unless he belongs to the court , to the army , to the navy , or to the civil service , a Turk in good standing has few occupations save that of a man of family . His religion forbids him to drink or to gamble ; to dance is to lower one 's self to the rank of slaves ; theaters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unknown to the Turkish world . For the man who must live without clubs , golf , or the shooting of big game ( the Turk of to-day is not universally a sportsman ) ; who may travel only after having obtained royal permission ; whose taste for art , as we understand the word , is as yet comparatively undeveloped ; who , by virtue of the peculiarities of his climate and the laws of polite living among his people , can therefore neither drink himself to death nor go to the North or to the South Pole in search of adventure ? what sort of life is there left for such a man to -- lead ? As it is in the nature of man to kill something , the Turk has made a fine art of killing time . Between his womenkind and his kaif , the Turkish equivalent for ( lake far niente , he manages to extract a certain amount of delicate and exquisitely satisfactory enjoyment out of what we more actively veined races call the game of life . From the point of view of its being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and governmental circles , is a failure . The struggle , the zest , the eager intensity with which life is lived in certain European countries and throughout America , stops short of Turkish frontiers . TURKEY is as democratic as America . There is no hereditary nobility in Turkey ; there is no ruling class ; there is no aristocracy , in the true sense of the word . A man of low origin , even a slave , by his abilities , good looks , or through the intrigues of some influential friend or relative at court , may become a high court official , a minister of the Sublime Porte , even Grand Vizir . The history of Turkey teems with sudden , amazing turns in the wheel of fortune . The careers of some of her greatest statesmen , generals , admirals , and vizius have been as replete with adventure and as richly colored with wondrous episodes as any hero Dumas or Victor Hugo ever imagined . So democratic a rule of social and political life has brought about the inevitable results . All Turkish society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excitement , and intrigue . Since the lowest may aspire to the highest place , every Turkish youth dreams of being governor over some rich province , minister , or , at the very least , ambassador to some of the great capitals . The court is the center of this hotbed of intrigue . All the rays of hope converge toward the central source of patronage and preferment . FoR the common people throughout Turkey , life has changed but little . The Turkish laborer , artisan , mechanic , farmer , is very much the same Turk he was twelve and a half centuries ago . The . greatest change that has come to the poorer classes is that in our day their children are compelled to learn to read and write . These workers , toilers , and mechanics are full of the same superstitions , they are controlled by the same traditions , and they are also as deeply religious , as were their ancestors who swept the Asian plains . Put a sword in their hands , and they would be miraculously changed into fighters and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i fighters possessed by a fierce and living faith . The religious fervor is as strong as are the practices of religion ; for the people continue with undiminished ardor the strict observances of their faith . The common people are among the last of the truly devout believers , and the religion of Mohammed exactly suits the character and taste of the pious , fervent Turk . No other faith can hope to reach every fold of a nature the  |p929  base of which is still preeminently at once warlike and sensuous , fierce yet tender , superstitious yet rationable , proud and yet patiently humble . The Koran is all the literature and Bible felt to be necessary to millions upon millions of minds and souls who are still in what may be called a state of high susceptibility to spiritual belief . The millions controlled by this monotheistic form of religion as revealed by Mohammed stretch from the interior of western and southern Africa to India , and from Arabia to the confines of Turkey in Europe . The recent amazing spread of Islamism throughout middle and southern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and development in that agitated continent . Black races , as well as the Persian , Turkish , Arabian , and the millions among the Indian peoples , have fallen utterly captive to the genii , to the angels , to the pens , to the fates , to the glory , of the Mohammedan heaven , to the mitigated hell torments , to the awful doom of predestination , to the rapturous certainties of resurrection , and to the assured immortality which the Koran , to its believers , reveals with so clear and certain a voice . As his Koran teaches him to be kind , patient , humane to animals and to his poor , to be hospitable , and to believe solely in one God , and Mohammed his Prophet , and to serve his Khalifa ( Sultan ) as he would Mohammed , we find throughout Turkey a whole people amazingly kind , courteous , hospitable ; a people needing no society of prevention of cruelty to dumb beasts , no almshouses or poor rates ; few perverts to other religions ; and toward their great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cruel or kind , behold a people submissive and humble , and yet full of the dignity that comes of a great patience and of a profoundly loyal nature . THE TWO SYSTEMS OF MOHAMMED THE Koran has accomplished this and similar results upon widely diverse peoples by means of two systems . Each of these was employed by Mohammed in the elaboration of his new religion . One of these systems was based upon his discovery of the fact that to govern many men of many minds a religion , while it may be a resume of many other religions , as was his , yet must be one the very simplicity of which comes as a novelty . The second of that remarkable man 's systems was the building up of his moral and civil laws on the theory that to guide certain races you must make due allowances for the influences of climate and customs . Mohammed , for example , did not invent polygamy . He merely legalized prostitution . He made the wild , the savage men of his time , as well as the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sexual tie , conform to a rule of life which should make a man responsible for his acts . By having his wives and slaves under his own roof , the Mohammedan husband became the protector of the women who ministered unto him . As father , also , the duties and responsibilities of the husband and master were extended to the offspring of both sorts of unions . To such unions very strict limitations were made . No Mohammedan legally may have more than four women , whether as wives or as concubines . WOMEN 'S RIGHTS IN TURKEY THE rights of women in Turkey were clearly defined some twelve centuries before Christian Europe or America had seen fit to grant either divorce or suitable alimony to women . While a Mohammedan may have one or four wives , as with each or all of his wives , should they be free maidens , he receives a dosTy , one half of such dowry is set aside . In case a husband repudiates his wife , this part of the dowry is returned with her to her father 's house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , while a Mohammedan has the right to divorce his wife for causes which would seem flippant even in Dakota , a Turk thinks twice before be goes to the extreme of repudiation . No. no ; divorce in Turkey is not popular . In all my acquaintance I do not know one who has divorced ! was gravely stated by a Turkish friend when this most excellent Moslem prohibitive law against impulsive divorces was under discussion . For a man to send away his wife that he may be freed from her , even take another in her place , is not an unknown masculine infirmity even in Christian Europe . To return her clinking to the tune of half  |p930  of her own dowry , this is an impending calamity to avert which many a Turk turns twice on the hard bed his rueful marriage has made for him . There has been a vast amount of pity wasted upon the Moslem woman . It may surprise even the woman suffragist to learn that the laws of Mohammed confer upon women a greater degree of legal protection than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Only the more recent liberties and protection granted to married women by the laws of divorce and the exclusive property rights now in force in the United States can be properly compared to those in force in Turkey . Under the Moslem laws the provision for securing to the wife the free and uncontrolled possession of her property is minutely stipulated in the marriage contract . A suitable sum is also arranged for her maintenance in accordance with her husband 's rank . A REVOLUTION WROUGHT BY WOMEN 'S FASHIONS THE Turkish ladies who come to shop in La Grande Rue , to buy innumerable articles at the Pera Bon Marche , are working a silent , unconscious , but none the less amazing revolution in Turkish life . Fashion is the greatest of all subverters . Since Abdul Aziz brought from France French notions about women 's dress , and introduced to the women of his harem the intricacies and refinements of Parisian costumes , the tastes and desires of Turkish women quite insensibly have begun , in their turn , their retroactive influence upon Turkish life and finance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oriental . With men as well as women the adornment of the person has been for long ages a cult , a social rite . Along with the influences wrought upon sensuous , semibarbaric natures by an Eastern sun and the intense Eastern light , under which the strongest colors pale and fade , the Turks , in common with all Eastern peoples , have long associated magnificence in apparel with high rank . Gorgeous as were the jewel-studded , lavishly embroidered Turkish costumes worn by the richer classes in former days , they had this one inestimable advantage ? they were always in the highest fashion . It took a new reign to bring in a new cut of a pasha 's mantle or gem- studded turban . As for the women , the harem of the Mohammedan had its own peculiar economies ; for within its mysterious walls it was the women who were changed or put aside , and not their dress . The busy brains of the men-milliners in the Rue de la Paix have effected a bloodless revolution . The Moslem rule of centuries , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nous avons change tout cela , " the Frenchmen must cry gaily , in a chorus , as they finger the checks signed by strange , undecipherable , but very negotiable Turkish signatures . Boxes upon boxes of gowns , ball-dresses , dinner-dresses , tea-gowns , shoes , slippers , the finest hosiery , the costliest lace-trimmed underwear ? these are sent via the Orient express or steamers from Marseilles , to be deposited at the harem doors of wealthy Turkish signors . With the coming of these boxes , the signor has made a discovery . It is now the dresses which change every year , and not , alas ! his odalisks . The bey or pasha who twenty years ago could have had two hundred women in his harem , and still know himself to be a rich man , now feels himself poor with but a single wife and her daughters to clothe , and a mere handful of Jarigas ; but these , of course , do n't count , for slaves still wear ? Allah be thanked ' . ? the comparatively cheap Turkish dress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as you pass Turkish ladies , you would not , you could not , suspect the full nature of their complete transformation in the matter of costume . It is still good form even among the smartest Turkish ladies to wear , when abroad , their feriajeh . But the cloak which is gown and inverted cape in one , the upper part of the garment being drawn over head and ears , this primitive domino cloak , still universally worn by the less wealthy classes , whether walking or driving , has undergone a very sensible amelioration . Instead of the disfiguring drawing-string pattern , the smart feridjeh is now simply a very well cut long silk cloak , rather loose-fitting , but still all-enveloping . The ladies whom you pass in their well-turnedout coupes , with only the black man 's face beside the liveried coachman on the box to remind you it is not a strictly European establishment ? these ladies have commonly  |p931  chosen dark , somber colors for their silken cloaks . Their veils are no longer the older-fashioned yaskmak , that famous veil that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most betraying and most seductive in a woman 's face , her eyes ; this bewitching mask is now chiefly relegated to the poorer classes and to negro slaves . The fashionable Turkish veil of our own time is a true veil . A large square of lace . black or white , covers completely both head and face . The thickly woven mesh falls below the chin . In such a disguise as that provided by the silken cloak and the veil-wrapper , who could divine the dainty French bodice , with its web-like embroideries and lace incrustations , or the tight hip-skirt , with its flying base , or the ropes of pearls , or the costly uncut emerald or diamond necklace ? For a shopping tour , the wife of the wealthiest pasha dons the skirt and shirt ( the blouse ) that has become as generally the accepted utilitarian feminine costume as has the republican sack-coat and trousers for men , whether sovereign or clerk . This skirt and shirt are worn beneath the cloak . In the European shops of Pera , if you use your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work upon the loom of Turkish life will confront you . The young daughters of matronly ladies whose half-open feridjehs betray them as wearing smart Parisian gowns and highheeled shoes , dames who doubtless began their harem life in gauze chemisettes and sagging Turkish trousers ? the daughters of these ladies you may hear stammering a few words of French or English . If none but women happen to be within the shop , the girls ' fair , fresh faces will be , and will remain , unveiled . It is only after marriage that the face of a Mohammedan woman must be unseen save by one man . her husband . and by the eyes of her own household . The education of its women is another among the many innovations that are being introduced among the more highly born or highly placed Turks . It is the mothers of a race who alone can educate , can transform its sons and daughters into the higher types of men and women . MOHAMMED 'S FAIRNESS TO WOMEN SLAVES are no less provided for , under the laws of Mohammed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is always a slave , if she bear a child to her master must be maintained for life , or she must be set free and married . Her children , whether she be bond or free , have equal fights with the children of the legal wife or wives of the household . A Moslem , in other words , virtually can have no sexual relations with any woman without assuming full responsibilities for such intimacy . Other customs , traditions , and ceremonies give to a Moslem woman a fixed and independent position within the walls of her own home . The ! mama " , or first head wife , is virtually the head of every Turkish household . She is also likely to remain such , as no Turkish parent will , as a rule , consent to see his daughter subject to a first wife . For a second wife , in the rare cases where such are chosen , the husband desirous of extending his sphere of bondage must , as a rule , either take an odalisk or'go without . Such a wife , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ semiservitude and obedience to the hanoum . Mohammed borrowed most of his laws from Moses . He added certain humane clauses that place him among the most just and sympathetic of all masculine reformers . For the slave and the free , for the divorced and the widowed , he provided laws securing to woman in every stage of life maintenance and support according to the state and means of her lover or husband . He understood women well enough to know that for a wife to have a rival in the house is not so bitter or so dangerous to the well-being of that household as to have the husband unfaithful abroad . The rivalries between Moslem wives are trials that may the more easily be borne , since the rights of each wife , even to the point of her share in the society of the master , are fixed by law . Mohammed thought so well of women that he could not have enough of them , even in heaven . So far from his denying them the possession of souls , the Koran distinctly asserts that women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but that they shall also suffer punishment for their evil ones . The Mohammedan women , it is true , are relegated by the prophet to a separate heaven from that open to their fathers , brothers , and husbands . But as these latter are promised the perpetual enjoyment of  |p932  the paradisiacal women , ? a particular species specially manufactured for the reward of the good and brave among men in the celestial regions , ? Mohammed 's knowledge of the sex may have suggested the inspiring thought that the promise of a continuation of the harem conditions ? that of looking at happiness through another woman 's eyes ? might not be considered as conducive to a satisfactory state of beatitude . SLAVES AND SLAVERY IN TURKEY THE system of slavery exists in the imperial harem , as it also exists throughout the whole of the Turkish Empire . The public sale of slaves has been suppressed , in deference to European prejudices . Those rows of human merchandise , whose black and white skins , whose crinkled and blond tresses , were formerly as much a part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the necklaced buffaloes or the stately camel trains , those groups of Abyssinians , Georgians , Circassians , and Greeks , have been removed from the public gaze , only to crowd the thicker more secret places . The institution of slavery is as unjustifiable under Moslem law as was our own slave-trade , in our Southern States , contrary to the spirit and teaching of our Constitution . To quote a recent English writer , " Slavery as now practised in Turkey is in direct contravention of the law of Islam , which only recognizes as legitimate property non-Moslems who have fallen into the power of true believers during war . " Circassians are not nonMoslems , nor are they spoils of war . They are Islams , whose faith is as pure as that of the hardened parents who deliberately barter their children 's beauty for money , and as that of the slave-dealers who crowd their fragile human merchandise into miserable little vessels in the depth of winter , that they may pass through the Black Sea at the season when Russian men-of-war are not scouring the horizon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are likewise the greater sufferers because of our humanitarian insistence on the suppression of a trade from whose scourge England , America , and Russia have freed themselves only during the past half-century . But the new broom of virtuous reform seeks ever to sweep as clean its neighbor 's precincts as it has its own . So long as the harem exists in Turkey . just so long must slaves be procurable . The internal organization of the harem is as dependent upon the slave as was the Greek system of civilization upon its slave foundation . For implicit obedience and profitable service there must be a class of beings who will fulfil blindly the commands of the superior . Slaves alone can be forced to carry out , to the utmost letter of the order , the word of command from their master or mistress . The institution of polygamy necessitates a certain amount of authority . The supporting base of the polygamous structure is slavery . With that note of humanity which characterizes most of the laws governing the weak and the unprotected throughout Turkey , domestic slavery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Turkish world is tantamount to an enforced domestic service . Slaves are protected by laws as binding as those that give to Turkish women a legal freedom almost unknown elsewhere . After seven years ' servitude the female slave may claim her freedom . This she rarely does , save , of course , in the very exceptional cases where she has been treated with cruelty . The peculiar privileges in matters of education , as well as certain coveted social pleasures , and above all else the gift of a dot and trousseau at her marriage ? these advantages make the position of a girl slave in a good Turkish household superior to the conditions of life possible in the low-caste rank of her parents . To be chosen by a dealer for exportation , to be bought by a hanoum for her beauty , is as great a boon to a poor Circassian as is the possible grandeur of her future elevation to the position of wife or seraili . The training of slaves with a view to making a profit out of their attractions is not an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and accomplishments are always twin stars in the matrimonial firmament . A clever and beautiful girl slave , well dressed , well mannered , and ambitious , may bring , not only to herself , but to her mistress , a flat-  |p933  tering degree of success by marrying well . Ladies highly placed take great pride in their slaves ; they go about with the more attractive of their household , much as a monarch likes to see himself surrounded by officials of handsome and imposing appearance . Slaves richly , sometimes fantastically dressed , the better to show off their points , are a part of every large entertainment , fete , and festivity . The color and beauty of their garments , their grace , youthful vivacity , and gaiety , add not a little to the splendor of the feasts given by women to women in the Constantinople great world . A certain amount of freedom is admitted between mistress and slave , and the mutual devotion between the girl who owes everything she is to the owner who has given her the opportunity to show her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slave finds confidante , friend . and ally , this love and attachment is sometimes as touching as it is sublime . For women must everywhere ding to women at certain moments , whether they be within or without harem walls .
