 |p960  IN three previous papers ' I have discussed three phases of the outlook on agriculture as expressed by students ? why certain young persons desire to leave the farm , why others desire to remain or even to remove there from town , and what the agricultural college is doing for the farm-youth . It now remains to complete the series by a discussion of what the common school can do for the farmyouth . The agricultural colleges are now accomplishing results of great and permanent value , in spite of the fact that they are isolated from the common schools , on which good collegiate training is supposed to rest . The agricultural country is well peopled with good farmers , in spite of the fact that the common school in the open country has given them no direct aid in their business . Sympathy with any kind of effort or occupation , and good preparation for engaging in it , are matters of slow and long-continued growth .

You may call it spirit , Providence , or God . The name is not material . It is all the same . lation of cities . The country school is within the sphere of a very definite series of life occupations . We may well begin our discussion of some phases of the rural-school problem by stating two propositions : ( 1 ) education should develop out of experience ; ( 2 ) the school should be the natural expression of its community . The country schools ? I now make no reference to other schools -- do not exhibit either of these principles .

Arithmetic and like studies are not essentials , but means of getting at or expressing the essentials . The first effort of the school should be to teach persons how to live . The present methods and subjects in the rural schools have come to the schools from the outside . If we begin the school work with the child 's own world , not with a foreign world or with the child 's by the as conceived of or remembered by the teacher or the text-book maker , it is plain that we have by that very effort started a revolution . @#  |p961  In making these remarks , I do not lose sight of the fact that we are making distinct progress in these very directions , or that teachers recognize the need of a change in point of view . Perhaps the best way to discuss the- subject is to comment on what is already beginning to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are trending . THE STATUS OF THE NATURE-STUDY OR EXPERIENCE-TEACHING MOVEMENT EXPERIENCE-TEACHING has now come to be one of the conspicuous phases of current educational work , and it is an interest that also attaches strongly to the rising feeling for release from conventionalism . It is expressed in kindergartens , manual-training , and the like , and in that teaching of natural history to which the term nature-study is commonly restricted . Most discussions of nature-study consider only its technical phases as a school exercise , dealing largely with the subject-matter , and the methods of teaching . In such discussions it is difficult for the layman to catch the spirit of it . In reality , the nature-study interest is one of the expressions of an underlying and redirecting tendency in our development . It is unfortunate not to know its philosophy , for we miss its significance . The movement is gradually being accepted as a necessary and abiding direction in education ; here and there a teacher has worked the philosophy into practice , and schools have found a place for some expression of it in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now being reflected in syllabi and courses of study . More than forty States . Territories , and Provinces have officially recognized nature-study or its closely associated subjects . Sometimes this recognition is the publication of a State course of study . sometimes the adoption of a text-book or recommendation of literature , sometimes the dissemination of leaflets , or , again , the passing of a mandatory law by the legislature . State policies are necessarily conservative , so that this wide recognition means that nature-study is at last fully established in the public confidence . Perhaps the best treatise on naturestudy that could now be made for teachers would be a skilful editorial combination and discussion of the various printed courses of study . My present purl . however , is to try to determ:ne what are the current conditions and ter:den , as expressed by these syllabi . The discussion divides itself into two parts : 1 Objects of nature-study ; ( 2 I Method- . , f nature-study . SOME OBJECTS OF NATURE-STUDY A STUDY of the various expressions in the State and other syllabi as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summaries . Some of these conclusions may be stated as follows : It is the purpose of nature-study to develop the child 's native interest in himself and his surroundings . It proceeds on the theory that the best educational procedure with the young is first to direct the personal sentiments , powers , and adaptabilities . Of course we must consider not only what the child 's interests and powers are , but also how we can aid him to grow into a man ; but we can not annihilate the native adaptabilities without endangering the child . It may be even dangerous to try to suppress them . If these tendencies and sentiments are not directed , they are likely to develop into wild and wasteful energies . The causes of truancy lie in part in our over-diligent efforts to repress the native enthusiasm of the child . A good part of our training of children , I fear , is expressed merely by the command " Do n't . " Each truant is a problem in himself , but it is probable that most truants belong to one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vicious class ; ( 2 ) the low mentality class ; ( 3 ) the class that will not conform to usages and to customs , and in which the energies tend to run riot , or at least to express themselves in erratic and unconventional ways . These last are the true truants . They are repressed children . A child of this class may be likened to a jack-in-the-box : he is forced into conventional limits , but is always ready to break out in a way that brings consternation to the well-behaved . Nature-study , therefore , is to begin with general . common , normal , and undissected objects and phenomena , rather than with definition and classification , in order that the child may be developed natively . Definition and classification  |p962  are the results of the accumulation of experience . They are not primary educational means or methods . Definition always lags behind knowledge . It is likely to take the place of knowledge in the child 's mind . It did in the old botany and grammar and physiology . As soon as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definition , we take away the life , spontaneity , and enthusiasm of it . Definitions are for mental guidance after experience has accumulated , and they become more exact with the maturity of the person . No doubt we have over-defined the subjectmatter in our text-books . Nature-study is coming more and more to be an out-of-door subject , for the child 's interest should center more in the natural and indigenous than in the formal and traditional . It is not our sphere to live chiefly in buildings . Nature-study began very largely with object-lesson work . The objects might have been collected out of doors , but they were taken into the school-room to be studied . This was a distinct advance over the older type of object-study , because it tended to substitute natural objects for artificial and geometrical and unpersonal ones ; but it did not develop into true nature-study until a distinct effort was made to study the objects and the phenomena just where they occur in their normal relationships . There can be no effective sustained nature-study when the work is confined in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from many parts of the country with the universality and unanimity of the nature-study movement , indicating the existence of a general feeling that the schools are not adequate and not vital . The nature-study teaching has introduced many new and significant phrases into the teacher 's vocabulary , as , for example , " increasing the joy of living . " " sympathetic attitude toward nature . " " increased interest in the common things , " " to train the creative faculties . " The keynote of nature-study is to develop sympathy with one 's environment and an understanding of it . The longcontinued habit of looking at the natural world with the eyes of self-interest -- -to determine whether plants and animals are " beneficial " or " injurious " to man ? has developed a selfish attitude toward nature , and one that is untrue and unreal . The average man to-day contemplat nature only as it relates to his own g or personal enjoyment . The end of nature-study is to devel spiritual sensitiveness and insight ; the fore , it must not cease with mere objec and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of science-teac ing . I think that I catch this note in the syllabi and books that I have examined . This attitude accepts phenomena as real , and regards what we call " progress " to be really such . It accepts the world as good . It does not depreciate the need and importance of introspection , hut regards introspection and meditation as exercises for a mature and maturing mind , and holds that such exercise is most effective when most closely related to experience . Nature-study is not merely objective if it is developed in the way in which it should be developed . If we develop first the meditative , passive , and subjective habit , then we are oriental ; but the spirit of the West is to live actively with the world . METHODS OF NATURE-STUDY A STUDY of the various statements in the syllabi of methods of nature-study teaching warrants a number of significant conclusions , some of which are as follows : The methods are coming to be somewhat concrete because the motive is being understood . The motive of nature-study work is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the intr duction of technical laboratory meth at a too early age ; it is revolt from t spirit of grown-up scientists as appli to elementary educational work . What method there is in the work characterized by spirit . It embodies t spirit of individuality , spontaneity . thusiasm . It is essentially informal a undogmatic . It arouses human inter The old educational procedure seemed be to try to make children as like as t peas . In fact , this procedure is still vogue , and this accounts for much of deadness of school work . Individual and personality , however , are the pri considerations in education , and the na-@#  |p963  ture-study method aims to develop them . It puts a premium on original modes of apprehending knowledge . It develops personal responsibility and initiative . In practice , nature-study develops many new modes of expression , as action , writing , speaking , drawing , color , music . That is , it develops the whole person . It also leads to a fine feeling for poetic interpretation . These ways of procedure tend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assemblage of classes . They break up the monotony and formality of the curriculum , and tend to give the school an expression of naturalness . They add variety and vividness . Nature-study should correlate and inoculate all school work . It puts a new motive and meaning into the school by making the school real and giving the teaching local application . Nature-study practice broadens the meaning of schooling . Consider the scope and breadth of the subjects that it touches : plants , animals , weather , the sky , fields and soils , health , affairs . The fact that so many subjects are touched is one reason why teachers of science are likely to disparage nature-study , for these teachers pursue one subject continuously for a considerable time and in much detail ; but the science-teaching of the college and the best high schools must not dictate the subjects and methods of the elementary schools . No one teacher is likely to cover all the subjects coming within the denomination of nature-study . The fact that so many subjects fall within its sphere allows of choice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significance of school . The nature-study method marks the final rise of the school-garden as a central means in elementary school work . This is likely to be the pivot about which personal nature-work revolves , because it is near at hand , concrete , and controllable . It is the laboratory from which all enterprises diverge . In time it will come to be regarded as one of the essential parts of any elementary school . It provides relevant laboratory work ; and no school , from the kindergarten to the university , is a good school unless it has laboratory work . Kindergarten-work , manual-training , nature-study , are all laboratory work . The methods of nature-study tend to connect the school with the home . They make schooling a serious affair . The school becomes a social force . Every teacher has felt that a good part of the patrons of any school look on the teacher with a sort of self-complacent and patronizing air , as if they did not take the teacher 's work to be serious or really important . They seem to accept it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I heard a school-gardener say that the parents in her district were silently opposed to the school . When asked for the reason , one of them remarked , " If the children go to school , we ca n't make them do anything for us . " That is , there are two opposed forces , the school and the parents . The school-garden and other nature-study work tend to correct this antagonism or separateness . In many cases the individual school-garden may be in the home grounds rather than on the school grounds . The school , the home , the community are only different phases or expressions of experience . The redirected school will develop the economic and social consciousness . We may sum up this review of methods by saying that the teaching begins with the actual , the tangible , the significant . We do not begin with classifications or systems , or with the idea of giving the child a complete view of a subject . We deal with the concrete . The pupil will gather experience and gain wisdom , and finally , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teach merely for the purpose of giving information : that can be got in a book . In the elementary grades in a country school , I think we shall do far better to teach the raising of a crop of corn , or the making of butter , than the principles of tillage , of soil fertility , or the theory of feeding cows . We should begin to teach by specific cases and examples . Possibly in the high schools we can begin to teach principles of soil fertility and cattle feeding , but there is danger of going too far in these abstractions even there . Some day the common schools will prepare for colleges of mechanic arts and agriculture as consciously as they now prepare for literary colleges . It is a question whether the proper demarcation between the common school work and the  |p964  college work will not then lie in the school dealing With actual problems and the college dealing also with the theories and the classified science . I think that the syllabi for agriculture in high schools err in covering the same ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . Probably they would do better to confine themselves more closely to special problems that mean something to the pupil and the community . It is not at all necessary that the high-school pupil should " develop a subject " or have " a body of knowledge . " Much of the present high-school work is far beyond the pupil . The people have always asked for concrete knowledge and training . It is a question whether nature-study and crafts subjects should be taught in the grades merely to illustrate or vivify some literary text or story . For example . is it worth while to exemplify Robinson Crusoe by studies of dogs and parrots and the making of canoes , as is now the vogue ? These exercises are really extraneous , after all , and a kind of acting . It is a question whether it is profitable for a mere child in the grades to build canoes unless the exercise comes naturally as a part of personal experience . The object-work to illustrate literature lessens and subordinates the meaning of the object ; and I can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on objects for their own sakes , and that have relation to experience , letting literature @#  |p965  be taught in some other way . We do not need any excuse for the study of nature . RESULTS TO BE EXPECTED FROM NATURESTUDY TEACHING PERSONS are always asking for the results of the nature-study work , as if they expect that statistics can be given in reply . They want to know how many teachers are teaching it , how many children are interested in it , how many school-gardens there are , how many syllabi are in use , how many pupils are enrolled , and the like . All this is well in its way , and is important , though the results of nature-study are not to be measured by these formal means , but , rather , by a general elevation in the mode and tone of the school , and in the point of view of the community . The school must be reorganized to meet the child 's needs . It must be simplified . Subjects must be taken out , rather than put in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point of view must run through them all , for it is a fundamental educational means . Most of the criticisms of nature-study are made against what are thought to be faulty methods here and there . It may be a question whether these criticised methods really are faulty ; but even if they are , and if all the work has been inadequate , nevertheless the nature-study movement will abide . It is one expression of the new education . If this experience-teaching is so fundamental , we must not look for results quickly . Spiritual movements proceed slowly . It may require a generation yet to get us out of the habit of teaching merely the names of things . It has been said that the current movement toward nature-study is misdirected , since all human activities , of whatever kind , proceed from experience . Language , for example , is only a means of expressing experience ; therefore Greek study is nature-study . However , the evolution of a language is the experience of a race ; what we now argue for is the using of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advise against the use of race-experience , as expressed in language and literature ; but education should begin with the person , which is the concrete . It is a fallacy to consider that naturestudy must be merely correlated with the present school subjects except as a means of starting and establishing its spirit .  |p966  Nature-study teaching is a way of conducting the school work so that it will have personal application and meaning . The school must be given a new purpose or expression . Our school systems are now really developed for the few ? for those who are good " scholars . " Other pupils are expected to emulate these few , whereas they may have a wholly different order of ability . When education becomes personal , all this will change . Well-developed experience with one 's normal environment is nature-study : it lies deeper than the adding of a subject to the course , deeper than merely to be " correlated with . " It is quite the oppo-@# site of " correlation with , " as if it were applied from the outside : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ APPLICATION TO THE COUNTRY SCHOOL JUST now nature-study is the steppingstone to the introduction of agricultural studies . This is an indication that it is a means of connecting the school with the real life and activity of the community ; but nature-study is a means of preparing the pupil for all kinds of school work and for all places , as well as for agriculture and for the country . It is a redirecting agency . In time , as the schools develop , we shall find that we shall not need ' to introduce agriculture as a separate study , even in rural districts , at least not below the high school , for in such districts the whole school effort will have an agricultural , country-life , or nature-study trend . Lest I be misunderstood , I will say at once that I am not opposed to the introduction of agriculture as a separate study into the elementary rural school . In fact , such introduction may be the very best means of bringing about the deeper and more fundamental re-directing of the school that is essential to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of agriculture as a present means to an end . We should not lose sight of the fact , however , that the schools are actually being redirected much more rapidly than those not engaged in school work may be aware . In time , the beginning schools will probably not teach any of the present-day subjects under their present names ; but this will adjust itself in the natural course of evolution . The greatest need is to reorganize the teaching of the subjects that are already in the country schools . Geography , for example , will deal first with the local country and its affairs . Of course the methods have changed greatly in a generation ; but the old geography was largely of the ballooning variety , beginning with the universe and descending through the solar system to the earth . All this is rapidly changing . If the school is in the open country , it may give attention to fields , birds , soils , brooks , forests , crops , roads , farm animals , hamlets , and homes . Geography can be so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to start a revolution in the agriculture of any commonwealth . Arithmetic needs redirecting in the same spirit . The beginnings of a new  |p967  motive in it are now becoming prominent . The principles of number are the same wherever taught , but practice problems may have local application . These problems have heretofore dealt with theoretical , urban , middleman , copartnership subjects , and sometimes have been mere numerical puzzles . It is significant that the arithmetic problems that the country child takes home do not interest the old folks . This is only because the problems mean nothing to them . Many of the problems of the farmer are numerical ? soil moisture , fertility questions , feeding rations , spraying , cost of labor and of producing crops , and all manner of accounts . Number can be so taught in the schools as , in ten years . to start a revolution in the agriculture of any commonwealth . Reading needs similar reorganization . This is everywhere recognized , and distinct progress is being made . It is not desirable to eliminate the customary types @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added to make the reading vital and applicable . It is not difficult now to find good pieces of English composition that deal with the customary practices and affairs of the open country , and that point the way to better things . Reading and spelling can be so taught as , in ten years , to start a revolution in the agriculture of any commonwealth . Even manual-training needs new direction as it touches country life . It may not be necessary to eliminate the formal exercises of model work and weaving and the like ; but some of the practical problems of the home and farm may be added . How to make a garden , to lay out paths , make fences and labels , are manual-training problems . How to saw a board off straight , to drive a nail , to whittle a peg , to make a tooth for a hand hay-rake , to repair a hoe , to sharpen a saw , to paint a fence , to hang a gate , to adjust a plowpoint , to mend a strap , to prune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems are bewildering from their very number . Manual-training can be so taught in the schools that are equipped for it as . in ten years , to start a revolution in the agriculture of any commonwealth . All such teaching as this will call for a new purpose in the school-building . The present country school building is a structure in which children sit to study books and recite from them . It should also be a place in which children can work with their hands . Every school building should have a laboratory room , in which there may be a few plants growing in the windows , and perhaps an aquarium and a terrarium . Here the children will bring their flowers and insects and samples of soil , and varieties of corn or beans in their season , and other objects that interest them , and here they may perform their simple work with implements and tools . Even if the teacher can not teach these subjects . the room itself will teach . The mere bringing of such objects to school would have a tremendous influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is for ; in time a teacher would be found who could handle the subjects pedagogically . Now we see children carrying only books to school ; some day they will also carry twigs and potatoes and animals and stones and tools and contrivances and other personal objects . My plea , therefore , is that the school accept all wholesome conditions in which it is placed , and that it begin with the sphere in which the child lives . The working out of this philosophy is naturestudy ( I know of no better term ) ; and this philosophy goes deeper than mere manual-training , or than arts and crafts studies , or than bare " self-activity . " Nature-study , as I conceive it . is not another subject , not something external or added to . It is a means of education . internal , central , essential , fundamental . In time nature-study and agriculture will be as much a part of the country school as oxygen is a part of the air .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
