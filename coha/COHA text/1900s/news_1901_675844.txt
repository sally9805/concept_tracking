I consider Mr. Shepard to be one of the ablest men in the city . He is and has been a Democrat at all times . He is a clean , honest man and he measures up to the situation in every respect . I think he is the equal of any candidate for Mayor ever chosen , and there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find fault with him . The naming of Mr. Shepard is a step in the right direction .

He has been on the right side of all political questions , and I. believe that he will be elected by a large majoritle ? ' ? A question was asked as to whether Mr. Shepard had made any pledges as to his policy . This aroused Mr. Shevlin , who said : " I am not the candidate . Go and ask Mr. Shepard . There are two great parties in this country , and I am certain that Mr. Shepard is and will be a party man .

If the people of New York want a well-governed city , they should have no hesitancy in voting for Mr. Shepard . " Mr. Shevlin was then questioned as to whether the action of the Democratic City Committee was final . He said : " There will be no change . The delegates will , 1 am sure , favor the selection of Mr. Shepard in the convention . " Senator McCarren said : " It was a great victory for the Brooklyn organization  --  a great victory . I think Edward M. Shepard is the strongest man who could be named for Mae-or . He is entitled to the support of every man who has good government at heart . " " You think that Mr. Shepard will be a strong candidate in Brooklyn ? " " I do , and he will be elected triumphantly , Mr. Shepard is an independent citizen . The nomination of Mr. Shepard shows one thing , and that is If a man is independent in politics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Chairman of the Democratic City Committee , said : " We will sweep the city by a very large majority . Mr. Shepard 's name has not been in the newspapers as much as Controller Coler 's , but we will sweep the city .

" Senator John McCarty of Brooklyn said : " There is no doubt that Mr. Shepard will be elected Mayor of New York this Fall . He is a strong man mentally , and from the political standpoint . His vote in Brooklyn will surprise many of the political opponents of the Democratic Party . " The question as to the comparative strength of Controller Coler and Mr. Shepard was discussed by the Brooklyn leaders , Mr. Shevlin said : " Why Controller Coler has conceded that Mr. Shepard was a stronger candidate before the people than himself .
