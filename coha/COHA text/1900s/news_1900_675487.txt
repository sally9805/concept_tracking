txt A statement that it would take three months to land 5,000 troops in China was denied at the War Department to-day . It is stated that 1 we can get troops to China long before Great Britain can , and that , in fact , the only powers which can get soldiers there ahead , of us are Russia and Japan . ' There are now at Manila two transports available for the transportation of troops . These are the Logan and the Warren . The Logan has a carrying capacity of 1,600 men , and the ' Warren of 1.200 . The Sher:man ' will be there on Thursday , and she has a capacity of 1,800 , makinf a total of 1 4,000 men ' who can be dispatched to China at once. , The Thomas , will be on hand on July 16 , and she can carry from 1.600 to 1,700 more . The Pennsylvania and Indians , which have been mentioned as transports , will be used only in case of extreme emergency . They are needed to carry supplies up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . be a very serious matter to endanger the carrying of supplies to an army of 50,000 men . There are , however , two large freight ships , the Flintshire and the Westminster , , , and if it became necessary to press the Pennsylvania and Indiana into SerVice for , the Carrying of troops , these two ships might be used for supplies , The Pennsylvania and Indiana are fitted up so that they can carry troops . Between them they could carry a regiment . It is estimated at the Quartermaster General 's office that , unless delayed . by typhoons , a transport could land its cargo of troops in China from Manila in . twelve days after word . was received to . begin loading the ship . It is assumed , however , that - the Government , if it is found . necessary to have a considerable force in China , will prefer to withdraw troops from the outlying sections of Luzon and other- islands rather than from the neighborhood 1 of . Manila , and this might cause a delay of a few days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The " reason for this , " said a prominent officer to-day , " is that it IS much safer to take troops away from the country districts than from Manila . The peeple right around Manila are the most 1 treacherous and hostile of any in the Philippine Islands , and the withdrawing - of troops from that section would mean an immediate uprising . It is different with the other sections . The robber bands could be allowed to practice their profession for a while . In a choice of evils , it would be vastly better to give the highwaymen a free hand for some time than to chance a rebellion in Manila and its outskirts . " The typhoons --  are the only cause of delay . - The big transports defy them , and in care of emergency they could be sent to sea in a typhoon . But the little vessels which do the loading would be swamped . It is impossible to load a transport while a typhoon is raging , and this has been the main difficulty in the way of sending the Ninth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breaking down of wires and other incidents of the storm , which made it difficult for them to pack and - get to Manila . The War Department , however , feels perfectly confident that it can have troops in China within a fortnight , or three weeks at the outside , after orders are . given , and that they can be the first troops to arrive there , barring . only the forces of Russia and Japan . In this case , instead of the United States being in the humiliating position of having to depend on other countries for protection , the shoe will be on the other foot , and Germany , France , and Great Britain will have to look to us . Two good animal ships are at Manila , the Port Albert and the Port Stevens . The former is with the Logan . Each carries 500 animals , and an abundance of wagons and storage . Forage enough can be taken to last 200 days . Gen. ' Chaffee , when he was at the War Department to-day , told Gen. Corbin that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the troops , indicating his belief that the campaign will be prolonged . He said that at Taint vessels were often frozen in the ice in November . Gen. Chaffee had a conference with Gen. Buffington . Chief of the Ordnance Bureau , and with Gen. Greely , Chief Signal Officer . Gen. Greely recommended Capt . Russell as Signal Officer , and Gen. Corbin directed Gen. to send Russell and a detachment of Signal Corps men with the Ninth Infantry .
