WE have been so long accustomed to think of Dante chiefly as the poet of The Divine Comedy , and of Shakespeare chiefly as the dramatist of the Playa , that we do not always remember that they are also supreme among modern lyric poets . There are two apparent reasons for this supremacy . The first concerns the Poet as Artist . Dante could never have perfected the ter= rima of The Divine Comedy , Shakespeare could never have elaborated the blank verse of the Plays , ? those Protean metres , each susceptible of endless variety in cadence , in sweep , in delicacy of modulation , in richness of tone , ? unless they had both been , potentially at least , masters of minor metrical forms . The greater includes the less . The second reason concerns the Poet as Man . Of all poetry , the lyric is the most personal . Through it the poet titters , without feigning or restraint , his subjective emotions . But the value of an emotion , for the purpose of poetry , depends on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or painting it may be otherwise , but great poetry inevitably presupposes greatness of character in the poet . He may have many flaws , ? sins , even , and startling limitations ; he certainly will not let himself lie measured easily by conventional standards ; but his greatness is essential , the one fixed fact in literature . Accordingly , there is no luck in the surpassing excellence of the lyrical poems of Dante and Shakespeare , nor of the lyrics of Milton and Goethe , ? the greatest characters after those that have expressed themselves through poetry in modern times . Let us glance first at Dante the Man . Fate gave him genius ; life brought experience : and he , by self-correction , perfected both . Commentators , in their effort to reconstruct the poet from his poetry , have almost made ns forget that lie was a man at all : rather was he , if we could believe them , a marvelously intricate mechanism for turning out literary masterpieces according to rules which these commentators have deduced from his works . Now , little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do know this beyond dispute , ? he was no literary formula . Historically , he came at the climax of the thirteenth century , ? that wonderful century , only to be matched in importance by the fifteenth and the nineteenth . It was the great Catholic century . It witnessed the Papacy at its zenith under Innocent III , the formulation of Catholic theology by Thomas Aquinas , the rise of the great ? orders , ? the Dominican to safeguard the faithful by persecuting heretics , the Franciscan to lead all men to Christ by following his example . It boasted its mystics and its logicians ; it built cathedrals ; it net forth on eight crusades ; it beheld the establishing of popular government in Italian cities , the Muirgeonings of popular literatures , the astonishing expansion of the great universities . Above all , it saw the death struggle between the Holy Roman Emperors and the Popes , ? the world their stake , ? which resulted in the destruction of both Church and State as the sole temporal head of Christendom . Into all these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speculations of the philosophers , into the antagonisms of popes and emperors , Dante plunged with might and main . He mastered not merely the theory of the mediaeval world religion and world politics , but threw himself into the civic life of his native Florence , where factions raged , and where to discharge a citizen 's duties meant to hazard property and life on the caprice of a fickle people . Coining of a well-to-do family , he enjoyed whatever schooling Florence then gave her youth , and he early , I conceive , outstripped his masters . Like most Italian lads , he wrote verses ; unlike most , he quickly proved himself a poet , for when he was eighteen his sonnet , " A ciascun ' alum presa , " won him a reputation among the chief poets of Florence . He fell in love with a damsel whom , after the fashion of his time , he never aspired to marry , being content to worship her at a distance , from his ninth year to his twenty-fifth , when she died . The commentators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this passion shut Dante out from all other thoughts , keeping him in a state almost hysterical ? now ecstatically oblivious to everything except the recollection that Beatrice had saluted him last week ; now plunged in gloom ; now fainting or seeing visions ; forever sighing and weeping ; and more than once stark mach . In his " little book , " The New Life , Dante himself supplies the outlines for this portrait ; but not to perceive that lie there writes as an artist , and not as a systematic chronicler , is to miss the key to The New Life and to him . Unquestionably , that passion for Beatrice was the chief experience of his youth ; and , on looking back , he omitted , like the great artist that he seas , all that he had done or thought outside of the orbit of Beatrice during those years , so that he created the impression that there was nothing more . So we most distinguish between the ideal world , in which Dante placed his passion for Beatrice , and the actual world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was really busy with many other things . Specifically what things , we can not say in detail . We know , however , that he was mixing with the best intellects of his time , studying , meditating ; eagerly taking part in the at-fairs of Florence , even enlisting in her militia and going forth to battle for her independence ; in a word , playing from the outset the part of a man hungry for life , impetuous , stern , of manifold capacities , and as far removed as possible from any abstraction or formula . Let us not think of him as the central figure in a Pre-Raphaelite picture , ? a soulful , esthetic youth , condemned to gaze yearningly at sad-eyed , large-jointed , wry-necked ladies , whose spirits and complexions seem sodden in opium . Pre-Raphaelitism had its charms , but it could no more interpret Dante than Pope could Homer . After Beatrice died , almost every authentic glimpse we get of Dante , for ten years , shows us a man seizing hold on active life with ever increasing energy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes on embassies ; he is one of the city priors , and a recognized // leader in one of the great political parties . He marries , and has several children ; presumably , he has also some bread-giving occupation . Then , in January , 1302 , while he is absent from Florence , his enemies , having got the upper hand , banish Ishii on a charge of barratry and falsifying , and ten weeks later they condemn him to be burned alive . Thenceforward , until his death in 1321 , he leads an exile 's life ; at first cooperating in attempts to capture Florence , then chafing because one possible liberator after another fails to come to her aid . Amid these perturbations , and in spite of wanderings which took him to almost every part of Italy , and perhaps across the Alps , he writes The Divine Comedy and The Banquet , and makes himself master of all the knowledge of his time . And to his learning he adds an intensity of observation and a breadth of reflection which had been united @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recall almost at random , these points in Dante 's career , because I believe it to be much more essential to know the tremendous energy of the man , and to see how in his character and genius he held a whole epoch in solution , than to be learned in his commentators . Only in this way shall we rid ourselves of the common notion that a great poet can not be a man of action , and we shall understand Dante 's lyrics better by perceiving that they are authentic fragments of a colossal personality . To be able to certify that a given poem was written on a given day in a given year , or to whom it was addressed , or what all its allusions refer to , is often gratifying ; but the matter of first importance is , how much of these poems is alive today ? how much of the eternal do they hold ? what message do they bring to your heart and to mine ? The approach to all the masterpieces of literature has become so clogged by the patient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climbing over or tunneling the Cordilleras they have raised before reaching the rich kingdoms where Homer or Dante or Shakespeare reigns . To be a scholar now is to read , not the originals , but the reviews of critiques of commentaries on the originals ; and yet the best advice is , Seek the original ? read it ? ponder it ? enjoy it ? absorb it ? find out what it means to you . What it meant to the poet himself or to his contemporaries we shall never wholly know ; for we can never reconstruct Dante 's mind or Shakespeare 's , or the age in which each lived . Many of the allusions , much of the spirit of that age , and the scope of the master 's genius , we can understand ; but still mode remains , and , unless evidence now unknown be discovered , will forever remain , conjectural . In the domain of conjecture criticism shifts its position from time to time , as an army besieges an impregnable fortress , attacking now on one side and now on another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . A beautiful Greek statue is slug up : while arclueologists are disputing whether it represents god , demigod , or hero , and who carved it , and where the marble was quarried , shall their uncertainty prevent us from delighting in its beauty ? And although it can never be established to whom Shakespeare addressed his Sonnets , or just how far The New Life mingles fact with allegory , have they no meaning for us ? Does it really signify whether Shakespeare had Pembroke or Southampton in mind when he uttered his passion in such sonnets as " When , in disgrace with fortune and men 's eyes , " or " Not marble , nor the gilded monuments , " or " That time of year thou mayst in me behold , " or " When to the sessions of sweet silent thought " ? Must we have solved the enigma of Beatrice in order to thrill as a lover thrills at the beauty of " Tonto gentile e tanto onesta pare " ? Let 00 emphasize this , because eru- 342 Dante as Lyric Poet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dealing with literature , and , indeed , with all works of art . Erudition continually thrusts upon us irrelevances whose only excuse is that they are facts . Philology sits in judgment on poetry . And since the authentic facts about Dante or Shakespeare were inventoried long ago , erudition offers theories , conjectures , plausible guesses , buttressed by many citations , instead of facts . II . Dante 's Canzoniere , or book of lyrical poems , contains eighty-six pieces usually held to be genuine , eight more called " doubtful , " and some fifty surely " apocryphal . " I propose to consider only the genuine , ? counting less than twenty-eight hundred lines in all , ? among which are fifty sonnets and twenty canzoni ; taking their authorship for granted , and making such comments on them as would still be pertinent even if Dante were not their author . In short , it is their substance and style ? questions of pure literature rather than of erudition ? with which I wish to deal . The first difficulty which confronts the reader of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in The Divine Comedy you soon find yourself entangled in a network of meanings and cross-meanings . Just as your mind grasps a thought , this suddenly dissolves into another , and this again is metamorphosed . It is as if , when you gaze into the translucent blue of noon , you could see , first , the constellations of the stars , and , after a little , beyond them , and lovelier still , angelic hosts , such as the old painters put in the heaven of their pictures . Dante intended this . There are , he said , four meanings possible in the highest poetry , ? the literal , the allegorical or mystical , the moral , and , finally , the anagogical . For our present pus-pose , we will not lose ourselves in the maze of symbolism : we will take the poems as they stand , and see what they mean to-day . For commentaries , turn to the excellent works of Witte and Fraticelli , those scholars to whom every subsequent reviler of Dante gladly acknowledges his indebtedness , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living poet in Europe and one of the foremost living critics , In Carducci 's monograph Done Rime di Dante there is a full discussion , based on the latest information , of the sources , composition , date , probable meaning , and style of most of the poems in the Canzoniere . Sig . Carducci discriminates so nicely that he thinks he can set down the order in which the lyrics were written . He assigns the first poems of The New Life , inspired by Guido Guinizelli and the popular poets of the third quarter of the thirteenth century , to 1283 and the next few years . Then Dante , feeling his awn genius , enters his second period , that of the " sweet new style " ( 11 dolce stil nuovo ) , which lasted till Beatrice 's death . From 1292 to 1298 Carducci discerns another period , which he subdivides into three parts , according as " natural , " " allegorical , " or " gnomic " tendencies manifest themselves . Finally , Dante 's banishment hi 1302 opened another period , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in him , while years and experience matured the sage and the statesman . Let us admit at once that Dante 's lyric poetry has the raw material from which such a classification can be made ; but let us be politely skeptical as to the probability that such minute dissection is right . To suppose that Dante , or any other true poet , produced his works after this orderly , chessboard fashion ? now all black , again all red , one month joy , the next month gloom ? would be to make that most mysterious of all creations , a poet 's soul , as Immdrum as a railway time-table. 1 // Before we survey the contents of Dante 's lyrics , let us examine for a moment his work as all artist in metre . He did not invent the forms in which he moulded his poems , but he so stamped his orignality on each of them that the sonnet , the ballata , and , above all , the cocoons , became through his genius new metrical instruments , capable of producing effects hitherto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been added to a primitive violin . While he ennobled these verse forms , lie showed how the Italian language could serve the highest purposes of poetry . There is a striking contrast between the metrical development of English and of Italian . English is rough rather than musical in sound ; it has few perfect rhymes ; its words , except in a few eases , refuse to be contracted or curtailed . How to get from such an instrument the delicate modulations that beautify the lyrics of Shakespeare , Shelley , and Tennyson , ? that was the technical problem for the masters of English verse . Italian stands as the reverse of all this . It is plastic almost to the point of fluidity . If a final syllable harms the rhythm , it can be elided ; if the first syllable interferes , it can often be suppressed ; if a foot or half-foot is needed , a suffix , of the required length , can be added ; even the central syllable of a word is not always safe from condensation . Of rhymes there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very genius of the language is musical , its prose having a dactylic flow almost as marked as the formal metres of its poetry . For improvisation , for sweet ditties and dulcet serenades , for folk-songs with their simplicity and their easy , haunting refrains , such a language could not be surpassed ; but could it be the mouthpiece for great passion ? Would tragedy not find it too soft , satire too flimsy ? Could it be trumpet , violin , or organ , as well as guitar ? Dante achieved this wonder He wrote sonic sonnets which not even Petrarch , coining after him Enid profiting by his example , haS rivaled . He raised the canzone to be the peer of the English ' ode . Welcoming difficulties , because he saw that to overcome them he must have control over every phrase , word , and syllable , wherewith to clothe his thought , lie experimented with novel kinds of metres and rhymes . The intricacies of structure which in English prevent the sonnet from ever losing , except with a few masters , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Dante resisted . Accordingly , he packed his canzoni with thought , firm of texture and polished until every syllable fitted irremovably into its place . Sometimes , indeed , he carried condensation across the border of obscurity imagine the terseness of Tacitus rendered still more difficult by the omissions and ellipses permitted in poetry , and you will get an idea . of his most compressed passages . His treatise on The Vulgar Tongue shows how completely Ile had mastered the theory of the science of verse , especially in the Renounce languages ; his poems prove that he could embody his knowledge in his technique . Dante gives no comfort to the idle singers of an empty clay , who pretend that technical knowledge and the file need not be included in a poet 's outfit . " The highest conceptions can not exist , " he says , " except where there is know-ledge and genius . " n " Never without sharpness of genius , nor without assi-duity in art , nor without practice of knowledge , " he says again , can one suc-ceed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folly of those who , with-out art and without knowledge , relying solely on their genius , set themselves to sing in the highest fashion of the high-est things . " In a famous passage of The New Life he remarks : " It would be a great disgrace to him who should 344 Dante as Lyric Poet . rhyme anything under the garb of a figure or of rhetorical coloring , if afterward , being asked , he should not be able to denude his words of their garb , in such wise that they should have a true meaning . And my first friend Guido Cavalcanti and I are well acquainted with those who rhyme thus foolishly . " And so are we , who have heard the follies of French Symbolists and of their foreign mimics gravely proclaimed as a new triumph in poetry . In Dante we find that rarest union , ? intensity of imagination and clearness of intellect . When Love inspired him , he wrote ; but the fervor of that inspiration did not prevent the working of his critical faculty , by which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Words . He seems to have held that our thought lies beyond our control , but that its expression depends on faculties which we may direct , ? on knowledge , taste , patience , and skill , which are greater or less according as we voluntarily cultivate them . " Speech , " he says , " is not otherwise an instrument necessary to our conceptions than is the horse to the soldier . " A memorable simile . The little singers of our day and of all days shun knowledge and dread criticism , and well they may ; for their verse-making is but effervescence . But Dante , seer and knower in one , could endure the most searching criticism ? lds own ? without chilling his inspiration . The analyses which he makes of each poem in The New Life , and his exhaustive interpretation of the canzoni in The Banquet , show critical talents of the highest order . Indeed , we almost resent his cold-blooded dissection of those throbbing sonnets to Beatrice , until we reflect that through his ability to criticise , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Italian poetry . He rescued Italian poetry from the doom of improvisation . The Provencal , lacking such a savior , had degenerated quickly , never to revive . Thus we can hardly overestimate Dante 's importance as a lyric craftsman . As such , he greatly influenced his immediate successors , and he has dominated the best Italian poets ever since . Shakespeare certainly ranks second to no other lyric poet , and yet his direct influence on English metrical development is scarcely discernible , ? his lyrics , like his plays , have had no progeny ; while Dante , both in his lyrics and in his epic , stands literally as the Father of Italian Song . Such was Dante 's influence on the structure of Italian poetry : not less elemental was his effect on its substance . His treatment of Love , the imperial theme of lyric poetry , illustrates this . Chivalry as an ideal partook somewhat of the feudalism and somewhat of the religion of the society out of which it sprang . The devotion of the Knight to his Lady went by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called worship ; for between them there existed , in theory at least , no personal relations . In fact , however , that faultless worship of the Knight for his Lady , untainted by thought of sex , had few votaries . As ancient as Adam and Mitt : was the love the Troubadours sang . " Galeotto was the book , and he who wrote it , " ? in those words Francesca da Rimini revealed to Dante the influence which had brought her and her lover to Hell . That sexless attachment of Knight and Lady , like its counterpart , sacerdotal celibacy , might have prospered save for one thing : in the one case Chivalry , in the other the Church , left human nature out of the reckoning ; and flax and flame , then and to-day and always , must burn when they meet . The sudden exalting of woman , commonly regarded as the chief product of Chivalry , had in essence a deeper origin . It marked a change in the ideals of sex that had slowly overspread Christendom ; nay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hea- // yen . The deification of the Virgin Mary typified the gradual recognition , unconscious rather than reasoned out , that at the very Heart of the Universe there must abide those qualities which snake woman woman . The Christian God , as defined by the theologians , whether he were worshiped as One , or as Three in One , was a masculine God . The Power personified in the Father , the Wisdom in the Son , the Love in the Holy Ghost , were still the attributes of man , and not of mankind , since they did not include attributes which are the peculiar endowment of woman . Motherhood , the most intimate and beautiful of human relations , had no recognition in that scheme of Deity . But instinct deeper than creed supplied the lack in the creed which theology had drawn up . In the apotheosis of Mary medieval Christendom made its most precious contribution to human ideals . But while ideal womanhood had already before Dante 's birth been deified , chivalric love had sunk in practice to the carnal level . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singer and his mistress , the Knight and his Lady , were not . And the poetry itself , naively charming in its youth , had become conventional . The old phrases and much of the old prettiness remained , and the metrical skill had increased ; but instead of many themes there was only ingenious repetition of one theme , ? conceits refined and overrefined , and , worst of all , the evidence that neither the poet nor his readers believed in the pure devotion which he extolled . Then Dante came , and into this ideal faded he poured that which first suffused it with new life , and then transfigured and sanctified it , until he had created a new ideal . Dante 's passion for Beatrice was genuine ; accordingly , his lyric poems to her vibrate with sincerity . Fortunately , he was spiritual as well as sincere ; and it is of great moment that he , the earliest master of modern poetry , should thus spiritualize the poetry of personal passion . Physical beauty remains of the earth , unless it be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form . Into his portrait of Beatrice he painted those attributes which never grow old , which could not be exhausted though every woman in the world possessed them ; and the mere description of them must have more and more meaning according as men see with the eyes of the spirit . To have converted the poetry of chivalry from being either a metrical plaything or an erotic ornament to such high uses attests the genuineness of his passion . But he ( lid more than this : he revived and amplified the mystical conception of Platonic love . In his passion for Beatrice ? as in all his other vital experiences ? he passed by a process of growth from the personal and concrete to the impersonal and universal . At first it was the real Beatrice , the beautiful and lovely daughter of Folco Portinari , on whom all his passion centred ; then , after she died , it was her memory that he worshiped ; until gradually , from a person she became a personification , ? the Symbol in Paradise of Heavenly ' Wisdom . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mightily by Plato in The Symposium , and so commonly misunderstood ? And now for the poems themselves . We find in the earliest of them a mystical view of love , which tends more and more toward the Platonic ideal , and which , after the death of Beatrice , when Dante writes avowedly in allegory , visibly merges in that ideal . As a youth , he had before him the beautiful canzone of Guido Guinizelli , " Al cos gentil ripera sempre Ansore , " in which mystical love is described with much philosophical finesse and much poetical charm . Among all the poems of that century , not by Dante , this is , I think , the most delightful ; and if it had here and there 346 Dante as Lyric Poet . a little more distinction of phrase , it would rank with the best modern lyrics . In it we have the two cardinal points laid down , that Love 's dwelling place is the gentle heart , ? " Love and the gentle heart are one same thing , " is Dante 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause from God , wears an angel 's face . Only a barbarian would undertake to degrade into cold prose the loveliness of the love poems in The New Life : no other medium than verse can convey the music of the words , the heightened imagery , the emotion which vibrates through the metre . We may , however , indicate some of their characteristics . First , the freshness of them ! They are the earliest blossoms of the Spring of modern Love ; and they glisten with the newness and the tenderness of Spring . For this vernal rapture we go back , in English poetry , to the Elizabethans ; but Sidney and Spenser drew from Italian streams which flowed from Dante 's fountain . Then , their blending of nalvet4 with knowledge . This strange power , Love , overcomes Dante it fills all his life , and transfigures the universe before his eyes ; he watches its influence spread , as he might watch with increasing wonder the mystery of dawn grow into the pageant of sunrise . But while his soul is thus enthralled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know the origin and nature of his new master hence that interweaving of passion and philosophy , in which Dante came at last to transcend all other poets . This blending reaches perfection in his descriptions of Beatrice , which rise higher and higher in spirituality , without letting us doubt that they apply to an actual woman . He reveals her to no by the effect she produces on those who beheld her , rather than by a definite portrayal of her countenance . Her eyes and her smiling mouth ( the two features through which the soul becomes visible ) , and the sweet dignity of her bearing , her expression , and not her physical mould , ? these are the outward signs of Beatrice which Dante describes . Accordingly , his portrait of her is at once actual and ideal : every lover who looks upon it believes that it was drawn from a living Beatrice , but that it can not possibly be true of any other than his own beloved . And then , how many chords are touched by the poems in The New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but also his own perturbations . Like all lovers , he pendulates between boldness and shyness . For days or weeks his one desire is to see her , yet when they meet his courage deserts him , he trembles at her salutation . Ile goes home to cry out on the tyrant Love who thus torments him ; and even while he cries out , he longs for a repetition of tilt ' torment . Like other lovers , he resorts to subterfuge , and pays such marked attention to another damsel that Beatrice herself is deceived into thinking that he has forsaken her . When he hears of this , he sends her a poem ( Ballata i ) in which he explains his conduct , and protests that his devotion has never wavered . The time comes when his passion is no longer a secret : his friends talk to him about it ; Beatrice 's companions question him as to its goal , and he pours forth the can ? zone , " Ladies , who have intelligence of love , " a passionate ode in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their comrade in heaven . Not long afterward the father of Beatrice dies , and for the first time the realization that Beatrice herself may die crashes like a thunderbolt through Dante 's soul . For him , as for every true lover in youth , nothing else can equal the dismay and agony which that possibility causes . Life and love are identical to the youth who loves ; how can he think of life without the beloved ? Only in the all-enveloping immensity of Death can the agony which Death inflicts be quenched . This sublimation of grief is rarely felt in later years , for experience teaches us that life can be lived , bereft of the beloved , or even lovelessly , and that Duty , Friendship , or Philanthropy may take Love 's place at the helm . This canzone , embodying Dante 's first premonition of Death , lifts his love story to a higher plane of significance by endowing it with that tragic quality which intrudes sooner or later upon us all . Dante had , in truth , already written two poems ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beatrice 's friends died ; but they are graceful and sweet , the utterance of sentiment , while this is tragic . And even after the death of Beatrice herself he speaks as one sorrowing , but not amazed , at Death . In the third canzone he pictures Beatrice in heaven , God having called her to him because he saw that this troubled mortal life was not worthy of such a gentle thing . But if we except the lamentation addressed to pilgrims who are passing through Florence , sorrow rather than anguish henceforth prevails . He suffers keenly , but he continues to live ; he strives for resignation , or at least for distraction , and is stirred by moral incentives of whose force he had not dreamed till now . The conclusion of The New Life contains further the record of Dante 's experience with the Compassionate Lady , who grieved at his grief and tried to cheer him , and so far succeeded that he found himself in love with her . A very human touch is this , bearing witness to the close resemblance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes back so vividly to Dante that he realizes that Sympathy , however sweet , is not Love , and can not replace the passion which Beatrice inspired ; and so he concludes The New Life with that famous resolve to say of her " what was never said of any woman . " These are Canzoni ix , x , and xi , Sestina i , and sonnets 22 , 32 , 37 , and 43 . Canzone viii refers to the Lady of the Casentino . I fol- Brief as is this analysis of the themes dealt with in The New Life , it will show , I trust , how wide their range is . Alike in the history of the poetry of the modern world and in the history of the ideals of love , they are of immense importance : intrinsically , also , many of them have never been surpassed , some of then , have never been equaled , by subsequent singers of spiritualized love , of beauty , and of womanly perfection . This cycle of poems in The New Life , although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is better known because of its sequence , its completeness , and the delightful prose setting , than all the rest , although among these are many magnificent poems , the fruits of Dante 's lyric genius at its maturity . There are perhaps a dozen which seem to belong , either in theme or in treatment , with The New Life ; then come the three canzoni of The Banquet , and finally some forty other pieces which have not been classified . We may mention first that strange group of poems r in which Dante inveighs against a lady who will not listen to his suit . They have shocked some of his critics and puzzled all , and many specious allegories have been invented to explain them . To analyze them we have not space here ; but in the briefest review of Dante 's lyrics they should not be passed by . For just as the poems to Beatrice reveal him as the youthful lover , so these show him to us loving with the full vehemence of his prime , and not at all resigned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who the lady was who has been called Pietra , quite without authority , and whether she was also the Lady of the Casentino , will probably never be known , but the poems add a whole pro- viiinteye. to our estimate of Dante 's personaMay we not be content to admit that low throughout Fratieelli 's nornbez4ng ( Can- meters , Barbiera , 1873 ) , which is the best in print , although by no means satisfactory . much of the Canzoniere has never been satisfactorily " explained , " nor can be , unless further evidence turn up , but that , nevertheless , nine tenths of it has intrinsic , vital meaning to-day ? Most of the controversies rage round insoluble matters . I care not whether the stony-hearted lady lived in Padua , or the Lady of the Casentino had ( as alleged ) a goitre ; what would it profit us to know the names of the grandmothers of the sculptor of the Venus of Milo , or of the musicians who played the shawms when the 90th Psalm was first sung ? The vital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " canzoni and of the canzone written in the Casentino is plain , and these poems all testify that no hurdling wrote them . Nor do I observe that psychology has yet contributed anything of value to literary criticism . Like pedantry , ? or scholarship , if the old name seems discourteous , ? it furnishes facts which do not touch the inner meaning of any art product . Suppose that we could , by some miracle of hindsight , measure after the psychologist 's fashion the emotions of Shakespeare and Dante , and that we learned that Shakespeare 's pulse rose three beats when he entertained an angry thought , or that Dante 's temperature fell three twenty-ninths of a degree when he thought vehemently of love : what would it prove ? Absolutely nothing as to the value of a scene from Timon or a sonnet from The New Life . Equally vain are the efforts , so far as I have seen them , of those critics who have imagined that by such devices they could fathom the mysteries of the creative imagination . Psychology bath its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are of them . Thirty years ago other critics believed just as confidently that they could explain genius by heredity . Returning to our survey , we can not but be amazed , as we get to the heart of one poem after another , by Dante 's inexhaustibility of thought , phrase , and metre . Judged merely by their number , the twenty canzoni are among the most remarkable evidences of poetic genius : but quality is the final test , and in this they do not fail . Not one is mediocre ; fully three quarters are superior . if Coleridge had produced fifteen odes equal to Dejection , we might have had in English a poetical achievement to set beside Dante 's canzoni . I do not imply , of course , that Coleridge 's genius resembles Dante 's in quality . But without frequent citations from the original , it is impossible to do more than speak of sonic of the obvious characteristics of such poetry . Lyrics like the ballate ? ten in number ? evade even description . Their beauty depends on the perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be described except by itself than is one of Shakespeare 's songs . The first two canzoni of The Banquet record the stages by which Dante passed from the love of Beatrice to the love of philosophy ; the third expounds the nature of true nobility . The remaining forty-five lyrics may be divided into moral , personal , and patriotic , according to their themes . Concerning Dante 's didactic poems in general , it may be said that , even to an Anglo-Saxon who has personally , and vicariously through Puritan ancestors , listened for centuries to moral preaching , they still have that insistence of truth which was old before Dante 's birth , and is born again whenever the youngest child perceives its meaning . In their intensity , they are among the few modern utterances through which the Old Testament resonance echoes ; but Dante reasons , whereas the Jewish prophet proclaims downright , " Thus saith the Lord ! " and awaits no reply . In these works , as in nearly all that he wrote , Dante was a pioneer . He tells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Italian , but that he chose to write of Philosophy under the guise of Love . deleted material however royally abundant is his treatment of others . In their capacity for passion the two poets were equal ; but Dante had a theory of life , the centre of which was Love , by which he came to test whatever experience , reflection , or imagination brought him . Shakespeare , so far as I discern , had no such unifying principle . The Niagara of life swept before him , and he sat upon the bank and strove to paint it as he saw it , ? incessant , vast , awful , beautiful , ? infinite in its momentary variations , yet apparently one and permanent : so he painted it , not reeking to put on to his canvas any questions of Whence , or Why , or Whither . Accordingly , myriads of men have had their characters formed by Dante ; I doubt whether many have been consciously formed by Shakespeare . I am not trying to compare these incomparable Two , but merelyto indicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the purpose of ranking them , would be as idle as a comparison of the Alps and the Atlantic Ocean ; the genius of each sufficed to symbolize life in its entirety . What abatement insist we make in our estimate of the Canzoniere ? Something , no doubt , must be deducted on the score of age , although Dante 's language has fewer antiquated words than Shakespeare 's . More formidable is his use of allegory ; for even when we have agreed to take what we can of the natural meanings , and let the gnomic and anagogical go , we should prefer to know all the possible answers to the riddle , and may feel a little aggrieved that we never can . That Dante sometimes exercises his marvelous gift for logical disputation beyond the proper limits of lyrical poetry , in which the main business is not to syllogize , can hardly be denied . So , too , we may justly object to an occasional display of learning , or to a passage obscured by too great condensation . But these blemishes occur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoiled by them . To complain that even he could not lift some of the intricate metres with which he experimented out of the region of artificiality condemns those verse forms , and not him , After making whatever deduction wo insist , an inestimable treasure remains . In the Canzoniere , the highest lyrical genius embodies itself in the noblest themes . Appraising Dante 's lyrics absolutely , for their contents and art , they belong at the head of modern poetry ; judging them historically , to determine their place in the evolution of European poesy , they have , like all of Dante 's writings , unique structural importance . By his conscience for form and respect for unity of theme and tone he belongs with the ancients , while by his treatment of the passionate and spiritual he seems strangely modern . He is the spokesman not of his own time and place merely , but of an entire age , of a complete civilization , which after six centuries of growth culminates before his eyes . And so his works embody that civilization , and transmit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as has perennial life . But it is his genius , ? the throbbings of his heart , the intensity and penetration of his mind , the mediaeval ideals exalted by his spirit , the terrible earnestness of his moral nature , ? it is Dante , the man , the person , the poet , and not his epoch , that lives to-day ; it is Dante , the passionate lover , that sings this matchless song to Beatrice ? " Tante gentile e tanto onesta pare. "
