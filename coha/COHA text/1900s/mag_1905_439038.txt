WHAT is History ? The thing we know ; the definition baffles us . But what is Truth ? or Beauty ? or Poetry ? The wisest have not yet agreed on a formula for any one of them ; nor is this strange : for Poetry and Beauty , History and Truth , spring from the unfathomed sources of life , from the mystery which , although it he for each of us the only vital reality , eludes all our research . But as we manage to live without solving the riddle , ? indeed , the acceptance of its insolubility seems to be the only solution , ? so we waive a final definition of history , and go on to consider some of its aspects . The present time is particularly favorable for a survey , because we have apparently reached a point where historians pursuing different aims are producing side by side , in mutual tolerance , if not in mutual respect . This is a hopeful sign . Progress requires variation ; orthodoxy leads to bigotry , persecution , paralysis . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in France , England , and America for more than a generation , and in Germany for two or three decades longer . It has passed beyond the tentative stage , survived ridicule and opposition , and risen to acknowledged supremacy . In its complete triumph there was danger that it might become a fetish . But now we begin to see that every method is merely a tool , and that the product of the tool depends on the skill of its user . No refinement of mechanism can take the place of human insight andcharacter . The results of a victory won by an army equipped with rapid - fire , long - range guns may sink into insignificance compared with what Norman William 's crossbows achieved at Hastings , or Washington 's flintlocks won at Yorktown . So neither Justin Winsor nor Mandell Creighton , enjoying to the full the advantages of the modern method , ranks with Thucydides or Tacitus , or with many lesser men , who flourished in the " unscientific " ages . Something more than a system goes to the making of great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which everything human rests is the beginning of wisdom . German historical students , under Ranke 's lead , had firmly established themselves in the scientific method , when the general adoption of the doctrine of evolution forced historians everywhere to take a new point of view . To trace causes and effects had long been their purpose ; now they saw that the principle of growth , or development , was itself the very rudder of causation . They proceeded to rearrange their material , and to rewrite the story of every nation , institution , art , and science according to this principle . No other formula has been so fruitful , or so universally applicable : nor do we now see how it can be superseded . To historians especially , the doctrine of development came as a revelation , which made the work of their pre-Darwinian forerunners appear as obsolete as the ancient religions appeared to the first , Christians . They felt the delight which thrills those who exercise a new faculty ; say , rather , the exaltation of those who dedicate themselves to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases , they strove by every means to magnify the difference between the New and the Old ; as if the New were wholly right , and the Old wholly wrong . This is a wise instinct ; for only when a novel doctrine or cult is pushed to its extreme can we measure its intrinsic value , and determine how much of its apparent strength is Inc ? to mere reaction or contrast . We now look back on the products of forty years of the modern historical school . Comparing them with the great works of the past , two facts strike us at once : there has been a gain in method , and a loss in literary quality . The gain in method shows itself chiefly in accuracy and in a studied impartiality : the loss in literary quality can be verified by tasting any average historical monograph . The scientific historian had formerly the same feeling toward the literary historian that the early Christians had toward the culture of Greece and Rome : believing that they themselves possessed the true gospel , they wished to show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pagans . History had come to be regarded as literature , they would leave no room for doubt that they regarded it as science . In the scientific world the view prevailed ? and it has not wholly disappeared ? that to write intelligibly is suspicious , while to write " popularly " is suicidal ; and this , despite the fact that Darwin , Huxley , Tyndall , and Mill ? the most illustrious men of science of their generation ? had set a noble example in clear expression . Historical students shared this distrust of literary form , and as their investigations followed the scientific pattern , their reports naturally took the shape of the scientific treatise . Several causes have contributed to make the scientific treatise what it is . First of all , it is usually written by an investigator or observer who has no aptitude for expression , ? for the highest powers of observation do not necessarily go with even ordinary capacity for expression . Next , the immense numbers of facts and processes discovered by Science during the past half-century have required the invention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a special dialect , which is often as hopeless for literary purposes as is algebraic notation . No wonder that men whose minds swarm with awkward vocabularies , ? formed , by a cruel irony . from mongrel combinations of the my beautiful of languages ( as if the Apollo lb vedere were ground into powder to null , stucco ) , ? no wonder that they distru-1 those who show ability to use the mother-tongue , which tends in a way to becon , foreign to them . Scientific men also scorned to suit their language to any persons except their fellow initiates , thereby illustrating that tendency to exclusiveness which appears in freemasonry , college secret societies , and sectarian mysteries . Nor must we overlook another very powerful influence . Throughout most of the nineteenth century the Germans set the standard of scholarship . The world has never seen other diggers so tireless , so patient , so zealous . They have made their minds , as instruments of observation , almost as precise and impersonal as a microscope . They accumulate facts by the million ; they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their devotion to truth , through their rugged honesty , they have worthily represented the great German race , which lags , on the political side , so far behind its ideals . lint to their scholarship , power of expression has been , it seems , denied . They have had to struggle against not only the difficulties inherent in the creation of new sciences and in the accumulation of knowledge , but also against the refractoriness of their speech . If a language be the expression of a nation 's habitual mental processes , German prose bears witness to a race which has had the habit of thinking widely and deeply , but not clearly . A German 's statement may be compared to a charge of birdshot , which scatters , and in scattering may hit the target , and much else besides ; while a Frenchman 's statement , like the ball of the sharpshooter , goes straight to the bull's-eye . All these various influences ? the scientific method , literary inexperience , contempt for unprofessional criticism , devotion to the new gospel , and zealous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea that History must be unliterary if it would guard its reputation for authority . The German practice of publishing doctors ' dissertations contribsled further to encourage the belief that historical composition meant merely the pitchforking together of the results of special investigation . These results were of ten valuable , but who could expect that young men of twenty-four or twenty-five , who had given little or no heed to the sooner of presentation , should write writ ? And having found that that sort of thing sufficed , they naturally were at no pains to improve on it in their later work . Nothing is more dangerous for a young man of ability than to suppose that the standard by which he wins his first academic success is final . For a good many years , much of the historical work produced in England and America smacked of the average doctor 's dissertation . Since the study and writing of History seem to be coming more and more to be restricted to university teachers , it is most inmorant that they should look jealously to the manlier as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for in fifteen or twenty years these candidates will themselves be t he arbiters of historic production . The opinion which many upheld that history is a science increased their desire to make it resemble the sciences in all respects . The question , ? Is History a science ? round which much controversy has raged , is not yet settled ; but it apparently has reduced itself to a dispute over terms . The confusion arises from assuming that a subject becomes a science when it is studied by the scientific method . But before History can be a science , men must possess the gift of prophecy . Your chemist or physicist deals with forces and elements which are absolutely determinable at all times and places , and under all conditions . Water will be composed of two molecules of hydrogen and one of oxygen until the earth drops into the sun . But the historian has to do with a chain of causation in which the chief elements ? the human Will and Chance ? are ab solutely incomputable . Will remains a mystery . We can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multitudes , nor can we set any limits to its activity . And so with Chance . After the event , it may be possible to trace the steps that led to it , but until it happens , no one suspects that it is near . Five minutes before Lincoln was shot , who dreamed of the calamity which was to shatter Reconstruction and alter the course of American history ? Cavour dies , after a brief illness , and the unification of Italy is permanently turned awry . Thus Chance mocks us . Our knowledge of all past history does not enable us to foresee what to-morrow will bring forth . We can generalize ; and many a historian mistakes his generalizations for laws , but they may fit no special event . Now the special events , due to the human Will or to Chance , make up History . Although you may have studied every recorded revolution , yet you can not foretell what peculiar turn the next outbreak in Paris may take from hour to hour : for you can not know beforehand how the persons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or on the masses ; much less can you predict what Chance may bring about . It would be idle to call arithmetic a science if twice two were three yesterday , four to-day , and possibly five or seven to-morrow . Yet similar variations are the staple of History . In human affairs , not less than in chemistry , given conditions would produce similar results , if you could get exactly the same personal ingredients . But this is impossible . SupposelMirabeau had not died in 1791 , ? suppose Robespierre had been assassinated in 1792 , ? suppose a stray bullet had killed young Bonaparte at Toulon , ? how would the course of events have been changed ! Yet if the study of History were a science , it would convince us that Alirabeitu 's death was inevitable , and that Robespierre and Bonaparte in the very nature of things could not die in 1792 . Manifestly , historians would be clairvoyants , as familiar with the future as with the past , the chosen confidants of Fate or Providence , if they could make any such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1792 , but to affirm that he could not possibly have died would be absurd . Yet until History can demonstrate the possible as clearly as the actual , it will never be a valid science . This does not , however , diminish its supreme importance , nor dull its interest ; on the contrary , the uncertainty enhances both . We are not to infer that life is lawless , because we lack the gift of prophecy . Will , too , has its laws , although we can not codify them . The historian 's business is to trace the sequence of cause and effect so that every event , every deed , shall appear inevitable . If he succeed in doing that , he should rest content , and let teleology alone . Were it not for Will , with its incomputable variations , mankind would be a sentient machine , and History would simply register the motions of automata . The consciousness of moral freedom alone gives dignity , charm , and significance to life . Although the fatalist may argue that this consciousness is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the practical man will accept at its full value the most genuine of his experiences . Accordingly , the historian must write as if he were an eye-witness of the events he describes , so as to reproduce the plasticity , the uncertainty , the impression of a state of flux , whirls belong to the passing moment . Like the dramatist , he knows from the first scene the catastrophe of the last , but , instead of telling the secret , he lets the plot unfold itself , as if it were being lived out by the persons in the play . This quality , one of the rarest , if it be not the very crown , of the historian 's equipment , gives not merely the certitude of veracity , but of life-likeness , which is the final test in reconstructing the past . So far as the historian treats his subject in this fashion , he allows full scope to the free play of will ; yet , as he really is not a contemporary , but a retrospective observer , he can also trace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fatal or inevitable nature . In other words , lie treats the Past as if it were Present , in his efforts to bring it to life , and he treats it as Past , in his efforts to rationalize and interpret it . So he is at once a Dramatist and a Philosopher . Needless to say , few historians possess these gifts in equal proportion , while many rouse in us the suspicion that they have never conceived of the Past as having been once Present and alive . They regard human beings as abstractions , or as dummies on which to drape their theories . In striving to eliminate the personal equation , whirls has an inconvenient habit of upsetting theories , they become impersonal : but as Personality is the very stuff out of which human . life and history are made , the more they get rid of it , the farther they remove from reality . In a perfect history we should have , as in Hamlet or Othello , the motives , the strokes of chance , and the resultant action , so revealed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for its information , a third for its philosophical bearing ; for it would mirror the universality of human experience . An immediate result of the acceptance of evolution was the spread of fatalism . Science could finally demonstrate that rigid laws govern the material universe , including the bodies of men . By implication , man 's will and spirit were equally fate-bound . Historians , imbued with this conviction , naturally ignored the individual , and devoted themselves to tracing the operation of laws in the development of nations and institutions . Great men seemed to them " negligible " quantities . Slowly , however , a change has come about . Recognition of the omnipresence of law has not lessened , but there has grown up what I may call a commonsense view of human freedom . The will is recognized as a force so mysterious and unpredictable that , though it doubtless obeys laws which we have not yet defined , still , for practical purposes , we must regard it as free . Thus Personality is coming again into the foreground of history . This involves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ described as alive and concrete , with individual flavor , and surprises , and not as abstract and mechanical . liv another natural process , History has come back to literature . The assumption that the historical monograph , being a " scientific " product , might be put together regardless of form , has been fully tested , and has broken down . The analogy between the historical and the scientific monograph proves to be illusory . The biologist , or other pure scientist , must use the dialect of his science in order to be understood by his special tribe ; nay , he may dispense with language altogether , and employ diagrams , symbols , and formulas . But the historian 's theme is intensely human , and demands to be expressed in human terms . He is concerned with narration , exposition , description , argument , all of which are governed by literary laws to which Ile most conform . He may protest that he is " scientific , " and refuse to be bound by the canons of literature , but he might as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willy-nilly , he must master the art of literary expression , if he would make his historical attainments effective . In the first flush of the scientific dispensation , workers in every branch of history seemed equally inspired ; and of a truth , their labors were equally useful . But gradually they have classified themselves according to the nature of their work and the talents required for it , in one class the Men of the Letter , in the other , the Men of the Spirit . The master is always a revealer of significances : facts are not ideas . During the mid-period , when they seemed to be on the same level , there were inevitable misunderstandings : the man who dumped an immense amount of original research into an unreadable monograph felt aggrieved that the books of Fiske and Green had a large sale ; while some " literary " historians , on the other hand , did scant justice to the patience and devotion of the delvers . Now , happily , as all realize that they are not competitors and that the work of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinctions is dying out . But the Men of the Letter always far outnumber the Men of the Spirit , and there is ever present the danger that they will force their methods and their standards on the Men of the Spirit . So , to-slay , Philology smothers Literature . It does not follow that all historical works should be composed after a single plan . There are episodes which call for special treatment , aspects which require that attention should be focused on them , to the exclusion of a complete or general survey . The immense expansion of knowledge in modern times has provided History with material as abundant as life itself . One science after another has encroached on its domain and tried to usurp its sovereign rights . Political Economy , Government , Sociology , Philosophy , Psychology , Comparative Religion , each has insisted that it alone can interpret the evolution of nations and of mankind . because , it pleads , the spring of human action lies in its field . The economist sees taxation and the supply and demand of commodities dominating men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between classes and between capital and labor are of vital importance ; and so with each specialist . But History has not been dethroned ; far from it : the abler the attempt of the specialist to prove that his science includes History , the clearer the conclusion that History can not be thus hemmed in . But all these efforts , and the flood of new knowledge which has been pouring in from every side during the past half century , have immensely enriched the province of History . The historian can never know too much of any of these or other sciences . He will often appeal to them to explain special events : but he must beware against surrendering his human point of view for that of any specialist . Whatever branch of his art he may practice , let him never forget to be human . By these stages , historical study has risen above polemics and technicalities . We seem to be approaching the happy moment when historical writers are to enjoy the fullest freedom . They have at command inexhaustible stores of material . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the demand increases for those who can write ; arid , since absolutely no period or episode has been exhausted , historians have a limitless field to work in . There is a recognized division of labor wrong them . They need no longer waste time trying to persuade a doubting generation that the scientific method is the best , or that , since the life of individuals , nations , society , aml the human race is a development , so the historian must be an evolutionist : everybody now assents to both propositions . What the world awaits is results . For after all , the world , which bothers itself very little about abstruse theories , judges by the concrete product . rr Recent publications give a fair idea of the change which has been taking place . The controversial temper has softened . Even the strictest of the scientific school can mention Macaulay without foaming ; the more progressive , imbued with the new spirit , freely acknowledge his genius in narration and in the architectonics of historical construction . This does not mean that they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candidate for college honors used to know by heart . although he had no inkling of the merits which more than offset them . So , too , Carlyle , having ceased to be regarded as a false prophet , whom the faithful must demolish , is coming to be judged on his merits . Men who differ from him totally now dare to recommend him , not as a guide to be followed everywhere , but as a marvelous revivifier of the Past . Of course , not every critic has reached this plane of open-mindedness . Not long ago a writer in The Nation , reviewing the French Revolution , said that Carlyle had " three traits which are almost incompatible with the successful discharge of the functions of an historian . He was a dramatist ; be was is sentimentalist ; lit was a preacher . " ' Let us notice only the first of these heinous charges , ? " he wa , a dramatist . " If our previous analysis was correct , the historian must above all thing , so project himself into the Past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . that is , be a dramatist ; therefore our anonymous critic in branding Carlyle as a " dramatist , " has unwittingly given hint the highest praise . History not dramatic Then what is it ? Commonplace men do not see the dramatic in life , literalists miss its humor or its pathos ; but surely we do not frame our standard from the opinions of defectives . A critic who writes in that vein advertises himself as obsolescent by his narrowness ; by his attitude toward the dramatic , he proves that whether under a Romantic or a Scientific dispensation he could never look far or deep . Very different is the verdict of Mr. Goldwin Smith , who , after referring to some of Carlyle 's limitations , says : " At the same time let me emphatically acknowledge Carlyle 's greatness as a teacher of history . In picturesqueness lie has hardly a peer . Still more strikingly unique and a greater mark of genius are the breadth and boldness with which he presents the whole of humanity with all its weaknesses and absurdities , with its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is an invaluable feature of his History of the French Revolution , a work which , though perhaps not strictly accurate in all its details , is in depth of insight , in breadth of treatment , as well as in picturesqueness and vividness , still without a rival . I would venture to commend it as a valuable training , in its way , for the historic sense . " This opinion is not only sound in so far as it concerns Carlyle , but it typifies the attitude of the best minds now engaged in historical work . The time has Nation , Feb. 12 , 1903 , p. 133. // passed for iloginat i zing , for asserting that here is only one orthodox treatment . Study of history can never be fruitful until it teaches the truth , which we all learn munwillingly , that five eye-witnesses may describe an event in five conflicting ways , rich of which may be correct . Final verdicts . ultimate facts , can not always be reached : the greater the mass of evidence , the smaller the probability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But what is History ? Freeman , in an epigram which has helped to dessicate many of his disciples , declared that it is only " past politics , " and that present politics will be future history . His dogmatic tone jars on us . Unless " politics " be defined so broadly as to lose all meaning , it does not cover the field : for we see that political action is usually not a cause , but an effect , and we have grown hungry to know causes . Thus , fluctuations in rainfall may lead to poor crops ; poor crops bring on hard times ; hard times precipitate strikes ; strikes induce wild economic agitation ; and this , finally , results in political action . The publication of Tom Paine 's Common Sense , or of Mrs. Stowe 's Uncle Tom 's Cabin , would not fall within Freeman 's definition of " political , " and yet the historian who should ignore such symptoms as those books might himself be ignored . The true historian will ignore nothing , not even rainfall ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treat all the evidence from the human standpoint . In other words , no matter how great the apparent influence of rainfall on national events , he will not allow History to be swallowed up in meteorology . In view of the repeated attempts of specialists to subdue History to their specialty , this warning is not superfluous . Professor Lamprecht , for instance , confidently asserts that History is only psychology ' Such an assertion was bound to come , because scholars are busying themselves in restating old facts in terms of psychology , which has now the greatest vogue among the sciences , and seems to promise a rich reward to explorers . Professor Lamprecht believes that the process by which the psychology of the individual can be measured will serve also for nations and races , and even for mankind . He imagines a " folk-soul , " or " psychic core , " or " mass-pyche , " as existent at all times , and containing whatever has been transmitted front the past and whatever auto-suggestion or external stimuli may contribute to it at any given moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its mass-psyche , which has , further , its own laws of growth and decay . In so far as Professor Lamprecht insists on the necessity of knowing all the compounds ? religious , economic , political , literary , artistic , commercial ? in order to understand a period in its totality , he deserves to be carefully heeded ; but when he proceeds to apply his theories , we must be on our guard . No age is so simple ashe assumes . His mass-psyche , which we take to be the daughter of the Zeitgeist , if he be not our dear old friend himself under a new name , rarely has a single dominant . In fact , your definition of the dominant often depends on whether you look forward or back . To the Old Regime , the dominant of the Revolution seemed destruction ; to the Girondist , it seemed progress . The same person or event may be both an end and a beginning . Was Dante the last of the medirevels , or the first of the moderns ? It may he true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youth , from youth to prime , and from prime to old age ; but the classification of those stages is vague . To say that a man is old scarcely defines him : old men may be irascible or urbane , vigorous or feeble , wise or foolish , selfish or self-denying , just like young men . And so of nations . Three hundred years ago Bacon thought that England had passed the zenith ; to-day Professor Lamprecht appears to be uncertain whether Germany has not begun to decline . But what , we ask , is the value of a " law , " if , after claiming to explain everything , it can not tell whether a nation is waxing or waning ? What should we think of a law in physics which could not determine whether an object were going uphill or down ? Like all Tendenz philosophers , here Lamprecht too often creates the impression of making events fit his theory . Many strange pranks are played in the name of evolution , and nothing is more popular than a superficial tracing of political or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great machines on Western farms : at one end , a reaper cuts the grain , which is passed through various compartments , and comes out alternately a loaf of bread or a straw hat at the other . You get what you put in . So with much of Herr Lamprecht 's method ; it is too sure , too rigid . Only in the brain of a doctrinaire do the wheels of fate grind so regularly . A single quotation will illustrate how far Professor Lamprecht 's theories have removed him from the historian 's point of view . After asserting that " the course of universal history has taken the direction in which the transmission of the higher elements of culture was easiest , " he says : " Only a full and broad experience will enable us to see clearly the essentials of the problem , and then only a very simple and elementary survey of the process of transmission may , as I suppose , be gained The way of mediation may lead either through space or time , and in the first case we might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The means of mediation may be single or manifold , intermittent , continuous , one-sided , lying open only to the one community in question , or two-sided , ? distinctions which occasionally may be traced to special climatic and geographic conditions as well as special culture-differences . And according to this we shall be able , when using the picture of a well-known physic process , to speak wish reference to these processes of osmotic phenomena of diosmo , eis , endosnzosis , and ammo-sin . " A man who thinks in these terms , who sees such pictures as that in the passage here italicized , has abandoned History for abstract science . No true historian ever conceived of the spread of French Republican ideas through Europe as a case of osmosis . The moment you begin to measure human actions and passions and ideals according to the formulas of physical chemistry , you quit the province of history . Herr Larnprecht would , we fear , be capable of reducing Romeo and Juliet to a physiological equation , or of working out the relations of Cmsar and Pompey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help he can from psychology , but let him shun the Lamprecht dogmatizing . The essential truth in Herr Lamprecht 's doctrines was discovered long ago , ? the truth , that is , that History must seek its material in every department of humans activity . Yet even so , not every history need be a history of civilization , which is , after all , what our German professor aims at . To write a complete biography of General Grant , you ought to know many unrecorded physical and psychological facts : but , even without these , you can undertake to describe his military career . Each writer must map out Iris own field , and make excursions into the neighboring fields only when by so doing he can draw from them indispensable material . With relief we turn from Professor Lamprecht 's Teutonic abstractions to Mr. James Ford Rhodes 's concrete performance . ' Mr. Rhodes has no pet dogmatisms. lie treats his reader as a human being of intelligence , who desires to learn what certain other human beings did in the United States during and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspect that osmosis , necrosis , or dentition is really his theme . He carries the judge 's function almost to the limit , preferring that you should decide for yourself from the evidence presented . In selecting and presenting evidence , he is conspicuously fair ; and his plain style reassures those who fear that brilliance means untrustworthiness . He feels the intrinsic interest of American political development so strongly . that in passing from the Civil War to Reconstruction he leaves on the reader no impression of an anti-climax . Very different in temper is Mr. Andrew Lang , ' who makes no pretense to impartiality . Good is good and had is bad with him ; lest you should have any doubts , he visually informs you ; and since the Scotch whom he describes were mostly either cruel fanatics or half-savage border ruffians , or knaves , he has comparatively little use for flattering epithets . For a Scotehman , he is remarkably candid in admitting the unloveliness and barbarism of his people in the seventeenth century . But when the chance comes to praise , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whom he paints a hero of the noblest type . I like enthusiasms in historians . Impartiality may be attained at too great a sacrifice ; and it requires little experience to discount personal bias where it exists . I suspect a little those vs ho parade their impartiality , which is a quality that can not be counterfeited . If they have it , we shall soon find out . Others before sitting down to write seem to put on an asbestos shirt , to prevent any glow from passing from themselves to their manuscript , unaware that they have no glow to communicate . The human pumice stone is not a genial companion , nor is his book . So , to hearMr . Lang call a scoundrel a scoundrel does not lessen my faith in his qualification to write history ; but Ile has two defects which de- tract from the wit and vigor of his work . He is controversial , now hammering at the assertions of previous writers , now parrying in advance the thrusts of critic 's , who , he suspects , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allusive , taking for granted that the reader knows all the petty squabbles of every clan , and the personal fortunes of every Tam , Sandy , and Bab from Pentland Frith to Tweed . Outside of China . ancestor-worship flourishes nowhere so luxuriantly as in Scotland : but after all , the affairs of the Maekenzies and Macleods and Mackays , in 1010 , or 1627 , do not necessarily , any more than the forgotten feuds of Choctaws and Cherokees , form the intellectual baggage of an educated man to-day . So Mr. Lang 's reader sometimes feels like a stranger at a family party , where all the conversation is about matters and persons he has never heard of . This is provincial . Iletween Mr. Rhodes , who keeps himself in the background , and supplies you with the material for forming a judgment , and Ur . Lang ; who makes history his story , which , you are to believe on his word , and to enjoy or not according as you arc attracted or repelled by his personality , recent historical writers vibrate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first two volumes of whose history , covering the period from 1856 to 1870 , contain by far the best summary accounts in English of the Unification of Italy , of the Mexican Empire , of the rise of Prussia , and the downfall of Napoleon III . Walpole has the gift , rare among Englishmen , of understanding foreigners . He writes forcibly , clearly , with a certain finality of tone and amplitude of view , which raise him above Mr. Herbert Paul , who has undertaken to cover nearly the same ground . ' Mr. Paul is likely to be more popular , Sir Spencer to be more lasting . For Mr. Paul writes as a journalist , not , be it said an average American journalist , but the English variety , ? bred at the university , with a social and intellectual background , and that capacity for hurling toy thunderbolts in the London Times and the other dailies , and for writing omniscient reviews in the weeklies , which is as peculiarly English as is devotion to cricket or marmalade . One never meets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to match their omniscience . The irruption of the journalist into literature was one of the most far-reaching events of the nineteenth century . His encroachment upon the domain of history has been not wholly unbeneficial : indeed , a journalist may be called a historian in the making .. He must possess an aptitude for seeing salient points , and for swift and pithy statement . But he has no time to verify . He is a man without yesterdays , and without to-morrows . The historian seeks for causes ; he weighs patiently ; he knows that truth does not always live on the surface , and that it often has several facets . The journalist feels no responsibility to be right ; instead of principles , which ought to be as much a part of us as the sap is of the tree , he has opinions , which are like the wisps of wool the bushes catch when the sheep rub by , ? a whiff may blow them away .

The editors who have succeeded him lack the power to weld and harmonize the material:perhaps , indeed , they wished to do neither , preferring to let monographs overlap in time and topics , and to give advocates of conflicting causes an opportunity to confound each other . The proposition that each topic shall be dealt with by the best authority sounds very attractive ; in practice , however , the " best authority " may be a poor writer or a lumbering thinker , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desert stretches . The Cambridge History would have been better had the editors decided more clearly whether it was to serve mainly for reading or for reference . To criticise it in detail would require the knowledge of more than a single specialist . When an English work , intended for English readers , tells us , almost on the first page of its first volume , that America was discovered by " Cristoforo ' ttlotubo , " we can have no further surprises at any fantasticality the British mind may evolve in its losing struggle with foreign proper names . If " Columbus " be not English by this time , then " William the Conqueror " is not . A more important defect is the failure to provide marginal titles or to subdivide the monographs : while as an example of waste of time and money nothing can surpass the hundred or more pages of bibliography appended to each volume . The entire work will contain perhaps fourteen hundred pages of book lists , not one of which is complete , and most of which will be soon outgrown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advisability of relegating bibliography to special works , English scholars have waked up to its importance . In all likelihood the next ten years will witness the publication of standard lists in all topics , and historians outside of England will no more attempt to make their own exhaustive bibliography than their own paper and ink . But after every deduction has been made , the Cambridge History remains a work of great value . It may justly claim to have no rival in English . Some of its monographs are fine specimens of epitomized learning . Mr. Henry C. Lea 's survey of " The Eve of the Reformation , " Mr. L. A. Burd 's remarkable analysis of Machiavelli , Mr. J. H. Rose 's papers on Napoleon , Principal Fairbairn 's chapters on theological development , Professor William Cunningham 's description of economic change , stand out , each in its way , as excellent . The collection has the further present merit of enabling us to appraise the contemporary English school of historical writers . One perceives at a glance how far they have emerged from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absorbed . They have begun to imitate the zeal of Freeman without his pugnacity , and the accuracy of Stubbs without his dryness . True to the sane Anglo-Saxon instinct , they never quite divorce History from actual life : but regard it rather as the school wherein the Present : should get its wisest instruction . One still feels , perhaps , that university posts at Oxford and Cambridge are not the best training ground for that candor and perfect freedom without which no historian can be first class . There still cling . and long must cling , to those universities the prejudices and traditions of ecclesiastical and political Toryism . The naturalness with which English historians gravitate into bishops ' sees is itself suspicious . There is something almost comic in the persistence with which Bishop Stubbs asserted year after year that your theologian is the best qualified historian , - ? ignoring , with characteristic English stolidity , the fact that , in pledging himself to the Establishment , he vitiated his judgment on the pivotal controversy in English history . Stubbs used to tell with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is to his contention that men who have mortgaged themselves to an ecclesiastical system make the best historians . In a railway train , in 1863 , he fell into conversation with a remarkable young man , ? John Richard Green , ? who was " holding in his hand a volume of Renan . I said to myself , if I can hinder , he shall not read that book . ' . . . ( Green ) came to me at Navestock afterwards , and that volume of Renan found its way uncut into my waste-paper basket ! " r So Stubbs , who prided himself on his historical veracity , confesses that he was afraid to have another historian mad Renan 's Life of Jesus . In other words , Stubbs , in the most important question in history , plotted to have Green come to a decision without examining all the evidence ! After that , the less we hear about the peculiar fitness of ecclesiastics for writing history , the better . The English universities are doubtless becoming fumigated of such clerical cant ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the Stubbsian disingenuousness is too likely to be condoned . The Cambridge Modern History may well be compared with The A merican Nation , ' a similar cooperative work , edited by Professor Albert Bushnell Hart . He divides Iris subject into twenty - six sections , each of which is treated in a separate volume by a specialist : but the total bulk will fall considerably short of the dozen ponderous English volumes . In make-up , at least , he has clearly the advantage . But the point of real interest is , HOW does American historical scholarship compare with the English ? Only a careful examination of both works , which are not yet complete , would warrant one in forming a final judgment ; nevertheless , several characteristics may already be noted . The American writes more as a specialist , the Englishman from a more general culture . The American has less literary sense ; but he has a keen eye for the main points , stud he resembles a lawyer drawing up a brief : the Englishman seems to be addressing a university audience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who expects to be understood . The American is more readable , the Englishman weightier . A still more instructive comparison could be made between either of these collective histories , and that which MM . Lavisse and Rambaud edited in France . It would show that French historical writers are to-day in the lead : in investigation they fall nowhere behind the Germans and Anglo-Saxons , in exposition they easily surpass both . German erudition may be said to come to us mostly in the form of " pay-dirt , " which we must sift for ourselves in order to get its modicum of gold dust ; the Englishman or the American presents us the crude ore , or at best , ingots of refined metal ; the Frenchman brings the finished object , artistic , symmetrical , complete . And tin Frenchman has his reward in a public which appreciates him . Forty - six editions of AI . Henri Houssaye 's history of tire year 1815 are sold in a short time , In America , publishers , critics , and the public think that only ephemeral fiction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our serious writers were to imitate French lucidity , ? the highest quality of the Gallic genius , ? they , too , might address a larger audience . These vast cooperative enterprises , based on the assumption that the immense amount of material now prohibits a historian from knowing thorm:hly more than a small field , has not deterred several individuals from undertaking to cover an entire epoch . President Woodrow Wilson 's history of the United States has hardly made a place for itself before the forerunners appear of Mr. Elroy Al . Avery 's work in twelve volumes , of Chancellor and lIewes 's work in eight volumes , and of Professor Edward Channing 's work in eight volumes ? Messrs . Avery and Chancellor aim at popularity , and the former offers as a special attraction profuse illustrations . Mr. Chancellor pursues a novel method of classification , and in Mr. Hewes he has a coadjutor who furnishes chapters of statistical information . Popular works must be welt as a whole before their worth can be estimated ; but from Professor Channing 's beginning , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writes with perfect independence , after weighing all the testimony . He is very sober-minded , with a preference for moderate statement , and f. , r reducing legends to their lowest terms . I le loin to the critical rather than to the narrative side . As there is in America no historian more careful and thorough than he , and none inure loyal to the scientific method , so it is noteworthy that he has liven great attention to the literary form his history . From the promise of his rest volume one may predict that he will hold for years to come a position similar lo that held by Bancroft in an earlier generation . The cooperative history will not , it is tear , displace the work of the single his-t orian . Grant that twenty men can know a long period in greater detail than one non can , yet there is much besides detail to be desired . A sense of continuity can not be had by tacking together a score of independent monographs . Wholeness of tissue , consistency in point of view , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to be preferred to accumulation of facts , ? industry . In reading Gibbon , you are conversing with a first-rate mind ; by no process known to arithmetic can three third-rate minds produce t lie effect of one Gibbon . Cooperation may create invaluable works of reference , but it can never close the field to individual genius . After trying to read consecutively much collaborated history , one is reminded of the traveler who , on being asked what he remembered best of his journey through the Sahara , replied , " The oases . " Our survey , cursory though it is , should not close without mention of books on special topics , like Mr. F. A. Ogg 's Opening of the Mississippi , or Major W. Wood 's The Fight for Canada , ' which are excellent examples of painstaking historical study . Sir G. 0 . Trevelyan 's American Revolution is already too well known to he discussed as a new work . It illustrates one very desirable tendency , which ought to grow into a custom . Although the American Revolution concerned England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before been so sympathetically treated by an Englishman . Foreigners often make the best historians , because race traditions and party prejudices do not hamper them : but in order to succeed , they must enter as sympathetically as a native into the aims of the people they would describe . They must feel the traditions and prejudices dramatically , without being swayed by them in judgment . This Trevelyan has done ' At this point stands the writing of history to-day . A decade which has seen published Goldwin Smith 's United Kingdom , John Morley 's Gladstone , and Mr. Rhodes 's History of the United States , need not hold itself cheap . The actual product is valuable : the outlook is toward a still richer harvest . In historical writing there are required , first , the accumulation of facts ; then , the synthetic mind , to understand and interpret them . Facts in themselves are as worthless as pebbles on a beach ; but in a master mind a single fact may become as potent as the pebble in David 's sling . We have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more and more a civilizing agent , for it will keep ever present the collective experience of mankind . Many false steps are now taken , many crazes distract the people , many wicked policies are ventured on by rulers , thorough ignorance or forgetfulness of the results of similar action in the past . History will serve not less as a corrective than as a discipline and as an inspiration . But in order to do this , History must be human , making its final appeal not as a monument of erudition , but as a masterpiece of art , in which the collective deeds and passions of men shall be not merely pictured with photographic accuracy , but vitalized and interpreted . Let us not suppose that this is a new aim . The great historians have always held it . The idea that Thucydides and Tacitus neglected to consult all the material available in their time is ludicrous . Gibbon knew his " sources " as profoundly as the impeccably correct Gardiner . Mommsen , we may be sure , had not , like Stubbs , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ master historians in the f uture. by whatever method they may work , will prove themselves to be akin to these in insight , in power , and in art . In conclusion , as a reminder that we are not the first to hold true views as to the proper qualifications of the writer of history , let me quote this passage , rich in phrase and wisdom , from an unknown author of two centuries ago . The historian , he says , " is required to be a Man born with all the Felicities of a lively penetrating Wit , and unbounded Genius : Eorm 'd by great Study , Experience and Practice in the World ; one that is both a Scholar and a Man of Business ; a good Geographer , Chronologist , Antiquary , Linguist ; conversant in Courts , Councils , Treaties , in Affairs Military as well as Civil , and in short every thing that is the Subject of History ; furnished with all proper Materials and Records , and a perfect Master of all the Graces of the Language he writes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough ; for what is yet more extraordinary he must have no Passion or Prejudices , but be a kind of Deity that from a Superior Orb looks umnov 'd on Parties , Changes of State , and grand Revolutions . And you are to suppose him bless 'd with Health , Leisure , and easi ? fortune , and a stedfast Application to hi , subject . After which the Perfections requisite in his Performance are almost innumerable ; a judicious Proportion of all the Parts of his Story ; a beautiful simplicity of Narration ; a noble , yet unaffected Stile ; few and Significant Epithets ; Descriptions lively , but not Poetical ; Reflections short and proper ; and lastly , beside a multitude of Particulars which can not be mentioned here , a good Conduct thro ' the whole , and an animating Spirit that may engage the Reader in every action as if personally eoncern 'd , and give him the firm Assurance that he sees things in their own Light and Colours and not in those which the Art or Mistake of the Writer has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
