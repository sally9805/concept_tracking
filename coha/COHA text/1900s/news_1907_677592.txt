txt Seats and Slots vs . Seats and Straps . The plan of " D. G. D. V. " for the relief of crowded Subway cars has suggested to me another plan , viz. ; that the seats should be made available by a penny in the slot system . All seats being raised , allowing standing room for those preferring to stand , by inserting a penny in the slot they should drop , allowing passengers to use them . Of course this would obviate the necessity felt by some of rising to yield one 's seat to a woman , as the seat would also rise , and would only again be in position by the use of another penny , which presumably the fair one ( are they not all fair ? ) would not wish to expend . Tho tickets at the office being sold for 4 cents , those preferring to stand would save 1 cent .
