txt those who did not know the man intimately , or who judged him from immediate results , he seemed often timid . Cautious he was , bUt not timid . He shunned the unknown , but with the actual duty facing him he was ready to deal , and-he had the courage of unselfishness in dealing with such duties . Those who have known him best are most earnest in this opinion . Above all , he had a nature apparently incapable of hatred , or of envy , or of malice . Enemies he had , but he was an enemy to no one . If an opponent could but get near enough to the man to know him he was sure to be disarmed . It seemed as if there were no room in his heart for resentment . He was not only sincere and warm in his friendship and devoted in his affections , but he was uniformly kindly , even under great prov'ocation . The root of this remarkable characteristic was and must have been sincere self-forgetfulness . An offense to himself did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . This was a rare quality , and it contributed largely to the affection of the people for him . It may be said that it was an indispensable condition to his singular and great success in public life . He will , we think , be remembered , and remembered long , for the love he gave to his people and won from them . THE CAREER OF MR . M'KINLEY . The career of Mr. MCKINL , EY has often been referred to since his attainment of high office as a typical . American career . It is so in the sense that in this country the arbitrary and conventional obstacles to success which pxist in most other countries are absent or are much less strong . But in all lands history shows that the avenues of advancement for men possessing really effectual qualities , responding to the conditions of their time , are by no means closed . Even in Russia , the character of whose Government differs as widely as can be conceived from our own , the leaders both in civil and in military affairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unprivileged classes . The significance of the career of Mr. MeTCtrInEr lies not so much in the political conditions in which it was worked out as in the essential qualities he himself possessed and in their adaptation to the requirements of his environment at every stage . Unquestionably his first great opportunity came with the war for the Union . It found hin ? a mere boy , not differing greatly in origin , in education , in ideals inherited or attained , from thousands of others who enlisted in that noble cause at the very start . But the searching test of service disclosed his real character to others and to himself . He was faithful to each duty , small or great , as it presented itself ; patient of hardship and privation , steadfast in trial , fearless in danger , eager to do his utmost , quick of perception , sure in judgment , ambitious of distinction , but unselfishly fair and loyal toward comrades and competitors . The honors he won were earned honestly and he bore them modestly . The gifts he de-. veioped were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of patriotic service . When the war closed he carried them into civil life , and they were of great value to him . In politics , in which he enlisted as naturally as he had joined the army , he had the advantage of a marked natural predilection . He found in politics the same delight that others find in the pursuit of wealth , or of professional distinction , or of the prizes of scholarship . It was his native bent . It can not be said that his chief motive was ambition . He repeatedly put aside opportunities of advancement which he thought his loyalty to others forbade him to accept . Such ambition as he had was certainly limited by his sense of duty to his party and to his fellow-workers . Nor did he possess the daring of the very ambitious man . He was not fond of risks . He was content to deal with each succeeding stage of the developing career he had chosen , and did not care to seek great stakes at the cost of great hazard . Within these limitations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a leader of force and influence . He was a patient and self-possessed student of the present and the immediate future . If he confined his study to , this field it must be said that as the field widened his mind broadened in proportion . All testimony of those intimately associated with him is to the effect that he dealt with the tremendous problems presented to him in his first term as calmly , as coolly , as patiently , and with as clear a conception of what he wished to do and could do , as he had shown in his previous very different and more . contracted ex. - peience . He was not counted a bold man , but he did not fear responsibility . His Cabinet agree that in all serious matters the final decision was his . He sought advice , sifted it in discussion , often accepted it , but when he acted it was on his best judgment , and he never asked any one else to be accountable for the outcome . So far as we can judge , aio President since lauccor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unusual tone of mind . It was one of the secrets of his influence , for it inspired at once confidence and respect It was one of the effects of this peculiar tendency that since he was ready to take decisions on himself , when they were necessary , he avoided those that seemed to himunnecessary .
