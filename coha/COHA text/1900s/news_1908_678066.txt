txt If there was anything lacking to demonstrate President Roosevelt 's complete mastery of the conference of Governors it was supplied this morning by Gov . Glenn . the militant Executive of North Carolina , who last year was engaged in a hot contest with the Federal Government over the supremacy of State or Federal railroad laws . Gov . Glenn made the speech of the conference , and from first to last it was an appeal for National support on a question in which North Carolina is vitally interested  --  the W-nite Mountain and Appalachian forest reserve proposition . The North Carolina Governor wanted the conference to do something that would make Congress pass the pending bill right off the bat . The Governors and their advisers were with him enthusiastically , and applauded every period . At a banquet ' last night Speaker Cannon had suggested that the States interested ' in this project should get together , and by a confederation of their own obtain the result they are aiming at . without calling for Federal assistance . Gov . Glenn took up that suggestion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We tried a confederation once down our way , " he cried , " and it did n't pay . " The assembled Governors fairly whooped their appreciation of that . They fired S. few hats in the air and generally let loose emphatic signs of approval . Roosevelt Running Conference . Mr. Roosevelt went on running the conference in his own way to-day , without let or hindrance from any of the Governors . He opened the session , and soon afterward called Gov . John Johnson to the chair , with the announcement that he had selected Gov . Deneen of Illinois to preside during his absence at the afternoon session . The " big " speech of the morning was delivered by James J. Hill , who made a solid impression by the figures of National waste which he produced . The Governors are getting better acquainted , the men accompanying them are finding out  --  eMci 's wine , and the ' novelty of actually doing business in the ' White House is wearing off , so that there is a readier disposition to jump in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest . Gov . Johnson has a nimble tongue , which helps out for a presiding officer . lie made one sally which set the whole crowd off . It came after the close of Mr. Hill 's speech . Referring to what Mr. Hill had said about the air as a beneficial agent in agriculture , Gov . Johnson said : " With a conference like this , which brings so many politicians together , there ought to be plenty of hot air . " Governors Favor Plans . The Governors are greatly pleased with their conference , and are already working to make such meetings a regular thing hereafter . They are satisfied to let the President go on running this one to suit himself , but there is a growing undercurrent in favor of getting away from White House influence In subsequent meetings , and have them in fact as well as name conferences of Governors . The idea of conservation of natural resources has caught them all , and there is now an overwhelming sentiment among them in favor especially of the Administration 's forestry policy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . But they are also talking- of the benefits that may be derived from such conferences in the way of efforts to obtain uniform legislation along other lines . ' Uniformity of marriage and divorce laws . with uniform extradition laws , appeal to the Governors yery strongly . At the close of the official conference this afternoon there was a little informal meeting attended by about a dozen Governors , at which a committee of three , Folk of Missouri . Sheldon of Nebraska , and Wilson of Kentucky , was appointed to canvass the subject ' and make recommendations as to what should be done for the future . Gov . Fort has already invited the Governors to hold their conference of next Year at Atlantic City , and Gov . Wilson has asked them to come to Louisville . The afternoon session furnished a diversion when Gov . Gooding of Idaho , who is a stanch Roosevelt man on most things , tackled the Government reclamation service and hit it some hard cracks . He contended for the right of the States to do the reclamation work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they did it a great deal ' more satisfactorily than the Government He cited two cases in his own State to prove his contention . On the Minidoka s project , Government work , there have been 787 entries and E22 transfers , principally because the settlers could not make good under the conditions . But on the Twin Falls ) project , a private enterprise under the State , there have been only about 15 per cent . of transfers . The speech of James J. Hill . head of the Directorate of the Great Northern Railway . was a notable address . Sneech of James J. Hill . Mr. Hill spoke in part as follows , his subject being " The National Wealth of the Land and Its Conservation " : " ' Of all the sinful wasters of man 's inheritance on earth ' said the late ' Prof. Shaler , ' and all are in this regard sinners , the very worst are the people of America . ' This is not a popular phrase , but a scientific judgment It is borne out by facts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wealth available for the uses of mankind , and to what extent we are wasting a National patrimony that can never be restored , we might be likened to the Directors of a company who never examine a balance sheet . " The resources of the sea furnish less than 5 per cent . of the food supply , and That is all . The forests of this country , ihe'product of centuries of growth , are tiisit. ; disappearing , ' The --  best ' : estimates .. ContSirgied-an- Page-4Q GOVERNORS WANT MORE CONFERENCES // reckon our standing merchantable timber at less than 2,000,000,000,000 feet . Our annual cut is about 40,000,000,000 feet . We are consuming yearly three or four times as much timber as forest growth restores . Our supply of some varieties will be practically exhausted in ten or twelve years ; in the case of others , without reforesting , the present century will see the end . Mines Ca n't Be Restored . " The mine is incapable of restoration or recuperation . Upon iron and coal our industrial . civilization Is built . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indefinite future . The startling feature of our coal production Is not so much the magnitude of the annual output as its rate of growth . For the decade ending in 1905 the total product was 2,832. - 402.746 tons , which is almost exactly onehalf the total product previounsly mined in this country . For the year 1906 the output was 414,000,000 tons , an increase of 46 per cent . on the average annual yield of the ten years preceding . In 1907 our production reached 470,000,000 tons . " Estimates of coal deposits still remain , ing must necessarily be somewhat vague , but they are approximately near the mark . The best authorities do not rate them at much over 2,000,000,000,000 tons . " The iron industry tens a similar story . The total of iron ore mined in the United States doubles about once in seven years . Our production now is over 600 pounds per capita . We do not work a mine , build a house , weave a fabric , prepare a meal , or cultivate an acre of ground under modern methods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this most precious of all the metals is so far from inexhaustible that it seems as if iron and coal might be united in their disappearance from common life . Ores Being Exhausted . " The most favorable view of the situation forces the conclusion that iron and coal will not be available for common use on anything like present terms before the end of this century ; and our industrial , social , and political life must be readjusted to meet the strains imposed by new conditions . Yet we forbid to our consumers access to the stores of other countries , while we boast of our in-. creased exports , of that material for want of which one day the Nation must be reduced to the last extremity . ' How are we caring for the soil and what possibilities does it hold out to the people of future support : In 1900 the total unappropriated public lands in the United States consisted of 792,000,000 acres . Of this area the divisions of Alaska , Arizona , California . Colorado , Idaho , Montana , Nevada , New Mexico @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acres of unsurveyed land . We have , subtracting these totals . 50.000.000 acres of surveyed and 36,500,000 acres of unsuiveyed land as our actual remaining ' stock . And 21 , - 000,000 acres were disposed of in 1907 . How long will the remainder last ? " Equally threatening is the change in quality . There are two ways in which the productive power of the earth is lessened  --  first , by erosion the sweeping away of the fertile surface into streams and thence to the sea , and , second , by exnaustion through wrong methods of cultivation . The former process has gone far . Soil Exhaustion Most Serious . " Far more ruinous , because universal and continuing in its effects , is the process of soil exhaustion . It is creeping over the land from east to west . " But the fact of soil waste becomes startlingly evident when we examine the record of some States where single cropping and other agricultural abuses have been prevalent . Take the case of wheat , the mainstay of single-crop abuse . Many of us can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Union . The average yield of wheat per acre in New York for the last ten years was about is bushels . For the first five years of that ten-year period it was 18.4 bushels , and for the last five 17.4 bushels . In the further West , Kansas takes high rank as a wheat producer . Its average yield per acre for the last ten years was 14.16 bushels . For the first five of those years it was 15.14 , and for the last five 13.18 . We perceive here the working of a uniform law , independent of location , soil , or climate . It is the law of a diminishing return due to soil destruction . " When the most fertile land in the world produces so much less than that of poorer quality elsewhere , and this low yield shows a tendency to steady decline , the situation becomes clear . We are robbing the soil in an effort to get the largest cash returns from each acre of ground in the shortest possible time and with the least possible labor . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neglect to follow the principle of rotation of the crops , and the failure to use wisely selected fertilizers . He advocated the raising of cattle on the ground . Continuing , he said : " What our people have to do is to cover less ground , cultivate smaller farms so as to make the most of them , instead of getting a scant and uncertain yield from several hundred acres , and raise productively by intelligent treatment to twice or three times its present level . " I have dwelt upon the conservation of farm resources because of the commanding importance of this industry and because of its relation to our future . Nearly 36 per cent of our people are engaged directly in agriculture . But all the rest depends upon it . Of our farm areas only one-half is improved . It does not produce one-half of what it could be made to yield ; not by some complex system of intensive culture , but merely by ordinary care and industry intelligently applied . " Even the unintelligent are now coming to understand that we can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Our total exports , about one-fourth in value of the products of our farms , consist to the extent of more than 70 per cent . of articles grown on the soil or directly sustained by it . We shall have less and less of this agricultural wealth to part with as population increases . And as to enlarging greatly our sale of manufactured products in the world 's markets , it is mostly a dream . We can not finally compete there , except in a few selected lines , without a material lowering of the wage scale at home and a change in the National standard of living . " Not only the economic but the political future is involved . No people ever felt the want of work or the pinch of poverty for a long time without reaching out violent hands against their political institutions , believing that they might find in a change some relief from their distress . " The era of unlimited expansion on every side , of having but to reach out and seize any desired good , ready provided for us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is drawing to a close . The first task , it seems to me , must be to force home the facts of the situation into the public consciousness ; to make men realize their duty toward coming generations exactly as the father feels it a duty to see that his children do not suffer want . " Prof. Thomas C. Chamberlain of the University of Chicago and President of the American Association for the Advancement of Science , read a paper on " Soil Wastage . " He expressed the belief that contrary to a widely held theory that the earth is approaching a condition of exhaustion it will be habitable for tens of millions of years . His paper was largely technical . R. A. Long of Kansas City was the next speaker . Attacks Trust Legislation . His subject was " The Conservation of the Forests . " He thought that it would be difficult to get the timber owner to enter actively Into the methods required for the perpetuation of the forests by spending even the minimum amount of 50 cents per thousand . But he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joint agreement for the saving of the forests . He said further : " I do not think I should neglect to say that the present demoralizing conditions existing in our commercial and manufacturing life , and the consequent waste and loss incident thereto , and especially incident to the wasteful destruction of hundreds of thousands of acres of timber annually , are , in my judgment , due largely to the pernicious effect of that class of legislation which , by its application , has placed an absolute prohibition on every form of agreement looking to conservation , has placed a ban upon all meetings and discussions having for their object the adoption of the most salutary measures for the preservation of this natural resource . and has caused the instant and unfair denunciation of every meeting of the so-called " Lumber Trust , " which does not , and never did , exist ; has produced such a condition of mind among lumbermen that they feel that they can no longer meet together for the general discussion of matters so vitally affecting their interests and the welfare of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prosecution . " This condition in the lumber business has led to the reduction of the wage scale of hundreds of thousands of men , affecting many millions of people , has left 20 per cent . of the timber in the forest to waste , and unless we have relief , these evils will increase and others will follow in their wake . " Attempts at compulsory competition constitute our present commercial nightmare . Such competition is not healthy , but disastrous , and serves only , in the end , to create the most pernicious monopoly by destroying all competition  --  it means the survival of the strongest , and not the ' fittest . ' " Is it not sufficient for all that our resources should be conserved and saved for all generations ; is it right or just that a great industry should suffer and generations to live hereafter be deprived of an adequate supply of lumber in order that a prejudice be vindicated and the consumer of to-day buy his lumber at less than cost ? " And in this connection it may be well to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at once bring us into direct and disastrous competition with lumber from Canada . " The Work of New York . J. S. Whipple , Forest . Fish and Game Commissioner of New York , enthused the conference with a brief statement of the work being done by the Empire State toward the preservation of its forest . He preceded this with the remark that within twenty-two or twenty-three years , unless preservation methods were continued . there would not be a sawing stick of timber standing in that State . He said that New York had planted more trees than all other States and the National Government combined . Gov . Fort of New Jersey gave a very satisfactory account of the forestry work being done in his State . The climax of the morning session was produced by Gov . Glenn of North Carolina , who made a vigorous appeal for action by the conference which would impel Congress to pass at this session a bill providing for the Appalachian and White Mountain forest preserves . At the afternoon session Gov . Deneen of Illinois presided . Ex-Gov . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Irrigation . "
