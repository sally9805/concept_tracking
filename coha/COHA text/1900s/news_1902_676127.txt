txt When James went to the United States Senate , in 1889 , it was said that his personal wealth amounted to 15,000,000 . For twelve years he had been active in Michigan State politics , despite his enorMous business enterprises , and his reputathen as a liberal giver to charity , although augmented since his elevation to the National office , had become established even before he became interested in politics at all . The Senator 's career was a varied one . He was born in Canada of Scotch parents May 12 , 1838r When a young man he went to Detroit to live and make a fortune . His wife , whom he married in 1860 , was a young woman of Rome , N. Y. , Miss Mary Wetmore . He sent all his sons to Yale University . As an employer of thousands of men . and women , he had the name of being so just and liberal that none of the thousands ever wanted to leave his service , and many of them grew independently wealthy while he himself was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States Senate were unanimous . The third term would have ended in 1907 . William , the Senator 's father , came to Canada with his wife in 1834 . They had left their home in Scotland , near Glasgow , with the intention of settling in Illinois , but had been persuaded to choose Ontario instead . James , their second son , was born in Hamilton , Ontario , and along with the early education he received at the best schools of the province he absorbed from his father , who was one of the founders of the Great Western Railway , some of the railroading and business instinct which was to be of so much service to him in later years . After completing the courses of studies offered at the Hamilton Grammar School by its celebrated Principal , Dr. Tassie , young chose to go into active business rather than attend Toronto College , as had been his original intention . He determined to learn the hardware business , and so went to work in an establishment of his home town . Four years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wholesale hardware house . Then , through his father 's influence , he was made purchasing agent of the Detroit and Milwaukee Railroad , and it was during the holding of this pesitiOn that he attracted the attention of a prominent railroad contractor , who offered him a large salary to buy supplies , hire men , and manage . a big business . All this was when he was only twenty years old . He superintended the construction of numerous piers on the great lakes , and represented his employer in other such undertakings , but finally returned to his old position with the Detroit and Milwaukee Railroad . But it was not long before he was ready to start out for himself . In 1864 he joined three other men in organizing the Michigan Car Company , out of which have since sprung the Detroit Car Wheel Company , Baugh Steam Forge Company , and Detroit Iron Furnace Company . By the time he became a United States Senator Mr. had long been President of all these concerns , as well as the chief stockholder in each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aggregate nearly $7,000,000 a year , involving the employment of 3,000 or more men . Car works were bought and established at various points in the West , and one big plant  --  that of St. Louis  --  was purchased by Mr. especially in order to make a good place for his brother , who left the hardware business in Detroit to become manager of the new works . This was the first of moves that resulted in his making it possible for three of his brothers to acquire large fortunes . AS RAILROAD PRESIDENT . In 1880 Mr. MeMillatezwas the leader of a group of men who built theDetroit , Mackinac and Marquette Railroad . He became its President , and his persistent energy in the face of many difficulties finally succeeded in developing into a flourishing country a district that had been hitherto comparatively unproductive . Other concerns in which he had become interested were the Detroit ' and Cleveland Steam Navigation Company and the Detroit Transportation Company , and the First National ' Bank and Savings Bank of Detroit , the Detroit City Railway , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , bought much real estate in his home city , and was regarded as foremost among those who were engaged in the upbuildIng of the town . It was largely through his influence the Duluth , South Shore and Atlantic Railroad was built . As his fortune increased so did his charitable works . When first chosen a Senator he was known as a systematic giver to private and public philanthropic undertakings , and no other man in Michigan , it is stated , ever gave away so much money or gave it more , ungrudg'ugly than he : As an instance of his generosity and his regard for those who were dependent upon him for their livelihood , it is related that once he advised an employe to invest $1,000 in a company he was incorporating . The employe , a woman , replied that she did not have $1,000 . " Well , " said Mr. e " invest it for you , and you can repay his out pf the dividends . " He was always doing kindnesses like this , but his large donations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew about . He founded the Grace Hospital with the largest gift ever recorded in the State . Not long afterward he gave $16,000 for the education of the negro in Texas . The Museum of Art of the Detroit Young Men 's Christian Association was the recipient of frequent contributions from him , as were all other such institutions thereabout . It has been said that not a week passed but some Detroit paper mentioned one of his gifts . There are in Michigan  --  and elsewhere , for that matter  --  hundreds of young men whom he aided . He helped many of them to get an education . To others he gave situations in connection with the enterprises he controlled . Four of Mr. 's children are living . three sons and a daughter . The eldest , William C. , a graduate of Yale in the class of ' 84 , went into business , and now occupies many responsible offices , being a Director of banks and railroads . The second son , who was graduated in 1888. studied law . The family residence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Sights of the City . Its art gallery and library are famous , and the sons , like their father , are noted as booklovers and judges of the beautiful . Like him , they are Presbyterians , regular church attendants , and interested in many charities . ENTRANCE INTO POLITICS . It was in 1877 that Mr. entered Michigan politics by becoming a member of the Republican State Central Committee . Two years later he was on the Executive Committee during the famous " hard-money " campaign , in which a great victory was won over Democrats and Greenbackers .. Mr. superintended the Newberry Congressional campaign , and the rolling up of , a Republican plurality in place of a Democratic one was credited largely to his efforts . Another two years passed , and he won a like victory in the same district for Henry W. Lord . After the death of Senator Chandler , Mr. was chosen Chairman of the State Committee , but after a little while he withdrew from politics for a while . At this time the Republican Party of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lower peninsula had been lost , and those in the other parts of the State were extremely uncertain . In 1880 Mr. was urged to return and take charge of the party 's work . His best friends advised him to decline . " You will ruin your chances , " they said , " for the State is lost in spite of all you can do . " The closeness of the contest gave it added zest . He took the Chairmanship again and appealed tor the usual contributions . " What is the use ? " asked those to whom he made his appeal . " Why should we sink our money in a hole ? " Where they had given $1,000 they now gave $100 , or perhaps not more than $25 . He told them he was sorry they would n't give more , but that if they were not willing to pay for the Republican victory he would do so himself : He won . He reorganized the whole party machine , from the County Committees up , He made the Republican forces united @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " knew his business . " In politics , as in business , Mr. 's career was one of Unbroken success . As Congressman Newberry once said of him , he never entered upon any enterprise that was not destined to succeed , and " not one of his plans failed When he himself had the execution of it . " He was as quick to decide as he was accurate , and it was related by his business associates that he could dispose of a deal involving hundreds of thousands of dollars " at the rate of a thousand a , second . " Senator Chandler once said of him : " As a man of affairs never has had an equal in Michigan . As a political manager he won success against the heaviest odds . To the Nation 's business he would bring the same clear judgment and vigor that have elsewhere won success for him . He would ably represent this State in the Senate . " HIS INTEREST IN MICHIGAN . Mr. retained ! the office of State Republican Chairman until 1896 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flag at all by reason of his elevation to the Senate , and all the time his home in Detroit , as well as one in the country near b , y , was maintained continuously , although he had a fine residence in Washington and a , Summer place on the Massachusetts coast . Though he was known in Washington as a Senator who attended strictly to all his Senatorial duties as rigorously as any other member , there was never a time when he lost sight of his personal business interests . It was told of him that he talked to his son in Detroit over the long-distance telephone every day . His working hours , both in Washington and before he went there , were from 10 or 11 o'clock in the morning - until 4 o'clock in the afternoon , and those who knew him said he could transact more business in that time than any two men they ever saw . He was opposed to any man laboring when not on duty , and this theory was followed strictly as far as business was concerned . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it came to politics , and his home in Washington was often the haven for important conferences long after the working hours of the day were past . For several months once the Republicans held their caucuses there ' at his invitation . Hard work did not interfere with the socad side of Mr. 's life . From his boyhood 's days he was known as the best of company , full of anecdote , never melancholy or pessimistic , and with a wide range of information that made him a pleasing companion to all sorts of men . The old workmen that served tinder him when he was a young purchasing agent and contractor 's manager remember him as always cheerful , always ready to help those who were ready to help themselves . The business men and politicians of his adopted State recall that no press of . work was great enough to make him forget there was a time for recreation and enjoyment . Washington khew him as a. " home man . " fond of his friends and ever ready to extend to them his hospitality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . he liked crowds or public entertainments . - To , the newspaper interviewer , whom a Senator has to meet almost as regularly as he gets his breakfast , Mr. was a model of courtesy , but a man of few words . If he had anything to say for publicCion he said it in a few words and so plaffily that he could not be misinterpreted . If he had nothing to say tie said so politely . IN THE SENATE . In the Senate he was particularly well known for his interest in the affairs of the District of Columbia . When he first became a member of that body he was made Chairman of the Committee on Manufactures and a member of the Committees on Naval Affairs , Agriculture , and District of Columbia . The latter is one of the most important committees . The local Government consists of three Commissioners , appointed by the President of the United States , who , in conjunction with the Chairmen of the two District Committees of the Senate and House , rule the city . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senate committee , will be long remembered for the work he did as one of the five city fathers , whose duties comprised all those of the Mayor , Controller , Aldermen , and Commissioners of any other city . In the Naval Committee he did not have much to do before the war with Spain , but then the work came thick and fast , and the success of United States warships at Santiago and Manila and elsewhere has been credited to Senator as much as to any other member of the Senate or House . On the Committee on Commerce he did valuable service , knowing thoroughly , as he did , all the various phases of the country 's commercial possibilities , and needs . One of the habits the Senator had  --  and one that was remarked upon by his friends as proving what an indefatigable worker he was  --  was the personal supervision of his correspondence . He made it a rule to answer every letter directed to him and to read each one through . He would dictate the reply , and then read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the business of important National committees and the handling of his own millions on his shoulders continuously . In the matter of Federal patronage what Senator said about Michigan " went . " For his political friends in that State he obtained many prominent offices , and if he spoke against a Michigan man that man 's chances were killed . The Senator 's favorite recreation , among many , was reading , and what he liked best to read was the life of Napoleon . He had a collection of Napoleonic literature , it is declared , that could not be surpassed in the world . For athletic sports of all sorts he had a decided liking , particularly for baseball , and when there was a good series of games in Washington , any one looking for him was very sure to see him making his way whithersoever they were being played . In this he was no different from Senator Gorman , Thomas B. Reed , and many other National legislators who were accustomed to take in the ball game every afternoon when they had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
