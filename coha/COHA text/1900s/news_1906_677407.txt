txt The Way It Appears As a constant reader of your paper I would like to venture a criticism of your attitude in regard to Mr. Hearst . You seem to be very much upset because Mr. Hearst has succeeded in educating the public , and particularly the working public , to the sad fact that they have not been getting what was coming to them ; for instance , that where a man may be earning $1,000 per year the head of his firm probably walks off with $75,000 a year . and when Mr. $1,000 a year asks Mr. $75.000 a year for a raise of $2 per week it may be refused , or if granted is thrown to him as a bone to a dog . Also you quote Mr. Hughes as stating that business men are honest . If he said that he is very poorly informed , as from a long experience among them I can testify that they are a very dishonest class .                  @ @ @
