THE question of our Government 's policy in Panama is , as the term implies , a question of policy . It is not a question of executive details , because there were no such details concerning which , per se , any material question could be raised . There was no waging of war . There was no slaughter . There were no torturings nor imprisonments . There was no arbitrary overthrowing of an established government . All that was done was to exercise the moral influence of a definite and peaceful policy . The train of incidents implicated with that policy was as follows : The United States Congress on June 28 , 1902 , directed the President to construct a canal at Panama . If , however , he should be unable to obtain title to the unfinished French canal and control of the necessary territory , on satisfactory terms a:ad within a reasonable time , he was to turn to the Nicaragua route . Under that law the President negotiated a treaty with Colombia , which was signed on January 22 , 1903 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vote of seventy-three to twelve , on March 17 , 1903 . The Colombian Congress rejected that treaty on August 12 , 1903 ; the time within which ratifications of it were to be exchanged expired on September 12 ; and on October 31 the Colombian Congress adjourned , leaving the treaty dead . Three days later , . on November 3 , the State of Panama declared its independence of Colombia , and on November 5 the Colombian garrison withdrew from Panama and went home . The United States , meantime , intervend for the protection of property and for the maintenance of transit across the Isthmus , according to the provisions of the Treaty of 1846 . On November 6 an offer was made , on behalf of Colombia , that , if the United States would suppress the revolution and forcibly restore Panama to Colombia , martial law or a dictatorship in Colombia would resurrect and ratify the dead treaty for the construction of the canal . Instead of accepting this offer , the United States on that day recognized the de facto status of the Panama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognized its de jure independence ,  | 126 JUSTICE AND EQUITY IN PANAMA . which was thereafter promptly recognized by other Governments throughout the world ; to wit , by France on November 18 , by China on November 22 , by Austria-Hungary on November 27 , by Germany on November 30 , and at later dates by Denmark , Russia , Sweden and Norway , Belgium , Nicaragua , Peru , Cuba , Great Britain , Italy , Switzerland , Costa Rica , Japan , Guatemala , Holland , Venezuela , and Portugal , in the order given . On November 18 a canal treaty between the United States and Panama was signed ; on December 2 it was ratified by Panama ; on December 7 it was transmitted to the United States Senate ; on February 23 it was ratified by the Senate ; and three days later it was proclaimed and became law . Such were the salient features of our policy , as practised toward Colombia and Panama . The question at issue is whether that policy was just and equitable . 1 . ? It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Congress had directed the President to construct a canal at Panama , rather than at any other point . We need not stop to consider why Panama was chosen . That was a matter of congressional enactment , not of administrative policy . The question of route had been discussed , with a wealth of investigation and detail , for many years . Whether wisely or not , and whether for adequate or inadequate reasons , Congress finally declared , explicitly and unequivocally , in favor of Panama . The President had to obey that mandate . There was no alternative , save in case of his inability to make satisfactory terms within a reasonable time . The President promptly proceeded to do the work prescribed by Congress . He made terms , which the Senate accepted as satisfactory , for the construction and control of the canal . He was himself the sole judge of what was a " reasonable time " in which to make such terms . That time proved to be something less than a year and a half , and it was approved as " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the President scrupulously obeyed the law . But it is said that the law directed him to make his terms with the Colombian Government , and that , instead , he made them with Panama . It is true that Congress mentioned the Colombian Government as the one with which he was to negotiate . Obviously , that was because it was at that time the sovereign of Panama . But it is equally obvious that Congress meant not that Government , per se , but whatever lawful Government the President might find in possession of the Isthmus . That is because ( a ) the Congress of the United States could not guarantee that President Marroquin 's or any special Colombian Government 126 would remain in power at Panama , nor give the President any assurance of what Government he would find there when he made the treaty ; and because ( b ) it did not say that if a change of government should occur upon the Isthmus before a treaty could be made , he should abandon Panama and go elsewhere . The prescription had reference to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was geographical rather than political . The President then made satisfactory terms , within a reasonable time , and he made them with the actual Government of the Isthmus of Panama . He obeyed the law of Congress in letter and in spirit . So far as domestic obligations were concerned , his policy was just and equitable . 2 . ? It was justified by our legal obligations to Colombia . Our Treaty of 1846 with New Granada guaranteed to New Granada ( or Colombia ) " the perfect neutrality " of the Isthmus of Panama , " with the view that the free transit from the one to the other sea may not be interrupted or embarrassed " ; and also guaranteed " the rights of sovereignty and property which New Granada has and possesses over the said territory . " It was perfectly understood , and was specifically and repeatedly declared , that this guarantee was solely against alien aggression , and was not to be interpreted as promising protection against domestic revolution or as assuring the perpetuity of the same domestic system of government that then existed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Secretary Seward on November 9 , 1865 , " was to guarantee the Isthmus against seizure or invasion by a foreign Power only . It could not have been contemplated that we are to become a party to any civil war in that country by defending the Isthmus against another party . " As a matter of fact , there were several revolutions in Colombia after the making of that treaty , to none of which was the United States a party , and none of which in any way affected the force of the treaty . Thus we made the treaty with the Republic of New Granada , under the Constitution of 1843 . A. new Constitution was promulgated in 1853 , under which the federal system was introduced . In 1855 the Constitution was amended so as to make Panama a sovereign State , connected with the rest of the Republic by only a federal relationship . That amendment specifically named the State of Panama as separate from , and in nearly all respects independent of , the State of New Granada . Practically , it renounced those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had over Panama at the time when the Treaty of 1846 was made . But the United States did not intervene to compel the maintenance of them , nor was it asked or expected to do  | 128 JUSTICE AND EQUITY IN PANAMA . so . On the contrary , if it had done so it would have been resisted , and would have been properly regarded as guilty of oppression . In that circumstance was a pretty plain proof of the fact that the guarantee of " rights and sovereignty " made in the treaty was a guarantee only against foreign interference or oppression , and not against domestic changes of sovereignty and ownership . In 1858 another new Constitution was adopted for the whole country , in which the federal system was confirmed " in perpetuity . " In 1862 there as a forcible revolution , which led to the adoption in 1863 of another Constitution , under which Panama and the other states were declared to be sovereign , but confederated in perpetuity for exterior security and reciprocal aid . That Constitution could be amended only by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , another violent revolution occurred , and in 1886 the victorious party dictated a new Constitution , sweeping away that of 1863 , abolishing without their consent the independent sovereignty of the states , and replacing the federal system with a strongly centralized government . To this latest Constitution the State of Panama never assented , but maintained an almost incessant revolt against it . In addition to these revolutions resulting in changes of the Constitution , there were others which resulted in mere changes of government . The latest of these was in 1900 , when President Sanclemente was thrown into prison , where he died , and the Vice-President , Dr. Marroquin , was installed in his place through a coup d'etat . The United States held strictly aloof from all of these proceedings , so far as politics were concerned . The Treaty of 1846 , however , gave this country the right to preserve peace and freedom of transit across the Isthmus , and was consistently interpreted and understood as giving us that right , even to the extent of intervening in local Colombian affairs and preventing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the line of transit . Thus , to quote Mr. Seward again , while the United States would take no interest in any internal revolution in the State of Panama , it would hold itself ready " to protect the transit trade across the Isthmus against either foreign or domestic disturbance of the peace of the State of Panama . " Note that it was not the sovereignty of the Bogota Government , but " the transit trade across the Isthmus , " that the United States was ready to protect against domestic disturbance ; leaving it to the people of Colombia and Panama to determine whether Panama should be governed at Panama or at Bogota . Note also that the United States was to protect that transit trade  | " against domestic disturbance of the peace . " How would it have been possible to do that if either of the domestic belligerents had been permitted to use the railroad as a base of military operations and thus to involve it in acts of war ? The only effective fulfilment of the treaty was in protection of the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faction . Such protection was repeatedly given , to the extent of forbidding either the Colombian Government or the insurgents to use the railroad as an engine of war . That was what wasdone in November , 1903 . The President protected the transit trade of the Isthmus against " domestic disturbance of the peace of the State of Panama , " regardless of whether the menace of disturbance proceeded from Colon or from Bogota . It can not justly be charged that the United States , while insisting upon free transit across the Isthmus for itself , prevented Colombia from enjoying it . The United States never but once ? and that was not in November , 1903 ? forbade the Colombian Government to make nonbelligerent use of the railroad , and it did so only through a subordinate functionary , who was promptly overruled by the Washington Government . All that it did prohibit was such conversion of the railroad into an engine of war as would interrupt free transit across the Isthmus and subject the road itself to destruction . That the intention of the Treaty of 1846 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obvious and indisputable . Mr. Secretary Hay set forth this phase of the case with epigrammatic force when he described the treaty as a covenant which " ran with the land . " The application of the treaty was geographical rather than political . The United States had no right to say what government there should be in Colombia , save that the domestic government should not be oppressed or overthrown by a foreign power . But it had the right to say that whatever government there was should fulfil its treaty obligations in the maintenance of free transit across the Isthmus . It had the right to say that such freedom of transit should not be interrupted by rebellion arising at Panama or Colon , and equally that it should not be interrupted by government coercion from Bogota . It had , finally , the right to say , as it did say , that after she had practically relinquished Panama to the control of its own people , and they had restored peace and established an orderly government of their own , Colombia should not reinvade that State for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it be said that this barred Colombia from using her sovereign  | power and resources for the performance of some of the supreme func tions of government , to wit , the suppression of rebellion and the main tenance of national integrity , the answer is that she should have thought of that before she made the treaty . Unquestionably she did , in making that treaty , to a certain extent abrogate and relinquish her sovereignty over the Isthmus of Panama . She did so in return for a quid pro quo , which then seemed to her adequate , and which , in the event , proved for many years not only to be adequate , but to put the balance of advantage upon her side of the account . Having thus en joyed the benefits of the treaty for half a century , it was not lawful for her to evade its obligations or to repudiate its penalties . The United States , having fulfilled its duties toward her , in protecting her from alien oppression , was amply justified , legally , in exacting from her its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beginning of November , 1903 . The United States was right , of course , in rejecting the Colombian proposal , that it should , in return for a canal concession , suppress for Colombia the already successful revolution in Panama , and restore that State to Colombian authority . The United States has never hired itself out as a mercenary , either for cash or for canal concessions . Equally right was it in recognizing the de facto Government at Panama . It is always lawful , and generally imperative , to recognize facts , and it was a fact that that was the only existing Government on the Isthmus . The Colombian Government there had ceased to exist . It had been expelled . It had departed . The Colombian troops had not been driven out by us . They had gone because they found themselves alone and helpless amid a universally hostile population . They recognized the accomplished fact . The Panama Government was in entire and undis puted authority , and was ready to fulfil and was fulfilling the actual functions of government . The only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact . Nor is the rightfulness of our later recognition of the de jure inde pendence of Panama to be impugned . It was done promptly , ten days after the Panaman Declaration of Independence . There . seems , however , to be no ground for the characterization of " indecent haste " which has been applied to it . There is no more generally accepted principle in international taw than that every nation is its own judge of the time when it is fitting to recognize the independence of another . In our own revolution , France recognized our independence years before it was act ually established , while Russia refused to recognize it until years after  | it had been established and had been recognized by the very Power from which we had won it . Both acted well within their legal rights . The United States recognized the revolutionary Republic in Brazil in 1889 , no less promptly than it did the Republic of Panama , although there was much less assurance of its stability . The long delay in recognizing the independence of the South American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been cited as a precedent which should have been regarded in the case of Panama . There was little if uny analogy between the cases . The contrast between South America then and Panama now is enormous . Considering the difference in speed of communication , and in extent and completeness of our knowledge of the countries concerned , it is scarcely too much to say that a day gives as ample time for deliberation now as a year did three-quarters of a century ago . In recognizing the independence of Panama we were lawfully recognizing an accomplished fact . If it be said it was a fact made possible only by our own conduct and attitude , the same may be said of other republics , which exist only because of our protection . Colombia herself would probably not have maintained her independence had it not been for the policy of the United States , especially as set forth and endowed with concrete force in the Treaty of 1846 . In the act of recognition then , as in that of intervention , the United States fully observed its legal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was justified on the ground of equity to Colombia . We must remember , what is too often overlooked , that while law is positive , equity is relative . We must fulfil legal obligations strictly and impartially , even toward the least deserving and least worthy . But we are privileged to consider the character , the conduct , and the deserts of the applicant for equity . He who seeks equity must deal equitably . The very word itself implies that . It is an elementary justice , based not on legal prescription , but upon the mutual merits of the parties to the controversy . What , then , were Colombia 's deserts ? So far as Panama was concerned , they were slight indeed . She had treated Panama most inequitably . She had forcibly abrogated the Constitution of 1863 , and had subverted Panama 's undoubted rights thereunder , without Panama 's consent ? just as though forty-four of our forty-five States should combine to deprive the forty-fifth of its equal representation in the Federal Senate without its consent . It had not only done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had systematically oppressed and plundered Panama , making the Isthmus the " milch cow of Colombia , " as it used to be said Cuba was of Spain . Upon dispassionate and impartial review  | of the record , it was impossible to withhold sympathy from Panama in her controversy with the Bogota Government . If , however , we were to go by on the other side , saying that such matters were none of our business , we could not ignore the fact that Colombia had treated the United States badly in more than one important respect . In 1880 this Government found it necessary to warn Colombia against making the concessions which she then proposed to make to France , as ? to quote Mr. Secretary Evarts , on July 31 , 1880 ? " introducing interests not compatible with the treaty relations which we maintain with Colombia . " Colombia then proposed ? I quote from President Arthur 's message of 1881 ? " to the European powers to join in a guarantee which would be in direct contravention of our obligation as the sole guarantor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words , while enjoying , at her own request , our protection , Colombia was intriguing against our interests with the very Powers against which she had sought and was enjoying our protection . We may pass by the assumption that Colombia vigorously used all possible influence against the Nicaragua Canal enterprise so as to compel us , if possible , . to adopt the Panama route at such terms as she might extort , for that is a matter of belief and common fame rather than of concrete record . But we may justly complain that she acted inequitably toward us in rejecting the canal treaty which her minister negotiated with us in 1902-3 . Mark that she had a legal right to reject it . That is indisputable . Her legal right to reject it was as absolute as our right to reject other treaties which our Government has negotiated , but which have not met with the approval of the Senate . She had , let us say , the sane right to reject it that we had to negotiate it , or that we had afterward to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it was not equitable ; or , at any rate , it was no more equitable than our subsequent recognition of , and negotiation with , Panama . If she stood upon her strict legal rights in rejecting the treaty , we had as good a title to stand upon out strict legal rights in recognizing Panama . But we may go beyond that , and say that her rejection of the treaty was positively iniquitous ? if I may coin that useful word , to express a slightly different shade of meaning from " iniquitous , " though indeed " iniquitous " might serve as well . Two facts of record are sufficient to prove the indictment . One is the explicit and repeated offer made by General Reyes in behalf of the Bogota Government , of which he was the prospective next chief , to resurrect and ratify the dead canal treaty , by martial law or dictatorship , - in return for our resubjugation of Panama  | to the Colombian yoke . The other is the confessed , deliberate plan of the Bogota Government to repudiate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to confiscate that company 's property , which it would then sell to the United States for a round sum . Let us note the details of that precious scheme . The charter or concession of the French company required the completion of the canal by October 31 , 1904 , failing which the concession and title would be forfeited to Colombia . It was obvious that the canal could not be completed by that time , so the company secured from the President of Colombia an extension of time of six years more . The plan of the Colombian Congress was to declare that extension invalid , thus repudiating the act of its own President , and then to confiscate the unfinished canal and abrogate the French company 's concession on October 31 , 1904 . That was the real reason why the canal treaty was rejected , and why the suggestion of reopening negotiations for a new treaty was made . Colombia did not want to refuse our treaty . She wanted to make the treaty . But she wanted to postpone doing so until after the French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself secure the $40,000,000 which the United States was willing to pay for the unfinished canal , instead of having that convenient and much-coveted sum go into the pockets of the French shareholders . She would have accepted the treaty gladly after she had confiscated the canal . Now the bearing of all that upon the question of our policy is simply to show upon how little ground Colombia could plead for better treatment as a matter of equity . Colombia , wearing the brand of a would-be spoliator , could not well come into court with a complaint that she had been despoiled . Upon the ground of equity she had nothing more to claim . She had been treated as well as she deserved , and better . Her only valid claim must be for legal justice , and in the making of that claim it might be well for her to take heed lest the court of civilization should declare to her : " Thou shalt have justice , more than thou desirest . " It will not serve to say we would not have treated a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . The record of our dealings with some of the greatest Powers of the world suggests that we have been no less independent in our bearing toward them than toward the lesser ones . On the other hand , we might equally well ask if Colombia would have acted thus toward a nation that was not rich , that was not urgently desirous of building the canal , or that was a little more in the habit of using the " mailed fist . " We must , it is said , have one law alike for all nations , great and small . That is quite true .  | What , then , would we have done had England recognized the inde. pendence of the Confederacy in 1862 ? The cases are not analogous The Confederacy was never , either physically or legally , in as strong position as Panama . I say that advisedly . The United States never scuttled out of the Southern States and abandoned them to secession , a , Colombia did out of Panama , but from the very beginning exerted it : fullest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pre serve the Union . The Confederate States had no such constitutiona defence of secession as that which Panama had in the fact of forme : independence forcibly destroyed without her consent . The Europear Powers did promptly recognize the Confederate States as belligerents In that they were simply recognizing a fact , and , however distasteful i1 was to us , we had no cause for complaint . There is another point which those who seek to raise this argument from analogy invariably overlook . It is this : That the United State had never , by treaty or otherwise , recognized international interests it the Southern States as Colombia had in Panama . In the Treaty of 1846 Colombia specifically recognized the fact that other nations , above al . the United States , had natural and lawful interests in the Isthmus o : Panama , which might in certain contingencies be paramount to Colombia 's own interests there . Those interests were peculiar to the Isthmus and did not extend to the rest of Colombia . For it is to be rememberec that the provisions of that treaty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protection and guarantee , did not apply to the whole o : Colombia , but only to the State ? that is , the Isthmus ? of Panama " The guarantee extends only to the Isthmus , " wrote Mr. Bidlack , our Charge d'Affaires who negotiated the treaty , to Mr. Secretary Buchanan in 1846 . In that circumstance the separate status of Panama , as contrasted with the rest of Colombia , was recognized , and so were recognized the peculiar and even paramount interests of other countries it that territory . I quote from President Polk 's message transmitting that treaty to the Senate for ratification : " The treaty does not propose to guarantee a territory to a foreign nation in which the United State : will have no common interest with that nation . On the contrary , we are more deeply and directly interested in the subject of this guarantee than New Granada herself , or any other country . " Let us suppose , to make an analogy which does not now exist between our Civil War and the Panama revolution , that at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by treaty with England that the cotton trade from our Southern ports should never be interrupted or  | embarrassed , and that England should have the right to intervene whenever necessary to keep that trade free and open . In such case it seems to me that England would have had a legal and moral right to intervene in 1861-62 , to break the blockade of our Southern ports and to prevent the United States from reestablishing it . The United States never made such a treaty . It would never have made one . But Colombia did make the Treaty of 1846 . There is the radical difference between the two eases . It is said that the application of the lex talionis does not indicate the loftiest motives . Granted . But there were other motives for our policy which were high and noble enough to satisfy the most exalted doctrinaire . At the present moment the argument is simply this , that neither law nor equity requires a nation to go out of its way to be generous to an unworthy object , even though that Object be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not a charter to license any more than strength is a charter to oppression . A strong nation should use its strength nobly . A weak nation should use its weakness no less nobly , seeking in morals the strength it lacks in material resources . 4 . ? It was justified under both law and equity to other nations . Our Government has violated no item of international law . It has invaded no rights of other countries or of their citizens . It dealt fairly , lawfully , even generously , with the French Canal Company . It patiently awaited and accepted the adjudication of the French courts in whatever legal controversies arose over the transfer of the company 's property . It has shown a scrupulous regard for the letter and spirit of international law , and for international equities . It has , moreover , fulfilled the implied duties which rested upon it as a result of its traditional policy . Under the Monroe Doctrine this country would not let other nations meddle in American affairs . It thus incurred a moral responsibility for those affairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and peace upon the Isthmus , and freedom of transit over that important route . Therefore it was morally bound itself to make such a guarantee , and to make it effective . It has done so . It would not permit any other nation to construct a canal across the Isthmus . Therefore it incurred itself the moral obligation to construct one . It is now proceeding to do so . The United States thus shows itself to be no dog-in-the-manger , but a Power that is as ready itself to do as to forbid others to do . The question of " international eminent domain " has been adverted  | to many times . It is perhaps not altogether pertinent , for the reason that the United States was not compelled to resort to the application of such a principle . It is not to be denied , however , that such a principle exists , and that it has more than once been practically applied in the history of the world . Every " concert of the Powers " for the coercion of one or more nations involves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Herzegovina , and Crete and Samos and The Lebanon , were removed from unbridled Turkish rule . It was upon the same principle that the joint control and the international tribunals were established in Egypt . It would scarcely be an exaggeration to say that the same principle was involved in the opening of The Sound to free navigation . There need be no hesitation in saying that if there had been no other way to secure the Panama Canal , the Powers of the world , or the United States alone , would have been amply justified in proceeding under that principle . But the principle is so delicate a one , and so easily liable to perversion and misuse , that there is cause for gratitude in the accomplishment of the world 's desire at Panama without resort to it . If that principle , or the contemplation of it as a possibility , did to any degree enter into the case in confirming the United States in its policy or in affording justification for that policy , then instead of condemning our Government , the world must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of so delicate and even perilous a principle with so much discretion , and with results so invariably beneficent . For what is , after all , most clear in the whole business is this , that the United States has acted unselfishly and for the good of the world . I say it has acted unselfishly , because it has sought no self-aggrandizement , no conquests , no acquisitions of territory , no extension of sovereignty . It has sought , and has secured , nothing but the privilege and power of constructing a canal which will be for the equal use and benefit of all nations . If it has in doing so exacted a grant of perpetual control over ' a part of the territory of another state , it has thus done only what was necessary for the safeguarding of the canal . It is inconceivable that any other nation on earth would have undertaken the construction of the canal and its protection and neutral maintenance on any basis of less authority . I say it has also acted for the good of the world , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the only way in which it could be satisfactorily fulfilled ; because it has assured the speedy opening of what will be one of the greatest highways of peaceful and beneficent commerce ; and because it has estab- lished a paramount influence for peace and justice in a land that for a century has known little of either peace or justice . The opening of the Suez Canal marked an epoch in history , though it was followed by profligacy , controversy , and war . In Panama these latter evils ran their vicious course before the United States assumed control . It will be this country 's privilege , in pursuance of the just and equitable policy already established , to make their recurrence forever impossible , and to make the future of that great enterprise an era of continued equity and unbroken peace . Thus governed , the benefits of the Panama Canal to the whole world may surpass those of the Suez Canal as much as the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans surpass in size the Mediterranean and the Red Seas . The policy that is leading , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consummation , may be carped at and impugned by some who see it through the distortion of loo close and too partial a vision . In the clear , comprehensive , and just perspective of history , its terms no less than its results will be its abundant and perpetual vindication .  |
