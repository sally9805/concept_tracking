IT was a year ago , at this Mid-March writing , that the Easy Chair replaced its accustomed casters with practicable keels , and slid down the icy seas between New York and the Bermudas . Now it has just returned to its window in Franklin Square , overlooking the gay ripple of the trains of the Elevated Road , after a voyage on other waters , almost as far as to the Summer Islands and hack , but this time by inland shores , where it has left the spring among red-budded maples wading well into a yellow flood , with the birds singing in their boughs , and the frogs piping at their roots ; and it invites the reader , with a hospitality that includes all his multiples , to accompany it in a fond retrospect of a steamboat journey from Pittsburg to Cincinnati , and again to Pittsburg . He need be gone only a week , and if he is of the Easy Chair 's mind , he will think the time well wasted . There was not much promise of pleasure in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the smoke of a thousand foundry chimneys gave up trying to rise through the thick , soft air , and fell with the constant rain which it dyed its own black . But early memories stirred joyfully in the two travellers in whose consciousness the Easy Chair was making its tour , at sight of the familiar stern-wheel steamboat lying beside the wharf-boat at the foot of the dilapidated levee , and doing ita best to represent the hundreds of steamboats that used to lie there in the old days . It had the help of three other boats in its generous effort , and the levee itself made a gallant pretence of being crowded with freight , and succeeded in displaying several saturated piles of barrels and agricultural implements on the irregular pavement , whose wheel-worn stones in long stretches were sunken out of sight in their parent mud . The boats and the levee were jointly quite equal to the demand made upon them by the lighthearted youngsters of sixty - five and seventy , who were setting out on their journey in fulfilment of a long-cherished dream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boats would have rehabilitated the past . When they mounted the broad stairway , tidily strewn with straw to save it from the mud of careless boots , and entered the long saloon of the steamboat , the promise of their fancy was more than made good for them . From the clerk 's office , where they eagerly paid their fare , the saloon stretched two hundred feet by thirty away to the stern , a cavernous splendor of white paint and gilding , starred with electric bulbs , and fenced at the stern with wide windows of painted glass . Midway between the great stove in the bow where the men were herded , and the great stove at the stern where the women kept themselves in the seclusion which the traditions of Western river travel still guard , after wellnigh a hundred years , they were given , ample state- rooms , whose appointments so exactly duplicated those they remembered from far-off years that they could , if they had liked , have believed themselves awakened from a dream of insubstantial time , with all the events in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When they sat down at the supper table , and were served with the sort of belated steamboat dinner which it recalled as vividly , the kind sooty faces and snowy aprons of those who served them were so quite those of other days that they decided all repasts since were mere Barmecide feasts , and made up for the long fraud practised upon them with the appetites of the year 1S50 . A rigider sincerity than shall be practised here might own that the table of the good steamboat Avoid : left something to be desired , if tested by more sophisticated cuisines , but in the article of corn bread it was of an inapproachable pre-eminence . This bread was made of the white corn which the North knows not , nor the hapless East ; and the buckwheat cakes at breakfast were without blame ; and there was a simple variety in the abundance which ought to have satisfied if it did qwq ? exile in a West Virginia oil town , was gladly returning to the home , for which he and all his brood of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceased to pine . His eagerness to get back was more than touching ; it was awing ; for it was founded on a sort of medival patriotism that could own no excellence beyond the borders of the natal region . He had prospered at high wages in his trade at that West Virginia oil town , and his wife and children had managed a hired farm so well as to pay all the family expenses from it , but he was gladly leaving opportunity behind , that he might return to a land where , if you were passing a house at meal-time , they came out and made you come in and eat . " When you eat where I 've been living , you pay fifty cents , " hp explained . " And are you taking all your household stuff with you ? " " Only the cook-stove. - Well , I 'll tell you : we made the other things ourselves ; made them out of plank , and they were not worth moving . " Here was the backwoods surviving into the day of Trusts ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the old ideals ! The new ideals , the ideals of a pitiless industrialism , were sufficiently expressed along the busy shores , where the innumerable derricks of oil-wells silhouetted their gibbet shapes against the horizon , and the myriad chimneys of the foundries sent up the smoke of their torment into the quiet skies , and flamed upon the forehead of the evening like baleful suns . But why should the Easy Chair be so violent of phrase against these guiltless means of millionairing ? There must be iron and coal as well as wheat and corn in the world , and without their combination we can not have bread . If the combination is in the form of a trust , such as has laid its giant clutch upon all those warring industries beside the Ohio and swept them into one great monopoly , why it has still to show that it is worse than competition ; that it is not , indeed , merely the first blind stirrings of the universal co - operation of which the dreamers of ideal commonwealths have always had the vision . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , seemed to have all the land to themselves ; but this was an appearance only , terrifying in its strenuousness , but not , after a11 , the prevalent aspect . That was rather of farms , farms , and evermore farms , lying along the rich levels of the stream , and climbing as far up its beautiful hills as the plough could drive . In the spring and in the fall , when it is suddenly swollen by the earlier and the later rains , the river scales its banks and swims over those levels to the feet of those hills ; and when it recedes it leaves the corn-fields enriched for the crop that has never failed since the forests were first cut from the land . Other fertilizing the fields have never had any , but they teem as if the guano islands had been emptied into their laps . They feel themselves so rich that they part with great lengths and breadths of their soil to the river , which is not good for the river , and is not well for the fields , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more to fence their borders with the young willows which form a hedge in the shallow wash such a great part of the way up and down the Ohio . Meanwhile the fields flourish in spite of their unwise largesse to the stream , whose shores the comfortable farmsteads keep so constantly that they are never out of sight . Most commonly they are of brick , but sometimes of painted wood , and they are set on little eminences high enough to save them from the freshets , but always so near the river that they can not fail of its passing life . Usually a group of planted evergreens half hides the house from the boat , but its inmates will not lose any detail of the show , and come down to the gate of the paling fence to watch the Avoncle float by , motionless men and women , who lean upon the supporting barrier , and rapt children , who hold by their skirts and hands . There is not the eager New England neatness about these homes ; now and then they have rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air of comfort ; and very , very rarely they stagger drunkenly in a ruinous neglect . Except where a log cabin has hardily survived the pioneer period , the houses are nearly all of one pattern ; their facades front the river , and low chimneys point either gable , where a half-story forms the attic of the two stories below . A garden of potherbs flanks them , and behind it cluster the corn-cribs , and the barns and stables stretch into the fields that stretch out to the hills , now scantily wooded , but ever lovely in the lines that change with the steamer 's course . Except in the immediate suburbs of the large towns there is no ambition beyond that of rustic comfort in the buildings on the shore . There is no such thing , apparently , as a summer cottage , with its mock humility of name , up or down the whole tortuous length of the Ohio . As yet the land is not openly depraved by shows of wealth ; those who amass it either keep it to themselves ur come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to waste it unrecognized on the ungrateful Atlantic seaboard . The only distinctions that are marked are between the homes of honest industry above the banks and the homes below them of the leisure which it is hoped is not dishonest . But , honest or dishonest , it is there apparently to stay , in the house-boats which line the shores by thousands , and repeat on Occidental terms in our new land the river life of old and far Cathay . They formed the only feature of their travel which our tourists found absolutely novel ; they could clearly or dimly recall from the past every other feature but the house-boats , which they instantly and gladly naturalized to their memories of it . The houses had in common the form of a freight-car set in a flat-bottomed boat ; the car would be shorter or longer , with one or two or three windows in its sides , and a section of stove-pipe softly smoking from its roof . The windows might be curtained or they might be bare , but apparently there was no other distinction among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the willows , or tied to an elm or a maple . or even made fast to a stake on shore . There were cases in which they had not followed the fall of the river promptly enough , and lay slanted on the beach , or propped up to a more habitable level on its slope ; in a sole sad instance the house had gone down with the boat , and lay wallowing in the wash of the flood . But they all gave evidence of a tranquil and unhurried life which the soul of the beholder envied within him , whether itmanifested itself in the master of the house-boat fishing from its bow , or the lady coming to cleanse some household utensil at its stern . Infrequently a group of the house-boat dwellers seemed to be drawing a net , and in one high event they exhibited a good-sized fish of their capture , but nothing so strenuous characterized their attitude on any other occasion . The accepted theory of them was that they did by day as nearly nothing as men could do and live , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farms supplied the simple needs of people who desired neither to toil nor to spin , but only to emulate Solomon in his glory with the least possible exertion . The joyful witness of their ease would willingly have sacrificed to them any amount of the facile industrial or agricultural prosperity about them , and left them slumbrously atloat , unmolested by dreams of landlord or tax - gatherer . Their existence , for the fleeting time , seemed the true interpretation of the sage 's philosophy , the fulfilment of the poet 's aspire . tion . Why should we only toil that are the roof and crown of things ? How did they pass their illimitable leisure , when they rested from the fishing-net by day and the chicken-coop by night ? Did they read the new historical fictions aloud to one another ? Did some of them even meditate the thankless Muse and not mind her ingratitude ? Perhaps the ladies of the house-boats , when they found themselves , as they often did , in companies of four or five , had each other in to " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper on some artistic or literary topic ? Iv The trader 's boat , of an elder and more authentic tradition , sometimes shouldered the house-boats away from a village landing ; but it too was a peaceful home , where the family life visibly went hand in hand with commerce . When the trader has supplied all the wants and wishes of a neighborhood , he unmoors his craft , and drops down the river 's tide to where it meets the ocean 's tide in the farthermost Mississippi , and there either sells out both his boat and stock , or hitches his home to some returning steamboat , and climbs slowly , with many pauses , back to the upper Ohio . But his home is not so interesting as that of the houseboat man , nor so picturesque as that of the raftsman , whose floor of logs rocks flexibly under his shanty , but securely rides the current . As the pilots said , a steamboat never tries to hurt a raft of logs , which is adapted to dangerous retaliation ; and by night it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the raft from a swaying pole . By day the raft forms one of the pleasantest aspects of the river life , with its convoy of skiffs always searching the stream or shore for logs which have broken from it , and which the skiffmen recognize by distinctive brands or stamps . Here and there the logs lie in long ranks upon the shelving beaches , mixed with the drift of trees and fence rails , and frames of corn-cribs and hen-coops , and even house walls , which the freshets have brought down and left stranded . The tops of the little willows are tufted gayly with hay and rags and other spoil of the flood , and in one place a disordered mattress was lodged high among the boughs of a water-maple , where it would form building material for countless generations of birds . The fat corn-fields were often littered with a varied wreckage , which the farmers must soon heap together and burn , to be rid of it , and everywhere were proofs of the river 's power to devastate as well as enrich its shores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its moments of insensate rage , and the land no protection from its encroachments except in the simple device of the willow hedges , which , if planted , sometimes refused to grow , but often came of themselves , and kept the torrent from the loose unfathomable soil of the banks , otherwise crumbling helplessly into it , The rafts were very well , and the houseboats and the traders ' boats , but the most majestic feature of the river life was the tow of coal-barges , which , going or coming , the Avonek met every few miles . Whether going or coming they were pushed , not pulled , by the powerful steamer which gathered them in tens and twenties before her , and rode the mid-current with them when they were full , or kept the slower water near shore when they were empty . They claimed the riverwhere they passed , and the Avonek bowed to an unwritten law in giving them the full right of way , from the time when their low bulk first came in sight , with the chimneys of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making themselves seen , till she receded from the encounter , with a wheel at her stern pouring a cataract of yellow water from its blades . It was insurpassably picturesque , always ; sad not the tapering masts or the swelling sails of any sea-going craft could match it . V So at least the travellers thought who were here revisiting the earliest scenes of childhood , and who perhaps found them unduly endeared . They perused them mostly from an easy seat at the bow of the hurricane-deck , and whenever the weather favored them spent the idle time in selecting shelters for their declining years among the farmsteads that offered themselves to their choice up and down the shores . The weather commonly favored them , and there was at least one whole day on the lower river when the weather was divinely flattering . The soft , dull air lulled their nerves while it buffeted their faces , and the sun , that looked through veils of mist and smoke , gently warmed their aging frames and found itself again in their hearts . Perhaps it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the redbirds sang , and the drifting flocks of blackbirds called and clattered ; but surely these also spread their gray and pink against the sky and filled it with their voices . There were meadow-larks and robins without as well as within , and it was no subjective plough that turned the earliest furrows in those most opulent fields . When they were tired of sitting there , they climbed , invited or uninvited , but always welcomed , to the pilot - house , where either pilot of the two who were always on watch poured out in an unstinted stream the lore of the river on which all their days had been passed . They knew from indelible association every everchanging line of the constant hills ; every dwelling by the low banks ; every aspect of the smoky towns ; every caprice of the river ; every tree , every stump ; every bud and bird in the sky , probably . They talked only of the river ; they cared for nothing else . The Cuban cumber and the Philippine folly were equally far from them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had never been here , but as if he never had been ; no public question concerned them but that of abandoning the canals , which the Ohio Legislature was then foolishly debating . Were not the canals waterways too , like the river , and if the State unnaturally abandoned them would it not be for the behoof of those railroads which the river-men had always fought , and which would have made a solitude of the river if they could ? But they could not , and there was nothing more surprising and delightful in this blissful voyage than the evident fact that the old river traffic had strongly survived , and seemed to be more strongly reviving . Perhaps it was not ; perhaps the fondness of those Ohio-river-horn observers was abused by an illusion ( as subjective as that of the buds and birds ) of a vivid variety of business and pleasure on the beloved stream . But again , perhaps not . They were seldom out of sight of substantial proofs of both in the through or way packets they encountered , or the nondescript @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and climbed their shallowing courses into the recesses of their remotest hills , to the last lurking-places of their oil and coal . VI The Avoitek was always stopping to put off or take on merchandise or men . She would stop for a single passenger , planted in the mud with his telescope valise or gripsack under the edge of a lonely corn-field , or to gather upon her decks the few or many casks or bales that a farmer wished to ship . She Jay long hours by the wharf-boats of busy towns , exchanging one cargo for another , in that anarchic fetching and carrying which we call commerce , and which we drolly suppose to he governed by laws . But wherever she paused or parted she tested the pilot 's marvellous skill , for no landing , DO matter how often she landed in the same place , could be twice the same . At each return the varying stream and shore must be studied , and every caprice of either divined . It was always a triumph , a miracle , whether by day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pilot 's inspired touch she glided softly to her moorings , and without a jar slipped from them again , and went on her course . But the landings by night were of course the finest . Then the wide fan of the search-light was unfurled upon the point to be attained , and the heavy staging lowered from the bow to the brink , perhaps crushing the willow hedges in its fall , and scarcely touching the land before a black ragged deck-hand had run out through the splendor and made a line fast to the trunk of the nearest tree . Then the work of lading or unlading rapidly began in the witching play of the light , that set into radiant relief the black eager faces and the black eager figures of the deck-hands struggling up or down the staging under boxes of heavy wares , or kegs of nails , or bales of straw , or blocks of stone , steadily mocked or cursed at in their shapeless effort , till the last of them reeled hack to the deck down the steep of the lifting stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could coil himself doglike down among the heaps of freight .
