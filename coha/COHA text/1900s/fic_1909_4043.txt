A LIST TO STARBOARD *** Produced by David Widger A LIST TO STARBOARD By F. Hopkinson Smith 1909 I A short , square chunk of a man walked into a shipping office on the East Side , and inquired for the Manager of the Line . He had kindly blue eyes , a stub nose , and a mouth that shut to like a rat-trap , and stayed shut . Under his chin hung a pair of half-moon whiskers which framed his weather-beaten face as a spike collar frames a dog 's . " You do n't want to send this vessel to sea again , " blurted out the chunk . " She ought to go to the dry-dock . Her boats have n't had a brushful of paint for a year ; her boilers are caked clear to her top flues , and her pumps wo n't take care of her bilge water . Charter something else and lay her up . " The Manager turned in his revolving chair and faced him . He was the opposite of the Captain in weight , length , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sixty with a pair of uncertain , badly aimed eyes and a voice like the purr of a cat . " Oh , my dear Captain , you surely do n't mean what you say . She is perfectly seaworthy and sound . Just look at her inspection  --  " and he passed him the certificate . " No  --  I do n't want to see it ! I know ' em by heart : it 's a lie , whatever it says . Give an inspector twenty dollars and he 's stone blind . " The Manager laughed softly . He had handled too many rebellious captains in his time ; they all had a protest of some kind  --  it was either the crew , or the grub , or the coal , or the way she was stowed . Then he added softly , more as a joke than anything else : " Not afraid , are you , Captain ? " A crack started from the left-hand corner of the Captain 's mouth , crossed a fissure in his face , stopped within half an inch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile of derision . " What I 'm afraid of is neither here nor there . There 's cattle aboard  --  that is , there will be by to-morrow night ; and there 's a lot of passengers booked , some of ' em women and children . It is n't honest to ship ' em and you know it ! As to her boilers send for the Chief Engineer . He 'll tell you . You call it taking risks ; I call it murder ! " " And so I understand you refuse to obey the orders of the Board ?  --  and yet she 's got to sail on the 16th if she sinks outside . " " When I refuse to obey the orders of the Board I 'll tell the Board , not you . And when I do tell ' em I 'll tell ' em something else , and that is , that this chartering of worn-out tramps , painting ' em up and putting ' em into the Line , has got to stop , or there 'll be trouble . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then we 'll overhaul her . " " I 've heard that lie for a year . She 'll run as long as they can insure her and her cargo . As for the women and children , I suppose they do n't count  --  " and he turned on his heel and left the office . On the way out he met the Chief Engineer . " Do the best you can , Mike , " he said ; " orders are we sail on the 16th. " ***** On the fourth day out this conversation took place in the smoking-room between a group of passengers . " Regular tub , this ship ! " growled the Man-Who-Knew-It-All to the Bum Actor . " Screw out of the water every souse she makes ; lot of dirty sailors skating over the decks instead of keeping below where they belong ; Chief Engineer loafing in the Captain 's room every chance he gets  --  there he goes now  --  and it 's the second time since breakfast . And the Captain is no better ! And just look at the accommodations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look after thirty-five passengers ? Half the time I have to wait an hour to get something to eat  --  such as it is . And my bunk was n't made up yesterday until plumb night . That bunch in the steerage must be having a hard time . " " We get all we pay for , " essayed the Travelling Man . " She ai n't rigged for cabin passengers , and the Captain do n't want ' em . Did n't want to take me  --  except our folks had a lot of stuff aboard . Had enough passengers , he said . " " Well , he took the widow and her two kids "  --  continued the Man-Who-Knew-It-All  --  " and they were the last to get aboard . Half the time he 's playing nurse instead of looking after his ship . Had ' em all on the bridge yesterday . " " He had to take ' em , " protested the Travelling Man . " She was put under his charge by his owners  --  so one of the stewards told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he ! Yes  --  I 've been there before . No use talking  --  this line 's got to be investigated , and I 'm going to do the investigating as soon as I get ashore , and do n't you forget it ! What 's your opinion ? " The Bum Actor made no reply . He had been cold and hungry too many days and nights to find fault with anything . But for the generosity of a few friends he would still be tramping the streets , sleeping where he could . Three meals a day  --  four , if he wanted them  --  and a bed in a room all to himself instead of being one in a row of ten , was heaven to him . What the Captain , or the Engineer , or the crew , or anybody else did , was of no moment , so he got back alive . As to the widow 's children , he had tried to pick up an acquaintance with them himself  --  especially the boy  --  but she had taken them away when she saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now spoke up . He was a tall , raw-boned man , with a red chin-whisker and red , weather-scorched face , whose clothing looked as if it had been pulled out of shape in the effort to accommodate itself to the spread of his shoulders and round of his thighs . His trousers were tucked in his boots , the straps hanging loose . He generally sat by himself in one corner of the cramped smoking-room , and seldom took part in the conversation . The Bum Actor and he had exchanged confidences the night before , and the Texan therefore felt justified in answering in his friend 's stead . " You 're way off , friend , " he said to the Man-Who-Knew-It-All . " There ai n't nothin ' the matter with the Line , nor the ship , nor the Captain . This is my sixth trip aboard of her , and I know ! They had a strike among the stevedores the day we sailed , and then , too , we 've got a scrub lot of stokers below , and the Captain 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets ugly when anything happens . I had sixty head of cattle aboard here on my last trip over , and some of ' em got loose in a storm , and there was hell to pay with the crew till things got straightened out . I ai n't much on shootin ' irons , but they came handy that time . I helped and I know . Got a couple in my cabin now . Need n't tell me nothin ' about the Captain . He 's all there when he 's wanted , and it do n't take him more'n a minute , either , to get busy . " The door of the smoking-room opened and the object of his eulogy strolled in . He was evidently just off the bridge , for the thrash of the spray still glistened on his oilskins and on his gray , half-moon whiskers . That his word was law aboard ship , and that he enforced it in the fewest words possible , was evident in every line of his face and every tone of his voice . If he deserved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on board  --  least of all from Carhart  --  the Man-Who-Knew-It-All . Loosening the thong that bound his so'wester to his chin , he slapped it twice across a chair back , the water flying in every direction , and then faced the room . " Mr. Bonner . " " Yes , sir , " answered the big-shouldered Texan , rising to his feet . " I 'd like to see you for a minute , " and without another word the two men left the room and made their way in silence down the wet deck to where the Chief Engineer stood . " Mike , this is Mr. Bonner ; you remember him , do n't you ? You can rely on his carrying out any orders you give him . If you need another man let him pick him out  --  " and he continued on to his cabin . Once there the Captain closed the door behind him , shutting out the pound and swash of the sea ; took from a rack over his bunk a roll of charts , spread one on a table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The door opened and the Chief Engineer again stood beside him . The Captain raised his head . " Will Bonner serve ? " he asked . " Yes , glad to , and he thinks he 's got another man . He 's what he calls out his way a ' tenderfoot , ' he says , but he 's game and can be depended on . Have you made up your mind where she 'll cross ? "  --  and he bent over the chart . The Captain picked up a pair of compasses , balanced them for a moment in his fingers , and with the precision of a seamstress threading a needle , dropped the points astride a wavy line known as the steamer track . The engineer nodded : " That will give us about twenty-two hours leeway , " he said gravely , " if we make twelve knots . " " Yes , if you make twelve knots : can you do it ? " " I ca n't say ; depends on that gang of shovellers and the way they behave . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of ' em . If they get ugly there ai n't but one thing left ; that , I suppose , you wo n't object to . " The Captain paused for a moment in deep thought , glanced at the pin prick in the chart , and said with a certain forceful meaning in his voice : " No  --  not if there 's no other way . " The Chief Engineer waited , as if for further reply , replaced his cap , and stepped out into the wind . He had got what he came for , and he had got it straight . With the closing of the door the Captain rolled up the chart , laid it in its place among the others , readjusted the thong of his so'wester , stopped for a moment before a photograph of his wife and child , looked at it long and earnestly , and then mounted the stairs to the bridge . With the exception that the line of his mouth had straightened and the knots in his eyebrows tightened , he was , despite the smoking-room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defied the Manager the week before . II When Bonner , half an hour later , returned to the smoking-room ( he , too , had caught the splash of the sea , the spray drenching the rail ) , the Bum Actor crossed over and took the seat beside him . The Texan was the only passenger who had spoken to him since he came aboard , and he had already begun to feel lonely . This time he started the conversation by brushing the salt spray from the Agent 's coat . " Got wet , did n't you ? Too bad ! Wait till I wipe it off , " and he dragged a week-old handkerchief from his pocket . Then seeing that the Texan took no notice of the attention , he added , " What did the Captain want ? " The Texan did not reply . He was evidently absorbed in something outside his immediate surroundings , for he continued to sit with bent back , his elbows on his knees , his eyes on the floor . Again the question was repeated : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is there ? " Fear had always been his master  --  fear of poverty mostly  --  and it was poverty in the worst form to others if he failed to get home . This thought had haunted him night and day . " Yes and no . Do n't worry  --  it 'll all come out right . You seem nervous . " " I am . I 've been through a lot and have almost reached the end of my rope . Have you got a wife at home ? " The Texan shook his head . " Well , if you had you 'd understand better than I can tell you . I have , and a three-year-old boy besides . I 'd never have left them if I 'd known . I came over under contract for a six months ' engagement and we were stranded in Pittsburg and had hard work getting back to New York . Some of them are there yet . All I want now is to get home  --  nothing else will save them . Here 's a letter from her I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I 'm up against . The boy never was strong . " The big Texan read it through carefully , handed it back without a comment or word of sympathy , and then , with a glance around him , as if in fear of being overheard , asked : " Can you keep your nerve in a mix-up ? " " Do you mean a fight ? " queried the Actor . " Maybe . " " I do n't like fights  --  never did . " Anything that would imperil his safe return was to be avoided . " I neither  --  but sometimes you 've got to . Are you handy with a gun ? " " Why ? " " Nothing  --  I 'm only asking . " Carhart , the Man-Who-Knew-It-All , here lounged over from his seat by the table and dropped into a chair beside them , cutting short his reply . The Texan gave a significant look at the Actor , enforcing his silence , and then buried his face in a newspaper a month old . Carhart spread his legs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stiff-brim hat until it made a thatch for his nose , and began one of his customary growls : to the room  --  to the drenched port-holes  --  to the brim of his hat ; as a half-asleep dog sometimes does when things have gone wrong with him  --  or he dreams they have . " This ship reminds me of another old tramp , the Persia , " he drawled . " Same scrub crew and same cut of a Captain . Had n't been for two of the passengers and me , we 'd never got anywhere . Had a fire in the lower hold in a lot of turpentine , and when they put that out we found her cargo had shifted and she was down by the head about six feet . Then the crew made a rush for the boats and left us with only four leaky ones to go a thousand miles . They 'd taken ' em all , had n't been for me and another fellow who stood over them with a gun . " The Bum Actor raised his eyes . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice . " Oh , we pitched in and righted things and got into port at last . But the Captain was no good ; he 'd a-left with the crew if we 'd let him . " " Is the shifting of a cargo a serious matter ? " continued the Actor . " This is my second crossing and I 'm not much up on such things . " " Depends on the weather , " interpolated a passenger . " And on how she 's stowed , " continued Car-hart . " I 've been mistrusting this ship ai n't plumb on her keel . You can tell that from the way she falls off after each wave strikes her . I have been out on deck looking things over and she seems to me to be down by the stern more than she ought . " " Maybe she 'll be lighter when more coal gets out of her , " suggested another passenger . " Yes , but she 's listed some to starboard . I watched her awhile this morning . She ai n't loaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That occurs sometimes with a gang of striking stevedores . " The noon whistle blew and the talk ended with the setting of everybody 's watch , except the Bum Actor 's , whose timepiece decorated a shop-window in the Bowery. ***** That night one of those uncomfortable rumors , started doubtless by Carhart 's talk , shivered through the ship , its vibrations even reaching the widow lying awake in her cabin . This said that some hundreds of barrels of turpentine had broken loose and were smashing everything below . If any one of them rolled into the furnaces an explosion would follow which would send them all to eternity . That this absurdity was immediately denied by the purser , who asserted with some vehemence that there was not a gallon of turpentine aboard , did not wholly allay the excitement , nor did it stifle the nervous anxiety which had now taken possession of the passengers . As the day wore on several additional rumors joined those already extant . One was dropped in the ear of the Texan by the Bum Actor as the two stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapidly falling . " I got so worried I thought I 'd go down into the engine room myself , " he whispered . " I 'm just back . Something 's wrong down there , or I 'm mistaken . I wish you 'd go and find out . I knew that turpentine yarn was a lie , but I wanted to be sure , so I thought I 'd ask one of the stokers who had come up for a little air . He was about to answer me when the Chief Engineer came down from the bridge , where he had been talking to the Captain , and ordered the man below before he had time to fill his lungs . I waited a little while , hoping he or some of the crew would come up again , and then I went down the ladder myself . When I got to the first landing I came bump up against the Chief Engineer . He was standing in the gangway fooling with a revolver he had in his hand as if he 'd been cleaning it . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you came from , ' he said . ' This ai n't no place for passengers '  --  and up I came . What do you think it means ? I 'd get ugly , too , if he kept me in that heat and never let me get a whiff of air . I tell you , that 's an awful place down there . Suppose you go and take a look . Your knowing the Captain might make some difference . " " Were any of the stokers around ? " " No  --  none of them . I did n't see a soul but the Chief Engineer , and I did n't see him more than a minute . " The big Texan moved closer to the rail and again scrutinized the sky-line . He had kept this up all the morning , his eye searching the horizon as he moved from one side of the ship to the other . The inspection over , he slipped his arm through the Actor 's and started him down the deck toward the Cattle Agent 's cabin . When the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which had rested on it since the time the Captain had called him from the smoking-room . The Actor 's countenance , however , had undergone a change . All his nervous timidity was gone ; his lips were tightly drawn , the line of the jaw more determined . He looked like a man who had heard some news which had first steadied and then solidified him . These changes often overtake men of sensitive , highly strung natures . On the way back they encountered the Captain accompanied by the Chief Engineer . The two were heading for the saloon , the bugle having sounded for luncheon . As they passed by with their easy , swinging gait , the passengers watched them closely . If there was danger in the air these two officers , of all men , would know it . The Captain greeted the Texan with a significant look , waited until the Actor had been presented , looked the Texan 's friend over from head to foot , and then with a nod to several of the others halted opposite a steamer chair in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a baby and the other a boy of four  --  a plump , hugable little fellow , every inch of whose surface invited a caress . " Please stay a minute and let me talk to you , Captain , " the widow pleaded . " I 've been so worried . None of these stories are true , are they ? There ca n't be any danger or you would have told me  --  would n't you ? " The Captain laughed heartily , so heartily that even the Chief Engineer looked at him in astonishment . " What stories do you hear , my dear lady ? " " That the steamer is n't loaded properly ? " Again the Captain laughed , this time under the curls of the chubby boy whom he had caught in his arms and was kissing eagerly . " Not loaded right ? " he puffed at last when he got his breath . " Well , well , what a pity ! That yarn , I guess , comes from some of the navigators in the smoking-room . They generally run the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your toes and dance a jig for me . No  --  no  --  not that way  --  this way-r-out with them ! Here , let me show you . One  --  two  --  off we go . Now the pigeon wing and the double twist and the rat-tat-tat , rat-tat-tat  --  that 's the way , my lad ! " He had the boy 's hands now , the child shouting with laughter , the overjoyed mother clapping her hands as the big burly Captain with his face twice as red from the exercise , danced back and forth across the deck , the passengers forming a ring about them . " There ! " sputtered the Captain , all out of breath from the exercise , as he dropped the child back into the widow 's arms . " Now all of you come down to luncheon . The weather is getting better every minute . The glass is rising and we are going to have a fine night . " Carhart , who had watched the whole performance with an ill-concealed sneer on his face , muttered to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? He 's a pretty kind of a Captain , ai n't he ? He 's mashed on the widow just as I told you . Smoking-room yarn , is it ? I bet I could pick out half a dozen men right in them chairs who could run the ship as well as he does . Maybe we 'll have to take charge , after all  --  do n't you think so , Mr. Bonner ? " The Texan smiled grimly : " I 'll let you do the picking , Mr. Carhart  --  " and with his hand on the Actor 's arm , the two went below . A counter-current now swept through the ship . If anything was really the matter the Captain would not be dancing jigs , nor would he leave the bridge for his meals . This , like all other counter-currents  --  wave or otherwise  --  tossed up a bobble of dispute when the two clashed . There was no doubt about it : Carhart had been " talking through his hat "  --  " shooting off his mouth "  --  the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When appeal for confirmation was made to the Texan and the Actor , who now seemed inseparable , neither made reply . They evidently did not care to be mixed up in what Bonner characterized with a grim smile as " more hot air . " All through the meal the Captain kept up his good-natured mood ; chatting with the widow who sat on his right , the baby in her lap ; making a pig of a lemon and some tooth-picks for the boy , who had crawled up into his arms ; exchanging nods and smiles down the length of the table with several new arrivals , or congratulating those nearest to him on their recovery after the storm , ending by carrying both boy and baby to the upper deck  --  so that he might " not forget how to handle " his own when he got back , he laughed in explanation . III Luncheon over , the passengers , many of whom had been continuously in their berths , began to crowd the decks . These soon discovered that the ship was not on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called to the slant of the steamer chairs and the roll of an orange toward the scuppers . Explanation was offered by the Texan , who argued that the wind had hauled , and being then abeam had given her a list to starboard . This , while not wholly satisfactory to the more experienced , allayed the fears of the women  --  there were two or three on board beside the widow  --  who welcomed the respite from the wrench and stagger of the previous hours . Attention was now drawn by a nervous passenger to a gang of sailors under the First Officer , who were at work overhauling the boats on the forward deck , immediately under the eyes of the Captain who had returned to the bridge , as well as to an approaching wall of fog which , while he was speaking , had blanketed the ship , sending two of the boat gang on a run to the bow . The fog-horn also blew continuously , almost without intermission . Now and then it too would give three short , sharp snorts , as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups , some touch of sympathy , or previous acquaintance , or trait of courage but recently discovered , having drawn them together . Again the Captain passed down the deck . This time he stopped to light a cigarette from a passenger 's cigar , remarking as he did so that it was " as thick as pea soup on the bridge , but he thought it would lighten before morning . " Then halting beside the chair of an old lady who had but recently appeared on deck , he congratulated her on her recovery and kept on his way to the boats . The widow , however , was still anxious . " What are they doing with the boats ? " she asked , her eyes following the Captain 's disappearing figure . " Only overhauling them , madam , " spoke up the Texan , who had stationed himself near her chair . " But is n't that unusual ! " she inquired in a tremulous voice . " No , madam , just precaution , and always a safe one in a fog . Collision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to clear the davits . " " But the sailors are carrying up boxes and kegs and putting them in the boats ; what 's that for ? " broke in another passenger , who had been leaning over the forward rail . " Grub and water , I guess , " returned the Texan . " It 's a thousand miles to the nearest land , and there ai n't no bakery on the way that I know of . Ca n't be too careful when there 's women and babies aboard , especially little fellows like these  --  " and he ran his hand through the boy 's curls . " The Captain do n't take no chances . That 's what I like him for . " Again the current of hope submerged the current of despair . The slant of the deck , however , increased , although the wind had gone down ; so much so that the steamer chairs had to be lashed to the iron hand-hold skirting the wall of the upper cabins . So had the fog , which was now so dense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With the passing of the afternoon and the approach of night , thus deepening the gloom , there was added another and a new anxiety to the drone of the fog-horn . This was a Coston signal which flashed from the bridge , flooding the deck with light and pencilling masts and rigging in lines of fire . These flashes kept up at intervals of five minutes , the colors changing from time to time . An indefinable fear now swept through the vessel . The doubters and scoffers from the smoking-room who stood huddled together near the forward companion-way talked in whispers . The slant of the deck they argued might be due to a shift of the cargo  --  a situation serious , but not dangerous  --  but why burn Costons ? The only men who seemed to be holding their own , and who were still calm and undisturbed , were the Texan and the Actor . These , during the conference , had moved toward the flight of steps leading to the bridge and had taken their positions near the bottom step , but within reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his coat and slipped in his hand as if to be sure of something he did not want to lose . While this was going on the Captain left the bridge in charge of the Second Officer and descended to his cabin . Reaching over his bunk , he unhooked the picture of his wife and child , tore it from its frame , looked at it intently for a moment , and then , with a sigh , slid it into an inside pocket . This done , he stripped off his wet storm coat , thrust his arms into a close-fitting reefing jacket , unhooked a holster from its place , dropped its contents into his outside pocket , and walked slowly down the flight of steps to where the Texan and the Actor stood waiting . Then , facing the passengers , and in the same tone of voice with which he would have ordered a cup of coffee from a steward , he said : " My friends , I find it necessary to abandon the ship . There is time enough and no necessity for crowding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women and children will go first : this order will be literally carried out ; those who disobey it will have to be dealt with in another way . This , I hope , you will not make necessary . I will also tell you that I believe we are still within the steamer zone , although the fog and weather have prevented any observation . Do you stay here , madam . I 'll come for you when I am ready  --  " and he laid his hand encouragingly on the widow 's arm . With this he turned to the Texan and the Actor : " You understand , both of you , do you not , Mr. Bonner ? You and your friend will guard the aft companion-way , and help the Chief Engineer take care of the stokers and the steerage . I and the First Officer will fill the boats . " The beginning of a panic is like the beginning of a fire : first a curl of smoke licking through a closed sash , then a rush of flame , and then a roar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : A sharp command clearing the way , concentrated effort , and courage . Here the curl of smoke was an agonized shriek from an elderly woman who fell fainting on the deck ; the rush of flame was a wild surge of men hurling themselves toward the boats , and the roar which meant death was the frenzied throng of begrimed half-naked stokers and crazed emigrants who were wedged in a solid mass in the companion-way leading to the upper deck . The subduing was the same . Illustration : Back , all of you " Back , all of you ! " shouted the Engineer . " The first man who passes that door without my permission I 'll kill ! Five of you at a time  --  no crowding  --  keep ' em in line , Mr. Bonner  --  you and your friend ! " The Texan and the Bum Actor were within three feet of him as he spoke  --  the Texan as cool as if he were keeping count of a drove of steers , except that he tallied with the barrel of a six-shooter instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face was deathly white and his pistol hand trembled a little , but he did not flinch . He ranged the lucky ones in line farther along , and kept them there . " Anything to get home , " he had told the Texan when he had slipped Bonner 's other revolver , an hour before , into his pocket . On the saloon deck the flame of fear was still raging , although the sailors and the three stewards were so many moving automatons under the First Officer 's orders . The widow , with her baby held tight to her breast , had not moved from where the Captain had placed her , nor had she uttered a moan . The crisis was too great for anything but implicit obedience . The Captain had kept his word , and had told her when danger threatened ; she must now wait for what God had in store for her . The boy stood by the First Officer ; he had clapped his hands and laughed when he saw the first boat swung clear of the davits . Carhart was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had edged up close to the gangway where the boats were to be filled . Twice he had tried to wedge himself between the First Officer and the rail and twice had been pushed back  --  the last time with a swing that landed him against a pile of steamer chairs . All this time the fog-horn had kept up its monotonous din , the Costons flaring at intervals . The stoppage of either would only have added to the terror now partly allayed by the Captain 's encouraging talk , which was picked up and repeated all over the ship . The first boat was now ready for passengers . " This way , madam  --  you first  --  " the Captain said to the widow . " You must go alone with the baby , and I  --  " He did not finish the sentence . Something had caught his ear  --  something that made him lunge heavily toward the rail , his eyes searching the gloom , his hand cupped to his ear . " Hold hard , men ! " he cried . " Keep still-all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stillness of the night came the moan of a distant fog-horn . This was followed by a wild cheer from the men at the boat davits . At the same instant a dim , far-away light cut its way through the black void , burned for a moment , and disappeared like a dying star . Another cheer went up . This time the watch on the foretop and the men astride the nose sent it whirling through the choke and damp with an added note of joy . The Captain turned to the widow . " That 's her  --  that 's the St. Louis ! I 've been hoping for her all day , and did n't give up until the fog shut in . " " And we can stay here ! " " No  --  we have n't a moment to lose . Our fires are nearly out now . We 've been in a sinking condition for forty-eight hours . We sprung a leak where we could n't get at it , and our pumps are clogged . " Stand aside , men ! All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them both  --  give me the boy ,  --  I 'll bring him in the last boat . "
