txt When Judge Ben Lindsey of Colorado , the highest authority in the United Statqs on juvenile courts , was asked what effect the influence of a voting constituency of mothers had had in the success of the Juvenile Court system of Colorado , he replied : " The Juvenile Court of Denver has always had back of it the support of the women , and whatever successes it may be credited with is largely , if not entirely , due to their efforts . " The results of woman suffrage in Colorado have been so satisfactory that It is hard to understand how ; t encounters opposition in other States . I have never observed one evil as the result of woman 's suff rage . " We have in Colorado the most advanced laws of any State in the Union for the care and protection of the home and the children , the very foundation of the Republic . These laws , in my opinion , would not exist at this time if it were not for the powerful influence of woman 's suffrage , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have conscientiously and faithfully administered them . " I know that the politicians in both parties reckon seriously with the woman vote . and I know that men of immoral character have been refused places upon party tickets because of the fear inspired by the woman vote . " We believe we have the best juvenile law , The best child labor law , the best compulsory education law , the best laws for the prevention of cruelty to children 0101 the enforcement of the obligations of fathers to support wife and child , and the best administration of these laws of any city of the Union . " In view of the fact that every irresponsible , unreliable , and malicious canard of tho failure of woman suffrage in Colorado i seized upon to exploit their predictions by opponents of political power for women , tho testimony of a man like Judge Lindsey . an acknowledged expert In child saving , will be of value to those who want the truth in regard to woman suffrage in practice .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
