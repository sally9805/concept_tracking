 | THE subject assigned to me for this article is certain rights of the individual , in respect of how and when he may be arrested , or his house may be invaded , by government , i.e. , by the police , and of whether he may resist unlawful interferences and trespasses by the police against his person or house . The unlawful and oppressive arrests and invasions of houses which had so long been habitual in the former city of New York ( owing not to the membership of the rank and file of the police force , for that was and is really of good quality , but to the sort of persons who had usually been put in rulership over that force for more than a generation ) , and which seem to continue unchecked in the new city , with no apparent sign of any one in the city government being conscious that the police may not lawfully invade houses and arrest and shove people about right and left at pleasure , serve to make such an article timely . As the law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police intrusion is the same throughout the English-speaking world ( if not , indeed , wherever else free government exists ) , what is here said is of general application , although laws of the State of New York may be particularly cited . I The difference between free government and despotism is easily stated . Under a free government every one is a law unto himself , except in so far as precise law , made by the direct vote of the qualified electors of the people themselves ( as is generally the case with our State constitutions in this country ) , or else by their chosen representatives in legislature assembled ( as is the case with our statute laws ) , permits him or his property to be touched by government . Under a despotism , the reverse is  | the case ; government is under no restraint or control of the governed , and takes the life , liberty and property of the individual at will ; and between these two extremes of government there are , of course , various gradations . A free government is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and those put in official place are the mere servants of the people . The people make the laws , and putting some of their own number in authority for the purposes of government , say to them : " These laws are your power of attorney to act for us ; read them carefully and keep within them ; it is not for you to say they do not give you power enough , and to go beyond them ; we have our reasons therefor , taught by experience , and that suffices ; our lives and liberties you may not take or interfere with to any extent whatever , except as we permit and in the way we direct therein ; you may take of our property for the necessities of government , but only to the amount and in the manner we prescribe therein . " The experience of history shows that free government , once established , can be preserved only by the individual standing upon his rights , or , more pointedly speaking , keeping government , i.e. , the officers and agents of government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lived up to by Englishmen everywhere ; it seems to be ingrained in them , and is entirely consistent with the highest loyalty to government . But in some parts of this country , at all events in the City of New York , and in some few places which have followed its abuses , it has gradually come to be scarcely understood at all in respect of the right of peace officers , i.e. , of the police , to make arrests , to invade houses , and the like . A small encroachment of arbitrary power by government leads quite inevitably , if suffered without opposition , to greater and greater ones , and to a growing multitude of them , accompanied by general extortion and blackmail , and ending in the temporary or permanent destruction of free government . Cicero said of Julius Cesar that as he looked at him adjusting his hair so nicely and scratching his head with one finger , it never occurred to him that such a man could conceive so vast and fatal a design as the destruction of the Roman commonwealth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the rights and liberties of the citizen . They appear at first , if noticed at all , as commonplace and harmless as the very ordinary-looking man  | Caesar scratching his head appeared to Cicero ; and yet they are germs pregnant with the destruction of free government . It is often of little consequence , and seldom of great consequence , whether an individual suspected or actually guilty of a criminal offence be arrested or convicted of it ; but it is always of transcendent importance that he be not arrested or convicted except in accordance with those restrictions and safeguards which the people , taught by dire experience , and guarding against a recurrence of arbitrary power , have by their constitutions and laws prescribed . We have in our fundamental instruments of government in this country , called constitutions and bills of rights , certain guaranties of individual liberties and rights , including freedom from unlawful arrests , invasions and searches , which we inherit from Magna Charta and the common law of England . No one who bows the history of these guaranties , and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally attained them , can see them infringed , much less defied and set at naught , without a feeling of resentment . They are the warp and the woof of our system of laws and government , and without them free government can not exist . II The manner in which a person could be lawfully arrested was settled by the common law of England . That law was brought to this country by the colonists , was inherited by us , and still remains our law except in so far as it has been changed by statute . The common law defining and limiting the right to arrest has remained substantially unchanged with us . In some States it has been reduced to statutes , and in some not . In the State of New York it was made part of our Code of Criminal Procedure , which was enacted in 1881 ; and , as an article like this is of no value unless it is instructive , and as I feel for obvious reasone that I should not here enter upon any disputed questions of law , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that Code which " define the right and power of arrest . And it should be held in mind that I am speaking of arrests without a warrant , i.e. , a warrant of arrest obtained from a magistrate or court , for of course when such a warrant is delivered to an officer he is bound to obey it , and every one is bound to yield to its commands . Warrants of arrest are not delivered to private persons to be executed . We shall arrive at a better understanding of the right and  | power of police officers to arrest without a warrant by first seeing what right and power private individuals have to make arrests . Every person always had , by common law , the right to make certain arrests without a warrant . It was not necessary to be an officer to make such arrests . That is still the law with us , the common law being expressed by section 183 of the Code of Criminal Procedure , which is as follows : " A private person may arrest another , " 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; " 2 . When the person arrested has committed a felony , although not in his presence . " By the express terms of this statute , which is only declaratory of the common law , every private person is given the right and the power to arrest and take before a magistrate without a warrant any person who commits " in his presence " any crime , whether of the lesser and sometimes trivial kind called a misdemeanor , or of the graver kind called a felony ( for " crimes " are divided into " felonies " and " misdemeanors , " all those which are punishable by imprisonment in State prison or by death being felonies ) ; and , furthermore , if a felony has in fact been committed , although not in his presence , he may in like manner arrest the person who committed it . Such is the right and the power of every person to make arrests ? that is to say , if any criminal offence , high or low , felony or misdemeanor , be committed in his presence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ; and if a felony has in fact been committed , he may in the same way arrest the person who committed it , although it was not committed in his presence . To this should be added , in order to make the statement complete , that if no felony has in fact been committed , or if the person arrested did not commit the felony which has in fact been committed , then the arrest is unlawful , and the person arrested may on being discharged maintain against the person who arrested him an action for damages therefor and for the ensuing imprisonment In the same way , of course , if a person should arrest one for committing a criminal offence , whether felony or misdemeanor , in his presence , and it should turn out that no criminal offence was committed , and that the arrest was therefore a false one , the same kind of an action for damages would lie . In such an action the jury are the judges of whether the person arrested committed the offence .  | Having seen the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private person now and from the earliest times , we are more alert to know what additional right and power of arrest without a warrant , if any , police officers possess . Many intelligent and educated persons in the City of New York are surprised and wholly incredulous when told that officers have no right or power to arrest without a warrant which every citizen has not ; that an officer is given no more right by law to arrest without a warrant than that given by law to every citizen , excepting in one not very substantial particular in the case of felonies , which will be hereinafter specified . Such surprise and incredulity arise from the fact that the residents of the City of New York have so long witnessed a contrary practice by the police that they have forgotten their rights as free men under Anglo-Saxon law . While all citizens have this " right " to arrest , it is not their " duty " to make arrests , nor have they the time for such work . They have , therefore , provided by their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their substance , of certain of their number called " peace officers , " or " police officers , " for such work ; but in their laws they have taken most scrupulous care to give these officers no right or power of arrest without a warrant , in the case of misdemeanors , which every citizen does not possess ( instead of making them a law unto themselves , as has grown to be the general notion in the City of New York ) , and scarcely any other power in the case of felonies , as will appear by the section of the Code of Criminal Procedure to be presently quoted in full . A policeman ( to speak so plainly that every one may understand ) is only a citizen dressed in blue clothes and brass buttons ( and sometimes with a club in his belt or pocket ) , with no right or lawful power of arrest without a warrant which all his fellow-citizens do not possess ; and he should be taught by those in authority over him never to forget this fact . His fellowcitizens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honorable servant , with no power to arrest any one except as precisely provided by law . Section 177 of the said Code , which substantially follows and codifies the common law , prescribes when an officer may arrest without a warrant , and is as follows : " A peace officer may , without a warrant , arrest a person , " 1 . For a crime committed or attempted in his presence ;  | " 2 . When the person arrested has committed a felony , although not in his presence ; " 3 . When a felony has in fact been committed , and he has reasonable cause for believing the person to be arrested to have committed it " A comparison of this section with the one defining the right and power to arrest given to all private persons , which is quoted in full above , shows that it is identical therewith , except that a third sub-division is added , making it lawful for an officer to arrest without a warrant " when a felony has in fact been committed , " although not committed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for believing the person to be arrested to have committed it . " As has already been seen , a private person has also the same right to arrest without a warrant for a felony which has in fact been committed , although not in his presence ; but if he arrest the wrong person , i.e. , a person who did not commit the felony , he is liable absolutely in an action against him by such person for damages for false arrest and imprisonment . The additional provision in the case of an officer exempts him from liability in such an action for damages , provided he acted on " reasonable cause for believing " that the person arrested was the right person . The jury in such an action are the judges of whether he had such reasonable cause . Except for this latitude and immunity in favor of officers in this one particular , there is no difference in respect of the right and power of officers and private persons to make arrests without a warrant , and their responsibility therefor in actions for damages for false @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of misdemeanors , and only this one in respect of felonies , and it has been mentioned and explained here only for the sake of exactness ; for it might be passed over as not substantially affecting the precise matter under consideration . By the common law it may be that such reasonable cause for belief could also be acted upon by an officer in respect of the question whether any felony had in fact been committed , as well as in respect of the identity of the person who committed it . The law does not and never did tolerate the idea that any one may be arrested without a warrant by a police officer , any more than by a private person , for an alleged criminal offence of the grade of misdemeanor , unless it was emitted in his presence . If a police officer knows , or thinks he knows , of facts which show  | that a person has committed a criminal offence of the grade of misdemeanor , but which was not committed in his presence , there is only one course for him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warrant , but his duty , and the full extent of his right , is , like any other citizen , to go before a magistrate , make a written complaint on oath of the facts and cause a warrant to be issued , and then the arrest can be made on the warrant . If the officer does not know such facts , but some person who professes to know them tells him of them , the officer can not himself obtain a warrant , much less make the arrest without a warrant , on such hearsay . His duty is to direct such person to a magistrate to make the written complaint on oath necessary to obtain a warrant ; and , in some grave cases , it may be his duty to accompany such person before the magistrate . The very same is the case in respect of felonies ; except , as has been seen , that an officer , the same as a private person , no more and no less , may , if a felony has in fact been committed , arrest without a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committed in his presence ; with only the additional right and safeguard , as we have seen , in favor of an officer , that if a felony has in fact been committed , he may arrest without a warrant on reasonable cause for belief in respect of who the guilty person is . The ancient reason for the enlarged right of arrest without a warrant to both private persons and officers in the case of felonies , is to prevent fleeing felons from escaping . The foregoing is , in the State of New York , all plain statute law , and is equally plain wherever it has not yet been reduced to statute . It has been declared by the courts many times . It is not new with us , but was inherited by us as part of the common law of England , and is common to every free state . It is the inheritance by right of every English-speaking people . It marks the difference between a free government and a despotism . It is thoroughly understood by the people in every locality in this country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it may be , a few other places ) , where the rights and liberties of the people , especially of the weak and uninfluential , who should be the chief objects of the protection of government , have been so long trampled upon by the sort of persons who have been put in rulership over the police , that the citizens have forgotten them . So far , indeed , has this gone that the police of the City of New York may without a warrant  | raid , arrest , and lock up over night several hundred people from all parts of the United States found in a public room or hall , against whom there is no pretence of any criminal charge whatever ; or drive the lawful delegates to a political convention out of the convention hall at the request or command of some political leader or boss ; or drag duly registered voters away from the polls while in the very act of voting , and in order to prevent them from voting ; or suppress free speech by breaking up meetings and driving the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without exciting any public protest whatever . Can a community in which such a state of things exists be said to be under the rule of AngloSaxon law and liberty at all ? What a contrast is presented by the conduct of government in England , in respect of the guaranteed liberties of the individual ! There the unlawful arrest by the police of the humblest woman or man arouses a public protest which the Crown has to heed for its own safety , and which becomes the subject of question and condemnation in Parliament next day . The unlawful arrest in London of one-tenth the number of persons lawlessly arrested by peace officers in the City of New York on last election day would cause a revolution there , unless prompt and full redress were given by the government , including the dismissal and also the indictment of the officers guilty of the oppression ; for such oppression is a grave criminal offence . That such outrages are not forcibly resisted by our people does not so much testify to their well known peaceable character as to the extent to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which characterizes a free people . III The right of the individual to be secure in his house or dwelling against an invasion and search thereof by the police without a warrant , is another of our inheritances from the common law of England . When the powerful and the great built castles , and surrounded them with wall and moat , and haughtily prevented even the king from entering without their consent , the genius of a whole people , instinct with love of liberty and of constitutional government , was quick to seize the opportunity to declare what now sounds in the city of New York as an empty boast , though it became and remains a great constitutional maxim , with a history and a literature all its own , viz. , that every man 's house  | is his castle . Its declaration was a revolution in government and in human liberty . It is still as pregnant of the individual rights and liberties of a free people as when it first emanated from what Coke called the unpolished genius of the people . It is as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his speech against the unconstitutional practice of issuing general or roving warrants for searches and arrests : " The poorest man may in his cottage bid defiance to all the forces of the Crown . It may be frail ; its roof may shake ; the wind may blow through it ; the storm may enter ; the rain may enter ; but the King of England may not enter ; all his force dares not cross the threshold of the ruined tenement . " The practice of issuing warrants which did not specify the persons or property to be seized , finally received its death blow from Wilkes and from the judicial decisions of Lords Mansfield and Camden . When such a warrant was served on Wilkes , he called it " a ridiculous warrant against the whole English nation " ; and for being arrested under it he obtained a verdict for one thousand pounds in an action for damages for false imprisonment ? a verdict for a sum so large in that day as to show in itself the liberty-loving spirit of the English people . What would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been without any warrant at all , as has been the case thousands of times in the City of New York , or more particularly in the County of New York ( for there are four counties within the limits of the present City of New York ) ? The Constitution of the United States contains the following provision , declaratory of the common law : " The right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , shall not be violated ; and no warrants shall issue but upon probable cause , supported by oath or affirmation , and particularly describing the place to be searched , and the persons or things to be seized . " This provision of the Federal Constitution is , of course , operative on the Federal Government only ; but it is adopted , word for word , in the ancient Bill of Rights of the State of New York , and is to be found in one form or another in our State constitutions or bills of rights generally . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officer should attempt to search one 's house or rooms without such a warrant , or with a warrant not " particularly de- scribing the place to be searched , and the persons or things to be seized , " he would be acting without authority and would be a trespasser . If an officer should without a warrant enter the residence of that Judge of the Court of General Sessions of the Peace of the County of New York who is called by the ancient name of Recorder , or the residence of a Justice of the Supreme Court of the State , or of the Mayor of the city , and say , " I suspect this is a. house of ill-fame , or a gambling-house , and am going to search it , " and should search it by force , the dangerous lawlessness of his act , not merely against an individual and the public peace , but against free government , would be manifest to all , and would be loudly denounced . And yet such acts committed against the influential and the great would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the endurance of free government , as when committed generally , or against the humble , the weak and the unfortunate , who should be the first to receive the good-will and protection of government . To say that a " suspicious " or " bad " place should be entered and searched without a warrant , would be to beg the whole question . Who is to say that it is suspicious or bad , whether it be the Recorder 's house or some other house ? The " law of the land " does not leave the decision of the matter to any police authority , however high , but requires that it be submitted in advance , on sworn testimony showing facts , to a magistrate or court . The principal duty of the police is to preserve the public peace , and keep outward order and decency . When they are permitted or used by those in authority over them to depart from this , and to go beyond the law by invading houses or rooms without warrants , and arresting in the same way for misdemeanors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as experience shows , is general oppression , extortion and blackmail by them upon the community . They , or more likely those in control of them , will accept money to refrain from their lawless invasions and arrests ; but that is impossible if they act with warrants in their hands , as the law requires . Crimes and vices are evils to the community ; but it behooves a free people never to forget that they have more to fear from the growth of the one vice of arbitrary power in government than from all other vices and crimes combined . It debases everybody , and brings in its train all of the vices . Societies , and private enthusiasts , for the " suppression of vice , "  | should read history , and learn the supreme danger of trying to do all at once by the policeman 's club what can be done at all only very gradually by the slow moral development which comes principally from our schools and churches . How is it they have never been kindly told this by some mayor of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read ( for instance ) the fifth chapter of Mr. Lecky 's " History of European Morals , " or the fourth chapter in Professor Lilly 's " First Principles in Politics , " or the same subject in St. Augustine 's " De Ordine " ? A police officer may without a warrant enter a house , or break in , if necessary , to make an arrest for an offence which is being committed therein in his sight or hearing , for that would be an offence committed in his presence , and for which he or any private person may arrest without a warrant , as has already been explained ; or if an arrested person escape , he may be pursued into a house and retaken . But these will be perceived to be mere corollaries of the right of arrest without a warrant where it exists , and not to affect or diminish the rights of the individual which the purpose of this article is to point out . IV It remains to answer the question which has all along been in the minds of some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a private individual , who is without a warrant unlawfully arresting one , or invading his house or rooms , be resisted ? " The law , often declared by the courts , says , Yes , it is lawful to resist him with all the force necessary to prevent him . An officer who is committing an unlawful trespass on your person or property is not in the performance of his official duty , and if he assaults you he may lawfully be resisted , the same as a private individual , even to the extent of taking his life , if , in the last extremity , that becomes unavoidable in order to save yourself from " great personal injury , " or from death , at the hands of the unlawful assailant . This is laid down in section 205 of the Penal Code of the State of New York , which substantially declares the common law . There is a statute in the State of New York , and probably in all our States , making it a criminal offence to resist an officer " in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offence , the principal thing to be proved is that the officer was " in the performance of his duty , " though this seems to be frequently overlooked in the City  | of New York . It seems to be often considered sufficient that the officer was resisted , even though the resistance was to an unlawful trespass being committed by him , so dim has become the knowledge of the rights of free men , under the common law of England and our constitution and laws , to resist oppression . This subject can be best disposed of by referring to the great case of the People against Hochstim , decided on appeal by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of the State of New York in the first judicial department ( which embraces only the County of New York ) , late in November , 1902 ; particularly as I do not wish to speak in this article except by authority . A deputy superintendent of elections , who is by statute a peace officer , with all the rights and powers of arrest which belong to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a duly registered voter on a charge of unlawful registration , when he presented himself at his polling place in the City of New York to vote and asked the election officers for his ballot . Hochstim and others joined the voter in remonstrating , and told the officer that the voter could not be lawfully arrested , as he was registered and had the right to vote . As the officer refused to desist , Hochstim and others resisted him , and shoved him into a corner , and enabled the voter to vote . Hochstim was thereafter indicted . tried and convicted of the alleged offence of resisting the officer in the discharge of his duty , which is a felony under the Metropolitan Elections District Law . It appeared on the trial , by the prosecution 's own showing , that the voter was lawfully registered and , consequently , had the absolute right to vote . The officer . instead of being in the discharge of his duty in arresting him . was , therefore , committing a gross trespass upon him . Nevertheless , Hochstim was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his duty , " and sentenced to State prison for three years . Having obtained a stay on appeal , other counsel of the highest eminence , whose attention was attracted to the case by the publicity it had then attained , principally by the adverse criticism by some newspapers of the granting of the stay , came forward without fee , and , refusing to consider any suggestion of compensation , undertook to defend him and vindicate the right of every citizen to resist the unlawful acts of officers . To the honor of the bar , it must be said that in every age its members have come forward in the same way to uphold individual  | right and liberty . Of course , the conviction was reversed , the judges holding that the officer was not in the performance of his duty , but doing an unlawful act , and that he was therefore lawfully resisted . It will not be going outside of the scope of this article to mention also that the opinions of the judges further decide that a registered voter may not be arrested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being entitled to register and vote , until after he has voted ; that he may only be challenged , and that if he then take the oath prescribed by law to swear in his vote , his right to vote is absolute . The following was said by Mr. Justice Hatch : " No interference with the citizen after he has registered , except to challenge his right to vote , either by threats of arrest or any other form of intimidation , or by interference with him when exercising the right , is permitted . Each and all such acts are unlawful , no matter by whom perpetrated . " And the following by Mr. Justice Ingraham : " He ( the voter ) had been duly registered , whereby he became a qualified voter and entitled to cast his vote . When he demanded his right to vote , his right could be challenged ; but if he made the necessary oath as to his qualifications as a voter , the inspectors were bound to accept his vote , and any one , whether a deputy superintendent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and intentionally interfered to prevent the exercise of that right violated section 41k of the Penal Code . " Nevertheless , it is more than probable that , at the very next election , hundreds of similar lawless arrests will be made in the City of New York by officers at the polls , as has been done for several years and was done at the recent election . It may not be amiss to mention that this great judgment in the Hochstim case was scarcely mentioned by the press of New York City , and except for possibly two newspapers the public there are wholly uninformed of its far-reaching purport . The citizen in voting is performing an act of sovereignty ; he is participating in the free expression of the sovereign will of the people . If government may send or threaten to send officers to the polls , with or without warrants , in order to frighten voters from coming there , or from mew , or to forcibly prevent them from voting by arresting them and tales them away , intimidation can be spread like an epidsie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily deterred from voting . For one illegal vote that might be prevented in that  | way , there would be scores of legal votes prevented . The Penal Code of the State of New York provides that " any one who wilfully and unlawfully obstructs , hinders or delays , or aids or assists in obstructing or delaying any elector on his way to a registration or polling place , or while he is attempting to register or vote , " is guilty of a crime . This , of course , applies to officers , the same as to all others . V The last mayoralty election in the City of New York was probably decided by the large number of persons who , during the previous four years , had been unlawfully interfered with and oppressed by the police . If the Mayor has caused the commissioner of police to issue a general order to the force , embodying the plain and simple section of the Code of Criminal Procedure prescribing their powers of arrest without a warrant , and the equally plain and simple prohibition in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which are quoted above , and warning them that unlawful arrests , house invasions , and trespasses must cease , and that thereafter it would be deemed a more serious offence for a policeman to unlawfully interfere with a citizen than to let a criminal escape , it has not been made known to the citizens at large , thousands of whom expected it and looked for it . Nor has the Mayor caused the civil service commissioners to go to the root of the evil by examining applicants for appointment to the force or for promotion therein in respect to the rights and powers of policemen to make arrests , or enter houses or rooms , without a warrant . An examination like this would be of more use than questions calling for the source of the Bronx river , or the number of public parks in the remote borough of Richmond . One recent instance suffices to show the false idea of the right and power to arrest and imprison without a warrant which still exists in the police department of the City of New York . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's court with a large batch of prisoners , whom he had arrested and locked up over night without a warrant . He told the magistrate that he wanted them all committed to prison until after election . The magistrate asked what charge of a criminal offence he made against them , and the response was that he made none , but that he feared they would register and vote if not locked up . Being asked if there was any one to make any charge against them , he said no.  | The magistrate said that he had no right to commit any one except on a charge of some criminal offence made on oath , and discharged the prisoners . Can any one imagine such an occurrence in England , or , for that matter , anywhere outside of the City of New York ? The police captain seemed to be wholly oblivious of the fact that it was not entrusted to him by law , but to the election officials , to decide who were entitled to register and vote , or that he had no right to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and he was in no amiable mood toward the magistrate for not holding his prisoners . He probably had in mind very different experiences before certain magistrates . The public have not yet been informed of his dismissal from the force , or of his indictment , or of any complaint whatever having been made against him by those above him in the city or county government ; nor have they been informed of any complaint or prosecution against any one for any of the hundreds of lawless arrests made in the City of New York on last election day , not to mention other times . It would seem that some conscientious reformer might leave the pursuit of unfortunate women , and suspend his labors with the police for the " suppression of vice " by force , long enough to deal with this great and dangerous vice . Several typical instances of the lawless invasion of houses by the police in the City of New York occurred only last month . It will suffice to describe one of them . All accounts agree as to the particulars of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by obtaining a statement from a truthful and careful person who was present throughout . The house invaded was said to be a place of private gaming . A large posse of policemen suddenly surrounded it and violently attacked it . They smashed in a window by means of some heavy weapon , and entered pell mell by the breach thus made , some of them flourishing revolvers and others armed with axes . After entering , the same course of lawless violence was continued . They had a search warrant from a magistrate , but did not act under it in getting in . They did not present it at the door , nor give any notice of it , nor ask for admittance under it ( nor at all , for that matter ) , before breaking in ; whereas section 799 of the Code of Criminal Procedure ( which only follows the common law ) prescribes that an officer having a search warrant may break into the house to be searched only " if , after notice of his authority and purpose , he be refused  | admittance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it a criminal offence to exceed the authority which a search warrant confers by law . Their conduct in breaking in was just as lawless as though they had no warrant , because they did not act under the warrant . They might as well have gone to the house without a warrant . It is only of late that they have begun to get warrants to enter houses , owing to recent judicial decisions ; but to get a warrant and then violate it is only adding an additional crime to that of the unlawful invasion . The " raid , " as it is aptly called ( for a lawless word best describes a lawless act ) , was , according to all the accounts , planned and led by the District Attorney of New York County in person ? the chief officer elected by the people to guard their rights and liberties , and maintain law and order in the community ; but this seems quite incredible . The grand jury was in session , but no inquiry was made by it into the matter ; nor did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police to account , or make any protest ; nor has any one made any complaint to the Governor of the State to enable him to exercise the constitutional power given to him for investigation , and for redress and relief to the people , in such cases . In a similar " raid " not long ago , a retainer or officer of the District Attorney 's office shot down a man . He has not been tried for it , nor even indicted , although no lawful cause or justification for his act is known to the public . The notion that the morals of the community can be reformed and made better , or that government can be purified and lifted up , instead of being debased and demoralized , by the policeman 's club and axe , is so pernicious and dangerous in any government , let alone in a free government , that no one can harbor it whose intellectuals are not , as Macaulay says , " in that mod unhappy of all states , that is to say , too much disordered for liberty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women and gamblers were in the beginning , and will be here , it may be , at the end . At all events , this we do know , that wherever their number grows less , it will be in the future , as in the past , not as the result of disorderly brute force , but as the result of the moral growth of the community , accompanied by a humane , even and orderly administration of the law . It would be difficult to speak with perfect forbearance of the strange pretence that the police could not enforce the law if they  | kept within the law themselves . The idea that the police may trample on the law regulating their conduct in order to make other people observe the law regulating theirs , can arise only out of a total lack of understanding of the principles on which free government rests . The duty of the police is fully performed by doing what the law prescribes they may do ; when they go beyond that , they are not doing duty , but violating the law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in the manner prescribed by the law , the law ? that is , the declared will of the people ? does not want or permit them to do at all . There can be no more dangerous notion in a free government than that those who enforce the laws have the right to be stricter than the laws , or are in any respect above the laws . If , in a criminal trial , the plain facts plainly presented do not convict , the people do not want a conviction , and so declare by their laws ; much less do they want arbitrary and lawless arrests , or permit them by their laws .
