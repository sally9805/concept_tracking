When Charles Hoyt , the playwright , was placed in a sanitarium by his friends early this Summer , and subsequently released on the promise of friends from his home , Charlestown , N. H. , that they would care for him , he declared that he was financially capable of taking care of himself and at the same time advising his friends to examine his tin box in the Garfield Safe Deposit Vaults . Little or no attention was paid to Mr. Hoyt 's statements . However , friends in this city knew that his plays brought him in last year over $34,000 , and that he realized considerable on his interest in the Madison Square Theatre . They felt that there must be something to show from these receipts , as Mr. Hoyt never lived up to his income .

When Mr. Hoyt 's friends took him from the sanitarium to Charlestown , N. H. , the Court appointed James 0 . Leiford. a resident of the latter city , as his guardian , but this appointment thus far has not been confirmed in this State . His friends , desiring to know whether the tin box actually contained the securities named or not , so that the amount of Mr. Leiford 's bond could be agreed upon , an application was made to Justice Fitzgerald to allow Mr. Leiford to open the box . The Court decreed last week that Mr. Leiford. in the presence of a court officer , should make the investigation . The schedule showing what was in the box was found to be correct and everything intact . The securities , jewelry , &c.,; were replaced in the box .

The first performance of the tragedy with Mr. Sothern as the Prince and Miss Harned as Ophelia will surely be given a week from next Monday night . This will be by far the most important dramatic event of that night , which promises , unless there are some wise postponements , to be overcrowded with first performances .
