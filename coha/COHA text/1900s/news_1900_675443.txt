txt Solicitor General Richards of the Department of Justice has filed a brief it the Supreme Court which fixes the attitude of this Government on the question of whether the Constitution extends to the new possessions of the United States . The Department of Justice says it does not without act of Congress . The case is that of Ramon Baez , a native-born inhabitant of Puerto Rico , who applies for leave to file a petition for writs of habeas corpus and certiorari to secure his release from further imprisonment under a judgment of the United States Provisional Court of Puerto Rico sentencing him to two months ' imprisonment for illegal voting at a municipal election held under the military order . The prayer is that the writ of habeas corpus be directed to Samuel C. Bothwell , Marshal of the Provisional Court c.ot **53;142;TOOLONG and that the writ of certiorari issue to the Provisional Court of Puerto Rico commanding it to forward to the court a transcript of its proceedings in this case . After reviewing the case the Solicitor General makes the following argument : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ territorial jurisdiction of this court ? Both are in Puerto Rico . While that island has been ceded to the United States , Congress has as yet taken no action toward organizing the territory oevapplying to it the Constitution and the laws of the United States . The island has been acquired under the power conferred by the Constitution on the Government of the Union making war and making treaties . " The ultimate disposition and government of territory thus acquired rests with Congress under the power granted it to dispose of and make all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory or other property belonging to the United States . " Congress has not yet acted . The President is , therefore . stiff ; in control , acting through the War Department . The occupation is a military occupt. ? tion . The so-called courts are the mere agencies of the military power . Everything is provisional alai temporary . The Department of Justice of the United S.tates is not in operation in Puerto Rico . The court has no jurisdiction of the case presented . "   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
