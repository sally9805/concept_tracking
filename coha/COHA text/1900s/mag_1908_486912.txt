Mr Taft 's letter in condemnation of the Maryland plan for disfranchising the negro , will open the eyes of some people in the South . They have taken his cordial advances and amiable expressions of good will as a sign that he would wink at the injustice of tricky suffrage laws , designed to exclude all negroes , even if educated and property-owning , and to include all whites , even though poverty-stricken and illiterate But that was a mistaken inference Mr Taft now leaves no doubt where he stands He is against the enactment of any suffrage measure which would be unfair in operation as between the races In dissecting the Maryland plan of dividing the voters into classes , he shows that the aim is to " free the whites from education or property qualifications , but to subject all negroes to them " This idea he truly declares to be repugnant to " the spirit of justice and equality , " as well as in violation of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments The whole law , asserts Judge Taft , ' ' ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and every Denim i at , who " dean es equality of ti eatment to the black and white races " to oppose it The docti Ines of this ad-inn able letter appl ' , , of course , not to Mainland alone They strike just as hard at the suffrage laws of MississiPPand Alabama and Georgia They make it evident that . in Mr Taft 's endeavors to win over t. e South , he is not going to forget the elementary principle of political justice Sober-minded people w.11 be glad that Judge WI glit has passed exemplary sentence upon the labor leaders , but will also be glad that the decision is to be reviewed by a higher coui t , and that the men are meanwhile out on bail This gives time for passion to subside , and furnishes an opportunity for the officials of the Federation of Labor to purge themselves of contempt Indeed , it is now reported that Mr Gompers will discontinue in his organ , the American Federationist , the " We Do n't has carried on his boycotting , and that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If he and Messrs Mitchell and Morrison duly submit to the legal authorities , the gravamen of the complaint against them will be removed .

" In the face of such a claim to be above the law and beyond reach of judicial process , the courts were bound to vindicate then dignity and assert their power In vindicating the courts , no one wishes to see anything like vindictiveness It is the principle which is at stake , not the exact form or severity of punishment The somewhat turbid rhetoric and occasional excess of heat and of epithet in Judge ' Wright 's opinion can not blind Mr Gompers or his counsel to the fact that it lays down what are now settled principles Since the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of the Danbury hatters , boycotting is illegal Labor leaders combining or conspiring to impair the property rights of any man or company are just as clearly criminal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same thing What is more , the protests of innocence which Mr Gompers makes are hollow Consider his repeated efforts in Congress and elsewhere to have the law amended He knew that , as it Htands , it is against his pi actices He 1-new to what penalties he was exposing himself and his fellows He gloried in the fact that lie might 1 av e to go to jail To show the eal issues involved , we have only to imagine the reception of the news that the heavy hand of the law had so been laid upon Rockefeller or Hari iman There would have been an up-m oar of delight It would have been said that no man had been found powerful enough to defy with impunity the law of the land But that is precisely what Gompers set out to do Boasting himself the head of 2,000,000 laborers , he dared the courts to touch him No capitalistic magnate ever assumed a more insolent port , and none ever more add , however , that we have no wish to see him imprisoned , provided the ends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lessons brought home , in other ways No one desires to make a martyr of Mr Gompers , or to give him the slightest chance to complain that capitalistic volatoi s of the Sherman law are not punished by being sent to jail for contempt We should all much prefer to see him become a law-abiding citizen It is idle for him to talk about the light of fi ee speech being impaired He is not sentenced for criticising the court , but for disobeying its order He may lad at the law as much as he pleases , but he must not violate it The thing to be aimed at is , not the punishment of Mr Gompers , but the ending of the tyranny and illegal oppression of boycotting , of which he stands as head and front The chance that Ohio may be represented in the United States Senate by a man like Congressman Bui ton must make honest Pennsylvanians look at that State with envious eyes For to Pennsylvania 's shame , it seems certain that Boles Penrose will be reelected A less useful member is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characteristics and in his policies , political and commercial , he belongs to a bygone age  --  the days of Quay and Hanna He is a reactionary of reactionaries , a man of good family and u aditions who has deliberately turned his back upon training and antecedents to descend to the lowest plane of Pennsy lvania , ring politics He : s himself unfit to hold any office , so tar as his influence goes , it is a trifle better than Platt 's and a little below Depew 's , to whom he is politically a full brother Senator Penrose is the head of the corrupt and infamous old Quay machine , which is in politics solely foi money-making and office-brok-erage The expected elect on of Secretary Root to the Senate . s ali eady said to have disturbed that body , because it seems to necessitate a change from the rule of rating a man according to age , to rating him according to ability By Mr Root would have no better chance than the rawest man from Nevada , he would have to go to the foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to promote him . But in the case of a man like Mr. Root the system seems too absurd The advantage of having him on the Foreign Affairs Committee is obvious ; yet that position is usually one of the prizes of long service . Similarly , Mr. Root 's fruitful labors in the War Department would seem fairly to dictate his assignment to a place on the Military Committee ; but here again the same difficulty arises The discussion of the matter only shows what a good thing it is to have a system , but how bad a thing it is to let a system strangle you No doubt , the law of seniority is , on the whole , useful But there are at least two occasions when it should be set aside : one is when , in Lord Rosebery 's phrase , seniority spells senility ; and the other is when a junior in point of service has had so much experience elsewhere in the kind of work to be clone , and has shown such talent in it , that not to utilize him vv @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but an outrage upon the public Neatly sixty counties of Ohio have voted out the saloons , by an average majority of close to one thousand Nine counties have voted " wet , ' mostly by very small majorities The campaign has demonstrated that the opponents of prohibition have no class of voters , outside those directly concerned in the traffic , upon which they can absolutely depend The mining districts in counties like Perry , Hocking , and Athens were regarded doubtful , bu t the miners themselves furnished a heavy " dry " vote , as did also the laborers in many of the smaller manufacturing centres It was supposed that the farmers could be much influenced by the fear of increased taxes if the $1,000 saloon license should be given up , but the farmer vote invariably goes heavily against the saloon The rapid spread of the trolley has made the farmer 's boy more than ever a frequenter of the town , while the increased tax has driven the saloon in the smaller places to a more vigorous quest than ever for profitable trade The connection of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adjuncts , has made the dan much greater than was encountered in the average drink-shop of a generation ago The large German element in the rural population of certain counties was expected to oppose prohibition , but only in a few localities has the expectation been fulfilled . Nor has the temperance wave been broken in those sections which habitually give Democratic majorities . The " dry " list now contains something like half the counties which returned majorities for Judge Harmon a few weeks ago , including Monroe , which has never gone Republican in its history and which yet went " dry " by nearly 1,200 . In the Seventeenth Congressional district , with a Democratic majority of over 7,000 , every county but one has voted " dry " by a good majority , and that one is almost wholly " dry " al-ready under the former township option law The river towns were to be adverse , but twelve of the fourteen counties touching the Ohio have declared themselves " dry .

Such a poor showing , doubtless , reflects to some extent upon the intellectual equipment of young Americans Too much familiarity with foreign languages and international law must not be expected from college boys But the chief difficulty is touched in the examiners ' remark : It seems impossible to obtain the men absolutely required without drawing upon States already over-represented in the ser-vice So long as consuls are picked according to geography , good material will be scarce Wyoming will always have proportionately fewer young men with the training and inclination for the foreign service than New York ing-house for places of honor and profit under all State officers except Gov .

Ten places within the gift of Mr. Woodruff 's clients have been removed from the exempt to the competitive class He may find consolation , however , in the fact that most of the 299 other positions placed within the competitive class have hitherto been in the hands of the Governor . Consolation , but also astonishment and contempt For a man who would just throw away the disposal of three hundred offices must always remain a puzzle to the mind which figured out that the renomination of Hughes would spell defeat for the Republican ticket . With President Roosevelt taking the postmasters out of their reach and the Governor hacking away at their State patronage , the politicians confront an increasingly bleak prospect , while all good citizens rejoice Only a few days ago Austria was re-ported as well on the way towards a reconciliation with Turkey There was to be an indemnity for the annexation of Bosnia-Herzegovina  --  the sum of $20 , - 000,000 was mentioned ?

The chances are that , ultimately , Austria will pay an indemnity . It is inconceivable that a European conference shall meet with-out allowing Turkey compensation for her lost provinces The Russian Min-ister of Foreign Affairs has hinted that the conference might concern itself with the kind of government Austria shall erect in the annexed provinces . but Ausgovina her own , would naturally refuse to allow any interference with what would become an internal affair ot the Empire The Balkan States may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as Turkey is concerned , she can be granted no other than a pecuniary satisfaction Upon that she may seasonably ins.st But it for the moment Austrian diplomacy may play fast and loose with Turkey without seriously affecting conditions in the Balkans , the effect is quite different on general European politics , and specifically on the future of the Triple Alliance Here the attitude of Italy is of primary importance Italy 's feeling has changed materially in the course of the last ten years She joined the Triple Alliance out of fear of French aggression . She now has a good understanding with France Conversely , her sentiment for Austria-Hungary , which has never been anything but disI he , has been growing more bitter Italian ambitions concerning Trieste and the Adriatic coastland have been one cause of irritation Recurrent conflicts between Italians and Germans in the Tyrol and other Austrian crownlands have been another At the conference of Algeciras in 1906 , Italy ranged herself on the side of France and against her allies , Germany and Austria-Hungary In a conference about Bosnia-Herzegovina she is sure to play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few weeks ago , a tormer Italian prime minister declared , in the course of debate , that Italy must henceforth arm , not against France , but against Austria The Parliament cheered him , minister s embraced him , and Premier Giolitti shook hands with him in congratulation True , the Chamber approved the fcre , gn minister 's formal declaration that Italy continued her adherence to the Triple Alliance , but the real spirit of the nation had been sufficienth shown by the preceding demonstration In the strain it puts on the Triple Alliance , rests one of the dangers of Austrian policy in the Balkans Dissolution of the Triple Alliance is , of course . not imminent Germany would not allow such a thing to come to pass , and even Italy will perceive that , hate Austria as she does , it is better , for the time , to have her as an ally than as an avowed enemy But the strands that bind the Triple Alliance are being cut one by one Italy is not only on friendly terms with France , but she is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Austria , the danger is recognized , and theie are protests against Baron von Aehrenthal 's policy of needless irritations The world hears but little nowadays of Russia and her domestic troubles Apparently , the revolutionary movement has come to a standstill , and the reactionaries are once mole securely in con trol But that is a wrong idea . On December 9 , the St Petersburg morning newspapers recorded seventeen executions and thirty-seven death sentences as the harvest of the day before That may be called making a wilderness and calling it peace , but Russia can not be spoken of as pacified With thirty-seven death sentences record ded on a single day , it is evident that revolutionary forces are still active Could the official statistics of the incessant blood-letting be compiled , the world would be aghast , particularly as there have been so many " executions " of which the official woi has wisely taken no cognizance Sooner or later , it would seem as if there must be a more violent explosion than heretofore , human nature can not endure violent repression and injustice of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people That the Russian Jews are still being persecuted appears from the news that the anti-Jewish agitation in Finland is becoming more and more serious For some days past dispatches have reported that the Russian authorities in Finland are driving Jews from their homes into the fields to starve and freeze , and that the Finnish Legislature has promulgated an edict prohibiting the slaughter of meats in accordance with the Jewish ritual If not all the blame must be awarded to the Russians it is , of course , plain that the Russian authorities , who have subjugated Finland with such an iron hand , will not object to anti-Jewish brutalities on the part of the Finns themselves They are willing to aid in the persecution by forcing young Jews into the army , and , after the expiration of their term of service , preventing them from returning to their homes .
