THE conduct of a modern church in a big city is a business in itself , like the management of a huge industrial enterprise ? a railway or a factory ? requiring unusual business aptitude , technical skill , and financial and executive ability . Such a typical church , ? vast , intricate , with paid and unpaid laborers , ? run like a great railway , is St. George 's , Stuyvesant Square , New York . As its rector , Dr. Rainsford , was the pioneer in blazing the right way to the conquest of the East Side , and as it has been the pioneer and the pattern in methods of dealing with East Side problems , it will serve admirably as an illustration of all the representatives of the new church . In St. George 's last Year Book , the rector calls for an endowment of a million dollars . He says he needs at least forty thousand a year in addition to what he can collect from his congregation , needs it for maintaining " our Church and extensive plane . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hint of the nature of this extensive plant when he says : " To take one item . Space for gymnasium , dancing , drilling , teaching the various branches of industrial work , costs in New York large sums of money , and the people who need these things can not possibly pay these sums . " Turn to the financial statement of the church , and you find that in the twenty years since Dr. Rainsford reorganized the old and dying church into the new and ever more vigorously alive church , it has spent two and a quarter million dollars ? at least four-fifths of it upon the extensive plant . Again , you find that last year the church spent about $97,000 , which would he the income of nearly two and a half millions at four per cent. ; and almost all of this went . into the plant . And these figures make no account of the labor , the free labor , of more than two hundred workers who constitute what may be called the minor superintendence of the plant . The altar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it is as the huh of 3 huge fly-wheel . Dr. Rainsford has a staff of assistant clergymen who devote themselves by day and by night almost wholly to spiritual and religious work ? to regular and special services in the church itself , to meetings held elsewhere in the region round about , to visits of condolence and encouragement , to the celebration of the holy communion by tenement sick-beds , and so on . But Dr. Rainsford is also a general superintendent of a plant which , excepting for his supervision , is carried on almost exclusively by laymen connected with the church . His wardens are an executive committee , his vestrymen are a board of directors , his regular lay assistants are his division superintendents and foremen , and his workers are the skilled labor . Affairs once regarded as purely secular absorb most of their time and thought . The spirit , no doubt , is of the world to come ; but is not the substance almost wholly of this world , of its hard and toilsome life and its pressing and practical concerns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The first thirty-six are Dr. Rainsford 's annual report ? six pages or thereabouts concerning the church , thirty pages concerning the plant . Sixteen per rent , the report of a rector ; eighty-four per cent . the report of a general superintendent . Then follow about thirty-five pages of reports on religious work , pure and simple . The rest of the book , just under 200 pages , is almost wholly made of the reports of the foremen of the various departments in the secular plant . . And as you study these reports , you understand why St. George 's has grown from a membership of a few hundreds twenty years ago to more than 8000 today , why it exerts such a vast influence , direct and indirect , throughout New York city and upon the clergy of the entire country . It is more than a church ; it is more than a " plant . " It is a complete society , a complete social organization in itself , a sort of model community founded upon an idea which lies at the basis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , up town and down , nowadays . That idea is , to use Dr. Rainsford 's phrase , " team-work . " To reach the masses , which in the true sense include all the so-called " classes , " these church model - communities have broken with notions of creed-brotherhood or brotherhood of all comfortably-off people , have gone back to the old original idea of universal brotherhood ? " Ho , every one that thirsteth , come ye ! " But for the emblazoning of this ideal upon the church 's standards , St. George 's would have been forced to sell its site and move up-town or go out of existence long ago . And it would have had the same fate had its notion of universal brotherhood been , doing something for the worthy poor . " The " my - good-man " and " my-good-woman " attitude will wreck any institution in the East Side ? or anywhere else in America ? unless it is well endowed or well backed by people who wish to have some place to go where they can play lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universal brotherhood , the conception of all these church model - communities , has been and is that every human being , regardless of surface differences , is endowed with a double capacity that is not affected by the law of inequalities ? the capacity to give , the capacity to receive . St. George 's recognizes that the passion for progress is as universal as its need . It has not collected alms from the rich ; it has not patronized the poor : it has organized rich and poor , educated and uneducated , fashionable and ragged , foreigner and native , for mutual help , for team-work . This view-point for theory and practice is important ; it defines the chasm between these democratic church plants and the aristocratic church plants of Europe , and of America also ? for , unfortunately , America too has aristocratic church plants , imitated from Europe , where the caste curse is at least explicable and , perhaps , not wholly inexcusable . The entire membership of St. George 's is organized into sub-associations for thedevelopment of intelligence , skill , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nominally pupils ; but all are , in fact , at school to each other day after day , evening after evening . Singing , sewing , acting , tailoring , manual training , shooting , kindergarten work , social entertaining , housekeeping , plumbing , carpentry , gymnastics , wood - working , cooking , the care of babies , dressmaking , millinery , embroidery , debating and public speaking , basket-weaving ? these and many other activities are engaging the energy and the enthusiasm of the eight thousand members of the church in their capacity as members of the church plant . And the plant of necessity occupies a large area , the floor - space befitting a great factory or combine of factories . There is the church proper , steepleless and with two massive towers , whose clocks seem to be keeping time upon its toilers , warning them that a moment is approaching when a great whistle shall blow the close of the day 's work . In the church proper the pews are free ? no one can have the same seat , except by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that gather hear sermons that are also lectures on various phases of the practical life ? addresses by the general superintendent to inform or to encourage or to get aid for or from his staff of workers . Behind the church is the Rectory , the residence and office of the general superintendent , the headquarters or general office of the works . Behind the Rectory , facing as it does upon East Sixteenth Street , is the ? big Memorial House , the main building of the great industrial and social-character factory . Across the way is the Deaconess Rouse , a sort of headquarters for the women superintendents and their staffs , and including an admirably equipped infirmary . Through East Sixteenth Street , three blocks farther into the East Side , is the Industrial Trade School . And finally there is the Seaside Cottage , where the huge team takes its summer outings ? daily excursions , vacation stops . In buildings , real estate , machinery , etc. , this plant represents an investment of upwards of a million and a half dollars ? and it rents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House gives the best opportunity to see the plant in operation . In the basement is the shooting-range for the Boys ' Battalion ? a military organization modelled on the Seventh Regiment and thoroughly trained . On the first floor are the Clothing and Relief departments , where poverty is dealt with on the self-respecting basis . The Medical Department and Infirmary used to be here also , but have now been removed to larger quarters in the Deaconess House . Also on the first floor of the Memorial Building are the Circulating Library and half a dozen societies for promoting social relations . On the second floor is a great hall . One day in the seven it is the Sunday-school , with more than two thousand scholars and about one hundred and fifty- teachers ? it rarely happens that so many as half a dozen teachers are absent . Six days in the seven this room is used for lectures , classes , schools of manual training , meetings of various kinds , dancing , all sorts of plant purposes . On the third floor is the Men 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billiard-room , gymnasium , baths , lockers ? a complete club , open from eight in the morning until eleven at night . The fourth floor is the clergy-house . The top floor is for the Battalion Club , the Battalion Armory , and the Dramatic and Literary Society . The plant is unceasingly active . Its secular operations begin at one o'clock on Sunday afternoon , when the Men 's Club opens for the day . At four o'clock on Sunday afternoon the Circulating Library is receiving and giving out books . At nine o'clock on Monday morning , with the assembling of the , kindergarten , the week 's work opens for full blast . That evening ? any evening ? you would be amazed at the variety of noises that would reach your ears as you walked the broad corridors or went up or down in the elevator . The crack of rifles , dance-music , and the steady beat of dancing feet , chorus - singing here , a man lecturing there , a boy 's voice raised in earnest debate yonder , the tramp , tramp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clash of gymnasium rings . And , a littleearlier in the evening , through the halls and in and out of doors were passing throngs of men , women , youths of both sexes ? some seeking groceries and clothes at cost prices , others seeking a dance , others a lecture , others a game of billiards or a quiet smoke in the Men 's Club ; this boy bent on gymnastic exercises , that young mother inquiring for the lecture on the care of babies , the group at the elevator waiting to be carried to the top floor , where they are to rehearse a play . And farther out East Sixteenth Street scores of boys are busily learning trades . There is no side of life upon which St. George 's does not seek to touch . Are you out of work ? There is its Employment Bureau . Are you sick ? There is its Medical Department and Infirmary . Do you need a lift over an impossible place in the road ? There is its Relief Department . Do you wish to improve your mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is it the physical that you seek ? Gymnasiums , military drill , baths , addresses on health and sanitation . Do you wish to learn a trade ? Manual and industrial training for both sexes . Housekeeping , cooking , sewing , the care of home and family ? You need look no farther . Are you in search of amusement ? Billiards , chess , cards , in the Men 's Club ; dancing , receptions , teas , fairs , plays , germane , parlor games . Do you wish merely to sit quietly and reflect ? St. George 's Church , large and calm and thought-inspiring. always open , that the wayfarer may enter and sit and remain as long as he wishes . But this is not all . It is only a bald outline of part of the factory . It gives but a meagre hint of what is perhaps the roost important part . In the statistical table in the latest Year Book you will find that during the year 10,967 visits were made and 15,419 visits were received by the general superintendent and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figures are the cold and utterly inadequate summary of a vast social life that is vital to the plant . They furnish the clue to the persistence and triumphant growth of St. George 's in a locality where decay would seem to he inevitable for such a democratic , God - helps - those - that-help-them selves organization . They explain why , although St. George 's loses nine per cent . of its membership every year by deaths and removals , it more than makes good the loss . The general superintendent permits no one to be negligent , no one to be lost sight of . About six hundred of his sub ? ordinates live in private residences ? the rich , who perhaps most of all need the benefits that come from working in and for the plant . About a thousand live in apartments and hotels ? the well-to-do who must be kept in line for what they can do and for their own sakes . Another thousand live in boarding-houses ? the young fellows and young girls who are working and are presently to set up housekeeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about five thousand five hundred ? live in tenements , and , like the others , they must be carefully looked after . The general superintendent not only goes himself , not only sends his immediate staff , not only sends his volunteer regular workers ; he also sends these eight thousand to call on each other , to keep track of each other , to keep each other up to the mark , that they may benefit the plant and be benefited by it . He goes and sends his men and women , his boys and girls , out , always out , after those who are falling away , after new men and new women , new boys and new girls . New York is a madly busy , an incessantly changing , city ? there are on the average three thousand changes of address in St. George 's membership annually . It is a tremendous task just to keep together the organization , to prevent enthusiasm from flagging , to make goad inevitable losses , and to show an advance each year . And it is inspiring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and grow where plants based upon patronizing and pauperization shrink and wither . This brings us to the basis of St. George 's strength- the social life . It is social life that New-Yorkers of all classes and kinds must need and most crave . We constantly hear of the lack of social life in the tenements ? as if the lack were Veb . CPR. ? No. 633-27 not universal in New York , were not greater in the tenements only because they are more populous . Every great city is socially a vast desert . The abysmal craving Of New York ? West Side and East Side , hotel and apartment , boarding - house and flat ? is for friends , for sympathy , for the gayefy and intimacy of the private circle , for social life , such as people can have in other cities , in the towns , in the country even . And St. George 's and its like among the new church model-communities seek to supply this lack , seek to respond to this craving . Its plant is essentially social throughout ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide , up and down , to draw in and to assimilate to its high and broad standards the timid and the awkward , the poor and the forlorn , the rich who long to he useful , the lonely who sit in the cheerless solitude of hall bedrooms or haunt the saloons or the dance-halls . It gives the older people a chance to smile , the younger people a chance to court , all a chance to work in the sunshine of fellowship .
