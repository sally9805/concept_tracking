N the British Who 's Who , after they have set down the time and place of a subject 's birth and the record of his major experiences and achievements , they give space to his recreations . Open it at a venture . A physician 's recreations are put down as " yachting , gardening , figure-skating , music " ; bishop 's are books and music ; an editor collects engravings and pictures ; a lawyer plays with photography ; a soldier rides to hounds and hunts big game and writes about both ; a university professor cycles . On the whole , the record of recreations is the most interesting thing in the hook , because it is the one that comes nearest to personal life . But nobody has put his recreation down as " alcohol , " an omission that , all things and folks considered , intimates a lack of candor ; unless , to he sure , it can be accounted for by the surmise that comparatively few persons whose recreation is alcohol get their names into Who 's Who . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those that are free and those that cost something . In the latter group belong alcohol , carriage exercise , enlargement by automobile , the opera and theatres , horseback riding in the parks , shopping , social entertainments from bridge parties up to balls , eating in fashionable restaurants , stock speculation , horse-racing , coaching , yachting , and politics . To the former class belong walking in the street and in the parks , sitting in the parks or playing in them , visiting the Aquarium , the Natural History Museum , the Museum of Art , the public libraries and reading-rooms , the tuberculosis show ? when them is one ? or the tenement-house exhibition , or any other instructive spectacle ; seeing various parades in the streets or on the rivers as circumstances provide them , being glad you do n't live in the country ; watching the street-cleaners , the ash-men , the garbage men , the postmen , thepolice , and the rest of the population ; exploring the town , admiring the brilliancy of the atmosphere , and breathing in the stimulating air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong of gasoline . Supplementary in an important degree to these free amusements are others that are cheap but do cost a little , especially and perpetually the use of the cheaper public vehicles ? street-cars , elevated railroads , subways , and ferries ? and the reading of newspapers , which last amusement is better patronized than even alcohol . Many more street - car rides are sold every day in New York than drinks , but streetcar rides belong , as a rule , in the group of necessaries rather than of recreations , though a certain proportion of them are incident al to recreation . But newspapers outsell drinks too , being very much cheaper , and they and conversation constitute the biggest items of recreation that there are . It is immensely important , this matter of the amusements of a great city ; important to health , sanity , energy , order ; to everything that makes for efficiency and happiness , and , you might even say , for salvation . Here is a huge working population , that gets tired every night , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Food and sleep are the necessaries that are vital to that restoration , but they are not enough . There is entertainment and recreation also to be provided every day in enormous measure . It is provided imperfectly , but better than most of us think . The great provision is social . Man , including woman , is the most interesting thing in the universe , and the provision of man in New York is exceedingly liberal . There are people in abundance to talk to , to sit with , to talk about , and to watch , and where there is the least of other recreations there is apt to be the most human society . If there are lonely children in New York , the place to look for them is within a block or two of Fifth Avenue , and not in the swarming streets that run east from the Bowery . The ability of the city children to play and be happy under unpromising conditions is a daily wonder . If there is a chance , they find it , and if there is none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dance ; when the weather is good they play ( out of school hours ) in the streets they live in , or in any public playgrounds or parks they can reach . When the weather is bad they suffer , but still they play . When they have nothing else to play with they still have one another , and however little they have , it means life to them , and they usually have the advantage of never having had any more . It is pretty hard to make New York a city fit for children to live in , but many people give themselves to that work , and accomplish much , and aspire to accomplishmuch more . That tho death rate is low there means a great deal , and the growth of suburban life due to new bridges , tunnels , and subways means a great deal also . Cities ought to be planned for children , and so laid out and built up that the first stages of life may be prosperously passed in them , and where there are the most children the streets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ houses most carefully contrived . But actually cities are built mainly for trade , with the prosperity of human life in them for an afterthought , and children intrude on them and get what they can , and are provided for by such adaptation of preliminary plans , or the lack of them , as can be afforded after the cost of many less important things is defrayed . New York is a habit , easily formed , as a rule , and quickly liked by those who form it . Horatio , who is looking the world over and trying it and tasting it in different places , came there /fist fall to spend the winter . Horatia 's present purpose is amusement . She amuses herself by thinking of things to do in- different parts of the world and doing them . One branch of amusement that she patronizes a good deal is the improvement of her mind . She thinks nothing of travelling three or four thousand miles to improve her mental apparatus for a couple of months . She likes New York , of course , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her enjoyment of the privilege of seeing so many well-dressed women . That is one of the standard gratifications of the town , a thing that always impresses newcomers , and never ceases to interest habitual residents . It is a gratification that costs enormously toprovide , but is a free show , one of the details of the great spectacle of Fifth Avenue , which , when it fits one 's humor , is the most amusing thing in town . When Mr. Godkin was editor of the Evening Post , sometimes one could read the editorial page all through with a continuous smile . So , on favorable days , the philosophical observer may walk up Fifth Avenue from Madison Square to the Plaza with stimulating darts of amusement every rod of the way . And since the high motor-busses with top seats have been put on , it is an interesting variation of that gratification to climb to the top of one of them at Washington Square and ride up the great avenue as far as the busses go , edified all the way , and progressing from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is still a good deal as it was seventy years ago , up through many blocks of new shops and office buildings to the very latest manifestations of millionaires ' houses . Surely that is one of the most remarkable ten - cent amusements anywhere provided . Of course Horatio likes Fifth Avenue . Everybody does who has eyes and can see with them , and likes to vary introspection by looking out and seeing what the rest of the world is doing . And that other amusement of hers , the improvetnent of the mind : I do n't feel absolutely certain that the facilities provided to that end are always the most effectual means to the end they are provided for . The mind goes up the back stairs sometimes , and gets itself improved by means the most unexpected and farthest from design . Mental improvement , becoming sometimes one of the by-products of living , comes sometimes quite irrespective of facilities . But New York has the facilities , such as they are , in great abundance . You can study anything there and learn it if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and classes , masters , teachers , fellow students , and incentives you find there in bountiful abundance and variety . From agriculture to speculation , from organized charity to dinner-giving , in all the branches you can improve your mind if you have the mind , the time , the money , and the necessary energy . I was going to say that some amusements New York provides for its own population and others for all corners and largely for outsiders . But I hesitated . because it seemed presumptuous to suggest that New York bad a population of its own . Its property in what it has is so very limited1 The place is mostly doors , and all open . It owns a little of everything , a little even of itself , but not much . I do n't know that any one has called it exclusive , but the imperial denizens of the boundless West say that it is oblivious to its relative unimportance , and is intemperate , ignorant , purse-proud , self-conceited , material-minded , frivolous , and incapable of seeing the merits or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a glass from the top of the Metropolitan tower . All that bountifulness of censure implies that there is something individual enough in New York to be scolded , and maybe there is , but the city is fairly pathetic in its hospitalities . There is aclub or two that makes a specialty of a membership that has the flavor of New York , and there is the vestry of Trinity Church which seems to be recruited from representatives of old New York families ; but the clubs that covet the New York flavor seem not to flourish better or to stand higher in public esteem than others that are wider open to imported talent ; and the corporation of Trinity does not insist upon having a native New-Yorker when it chooses a rector . Nevertheless New York has a resident population for which it makes a provision of amusement that is not quite identical with what it furnishes to visitors . To amuse visitors is one of the great money-making industries of the town . The hotels live on it ; the taxicabs flourish by it ; to that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintenance . But the little air-space and river-view parks and the big remoter parks are almost entirely for New-Yorkers who live in New York ; and though Central Park is a show-place , and Riverside Park , including its drive and its tomb , its river and the boulevard that runs far away beyond it . is another , the great use of these parks , too , is to refresh the spirits and recruit the physical energies of the resident population . How wonderfully they serve those ends can only be appreciated by a citizen who gets out of the beaten daily path in which every industrious resident , to conserve his necessary energies , is bound to direct his habitual steps , and inspects the habits and activities of his fellows whose needs are different from his , and their lives otherwise ordered . He will find on auspicious days in the proper time of year playgrounds swarming with active children , recreation piers full of life all day long , from morning when mothers bring their children to them , till evening when the band plays ( sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the river air . Nine miles north of the Plaza as the crow would fly if there was one , and as the Subway does actually run , is Van Cortlandt Park ? a lot of land with great fields , where golfers golf , and hall-players play ball , and tennis - players tennis , and where on Sunday afternoons ( and Saturdays too , doubtless ) all through the ? fall , football-players by the hundred contend in the sport so dear to human catapults , while crowds stand watching them along the side lines . Other multitudes inspect the animals in the great Bronx zoo , and walk through the woods and plantations of the Botanical Gardens . It amazes the more inert observer that so many people will go so far to tire themselves out with healthy exercises and wholesome recreations , but there comes in the energy of youth and the coercive pressure of the alternative . Home in a tenement or a flat is doubtless most attractive to the physically weary , and it is worth while to go out and get tired , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one 's lungs , and new topics of discourse , if only to make restricted guar-tern seem restful when one gets back to them . And that brings up the immense importance of cheap and rapid transportstion in a great city . Probably it does not pay a rapid-transit corporation to haul a passenger ten miles for five cents . But nrovided the passenger , whatever his age , is after the kind of amusement that helps him to live , it does pay the city , a part of which he is , to have him carried , as far as he needs , or has time , to go , for such a fare as he can afford to pay . Sometime , no doubt , the islands in the East River will he parks , and given over to recreation and pastimes , instead of being devoted , as now , to penal uses or the segregation of the insane . Meanwhile the value of Central and Riverside parks as breathing and walking spaces for multitudes of tenement-dwellers is only appreciated by people who spend their summers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know what shifts are used by the real city-dwellers who can not get away at all , nr only for a week or two . It is the problem of healthy life for people in that predicament that the matter of the city 's amusements enters into most vitally . When the population of a town has passed four millions already and is rapidly becoming five , and with no particular boundary in sight to stay it , it has become sufficiently important that the possibilities of healthy life should he carefully provided and distributed there . it does n't take much . Du Maurier pretty well covered the ground in his verses : " A little work , a little play To keep us going ? and so good day ! A little warmth , a little light Of love 's bestowing ? and so good night ! A little fun to match the sorrow Of each day 's growing ? and so good mor-row ! " To keep these necessaries of life within reach of all tolerably faithful and diligent people does not seem an impossible task , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrestrial convulsion in Europe continues to load up a long succession of steamships heading for New York harbor it will continue to offer considerable difficulties . Not only does the city owe to the industrious poor the chance to lead healthy and wholesome lives , but a metropolis in which swarms of people are constantly getting rich and other swarms are rich already , and to which throng folk with ready-made money , and very high-class workers of every kind whose wages are high , must provide recreations and exercises for all of these also . To he sure , the well-to-do people provide pretty carefully for themselves and their own welfare , supplying themselves with convenient country places , yachts , automobiles , summer migrations , and journeys of recreation to regions beyond the seas . But they and their children need parks and avenues to drive in , and bridle-paths to ride in , and with these , at least , the city provides them , the rest of the enormous total of amusement in which they share being furnished by themselves or by those who find a profit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinners , its dances , its clubs , its bridge , and all its activities , whether recreative or wearisome , there need be no anxiety on the part of the altruistic beyond a reasonable concern to see that the streets are paved and lighted , that the police are reasonably efficient , and CXVITT. ? No. 708. - 110that churches are kept open for the spiritual refreshment of such as grow weary of the pride of life . " Society " is much more in danger of too much amusement than too little , and too much is a very weary experience that people take the rest cure for . It is hard work and the hours are late , and the food is superabundant and drink somewhat over-plentiful , and the talk and the inspirations of it all seem often an inadequate return for the outlay involved . But all that is controllable by the individual will , and as citizens and taxpayers we do not have to worry over the troubles of folks who have too much fun , however as moralists or spiritual teachers we may be concerned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people get too much , and most people do n't get quite enough , and we could fix it all better for both groups if we knew how and bad the power . And yet , to be sufficiently amused seems so easy and so cheap , provided one has self-control , the right kind of mind , the skill to make a modest living without excessive labor , and that sense of human relationship which makes mankind companionable wherever found ! To be the right kind of a human being is so much more important than advantageous environment ! There are people who , if you put them down in Paradise , will have made some kind of a sty of it within three weeks , and people who , if you put them down in a sty , will either turn it into a modest Paradise or move . And so , of course , there are people who profit by opportunities of amusement and those who abuse them , but the fact of the abuse must not weigh to make us resigned to having folks deprived of opportunities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President Eliot said the other day in Boston to an audience of schoolboys : " There should he parks , gardens , and bath-houses to add to the public enjoyment . After all , is life for labor only ? Should we be content with working , to live a life for work ? We want enjoyment ; we need it ; and a very important part of the city , town , or household expenditures should be for getting and giving pleasure . We should not be contented with mere working to live . or living to work . "
