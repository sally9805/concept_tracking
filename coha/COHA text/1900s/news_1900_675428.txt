txt There is little doubt that the sentiments uttered with so much emphasis by the President on Saturday evening are shared by a great part of the American people , probably by the great body of them . The applause that greeted him from his fellow-Ohioans fairly expressed the feeling pervading this community , and , so far as it is possible to judge , Pervading the entire . Nation . Especially do the people of the United States accept the President 's statement of the duty imposed on them and on their representatives by the events o f the past two years . The statement was eitremety earnest . The President declared that the war was concluded " without a suspicion of unv.orthy motive of practice or purpose on our part , and with fadeless honor to our arras . " 1 " -1 pointed to " the grave trials and responsibilities " the close of the war had brought 1c us . He asserted that " no phrase or catchword can conceal the sacred obligation . it involves . " The problem before the people " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " In his closing passage he announced : " The liberators will never become the oppressors . A self-governed people will never permit despotism in any Government which they foster and defend . " " It is not possible that 73,000,000 American freemen are unable to establish liberty and justice and good government in our new DossPssionF . " These are brave words . We do not impeach their sincerity . We assume that they express the sentiments of the President 's heart . We do not question that he desires above all things to do his duty , and to help and guide the American people to do their duty . But desire is one thing and doing is another . Admitting that the President has constantly wished to do his duty , we are puzzled , and a vast number of the American people are puzzled , to account for what he has actually done within the past fortnight . He had declared in a message to Congress that it was our " plain duty " to establish freedom of trade between the island of Puerto Rico and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in direct contradiction to the principle thus dt:fined , a bill was passed by the House este blishing tariff duties . on the trade of Puerto Rico . A word from him would havt prevented this . The opposition to the ? ) ill in his own party ! n the House was ! tilled almost entirely by assurances that he wished the bill to pass . He did not deny that these assurances were well founded . He did not repeat his statement . He did not recall it . He sat in silence in the White House and saw the " plain duty " of the Government not merely evaded , but violated Here was a question to be " settled soberly and in good conscience . " The " phrases and catchwords " used in the House by the leaders of the majority could not " conceal the sacred obligation it involved . " By his own deliberate statement , officially made to Congress , here was a case in which the " liberators " were becoming the " oppressors . " He permitted the wrong . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong . Our readers are aware that we have not been grudging in the credit awarded to the President for many acts of courage and wisdrm . Nor have we hesitated to make all possible allowance for the difficulties by which he has been surrounded , cr to give him the benefit of doubt aue to insufficient information . We have therefore the right , and we feel it to be a duty , to say plainly that his course in this matter can not be explained on the known facts in a way , creditable to him and consistent with the standard of conduct that he has himself set up . So far as his personal reputation is involved , it is a small thing compared with the honor of the Nation , which is directly affected . It is a misfortune , a very grave misfortune , that the high purpose professed by the President in the name of the Nation can be exposed to suspicion by such substantial contrast between profession and permanence .               @ @ @ @ @ @
