Events and opinions touching the - Venezuelan question are overlying each other so rapidly that the lower stratum of fact is already passing out of sight . The Administration at Washington is blamed in some quarters for entering into any agreement with England and Germany which should recognize their right to coerce an American republic . But the principle upon which our Government has acted is a perfectly sound one , and its present position is unavoidable , unless we are to assume responsibility for the debts and also for the manners and behavior of the Spanish-American countries . No sane person would think of doing so . In order to assume such responsibility , we should have to take possession of the countries themselves and regulate their debts and their manners at the fountain-head . We are not prepared for that at present . Therefore , logically , we must say to other governments , when they have claims or complaints against the countries south of us , " Collect your claims , obtain your satisfaction in your own way , subject to the law of nations which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the soil of the offending state . " Before anybody blames the Administration , let him say what he would himself have done if he had had charge of public affairs . President Sehurman had better be careful how he criticises the masterly inactivity of Congress in regard to the Philippines , unless he- wishes to hear himself denounced as a " little American , " and a traitor . On Thursday night he had the audacity to say that the financial distress in the islands was due solely to " the palpable poltroonery and ' cowardice of the members of the American Congress . " Instead of joining in the cry that the quicker the Filipinos learn English the better for them , he declared that to insist upon one language in the Philippine Islands is a crime against nature and in defiance of history . " Really , this sort of talk would condemn him to a term of at least ten years in a Federal Penitentiary if the Imperialists could sit on his case Worst of all , President Schurman failbd to agree with President Roosevelt that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will in Alaska . Should it stay there after Our work is done , the Filipinos , he as . serted , would have to be either subjects ' or Citizens of the United States . As if this were not heresy enough , the Chief : Sign ' al Officer of the arniy , Gen A W Greely , made himself a candidate for the retired list by declaring that he never had believed in the war with Spain . The most disgusting part of all this is the evidence it affords that the anti-Imperialists refuse to be bound by repeated official proclamations that they are all dead . Mr. Samuel Gompers and a number of gentlemen who are in general sympathy with him on labor questions , have prepared and signed a protest against the recommendations of Prof. J. W. Jenks to the Secretary of War touching Chinese labor in the Philippines . They say that the recommendations , if carried out , would result in a system of coolie labor little better than slavery , and that they would also expose the people of the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a degradation of labor and a lowering of the standard of living . They contend further that the avowed object of these recommendations , which is to promote the exploitation of the islands by American and European capitalists , is not a sufficient offset to the evils which Chinese contract labor brings in its train . Professor Jenks is a pretty good authority on economic questions , and he has studied this particular subject on the ground . At the same time it must be said that the economic question is not the foremost one to be considered in this case . The first consideration here should be the happiness of the people to whom the country belongs , the Filipinos  --  upon which there is , no doubt , much to be said pro and con . The second is the kind of moral teaching which the United States gives to its own people , and to the world , when it lays down rules for immigration , for contract labor , and kindred matters . And here we have to confess that Professor Jenks 's plan , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laborers after their admission to the Philippines , is repulsive to American ideas of freedom and individuality , and ought to be promptly rejected by Congress . Pa his recent communication to the Evening Post , the Pension Commissioner , Mr. Ware , asked the aid of that newspaper in opposing the bestowal of pensions upon men convicted of infamous crimes . He also called its attention " to the propriety of making a fight ' upon the joint resolution of July 1 , 1902 , which was a bill to pension- the deserters of both armies " Mr. Ware 's opposition is the more praiseworthy-because this joint resolution became a law entirely . by the signature of Mr Ware 's chief , Theodore Roosevelt . The " hero of San Juan Hill , " in stump speeches , ' messages , ' etc. , ' has read ' us so - many sermons on tt b vicious influence of the craven and the weakling that we can explain his action only on the ground that he did not read the bill when it was presented to him . It consists of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the administration of the pension laws , any one who was honorably discharged from his last contract of service " shall be held and considered to have been honorably discharged from all similar contracts of service . " He may have deserted a dozen times from Confederates or Federals , and been the most conscienceless " bounty-jumper " in the army , but if he stayed six months in the service the last time he enlisted , he is to be pensioned along with the man who served from Sumter to Appomattox ! That Mr. Roosevelt could have approved this law knowingly is impossible of-belief , and he should join in the demand for its repeal . - At the National Reciprocity Convention at Detroit last week , Gov . Cummins of Iowa spoke like a man having solid ground under his feet and a firm backing among his constituents . " Tariff schedules , " he said , " like other laws , are to be made , unmade , and remade according to public needs , and we are not to be warned off by the statement that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the priests are not to be touched by profane hands . " He denied that it was necessary to change the whole tariff because a part of it needed to be changed . That notion was the refuge of two classes of donothings ? " those who want to perpetuate something which they know would be condemned under impartial investigation , and the timid souls who would rather not vote at all than vote right or wrong . " An opportunity is close at hand for the Republican party to divide into the two classes named by Gov . Cummins . The treaty of reciprocity with Newfoundland has been signed and transmitted to the Senate for ratification . It is ' the act of the present Republican Administration . It is also a repetition or revival of the Blaine-Bond treaty negotiated by a former Republican Secretary of State . It admits to our ports , free of duty , salted fish , fish sealskins , and the ores and metals of Newfoundland , in return for which our fishermen have certain privileges in. the ports of Newfoundland , and the admission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with reduced duties on cereals and provisions To this treaty it is said that the New England Senators are firmly opposed , because-it puts on the free list salt codfish , which is a product of New England industry Their attitude gives point to Gov . ' CUramins 's speeCh , and ' we ' shall Soon see ' Whetherthe whole Republican party is to divide on the lines which he drew so graphically at Detroit . The lecture on Trusts delivered by Judge Grosscup of the United States Circuit Court , at the University of Nebraska , is noteworthy in two particulars It is the opinion of a judge who has had a considerable amount of Trust litigation to deal with on the bench , and it is that the Sherman Anti-Trust Act is non-enforceable and ought to be repealed . Repeal of that act , he says , lies at the foundation of any effectual anti-Trust law . The reason why he thinks so is that it proceeds upon a false theory that the Trusts should be uprooted instead of regulated . So far are we from uprooting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Sherman act went on the statute-book . This is certainly something like a demonstration of the futility of that act . Judge Grosscup would substitute in place of it one which would " provide against artificial prices , brought about either by a cornering of the supply or by conspiracy , and also against discrimination in prices as to either buyers or places . There should be provision for open books , for stated examinations by some department of the Government , and for periodical statements to the public , as in the case of the national banks and many of the railway companies . The new legislation should forbid the issue of primary stock in ess : cess of the cash paid in , or the real value of property contributed , to make up the company 's assets . Some department of the Government should be charged  --  as between the company and the public  --  with the duty to see that this limitation Was enforced " This is a summary in brief of the Littlefield bill , and it can not fail to strengthen that measure in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the soothing influence which the Judge anticipates on the relations of labor and capital is more doubtful . The meeting of the Civic Federation came to an end on December 10 , and Chairman Hanna took occasion in the closing speech to praise the bituminous coal miners for standing by their contract and continuing work last summer , when they were asked to join the anthracite miners in a sympathetic strike . Mr. Hanna considered this a crucial test of the good faith of organized labor , and he congratulated the country on that notable event , but it is notorious that the success of the anthracite strike depended upon the bituminous miners keeping at work and contributing a certain percentage of their earnings to the strikers This was made clear by President Mitchell 's speech at the bituminous miners ' convention at Indianapolis , July 17 , which he concluded with a series of resolutions on the financial side of the ques tion . These embraced , an appropriation of $50,000 at once train the treasury of the United Mine Workers , an assessment of one dollar per week on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to all trade-unions and the general public for financial assistance , Which resolutions were wisely adopted . What would have been the consequences ' of a sympathetic strike in the bituminous mines at that time ? Not only would the anthracite miners have been without bread , but the bituminous miners would soon have been in the same plight , and the other trade-unions , nine-tenths of which were dependent on coal for their respective industries , would have been disabled in like manner . Mr. Hanna , as a bituminous coal operator , would have been crippled also , and prevented from lending aid to the anthracite workers even if he had been disposed to do so . We do not underestimate Mr. Mitchell 's service in preventing a large body of excited men from taking a step disastrous to themselves and to the public , but we think that we are now far enough removed from that event to clear our minds of cant . We learn from Indianapolis that the members of Local Assembly 300 , Knights of Labor , which is the labor organization of window-glass workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which can be made in a month , and that the President of this Assembly , Mr. Burns , has either rescinded or relaxed it . The members have refused to obey Mr. Burns 's order , and a new candidate for the presidency of the Assembly has taken the field against him , with every prospect of success . The reason for limiting the production of glass is to keep the price of the article up to the possible limit of the duty on imported glass under all circumstances . The duty is about 100 per cent . ad valorem ; that is , the American consumer of windpw glass must pay two prices for every Pane he buys . But this is not the whole ! story . From the Knights of Labor Journal , November issue , we learn not only that this fraud on the consumers has been accomplished , but that an outrage of equal magnitude has been perpetrated upon all the glass-blowers of the ; country who are not members of Local Assembly No. 300 . These are only 2,400 in number . They do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' except with their Permission , and in no event without paying an initiation fee Of several hundred dollars . So tyrannous and exasperating has this monopoly behorae that a bill is to be introduced in Congress , under the auspices of the Knights of Labor , to put window glass on the ' free list . A copy of the bill is printed in the Journal . The arguMent advanced editorially in favor of it has a familiar sound to our readers It affirms that no duty on window glass has been needed in. this country for purposes of protection these many years . It says that the effect of the exorbitant duty has been to enable-the manufacturers to become sluggards , . to take things easy , and to lag behind other countries in the-technicalities of the art . If they had made proper use of the opportunities which nature has ; thrown in their way , instead of relying upon the artificial supports of the tariff , . they might have distanced competition in foreign trade and commanded the markets of the world . The tariff on window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the glass be not more than ten by fifteen inches square , the duty is 1% cents per pound , and it rises to 4% cents per pound for sizes exceeding forty by sixty inches square Common window glass of the ordinary sizes , worth $1 50 to $2 per box in a free . market , costs the American consumer $3 to $4 per box , and the restrictions on the output in this country are such that an enlarged demand coming upon . the market can not be supplied . Consequently , there is an importation of 300,000 , to 400,000 boxes per year which might be made at home if the shackles of the Trust were thrown off . And yet we are told that the tariff has very little connection with Trusts , and that any meddling with the duties will bring destruction upon the " small producer . " Is there any smaller producer of glass than the compound window-glass Trust ? It was doubtless an agreeable duty which the National Civil Service Reform League performed at Philadelphia in giving to President Roosevelt the praise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appointments to office , and for his enforcement and strengthening of the civil-service laws . The discomfiture of the spoilsmen at his hands , in. the matter of the permanent census office , was a great stroke for reform , of which the full merit will be visible when the new order of things goes into effect on January 1 . The resolutions adopted by the League on Friday call for further steps in advance , one of them being the long-delayed reform of our consular system . President Roosevelt 's message endorsed the plan of bringing consular appointments and promotions under the merit system , and asked Congress to pass a law compelling it . The League favors such legislation , but also , adopting a suggestion of Mr. Schurz 's , calls upon the President to put the new system in force by Executive order , it Congress refuses to act . That he has the Constitutional power to do so can not be questioned . " The President shall appoint " ; and he may , if he pleases , say that he shall appoint only those consuls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is well enough to urge Congress to move first ; but if this particular reform fails , the responsibility will rest ultimately upon the President . He has the power fo inaugurate it on his own motion . We hope to see him do it . Postmaster-General Payne and Surveyor Clarkson are evidently having a lively time of it making sure that the Southern delegates do not get away from President Roosevelt . Both of these experienced political managers are reported to have been on the verge of desperation the other day , and to have averted a calamitous result only by prompt and vigorous means . It came about in connection with a North Carolina postmastership contest . Negro Republicans , in Washington to see about the appointment , were looking sullen over a report that the advice of Senator Simmons , a Democrat , had been asked by the President Manager Payne saw that this would never do , so he engineered an " administrative intimation " that Senator Simmons 's interference was regarded as an impertinence This comforted the negroes , but drove Senator Simmons into fury . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to " disclose " his relations with the Administration . But Manager Payne was equal to the occasion . He sent for Senator Pritchard and hurried him off to the Senate to stop the speech Pritchard arrived and found his colleague , typewritten sheets in hand , ready for the onslaught , but was successful in making him die with all his music in him . Meanwhile , Surveyor Clarkson made a " flying trip " to Washington and " talked matters over " with the President . For the moment , everybody is breathing more easily ; but it was a narrow escape . All friends of good city government will rejoice that the retirement of Col. Partridge furnishes the Mayor an opportunity to have the Police Department thoroughly overhauled . The one explicit mandate of the voters at the last municipal election was that such a reform be had , by root-and-branch methods , if necessary . Now that the Department has been freed from a demonstrated failure , the field is clear for the selection of a new head who shall have the needed physical and mental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the capacity to make himself aterror to evil-doers on and off the force. - A Commissioner of Police of that type may yet retrieve the whole situation , and make the outlook for the continuance of a reform city government after next year entirely different . We confidently count upon Mayor Low 's zeal in finding such a man . He simply must be found , and the work must be done . Everybody will be ready to let bygones be bygones , and heartily uphold the hands of the Administration if it only puts an edge on reform , and tireless energy into the rescue of the city from Tammany and all its ways . A very estimable woman , high in the councils of the Woman 's Christian Temperance Union , takes President Roosevelt to task for harboring in the White House Mr. George F. Watts 's great picture , " Love and Life . " The picture , it may be remembered , was given to the nation by Mr. Watts . At the time there was some anxiety as to the proper disposal of the gift . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and superior to most of his work in execution . The composition need hardly be recalled to our readers ? Life , a frail woman 's form steadied along a mountainous pathway by the sturdier figure of Love . Both are nude , and so best express the artist 's high thought , which is that love sustains when otherwise the path of life were too difficult to be trod . This is what a normal person of no extraordinary discernment would see in Mr. Watts 's beautiful allegory . We presume that this is what President Roosevelt , the temporary custodian of this work of art , sees in it . Of course , it is possible to see it in another light . To the well-intentioned woman who has assumed the charge of the President 's artistic morale , it is ? " A nude woman going up a cliff in a high wind . " There is an appalling truthfulness in this description , and if " Love and Life " were no more than that , we might adopt the plan of that exceptionally chaste century , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nuditres of the Renaissance . It is a very barren victory that the German Government has won in passing the tariff bill ; in fact , many friends of the present order see in the bill itself , and in the manner in which it was forced through the Reichstag , the beginning of industrial distress and of political disorder . The Government has asked for " a weapon " against commercial rivals  --  a tariff schedule so high that all who trade with Germany must sue for concessions  --  and now it has a weapon with a vengeance . The tariff schedules , as amended out of all semblance to their original conditions by the Agrarians , are so excessive that the Vosszsche Zettung questions seriously if they can ever ' be put into effect Of course , the case of the Government was surrendered when the Chancellor , contrary to his own protestations , accepted-a prohibitive duty on barley for malting purposes . He does well to refuse the hollow offer of a prince 's title for his services in passing such a bill . He must realize that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be passed . It is a high price  --  the Government is paying for the Kaiser 's canal and naval projects , and the Chancellor has no more reason to expeat fidelity in his Agrarian allies for the future than he has found moderation in the past . , More unfortunate than the victory of the German squirearchy or the grotesque tariff bill itself , is the manner in which that measure has been passed . It will raise the price of food for every workman in the German mills , it will strike at the export trade which has made Germany a prosperous manufacturing nation , it will have a tendency to bring distress upon all those not engaged in agriculture . In view of these facts , the refusal to hear the minority  --  the representatives of the classes most likely to be injured by the bill  --  was wholly indefensible . The majority had , to be sure , the pretext of suppressing deliberate obstruction ; but the pretext was a flimsy one . Violent obstruction by the Social Democrats was used only against the extraordinary proposal to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separate sections . It was a measure of self-defence , and , in essence , less disorderly than the gag rule of the **25;160;TOOLONG majority . The surrender of the Government to the Agrarians and its oppression of the Socialist and Radical minority seem an excessive price to pay for a very bad tariff . The ulterior effects of the whole incident can only be to increase class prejudice in Germany , and ultimately to strengthen the anti-dynastic parties . What would have been one of the wonders of the world a century ago was completed on December 10 , when the great dam of the Nile at Assuan was formally opened . Not only is it one of the greatest engineering feats of modern times , but it bids fair to be one of the most beneficent public works undertaken by any modern Government Completed a year before the contract time , the actual construction of this great reservoir has taken but little more than four years It makes navigation to Wady Haifa possible throughout , the year by means of a canal ? around the cataract . But its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a consequent famine by storing sufficient water to supply the irrigation canals , even when the Nile flood fails to bring down its rich silt to the tillers of the soil . More than that , the reservoir will make two crops a year possible , one in winter and one in summer , and this system of double crops is counted on to make Egypt in time one of the richest countries of the world , in proportion to its area and population . No work that England has done for the natives in any of its foreign possessions surpasses its achievements in Egypt . The excellence of its administration in the Nile country is , indeed , the one justification of its failure to keep its solemn pledge to evacuate this country .
