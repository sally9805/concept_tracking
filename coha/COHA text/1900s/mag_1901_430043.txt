 | THE nearest approach to the pomp and pageantry of a royal court , with its attendant emblems of heraldry and insignia of rank , its gorgeous , stately ceremonials and the dazzling splendor of the raiment of its devotees , which the American continent , has known since the days of Montezuma , is to be found in the assemblages of the Diplomatic Corps at Washington . These levees ? invariably half social , half official , for the representatives of royalty never wholly unbend ? easily constitute the most attractive of all the spectacular features of life in the nation 's most beautiful city . In glitter and sparkle and color , the pictures presented are well-nigh the peer of any afforded by the capitals of Europe or the Orient , and even in the settings ? the ball-rooms and banquet-halls ? the seat of government need not blush for its possessions . Uncle Sam now has diplomatic relations with fully three dozen countries , which are represented at the American capital by six Embassies and thirty Legations . Composing these various transplanted households are more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and clime , and constituting the most interesting " foreign colony " to be found on this hemisphere . To look after the business of the Embassies alone , and provide the proper social environment for these official habitations , more individuals are now required than were to be found the entire Diplomatic Corps at the City of Magnificent Distances a few years ago . In addition to the Ambassador , who is , of course , intrusted with the entire direction of the affairs of the Embassy , there are Secretaries , Naval Attaches , Military Attaches , and mayhap interpreters , forming a staff which in the case of some Embassies , such as the British and the Chinese Legations , includes about a dozen persons . The diplomatic contingent at Washington has been growing larger year by year , and the increase has been particularly marked since the consequences of the Spanish-American war forcibly installed the United States in the position of a world-power . More than that , a broader importance and deeper significance have been imparted to this congress of nations at Miss Columbia 's Court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It may be explained that in the management of international problems of statecraft Ambassadors and Ministers Plenipotentiary bear much the same relation to each other as do Senators and Representatives in the deliberations of the American legislative body . The Ambassadors are the bright particular stars of the diplomatic firmament . Not only do they enjoy higher rank than their confreres , and the presumption of representing more directly the authority of their sovereign or government , but , through the possession of greater discretionary privileges , they are enabled to handle the matters which come within their jurisdiction with less delay for instructions from officials at home . In conformity with one of the strict rules of diplomatic usage , however , no nation sends an Ambassador to a country which has not delegated in exchange an official of equally high diplomatic rank , and so the intensely democratic convictions of the American lawmakers restricted Uncle Sam 's  | official guests , for more than a century , to envoys of lesser rank . Since the passage of the law making it possible to raise representatives of the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most powerful nations on the globe ? Great Britain , France , Russia . Germany , Italy and Mexico ? have demonstrated their respect for the Republic by sending to Washington ambassadorial appointees . Adding dignity to the personnel of this cosmopolitan gathering on American soil , has also contributed to its splendor and impressiveness . In the corps , as at present constituted , are many men of world-wide reputation ? statesmen whose names stand for some of the most brilliant diplomatic triumphs known to modern times . In spite of the fact that he light of publicity beats so fiercely around these bearers of the greetings of kingdoms and empires to the land of freedom , they in reality live to a considerable extent in a realm of mystery , and to penetrate this realm seems to be one of the dearest ambitions of a considerable portion of American citizens . If one would gain tangible evidence of how potent is the attraction exerted by these distinguished foreigners , with their suggestion of strange peoples and unheard-of customs . he has only to note the eager interest manifested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Union , who throng every formal function at Washington where a glimpse may be caught of this contingent of gaily attired dignitaries . There are only a few occasions each year , however , when the general public may feast its eyes upon this brave show of fur and tinsel . The New Year 's reception at the White House , and the special reception which the President tenders annually to the Diplomatic Corps , bring out the showiest court costumes in the wardrobes of the distinguished foreigners : as does also some special event , now and  | then , such as the inauguration of the Chief Executive , a memorial service in honor of some departed monarch , or a wedding in which the chief participants are members of the diplomatic circle . The costumes in which the representatives of the governments of the world come to pay their respects to the highest official in the United States , are in most marked contrast to the habiliments of America 's envoys in the throne-rooms of Europe . In the early years of the century , Uncle Sam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of two kinds of uniform , each including a coat of blue , lined with silk , both coat and cape being heavily loaded with embroidery . For half a century , however . our emissaries at the courts of the world have been restricted to " the simple dress of an American citizen , " now and then modified in detail , as by the introduction of knee-breeches or a dress-sword . In the official plumage of the diplomats gathered at the American capital , on the other hand , there is embodied every hue known to nature . Many Attaches are officers in the military or naval service of their respective countries , and appear in the brilliant uniforms of the various branches of such service . The fashion-plates of diplomatic court-dress embrace everything from splendid uniforms of glowing crimson and snowy white to others gleaming with gold embroideries on black , set off in many instances by the fur trimmings of the hussar capes and a wealth of dec- orations , while prominent by contrast are the red fezes of the Turkish Minister and the members of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chinese Legationers . A titled visitor who is eagerly sought out by the eyes of the spectators at every diplomatic function is Lord Pauncefote , the British Ambassador to the United States . This interest is perhaps due in part to his position as Dean of the Diplomatic Corps . The coterie of diplomats , constituting a body by itself , is governed by laws of its own making , and custom has decreed that length of service shall fix the Deanship . If all the foreign representatives at Washington still ranked as Ministers , it is possible that Lord Pauncefote would not hold the coveted post ; but since seniority among the Ministers does not count where there are Ambassadors , and Lord Pauncefote was the first Ambassador appointed to this country , he stands as arbiter in all the delicate questions of precedence which arise from time to time within the Corps . Mod-@# ern times have known no handsomer costume than the regulation gold-embroidered dress-uniform of the British diplomat , and the regular ornamentation is augmented , in the case of the uniform which Lord Pauncefote has worn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insignia of his rank . The court-dress of many of the diplomats bears a slight resemblance to the Knights Templar uniform so familiar in this country , but is much more elaborate in every way . A majority of . the LatinAmerican governments have within the  | past year or two adopted a universal design for diplomatic dress ? a uniform resplendent in red and gold . One of the most striking uniforms ever seen in Washington is that worn on state occasions by Baron Hengelmuller , the Minister from Austro-Hungary . It consists of deepred trousers , high black boots , and a black velvet cloak splendidly ornamented . Count Cassini , the Russian Ambassador , is a diplomat who has during his long career performed many notable services for his government , and the testimonials of appreciation which have come to him in the form of decorations have made of the front of his court-coat literally a mass of gold and jewels that sparkles with every move . The members of the Russian Embassy are notable for the sumptuousness of their uniforms , and this made all the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the memorial services in honor of Queen Victoria , they appeared in plain black , with astrakan-trimmed chapeaux with black feather tufts . It may be noted , also , that on occasions such as the one mentioned all the foreign diplomats have the hilts of their swords intertwined with black crape . The representatives of our sister republic , France , are provided with far more imposing court-dress than are the officials in the diplomatic service of the United States . In addition , the French Ambassador , Monsieur Cantbon , and all the members of his staff who served in Washington during the SpanishAmerican war , are adorned with the superb decoration of the Order of Isabella , presented by the Queen Regent of Spain in acknowledgment of their good offices in effecting peace . Dazzling as are the uniforms of the Europeans , and the diplomats from South and Central America , however , they are outshone in a measure by the elaborate attire of the courtiers from the Orient . At the head of this contingent stands Wu Ting Fang , the famous Chinese Minister . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purple silk , trimmed with white for , over which he wears a heavy silken , fur-trimmed cloak . His costume represents the acme of magnificence in one direction , just as Lord Pauncefote 's coat of scarlet , with gold collar , frogs and slashes , does in another . A distinguishing characteristic of Minister Wu 's costume is an immense diamond which he wears in the front of his silk turban . The able representative of the Celestial Empire tells most humorously of his fright when on one occasion he missed the precious stone , only to discover after a terrified search that he had reversed his turban in donning it . The members of the Chinese Legation are the only servitors of the nations at Washington who do not carry the regulation dress-sword . The uniforms of Minister Takahira of Japan and his Secretaries and Attaches , although the embodiment of gorgeousness , more nearly conform to Continental fashion ; and so also does the attire of the Koreans , although it has  | been but a few wars since the latter were pointed out to spectators at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human medley . The Siamese diplomats have , to a considerable extent , taken the place in the panorama vacated by the Koreans , and their trappings more than compensate the sight-seer for the suddenly acquired modesty in dress on the part of their neighbors in the Far East . The Siamese Minister , Phya Prasiddhi , one of the new arrivals at Washington , is of the most unostentatious appearance when clad in the prescribed garb of American society , but on state occasions he blooms , like a suddenly unfolded flower , in robes of the richest brocaded satins and a silken scarf of wonderful hues . The closing- months of the century brought the Siamese envoy a rival for the position of the most elaborately dressed diplomat , in the person of Gen. Isaac Khan . the new Persian Minister . In this connection it may be recalled that the former Persian envoy , the first representative whom the Shah ever sent to Wash- ington , was virtually driven away by the funny pictures whereby the American newspapers portrayed his fantastic costumes . The new-comer is evidently not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excite admiration than amusement , for the new uniform which was made for him in Paris just before his departure for his present post of duty is quite the most gorgeous outfit that has been seen on this side of the Atlantic . The unique feature of the apparel of Ali Ferrouh Bey , the Turkish Minister , and the members of his suite , is found , of course , in the omnipresent red fez , which these diplomats wear even in church . The masculine contingent from the Turkish Legation was compelled to divide interest at the White House reception which ushered in the century , with the only lady  | who ever accompanied the representatives of the Sultan on such an occasion . The Minister could not be accompanied by his wife or sister , who are strict Mohammed ans and take no part in the social life of the capital , but Mme. Sidky Bey , the wife of the Second Secretary , was present with her husband , and her quaint gown attracted no end of attention . The gowns of the feminine members of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the fashionably dressed American women that they are rather outshone , in so far as popular interest is concerned , by the costumes in which their liege lords appear on state occasions . The one notable exception is found in the case of Madame Wu , the wife of the Chinese Minister . Madame Wu is the possessor of some of the handsomest jewels in the United States , and these , with her close-fitting velvet headdress , are alone sufficient to rivet feminine interest . The head-dress is fastened by three ornaments , the settings of which are respectively : an enormous pearl , a large solitaire diamond , and a ruby surrounded by a number of large , brilliant diamonds . Among the Chinese woman 's other treasures are ear-rings and a necklace of diamonds , and several clusters of pearls . Madame Wu is also the possessor of a collection of surplice-like overdresses , for wear over her short skirts ? garments of the richest brocade , which are the envy of nearly all the members of the gentler sex among the lookers-on at the pageantry of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the gaiety of dress among the diplomats is restricted to formal functions . Many of these temporary sojourners from other climes appear now and then in golf costumes that are amazing to behold . The French Ambassador , the Danish Minister , and many of the Attaches of the British , German and other Legations , are enthusiastic golfers , and although Minister Wu may occasionally be seen trudging around  | @# the links in a flowing robe , the counterpart of which , for vividness of tint , could scarcely be seen on the comic-opera stage , he hardly presents so striking an appearance as some of the younger diplomats with their fearful and wonderful plaids and checks . The provision of the elaborate costumes necessitated by his official duties is the severest strain upon the pocketbook of a young man in the diplomatic service , and unfortunately he can not emulate the example of some of the junior naval officers and arrange joint ownership in some of the trappings of his station . Doubtless the younger members of the Diplomatic Corps find many compensations in the adulation which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in official life at Washington is so sought after by the hostesses of society , and owing to the proverbial feminine fondness for gold braid and bright buttons , even the officers of the American army and navy often fail to defeat these foreigners in a tourney for the favor of the beauties of the American Court . During the past decade , many members of the Diplomatic Corps have married American girls . This is , however , seriously discouraged in the case of the Ministers by their respective governments , who contend that an envoy , having to reside , as occasion may demand , in any part of the world , should be wedded to one of his own countrywomen . Of course , this has not prevented a number of Ministerial representatives from marrying daugh-@#  | ters of Uncle Sam , although in almost every case the action has been closely followed by transfer to some other post . With the Secretaries and Attaches the case is different , the gov-ernments seldom , if ever , interposing objection , and a large number of international marriages of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The wives of diplomats at Washington are entirely exempt from giving public receptions , which custom has prescribed as one of the duties of the ladies of the Cabinet and the wives of United States Senators , but nevertheless many of them , actuated by a fine sense of courtesy . have frequently given charming public entertainments . There have been numerous regrettable features connected with some of these functions at the diplomatic homes . Curiosity to catch a glimpse of the treasures of these transplanted homes has naturally attracted immense crowds . and in some cases the hospitality of the foreign Embassies and Legations has been grievously intruded upon . Minister Wu had perhaps the most distressing experience . When the affable Chinaman first took up his residence in Washington , he held a gland reception , but the swanning crowds trampled upon his lawn and carried off his bric-a-brac , and now nothing could induce him to repeat the experience . Countess Cassini , who presides over the household of the Russian Embassy . was lately obliged to request the publication of a notice to the effect that her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Embassy , on one occasion , a mother took lice brood of dirty children into the great ball-room ,  | and after seating them on a divan done in French upholstery , proceeded to the dining-room and helped herself to enough cake to satisfy the ravenous youngsters . It is hardly to be wondered at , therefore , that to give a public entertainment is not regarded as a pleasure by the foreign Embassies , and the decline of this form of function has been very rapid . The diplomats at Washington are great dinner-givers . Some of the most brilliant assemblages at the capital are to be found at their tables . ( ) n the other hand , there are diplomatic repasts to which all the envoys and their wives are incited which are rather dull affairs , nor is this strange when it is taken into consideration that a guest may sometimes be assigned to take down to dinner a lady with whom he has no language in common . The members of the foreign colony are most punctilious in the observance of all the details of official @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of officialdom for the return of a first call , Ambassadors and Ministers usually return a call immediately , taking this promptitude as the most delicate possible expression of their appreciation of the visit . Not infrequently a caller at an Embassy or a Legation will find the card of the person called upon when he returns to his own home at the end of the afternoon round of visits . A grave pitfall to be eschewed by every new-comer in Washington society is found in the intricacies of social precedence based on official rank . Paltry and incredible as it may seem , grave international complications have on more than one occasion been threatened because ignorant hostesses at the national capital unwittingly assigned envoys to seats at dinner lower than their rank should have permitted . In the social scale the President is followed by the Vice-President , and then come the Ambassadors , who , being presumed to represent the persons of their sovereigns , are disposed to yield precedence only to members of the royal family of the court or the sons and brothers of crowned heads . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since . Lord Pauncefote claimed that his position entitled him to take precedence of every person save the President , and it was not until the venerable diplomat received a special hint from the Foreign Office at London that he consented to call on the Vice-President .  | Following the Ambassadors , in the official list in use at the White House , comes the Secretary of State , although when the ambassadors give functions at which he is a guest the Premier ranks even the Dean of the Diplomatic Corps . After the Secretary of State . when the regular order is observed , come the Envoys Extraordinary and Ministers Plenipotentiary and Charges d'Affaires . It is not expected that the President shall ever call at any of the Embassies or Legations , although in the case of one or two Chief Executives this rule has not been rigidly adhered to . Probably the diplomats are really seen to best advantage at the annual balls or receptions which some of the Embassies and Legations give in honor of their sovereigns . The greatest of these functions in recent years have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recurring anniversary of the Queen 's birthday . Of course , there are never any tangles over problems of precedence at festivities at which diplomats are hosts , but when an outsider entertains the Corps the event is usually preceded by an interchange of correspondence equal in volume to that of a big business firm , before all the guests are assigned to positions compatible with their dignity . Finally , nations , like small boys , occasionally get in quarrels . and during these " do n't speak " periods the greatest care must be exercised to prevent embarrassing occurrences at social functions at the capital . Then , too , there are Powers that have long-standing feuds which their representatives seek to perpetuate . A case in point is that of Austria and Mexico . The former government did not until a few weeks ago recognize the existence of the latter nation . and several times the Secretary of State or the Dean of the Diplomatic Corps was called upon to devise ways whereby the envoy of one country might be honored without giving offense to the other . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
