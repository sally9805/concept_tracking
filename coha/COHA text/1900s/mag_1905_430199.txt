 |p1060  " AFTER Bread , Education is the Great Necessity . " So runs the inscription upon one of the most famous public monuments of Paris . That education is a social necessity is no longer seriously questioned . But the other idea of the French motto , that education must come after bread ? that it is alike foolish and cruel to attempt to educate a hungry child ? is often lost sight of . In the early days of the public agitation for free and compulsory education it was not infrequently urged that before the State should undertake to compel a child to attend its schools and receive its instruction it ought to provide for the adequate feeding of the child . That argument , happily , did not prevent the establishment and development of public education , but now that the latter institution has been firmly rooted in the soil of our social system , there is an increasing belief in the inherent wisdom and justice of the claim that the State has no moral right to attempt to educate an unfed child . Apart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a policy . All practical educators agree that the money and effort spent in the endeavor to instruct hungry or underfed children are largely wasted . Few , if any , will disagree with Superintendent W. H. Maxwell , of the New York Public Schools , when he says : " Education , whether physical or mental , is seriously retarded , if not practically impossible , when the body is improperly or imperfectly nourished . " That mental under-development commonly attends physical under-development is a physiological fact too firmly established and too obvious for argument . Our national complacency has received a severe shock , or a series of shocks , in the form of the revelation of a growing and menacing poverty problem of vast dimensions . The terrible , sinister , challenging phrase , " ten millions in poverty , " alarms us . Some phases of the poverty problem we have studied and familiarized ourselves with , but its relation to our future citizenry , the children upon whom we lavish so much money and effort for their education , we have neglected . In this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , England and Germany . They have given it most serious attention and studied poverty in relation to the efficiency of their educational systems , public morality and the development of their children physically and mentally . Mr. Robert Hunter 's estimate that in New York City alone some sixty to seventy thousand school children suffer from underfeeding has caused something of a sensation . While no serious attempt has been made to dispute that estimate , or the data upon which it is based , there is a wide divergence of opinion , naturally in the absence of comprehensive and carefully collected facts . On Mr. Hunter 's side are some of the most prominent and experienced officials of the great charitable societies , some of whom think he has understated the extent of the evil , and many of the most experienced medical men of large practice among the poor . Others there are , of course , who regard it as a wild guess , unwarranted by facts . But they do not offer any evidence in rebuttal of Mr. Hunter 's statements . They give only bare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been directed to the statement about the condition of the children in New York City schools . It has tended to obscure the most important fact of all , that the poverty problem is national in its scope . It is not a question of sixty or seventy thousand under/ fed school children in New York , but of nearly three million children in the United States underfed , and suffering in consequence from under-development physically and mentally . Boston , Philadelphia , Cleveland , Chicago , Jersey City , these and scores of other cities are equally , in proportion to their size , confronted by this grave problem . Statistical data upon the question of underfeeding are scarcely obtainable , as no systematic inquiry has ever yet been made in the public schools of any American city . During the past two months I have made a somewhat careful and detailed investigation of this problem , approaching it from various sides . I have personally visited many of the largest public schools and gathered the experiences of the teachers and principals ; I have gone over several of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ histories ? often from their own lips ? and backed these direct observations and inquiries by investigations at the homes of the children , made by trained investigators . In addition to these observations in the schools I have the testimony of physicians- of large practice amongst the poor , heads of large hospitals and dispensaries , visiting nurses and others , whose collected testimony is based upon personal observations of many thousands of cases every year . Miss L. S. Bainbridge , head of the Woman 's Branch of the New York Mission and Tract Society , says : " The general experience of our thirty or forty workers is that two-thirds of the children in the tenement families are not sufficiently nourished to do good brain work in the school . It is the constant experience of our trained nurses that their services are asked for children who need a bowl of soup or a good dish of oatmeal with milk on it rather than medicine . " The head of the Babies ' Hospital , Miss Marianna Wheeler , gives underfeeding through poverty and improper feeding through ignorance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ailments treated . Sometimes underfeeding and improper feeding are not distinguishable . A mother too poor to buy milk may give her child tea and bread . Such a case will often be regarded as one of improper feeding through ignorance , when , in fact , IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS Io61 it is one of underfeeding due to poverty . A classification of the cases entered in the Babies ' Hospital for a single day , sixteen in number , gives eight cases due to absolute underfeeding , five to improper feeding and only three in which these causes did not appear as primary factors . The Presbyterian Hospital reports a majority of its patients suffering from under-nutrition . The Superintendent , Miss Maxwell , says : " Of the 1,359 cases of pulmonary tuberculosis visited by our district nurses we are convinced that one-third of that number are suffering from insufficient and improper food . Of the 653 acute medical cases , one-sixth of the number suffered from marasmus and one-ninth with rachitis . " Both these diseases are essentially due to undernutrition . At one large dispensary where they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told that quite 50 per cent . of all the cases were due , wholly or in large part , to underfeeding or improper feeding . Taking only the absolutely underfed , the Registrar told me that 33 1-3 per cent . would be a conservative estimate . Fifty per cent . underfed was the estimate of the Superintendent of another of the large dispensaries . Not less emphatic is the testimony of those principals and teachers in the schools who have given the problem their attention . I have heard teachers tell of children fainting from exhaustion and hunger . In many more cases I have been told of backward , deficient , drowsy children , whose condition is directly traceable to underfeeding . The average citizen , who is inclined to doubt the wisdom and perhaps also the need of providing food for the children in our public schools , would be surprised to know the extent to which the teachers , out of their generally too slender incomes , provide suffering children with food , and sometimes with shoes and clothing . Investigation in the schools is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sympathetic and tactful the natural sense of the shame of poverty in the child is hard to overcome . And not all teachers are blessed with the gift of tact . I have more than once had inquiries made with the result that in the  |p1062  same school , in two classes of children of about equal age ? and coming in many cases from the same homes ? the reports have given from to to 5o per cent . underfed in the one class and absolutely none at all in the other . In such cases careful inquiry has shown that the one teacher had sympathetically and privately questioned the children individually , while the other had simply taken the class collectively and gone through some such formula as this : " Is there any child here who does not have enough to eat at home and is hungry ? If so , please show hands ! " I have gathered record upon record of such " investigations . " Even so , with such unintentionally brutal methods , not a few cases have been revealed where children were in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made by the teachers the results have been alarming . I have before me the letter of the principal of a school giving the results of an investigation made in two classes , one of boys , the other of girls . When I visited the school the principal told me that there were " quite a number of underfed children . " In her letter written to me later she says that one-tenth of the children in the girls ' class were reported as underfed and onefifth in the boys ' class . In the boys ' class subsequent inquiry showed there were two boys very weak from lack of food . Another teacher in the same school said that quite 50 per cent . of her class are underfed . In another school I was told by the principal of children fainting in school from lack of food . Of one thousand pupils I was told " at least one hundred are badly underfed . Careful inquiry would probably show that the number was much larger . " This , by the way , is one of the schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shape of food and clothing is given by the teachers . In another school of some fourteen hundred children the principal , a most humane man , assured me that there were " not five cases in the whole school " of necessitous children . He undertook to have his teachers personally and privately inquire of every child in order that he might show how " absurd " the estimate of to per cent . underfed children was . Of nine hundred and nine children whose cases were reported by the teachers one hundred and four had had no breakfast that day , while fiftyfour children had had insufficient and were hungry . In most cases they had had only bread and tea . Thus , the result shows 17 per cent . of the children examined to be underfed . Of course allowance must be made for those children who went without breakfast from causes other than poverty , such as lack of appetite , fear of being late , etc . Tho , I must add , that in many cases children who miss their food for the latter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work and who must , therefore , shift for themselves . For many such children going without breakfast , and even without lunch , is so common as to be almost a chronic condition . The teacher 's written report from one class iii this school shows that of forty-three children present no less than thirteen had had no breakfast , while twelve were classed as having had very little . When that report was sent back to the teacher with instructions to find out the reason why the thirteen had come to school without food , it came back with postscript , " There was no food for them to eat . " Principals and teachers have told me of children giving out , fainting from hunger , and when they were given wholesome and nourishing food , which they ate ravenously , being nauseated because they were not used to it . In one school , where there is a special class of backward , defective children , provision has been made for feeding them . A fund has been created by the teacher , to which the children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the teacher and the principal . Every day at ten o'clock the children get a cup of hot milk each , and three times a week they get the products of the Girls ' Cooking Class . Only after feeding them could the teacher begin to make progress with these defectives . She assured me that careful study and inquiry had led to the conclusion that there was generally , if not always , under-nourishment and consequent physical under-development to account for the mental under-development of the children . Experiments in Boston have shown similar results .  |p1063  Aside from the question of underfeeding , tho often inseparable from it , is the broader question of improper feeding . This often is a result of the ignorance of the parents ? and such ignorance is not confined to the poor , tho most prevalent among them . I have heard of babies less than a month old being fed upon cabbage ! But there is a phase of the evil of improper feeding which I have found generally prevalent . Many of the mothers of the children go out to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In many of these cases the children are given a small sum of money , generally from three to five cents , with which to buy lunch . There is not the absolute lack of income associated with destitution , but an industrial condition which prevents the mother giving her attention to the children . Judicious expenditure upon wholesome food in these cases is the exception . The children buy candy , apples , often unripe , covered with a coating of highly colored sugar ( from which so many cases of ptomaine poisoning have been recorded ) , or pickles , sometimes the latter with a " hunk " of bread , but oftener without . I know of scores of cases of children having bought pickles day after day . Sometimes , especially among the boys , the game of " craps " is responsible for one having no lunch and the other having a particularly big , unwholesome " blow-cut . " Many teachers have pointed to this lunch question as the most serious of all , and expressed an earnest wish that some means could be devised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children 's pennies upon decent , wholesome food . That the evils of underfeeding and improper feeding due to the destruction of the best features of home life by our industrial conditions are terrible in their magnitude and far-reaching influences is certain . Something must be done . But the first step which should be taken is an investigation of the problem itself . It is to be sincerely hoped that the committee appointed for that purpose by the Board of Education in New York will cause an expert investigation to be made upon the following points : ( 1 ) The extent of underfeeding ; ( 2 ) its physical effects so far as they can be ascertained by weighing and measuring the children in various districts and comparing the results ; ( 3 ) its mental effects as seen in the relative receptivity and efficiency of the underfed and the wellfed ; ( q ) the improvements noted in children 's homes , etc. , as a result of properly feeding hitherto underfed children ; ( 5 ) methods , cost and results of various experiments in the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoped that the school authorities in other cities will cause similar inquiries to be made . For it can not be too often repeated that this is a problem which exists in every industrial and commercial center of the nation . While my recent personal investigations have been confined to New York , yet I have heard from teachers and others of similar conditions prevailing in other cities , notably Boston , Philadelphia , Chicago and Cleveland . Child labor investigations in Pennsylvania have shown that it is the underfed , undeveloped and backward child who is most often taken from school and sent to the factory or the mine . Thus the work of physical deterioration and ruin begun ere the child leaves its cradle , aye , often ere it leaves the womb of the mother , is completed . It is trite to say that no nation can afford to allow its children to go underfed . That means national peril and decay . There is no greater " race suicide " than that . To those who cry out that any attempt on the part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " it should be sufficient to point out that our public school system itself has grown out of " pauper " beginnings . And to those who take refuge behind the old idea of the " survival of the fittest , " I suggest that to make as many as possible fit to survive is the better basis for civilized statesmanship.
