txt Rights of Speech and Meeting . In England , when we say that we have " free speech , " we mean that we have it , not merely that " it can be had upon application , " ( provided the Mayor or the Park Commissioner thinks the applicant a fit subject to use it . ) A man who wants to use his right uses it , without any one 's permission . If his pocket is empty or a hall not big enough for him , or if no hallkeeper likes his face , he goes out , asking nobody 's permit , to a street corner , a public park , any public place where he can find room for his crowd without obstructing traffic . He is , of course , as here , " responsible for the abuse of that liberty , " though as a matter of fact I never knew of any case in England of any man being arrested for anything he said at a meeting indoors or out . Now , am I to understand from your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my constitutional right " of free speech and free meeting in this country is dependent on a nervous Park Commissioner feeling sure that the crowd will not be unmanageable and dangerous " ?
