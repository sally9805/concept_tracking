txt Police Commissioner BAKER reported yesterday that twenty-two persons were killed in the streets of New York by automobiles and more than 100 injured in October . This statement is shocking , but we all know that motor cars have been permitted to travel too rapidly in our streets , to turn corners at full speed , to cross crowded thoroughfares heedlessly . The Commissioner seems to believe that the corruption and inefficiency of his bicycle squad is partly responsible for the sacrifice of human life and for the immunity of reckless drivers . A new bicycle squad has been in training , its members recruited from the ranks of patrolmen , and many , if not most , of the members of the present squad may be subordinated . Commissioner BAKER is responsible for the misdeeds of his men , and he is right , if he believes that any branch of the force has been negligent or dishonest , to punish them . It seems that dishonesty , if it can be proved , should be punished by dismissal rather than transference . But we assume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earnest or he would not publish ' assertions reflecting so strongly on the Integrity of the force he controls . His charges imply that in the various garages an acquaintance with the bicycle squad , regulators of traffic , is maintained , to the pecuniary profit of the policemen . The further implication Is that chauffeurs intend to drive as fast as they please through the street , in defiance of the law , , when they do not fear arrest , or if , after arrest , they can easily escape through the connivance of the police . This much has been suspected , at least . Its confirmation leads to the further suspicion that some rascally chauffeurs who have killed pedestrians , and then escaped , have had police protection . The law against fast and careless driving in the city streets should be rigidly enforced , and the legal penalty for breaking it. , should always be in- , Meted . ? A Combinailon. against the safety of the public by the pollee and the chauffeurs is indicated in the statement of Deputy Commissioner ** that last Saturday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to , stop reckless driving , it was privately corn , munica.tcd to the public garages without delay . .
