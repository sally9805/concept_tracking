Heart disease was the cause of death . Mr. Johnson had been ill at home only three weeks . Previous to this time he was under the care of a physician for heart trouble , but the symptoms were not alarming , and did not cause his family any worry . Three weeks ago Mr. Johnson had to give up active work . He was attended by Dr. Philip A. Bennett , the family physician , and as the recovery of the patient was not rapid Dr. J. A. MeCOrkle was called in consultation A few days ago it was decided to call Mayor Tom L. Johnson of Cleveland , Ohio , to the bedside of his brother . Mrs. Albert L. Johnson , her four children , Mayor Johnson , and Mr. Johnson 's mother were present last evening . The death of Mr. Johnson will come as a surprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physique , who always led an outdoor life in his railroad work . He was six feet one inch in height . Prior to the be , ginning of his last attack , Mr. Johnson never suffered any severe illness . Mayor Johnson and Albert L. Johnson who were born at Helena , Arkansas , went to Cleveland when young men and started with a few mules in the street railroad business . They had what were considered to be valueless old franchises . Tom Johnson led in the development of the street railway ventures and Albert Johnson was active in the operating department . His brother looked after the finances . When the Johnsons disposed of their Cleveland street car interests and took to other fields success seemed to come a little slow to Albert Johnson . A system from East Liverpool to Wellsville , Ohio , was built by him , Sidney Short , C. E. Grover , and Henry Davies . Eight miles of track were laid , but the venture was not a successful one . Mr. Johnson 's attention was next devoted to the street railroad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began the development of lines of urban and interurban trolleys , which now connect over sixty villages and towns . One of the most successful ventures of Albert Johnson was with his brother , Tom Johnson , in the Nassau Railroad Company of Brooklyn . Senator Michael J. Coffey , then an Alderman of Brooklyn , engineered the scheme to get the franchises through for the Nassau Company to start an opposition to the Brooklyn City Company . The first surprise came when Tom and Albert Johnson started trolley roads to Coney Island and placarded ' them with signs , " East River to the Ocean . " A single fare of 5 cents was charged , and the Nassau system became a dangerous competitor to the Brooklyn City Company . When the plans of Roswell P. Flower were formulated for the consolidation of all the transit lines of Brooklyn into one : system the Johnsons held out for a very large price for their road . The boldest of Mr. Johnson 's schemes in street railroad business became known a short time ago when Mr. Johnson told a friend that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obtained from the Brooklyn Board of Aldermen he went to IL T. Wilson , the banker . Mr. Wilson was the controlling factor in the Detroit street railways until he was bought out by the Cleveland-Everett-Moore syndicate . Mr. Johnson explained to the banker the merits of the Brooklyn system , and soon . the work of laying thirty miles of tracks was begun and a mortgage of $10,000,000 placed on the property . Tom and Albert L. Johnson made it a point never to sell a share of stock of the Nassau Railroad Company . Patrick H. Flynn , one of the promoters of the company , and Michael J. Coffey had large holdings of the stock : but the Johnsons never sold a share of their stock until it was turned over in bulk to the promoters of the Brooklyn Rapid . Transit system . The price paid to the Johnsons for their personal holdings is said to have been over $4.000,000 . Mr. Johnson went to London and took an active part in the building of an underground road in that city . The last project to which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connect Philadelphia and New York by a trolley system . Mr. Johnson offered to build a tunnel under the East River to Brooklyn to Flatbush Avenue , thence to South Brooklyn and under the Narrows to Staten Island , thence to New Jersey , and direct across that State to Pennsylvania . He offered to make the fare 3 cents for passengers in any part of Greater New York , and if the tunnel cost more than the $8,000,000 which it was decided could be spent on the Brooklyn extension of the Rapid Transit tunnel .. Mr. Johnson offered to raise the capital himself . After a controversy with the Rapid Transit Commissioners , durirg which Mr. Johnson charged that a present of many mill , ions of dollars had been made to Con. , tractor John B. when the rapid transit tunnel contract was signed , it was decided not to accept Mr Johnson 's offer . The statement was . also made that if Mr. Johnson wanted to bid on the tunnel as planned under the East River to Flatbush and Atlantic Avenues , Brooklyn , his bid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been busy buying and consolidating trolley lines between New York and Philadelphia to make a trunk trolley system , and he promised a forty-cent fare from the e3aremes of the line . Mr. Johnson also had his engineers at work preparing estimates of the cost of building the Brooklyn tunnel . It is known that Mr. Johnson worried considerably over the situations existing in New York City and Philadelphia , and even iafter his illness kept planning active campaigns for three-cent car fares , a mammoth petition containing hundreds of thousands of names of people interested having been planned through his advice . Since his illness this petition was sent to the Municipal Assembly . The home of Mr. Johnson was one of the handsomest on the Shore Road in Brooklyn . The house overlooks New York Bay and the Narrows , and is of unique architecture . It combines many characteristics of Spanish and Roman types . It is two stories in height , and the interior of thft building is in the shape of the open court common in Roman architecture . Mr. Johnson 's wife was a Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
