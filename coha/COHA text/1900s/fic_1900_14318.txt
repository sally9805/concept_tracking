The Terrills ' dining-room , low-ceiled , and panelled in dark woods , is lighted by many candles , held in brass candlesticks of every conceivable age and country . They adorn the table , the buffet , the sideboard , the mantel , and are placed at intervals on a shelf which runs around the room , where they stand between pieces of antique and more or less perfectly preserved china , and strange Oriental , Russian , and Hungarian brasses . The brass and irons in the fireplace date back four generations , as does the warming-pan hanging near them . The polished floors are covered with rare Eastern rugs , and everything about the room betoken the enthusiastic collector . The dining-table , on the left , is daintily equipped , and on a small writing-table , on the right , stand a desk telephone , lighted candles , and a brass jar of twisted paper spills . A wide doorway at the back , on the right , discloses the divans , lounging chairs , pipe-racks , and other comfortable paraphernalia of the smoking-room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left , leads to the hall , and a third door , on the left , to the butler 's pantry . At the table , GLADYS TERRILL , a slender , graceful , impulsive young woman , charmingly dressed , sits opposite her big , good-natured , tender-hearted husband , whose glance is steady and whose chin is firm . They are just finishing dinner , JOE sits at the left and GLADYS at the right of the table . JOE ( taking the last sip of his cofee ) . Ah ! That new cook is a jewel , Gladys ! That 's better coffee than I 've had before in a month . p. 3 GLADYS ( smiling ) . Even at the club ? JOE Even at the club . It 's a fitting finish to a perfect dinner . ( Watching her with a significant smile which she does not see . ) If I were a suspicious man , or you were an artful woman  --  and were I the one , you would undoubtedly become the other  --  I should suspect that you had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and avoids meeting his glance ) , and had planned this dinner for the special purpose of disarming me . I thought I was cross when I came home , and I know I was tired and anxious ; but now  --  I need only a pipe and some music to make my contentment complete . ( He rises and walks toward the smoking-room . ) GLADYS ( hastily ) . Oh , Joe , I forgot to tell you ! I got such a gem of a chair to-day ! JOE ( in the smoking-room , absently , as he looks from side to side ) . Yes ? GLADYS ( turns in her chair and talks to him over the back of it ) . A genuine antique  --  mahogany , of course . It belonged to Martha Washington 's mother , and is in perfect condition . JOE That 's good . Gladys , do you know where my pipe is ? p. 4 GLADYS ( rising , laughing nervously ) . What pipe ? You have so many ! I do n't smoke your pipes , Joe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair ! ( JOE abandons the search for the pipe and rejoins her . ) It 's such a dear ! It 's quite low , with a high back , curved so ( illustrating )  --  a most unusual shape , the man said . It 's great luck to get a piece so well authenticated . JOE Did he give you a pedigree with it ? ( Turns toward smoking-room again . ) GLADYS Well , he assured me that it had belonged to the Custis family . JOE ( pausing ) . The Custis family ! I thought you said it belonged to Martha Washington 's mother . GLADYS Well , her name was Custis before it was Washington , was n't it ? JOE ( with enjoyment ) . To be sure , it was ! Mrs. Custis . GLADYS Oh ! Why  --  that 's so ! Oh , well , he probably meant her mother-in-law . Some people disregard those small distinctions , you know . JOE True . Accuracy seems incompatible with a taste for curios . GLADYS And from the Custis family it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose ? Or was it the beautiful Annabel ? GLADYS Joe ! Do n't be absurd ! And he bought it from a cousin of the Lees , a Mrs. Stanton , who has fallen upon evil days and has had to part with all of the family plate . Is n't it sad ! JOE ( poking about among the brasses on the mantel ) . Very , I wonder where that pipe can be ? I thought I put it in the rack last night . GLADYS ( turns away from him ) . You did . That is  --  er  --  I think you did . JOE ( watching her , and smiling mischievously ) . Well , why is n't it there , then ? GLADYS Oh , well , never mind ! Take another one . I want to show you the chair . JOE ( hunting about ) . But I want that one . Nothing but that meerschaum is fit to smoke after such a dinner ! GLADYS ( falteringly ) . Are you so very fond of it ? JOE Fond of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . GLADYS ( archly ) . Your best friend ? p. 6 JOE ( in the doorway on his way to the smoking-room ) . When you flouted me and would none of me , my dear , it was my only solace ! When I was trying to screw my courage to the proposing point , it was my sole confidante . And when , finally , you promise to marry me , it alone knew the ineffable joy that filled my soul ! My pipe ! My pipe ! My kingdom for my pipe ! ( He disappears in the smoking-room . ) GLADYS Oh , dear ! Joe , dear , come here a moment . JOE ( outside ) , Just a moment . I want to find  --  GLADYS ( faintly ) . No , dear ; come now , please . ( Sits ? weakly , down R. ) JOE ( hurrying to her ) . What 's the matter , dearie ? Are you ill ? Do you feel faint ? GLADYS ( holding him off ) . Oh , no , no  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please , while I tell you what  --  what I paid  --  for that chair . JOE ( easily ) . Oh , that 's all right , dearie ! I never question your expenditures , you know . ( Watches her with significant smile whenever she is not looking at him. ) p. 7 GLADYS ( faltering , unable to meet his glance ) . Yes . but I  --  I  --  must tell you about  --  this one . ( JOE wheels up a chair for her , and when she sits he pauses behind her looking sympathetically at her . He takes the meerschaum pipe from his pocket , looks at it , seems about to speak to her , pauses , wags his head with determination and drops the pipe back in his pocket . ) GLADYS Come , Joe ! JOE ( placing a chair for himself near her ) . Very well ; but why this sudden enthusiasm over foundered furniture , anyway ? I thought that nothing but ancient and honourable brass , with " the loving marks of the hammer " upon it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . GLADYS Oh , of course , brass is all very well , but I have a great deal of it ; and it 's getting to be rather a vulgar and commonplace pursuit  --  collecting brass . Everybody 's doing it now . JOE Has your dear , disagreeable friend Mrs. Corliss succeeded in getting any yet ? GLADYS Oh , she has a few small pieces , and one very good samovar and tray . Poor Mrs. Corliss ! She called upon me last week , and when she saw my new candlesticks  --  the ones from Manila , you know  --  she positively grew pale ! I knew how envious she was when she began talking of the mahogany table that descended to her from her great grandmother , who belonged to an obscure branch of the Lee family . Then she said , in that lofty , patronizing way of hers : " Nothing gives such an air of quiet distinction to a room , Mrs. Terrill , as a few fine old pieces of mahogany . " p. 8 JOE ( laughing ) . Poor Gladys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( vindictively ) . Well , I have now ! And it antedates her grandmother , too , and comes from the main branch of the same family , with the Custis connection back of that ! JOE ( whistling ) . Whee-ew ! " Charge , Chester , charge ! On , Stanley , on ! " All right , dearie , I 'm glad to see you win . ( Rises . ) GLADYS ( breathlessly ) . Oh , Joe ! Wait ! That is  --  I  --  I have n't told you yet about that chair  --  about what I gave for it , you know . JOE Oh , never mind , sweetheart . Nothing  --  within reason , of course  --  is too much to pay for a victory over Mrs. Corliss . I confess I do n't like that woman ; and I wo n't have her patronizing you , confound her ! ( Replaces the chair he has used in its original position . ) GLADYS ( taking courage ) . Then maybe you 'll forgive me ! You see , the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bought a good deal of brass , and he came here yesterday to tell me that he had some andirons and things . They were n't genuine antiques , and , of course , I did n't want them . Some one was in the reception-room at the time , and I received him in here , and  --  and  --  he saw  --  he saw that old meerschaum of yours in the pipe-rack  --  p. 9 JOE ( turning suddenly toward her ) . Gladys ! You did n't  --  GLADYS Wait , Joe ! Please ! He admired it very much  --  JOE ( savagely ) . Of course he did ! ( As she looks away , he grins and wags his head . ) GLADYS And said that he had an order for just such a pipe from  --  from  --  oh , I 've forgotten the name  --  some pipe collector  --  and asked me if I 'd sell the pipe . JOE And you ? GLADYS I said no , of course ! JOE Of course you did ! GLADYS Then he asked me if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Corliss and her stupid old table , so I said I was , and he told me about this chair and offered to bring it here to-day . So this morning he brought it and  --  JOE ( indignantly ) . And stole my pipe ! The villain ! I 'll have him  --  GLADYS Oh , Joe , please wait ! JOE ( impatiently ) . Well , go on ! What happened ? Who is he ? Where 's his shop ? ( She looks away from him again and he pats the pocket where the pipe is and smiles. ) p. 10 GLADYS He said he had another customer for the chair , who had offered him fifty dollars for it yesterday afternoon , but that he had promised me the first chance , I  --  I said that fifty dollars seemed a great deal for a small , plain chair , and then he said that  --  he said  --  he  --  oh , JOE ! ( She hides her face . ) JOE ( grimly ) . Go on . ( From this point JOE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He said that if I 'd let him have the pipe I might have the chair for  --  thirty dollars . JOE Gladys , did you  --  GLADYS I told him I 'd speak to you about it ; but he said the other customer was waiting for the chair  --  JOE ( sarcastically ) . Of course the other customer was waiting ! They always are ! And the telephone , I suppose , was out of order ? GLADYS I did try to ' phone to you , Joe , but the boy said that you were out and would not be back until after five o'clock . JOE Well ! GLADYS So I told the man that I could n't buy the chair , and he was taking it away when I happened to wonder who the other customer was . I asked him , and he could n't remember the name , but said it was a lady living in Washington Avenue . Then I knew that it must be Mrs. Corliss , and he was very sure that that was the name  --  p. 11 JOE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joe , he got clear to the gate with that chair , and when I thought of Mrs. Corliss 's getting it I just could n't let it go . I called him back and offered him forty dollars for it  --  JOE Why did n't you give him fifty ? GLADYS I had n't it . I 've exceeded my allowance already . And when he refused forty I  --  I  --  I gave him the pipe ! ( JOE turns away , with a muttered exclamation . ) It was only an old stained thing , anyway , Joe ; and I went right down town and bought you a nice new one ! See ! ( She goes to a cabinet and produces a new meerschaum , of a shape to arouse all a pipe-lover 's wrath . ) Is n't that a nice clean one ? ( JOE groans . ) And just think what fun you 'll have colouring it ! The other one was finished , was n't it ? JOE ( despairingly ) . Gladys , that pipe was  --  oh , hang it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? GLADYS In the library . Why ? ( JOE touches a bell on the table . ) ENTER from the butler 's pantry MOLLY , the maid . ) JOE Molly , bring in the old chair that Mrs. Terrill bought this afternoon . ( Exit MOLLY , ) ( JOE paces moodily to and fro , while GLADYS fusses nervously about the table , occasionally glancing at him . ) Enter MOLLY , pushing the chair before her . It is of plain , rather awkward shape . Its dark , scratched surface is rough with the accumulated dust of attic and second-hand shop , and its seat , once brave in glossy black haircloth , dull tatters of which still remain , is lumpy and without resilience . The weary springs have thrust themselves out at the bottom , and hang in dejected spirals , scraps of the ragged lining still clinging to them . Through a heavy silence , MOLLY pushes this forlorn remnant to the centre of the room , and then , tittering irrepressibly , she hurries out . p. 12 GLADYS ( her courage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joe ! Do n't you see what a prize that is ? See that curve ! So much feeling ! And the  --  JOE ( explosively ) . Gladys Terrill ! You gave my pipe  --  and thirty dollars  --  for that ? GLADYS Why , Joe , that 's  --  JOE It 's a bloomiug old fraud , that 's what it is ! And my pipe , my meerschaum pipe , went for  --  ( He shakes his head in mournful despair . ) GLADYS But Joe ! You have so many pipes I And that one was all coloured . I thought the interest in a meerschaum lay in colouring it . You do n't care to make collections , so I do n't see why  --  JOE For heaven 's sake , Gladys ! Do you change your fad so often that you have no comprehension of sentimental values ? Does it mean nothing to you that a thing has been closely associated with all your moods for years ? On my soul , I believe you 're a lineal descendant of Esau  --  but you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these days I shall find that you 've renounced me for a cracked teacup or an old bent spoon . One piece of silver would be about my price , I imagine , if it were a genuine antique ! p. 13 GLADYS ( with dignity ) . Joe , I may have been at fault , but I 've done nothing to call down upon my head any such bitter , cruel tirade as this ! JOE Oh , have n't you ? When you painted snow-scenes on wooden shovels and mounted them on plush plaques ; when you daubed tropical landscapes on sections of stove-pipe and stood them in terra-cotta saucers for umbrella-stands ; when you filled the house with millinery stuff and tied gilded artichokes to the backs of the easy-chairs with pink ribbons , " in the interests of sacred home-bred Art , " did I make any remonstrance ? When you pitched all that out and took to Japanese screens and bamboo furniture ; tacked fans on the walls and put inflammable paper umbrellas over all the chandeliers ; when you painted writhing , sprawling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my bedroom , I said nothing . When you banished all the carpets and put down noisy , cold , comfortless , slippery hardwood floors , I risked my life daily without a murmur , and paid cheerfully for the Persian rugs ! GLADYS But , Joe , sanitary considerations  --  JOE Yes , I know . Antique rugs , woven amid unspeakable filth and used for years in vile Oriental squalor  --  full of heaven knows how many kinds of microbes  --  are absolutely necessary to the latest improved modern sanitation ! When you filled the house with cracked china , and raved over the " sincerity " of a pitcher that had lost its handle and would n't hold water , I made no comment . And when you began buying brass , I saw the gas and the lamps and the electricity give place to sputtering candles in order that you might show your brass candlesticks , and I held my peace ! Every nook and corner of this house is full of old junk that you paid Lord knows what for , and that you 'll donate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Scavengers ' Homes ! But the end has come ! I 'll be hanged if I 'm going to submit to having all the comfortable chairs in the house banished to make room for stiff , spavined , knock-kneed old trumpery like that ! p. 14 GLADYS ( with dignity ) . Joe , even if you have no appreciation of Art , you must admit that that chair has historic value . JOE Historic nonsense ! That chair 's a bally old cheat on the face of it , and anybody can see with half an eye that it 's no more of an antique than I am . It was probably in the heyday of its youth and beauty about the time your mother was married . ( He takes out his penknife and scratches the wood , while she flutters protestingly to the rescue . ) I thought so ! You 'll acknowledge , I think , that while I 'm no judge of the values of sheet-iron umbrella-stands , or broken-crockery , or battered brass , I do know something about woods , and I assure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , every-day walnut ! GLADYS Joe ? Joe , you do n't mean that ! Walnut ! JOE Walnut ! And for that , you bartered my meerschaum pipe : the pipe that I got in Heidelberg ; that was the pride of my student days , and my friend and best companion in the disheartening years after my father 's death ! The pipe that I have coloured carefully and lovingly , and that has contributed to my pleasure and comfort every day for fifteen years ! The colour in that pipe comprised the softest , smoothest , most exquisite tones imaginable , and was a constant source of delight to me . You tell me that I have no soul for beauty , no appreciation of Art , and then you sell that pipe for  --  that ! p. 15 GLADYS ( icily , her back toward him ) . Have you been quite brutal enough now ? Are there are any more unkind things that you wish to say ? Have you hurt and humiliated me sufficiently ? ( Turning suddenly upon him . ) I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ugly , smelly , old pipe , and I 'm sure it would never occur to any sane person that the thing could be desirable ! JOE Ho , would n't it ! It 's not six months , since Delvan offered me seventy-five dollars for it . It 's one of the finest pieces of meerschaum in this country . GLADYS Delvan ? Delvan ! Who is Delvan ? JOE Fellow at the club who prides himself on his collection of pipes . He has n't a meerschaum among them all to equal mine . He 's been begging for it for months . GLADYS ( tragically ) . Joe , he 's the man ! JOE ( his anger spent , concealing a smile ) . What man ? GLADYS The man who wants your pipe . JOE ( coolly ) . Why , of course he wants my pipe . I just said so . GLADYS I mean the man who said he wanted a pipe like that . p. 16 JOE Certainly ; he wanted that one . GLADYS Ca n't you see ? You are so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had given him an order for a pipe , and he 's the man . JOE ( solicitously ) . Gladys , are you losing your mind ? What man ? GLADYS Joe Terrill , you are the slowest ! The man who sold the chair ! JOE ( slowly ) . Delvan is the man who sold  --  GLADYS No , no , no ! The man who sold the chair said he had an order from a pipe collector  --  JOE Oh ! GLADYS And Delvan 's the man ! JOE ( very deliberately ) . Damn ! GLADYS Joe ! JOE Delvan 's been making offers for that pipe for at least two years , and only last week I told him he 'd never get it . GLADYS ( timidly ) . Would n't he give it back to you , Joe ? JOE Give it back to me ! GLADYS Yes , if you told him the circumstances ;  --  that I  --  p. 17 JOE ( distinctly ) . That my wife traded off a valuable pipe , my personal property , for an old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes , I dare say that if I told him that , he 'd return the pipe  --  with his condolences ! GLADYS Oh , Joe ! Of course , you could n't tell him that ; but  --  but I can , and I will . ( She runs to the writing-table and takes up the telephone directory . ) I 'll telephone to him this very minute that I  --  JOE ( sternly ) . You 'll do nothing of the kind ! ( He takes the book from her , closing it . ) This is not a matter to be adjusted over the telephone , and I forbid you , Gladys , to say anything whatever about this matter to Mr. Delvan , either now or at any future time . GLADYS ( rising , aghast ) . You forbid me ! JOE I forbid you ! Exit JOE to hall . ( GLADYS stares after him in amazement , gasps , blinks , and then , as the full realisation of the result of her bargaining overwhelms her , she wrings her hands and drops into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her arms . ) ( Enter JOE , unnoticed by GLADYS , carrying his hat , and a heavy stick , and wearing his overcoat . He pauses in doorway , looks at her , takes pipe from pocket of his coat , looks at it , at her , takes an impulsive step toward her , as if about to show her the pipe , pauses again , looks at the pipe , and drops it into his overcoat pocket , shaking his head . p. 18 JOE ( still near doorway ) . What 's this curio dealer 's name , Gladys ? And where 's his shop ? GLADYS ( dully ) . His name 's Gortowski , and his shop 's in Curtis Place . Why ? JOE I 'm going there to see if he 's sold the pipe . GLADYS ( rising in alarm ) . Now ? JOE Now . GLADYS But his shop will be closed . JOE I 'll find him . Those people always live in or behind or under or over their shops . I 'll find him . GLADYS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's gone . GLADYS And if not ? JOE If not , I shall buy it of him . GLADYS But  --  but , Joe , he 'll ask an awful lot of money for that pipe . JOE ( grimly ) . Very probably . It 's worth a lot . Good-bye . GLADYS But  --  Joe , I 'm afraid for you to go down into that neighbourhood at night . It 's dangerous ! JOE Nonsense ! p. 19 GLADYS Take me with you , then ! JOE No , I prefer to go alone . GLADYS Why ? JOE Well  --  I think  --  that is  --  I can do more with him if you  --  at least , if I 'm alone . GLADYS ( her alarm rapidly increasing ) . Joe , do you think you 'll have trouble with him ? Is that it ? Goes to him and lays her hands pleadingly on his arm . Oh , Joe dear , do n't go ! I 'll get your pipe back somehow , if I have to go down on my hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hysterically ) do n't go down there and fight with that man ! JOE ( patting her hand reassuringly ) . No , no ! What a nervous little woman it is ! I 've no intention of fighting with him , but I may have to  --  well , to scare him , and I can do that better if you 're not with me . GLADYS Scare him ? How ? JOE ( reassuringly ) . Oh , threaten him with some legal process , or something . Do n't fret about it , Gladys . I 'll get the pipe if it 's there , but nobody will be hurt . GLADYS Oh , I 'm so frightened ! Have you your revolver ? p. 20 JOE No , this stick will do . GLADYS Oh , please take your revolver , dear ! It would n't be safe to go down there without it ! JOE That is n't a bad neighbourhood . GLADYS It may be  --  at night . Please , dear ! JOE I do n't believe it 's loaded . GLADYS No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the  --  **26;1857;TOOLONG , and I put them , for safety , in a jeweller 's box at the back of my top drawer . JOE There must be a box of cartridges somewhere . GLADYS Yes , they 're there , too  --  in my top drawer . Please get them , dear . JOE All right  --  though there 's no earthly need of it . ( He pauses at the hall door . ) Your top drawer , you say ? GLADYS Yes ; ' way at the back , under some laces  --  or maybe it 's handkerchiefs . You 'll find them , anyway . Take off your overcoat . It 's so warm in the house . ( Exit JOE , leaving his hat , coat ; and stick on a chair near the dining-table . ) ( GLADYS wanders about in deep distress , until a sudden thought halts her abruptly . Her kindling glance turns toward the writing-table , then toward the hall . She listens keenly for an instant , eagerly runs to the telephone , seizes the receiver and speaks rapidly. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , Main three seven one ! Hello ! Is that the Union Club ? Is Mr. Fred Terrill there ? If you find him , ask him to come to the ' phone at once , please . Hurry ! ( Pause , during which she taps her foot , glances apprehensively toward the hall , and frowns . ) Hello ! Oh , hello , Fred ! Yes , Gladys . Oh , Fred , I 'm in the most awful scrape ! How much money have you ? What ? How much do I want ? Oh , seventy-five or a hundred dollars , I suppose . Perhaps more . What ? You can get it ? Thank Heaven ! Then go to Gortowski 's curio shop in Curtis Place  --  it 's not far from the club  --  and get Joe 's pipe . Give him any sum he asks and I 'll repay you when I get my next allowance . Run , Fred ! Joe 's pipe . The meerschaum , you know . Oh , never mind ! I 'll tell you all about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I traded it for a horrid old chair and I must get it back . Yes , the one he got in Heidelberg . Oh , yes , I know ! Never mind about that . Joe 's said it all ! Joe says he 's going down for the pipe to-night , and I 'm afraid he 'll kill the man ! He 's getting his revolver now . You must get there first . Will you go ? JOE ( outside ) . Gladys ! p. 22 GLADYS ( in ' phone ) . Wait a minute ! ( She runs to the door . ) Yes , Joe ? JOE I ca n't find those cartridges . It was your revolver you put in your top drawer . GLADYS Oh , so it was ! Let me think ! Oh ( slowly ) , I must have put the  --  er  --  bullet things in my bonnet-box . The round one on the top shelf  --  left-hand side  --  back . ( She listens a moment , mischievously smiling , nods triumphantly , and runs back to ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to thrust Joe 's stick under the edge of a rug . She speaks in ' phone . ) Hello , Fred ! Oh , hello ! Will you go ? Oh , you 're a darling ! And oh , Fred , if you get the pipe , ' phone me at once , wo n't you ? I 'm nearly crazy ! I 'll keep him here as long as I can . He 's hunting for his cartridges now , and I 've told him the wrong place , so he wo n't find them right away . And I 've hidden his stick . Run , Fred ! And  --  hello ! Hello ! Fred ! Do n't forget to ' phone me Yes . Yes . That 's right . Good-bye . ( She sighs as she hangs up the receiver . ) JOE comes in from the hall , snapping an unloaded revolver . Every time the trigger falls , she starts apprehensively. p. 23 JOE I ca n't find those cartridges , Gladys , but here 's the gun . I could run a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  which it wo n't be . ( Takes up his hat and coat and looks about for his stick . ) Where 's my stick ? GLADYS Your stick ? Why  --  you brought it in here with you , did n't you ? JOE I thought I did . Confound the thing ! Where has it gone to ? GLADYS Maybe you left it in the hall . JOE No , do n't you remember ? When you spoke of the revolver I said  --  GLADYS You said the stick would do , but did you have it in your hand ? ( After a moment spent in further search , JOE goes into the hall . GLADYS covers the stick more completely with the rug , making sure it is perfectly concealed , and is once more apparently looking for the missing cane when JOE re-enters , with a lighter one . ) JOE Never mind , Gladys , this one will do . Goodbye . GLADYS ( firmly ) . No , Joe ; if you wo n't carry a loaded revolver , you must take a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you had the big one in your hand when you started upstairs for the revolver . Maybe you left it up there . p. 24 JOE Possibly I did . ( He goes toward the hall and pauses in the doorway . ) By the way , who telephoned just now ? GLADYS ( innocently ) . Telephoned ? JOE Yes ; were n't you at the ' phone ? GLADYS Oh  --  why  --  oh , it was Fred , you know . Said he might be up by-and-by . Why do n't you wait until he comes ? Then he can go down with you and help intimidate the man . JOE I thought he was going to take May Sloane and her mother to the opera to-night . Said he was . GLADYS Oh , did he ? Maybe he 's coming up after  --  that is , before  --  at least  --  perhaps she 's sick and ca n't go ! JOE Guess not . I came up in the car with her tonight , and she seemed unusually lively . GLADYS Oh , well , perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about something . Maybe he said he could n't come up to-night . JOE That 's funny , too . You were n't expecting him , were you ? GLADYS No  --  yes  --  oh , I do n't know . Maybe I was . I ca n't pretend to remember all the engagements your brother makes and breaks with me ! p. 25 JOE ( mournfully ) . Fred will feel mighty bad about this pipe business ! That meerschaum was the only one of my bachelor possessions that he envied me . ( Sighs . ) Well  --  I must find that stick . ( As he turns to go , the telephone bell rings . He moves to answer it and GLADYS dexterously slides into the chair and takes the receiver . ) Who 's that ? GLADYS How should I know ? Run along and get your stick . He 'll have time to sell that pipe four times before you get there at this rate ! ( JOE goes out , leaving hat and coat , as before , on the chair . GLADYS speaks eagerly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hello , Fred ! Did you get it ? What ? Sold ? Not there ! Oh , impossible ! He 's deceiving you ! I gave it to him myself , and if he has n't sold it , it must be  --  What ? Joe ! Oh , no ! There 's some mistake ! What ! Joe ? Wait a minute . ( Glancing toward the hall , she goes to JOE 'S coat , and after feeling hurriedly in several pockets , she suddenly pauses . Her shoulders stiffen and her lips form a rigid line as she slowly draws forth a very handsome meerschaum pipe . She places it very carefully on the dining-table and returns , with great dignity and deliberation , to the telephone . When she speaks , her tone is icy and her enunciation sharply precise . ) Very well , Fred . Yes , it is here . I do not know . Your brother has not explained . Yes . Thank you . Good-bye . ( She hangs up the receiver and crosses slowly to the left side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hall door . ) Presently enter JOE . p. 26 JOE ( irritably ) . I ca n't find that stick anywhere , Gladys . I 'm going without it . ( Takes up his hat and coat and goes to the door . ) Good-bye . ( He pauses in the doorway . ) Good-bye , Gladys . ( Save for a barely perceptible twitching of the erect shoulders , there is no reply . He steps toward her , and as he does so he catches sight of the pipe lying on the table . He pauses , half smiling , in whimsical appreciation of the situation , drops his coat and hat , thrusts his hands into his trousers ' pockets , looks at GLADYS , at the pipe , and at GLADYS again . Whistles , softly , three ascending notes , and then attempts a debonair manner.Oh  --  ah , ha , ha , ha ! I see you  --  er  --  you found the pipe ! ( GLADYS surveys him scornfully , and an uneasy note creeps into his laugh ) . Little joke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ha , ha ! Did n't work , though ! ( Rather ruefully . ) Might have known it would n't ! You 're so deuced clever , you know ! Ha , ha  --  ha  --  ha . ( Mirthlessly his laugh dies out and he regards her motionless figure nervously . ) Oh  --  er  --  Gladys ! I say  --  Gladys ! GLADYS ( in a level tone ) . Well ? JOE ( fingering the pipe for inspiration . ) Are n't you glad I got it ? p. 27 GLADYS Very . JOE Why do n't you exhibit symptoms of joy , then ? GLADYS There are moments when one 's emotions may be rather varied . Since you seem so well satisfied with yourself and the situation ( rising ) I will remove my unsympathetic presence and leave you to the full and complete enjoyment of your pipe and  --  your amusing reflections ! ( As she sweeps toward the door up R. he intercepts her at C. and attempts to touch her arm . She recoils and stands very erect . ) JOE Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be hard on a fellow ! Maybe I did carry it a trifle too far  --  GLADYS A trifle too far ? JOE Well , you went rather far yourself , did n't you ? GLADYS Possibly I did  --  but , at any rate , I was truthful ! I did n't stoop to petty , contemptible deception ! JOE ( after raising his eyebrows whimsically . ) Deception is rather a strong word to apply to a harmless little joke . GLADYS And you regard it only as a " harmless little joke " to deceive your wife , to let her make a long , painful and entirely unnecessary confes  --  explanation , to hurt and humiliate her with your reproaches , to swear at her  --  p. 28 JOE Gladys ! GLADYS You said damm ! To frighten her nearly to death with your threats  --  JOE My dear girl , I made no threats ! GLADYS Nor did you go pawing through my laces for your revolver , I suppose ! JOE At your request , however . GLADYS ( hysterically indignant ) . Probably I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that awful old Gortowski , but  --  JOE Gladys , there was no question of killing nor of fighting , except what existed in your imagination . The plain facts in the case are these . I stepped into the club to-night and met Delvan . He said : " Come on with me , Terrill . I 've just heard of a pipe that by all accounts beats yours , and I 'm going to see it . Old Gortowski got it for me . " So we walked over to Gortowski 's shop , and there we found  --  my pipe ! GLADYS Well . JOE Well , of course , we both recognised it at once , and I questioned the fellow sharply . Little by little he told us the principal facts , as you have told them to me since . Delvan knows a thing or two himself about antiques and curios , and he had seen the chair and knew it was n't genuine . So , together , we bullied and threatened the old rascal  --  p. 29 GLADYS Threatened him with what ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obtaining money under false pretences , and  --  other things . GLADYS What other things ? Joe , you have deceived me long enough ! Tell me the truth . JOE Well , you see , dear , the pipe was  --  was really  --  well  --  mine , you know , and  --  he had  --  er  --  had  --  well  --  received it  --  from  --  from you , you know , and  --  GLADYS ( incredulously ) . In other words , you accused him of receiving  --  stolen  --  goods ! JOE ( with forced nonchalance ) . Well , something like that , I believe . Delvan 's a lawyer , too , you know , and between us we piled it on rather strong . GLADYS And so , for the sake of a piece of old meerschaum , you 've not only lied to your wife but you have branded her before your friend and a vulgar curio dealer as  --  as a thief ! Do n't touch me ! Do n't dare to touch me ! JOE ( contritely ) . Gladys , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GLADYS Nothing . It is best that you should say nothing . Any explanations that you could make would only serve to intensify the situation . ( She moves majestically toward the door. ) p. 30 JOE ( desperately ) . But , Gladys , you do me great injustice ! Delvan will tell you  --  GLADYS I do not know Mr. Delvan , nor do I care to know him , and it can hardly be supposed that he desires to meet  --  a thief , condemned by her own husband ! JOE But I did n't condemn you , dearie ! Delvan said  --  Enter MOLLY , from hall carrying a box of flowers and a note , which she takes to GLADYS , down L. C. MOLLY The messenger is waiting for an answer . GLADYS ( reading the note ) . " My dear Mrs. Terrill : Will you accept the compliments and congratulations of a crusty old  --  " You may go , Molly . ( MOLLY goes out . When the door has closed behind her , GLADYS resumes : )  --  " of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend ? My compliments are due to any woman who is sufficiently charming to keep her husband romantically in love with her after many years of married life , and my congratulations are offered because that fine fellow , Terrill , quarrelled with me this afternoon ( JOE smiles broadly ) when , in order to obtain possession of that marvellous pipe , I slandered you . I trust , however , that his wrath may have cooled somewhat ere this ( JOE , still smiling , fills the pipe from a pocket-pouch and strolls over to the writing-table , where he selects , with great care , a spill from those in the jar ) , and I beg , not only that you will accept my apologies for this afternoon 's calumny , but that you will grant me permission to call upon you this evening , that he and I may smoke together a pipe of peace . ( JOE lights the spill in the candle-flame . ) Hopefully yours , CHAUNCEY COLE DELVAN . " ( The note flutters to the floor . ) Oh , Joe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he holds out eager arms to her , she runs to him and hides her face on his shoulder. )
