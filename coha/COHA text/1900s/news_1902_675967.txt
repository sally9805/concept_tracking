txt This city , so recently swept by fire , is now overwhelmed . by flood . Three weeks ago the greater part of its business section was burned out and to-day the quarter occupied by the houses of the poorer class is inundated . Hundreds of families have been made homeless by the overflow of the Passaic River and the country for miles around the city is under water . So far but one death has been reported . The great peril until late this evening was that the Spruce Street raceway might overflow , in which ( .. event a fearful loss of property in the manufacturing districts would have followed . The raceway supplies water power for most of the mills along the water front . Right at this point the city authorities placed expert engineers , who were Instructed to touch off a blast of dynamite to open a new channel for the immense volume of water held there , and by diverting it to the bed of the river in a new direction the authorities hoped to save a great deal of valuable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spruce Street bridge the experts placed mines of dynamite , which if it was found necessary would have been exploded . At 5 o'clock this afternoon the water In the raceway was within three inches of the danger point , but four hours later it was reported that it had fallen from four to five inches below this point . The raceway was built some fifty years ago by the Society for the Establishment of Useful Manufactures , the most prominent member of which was ' ex-Gov . Colt , and the late Vice President Garret A. Hobart was a large stockholder . The fire of three weeks ago , while causing a damage to . property to the extent of nearly $8,000,000 , did not create such suffering and widespread desolation as the flood- of to-day . The district for a mile along the river front , from Spruce Street hill to Straight Street , and two blocks north and five blocks south of the river , nearly half a mile in width , is covered with water which in many instances reached to the second story of the dwellings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and several silk mills and dye works . In the immediate vicinity of these hives of industry fully 000 families have been driven from their tenements . Of these unfortunates several hundred were taken from their houses in boats and barges , amid scenes of much excitement . In the absence of Mayor John Hineheliffe , who ' is-now in Cuba recuperating from the strain of the recent fire , Thomas J. l3rogantPresident of the Board of Aldermen , is Acting Mayor , and with the Mayor 's Secretary , William L. Dill , is doing his utmost ? to relieve all those macho need assistance . They tried to reach Gov . Murphy to-day , but failed to locate him . The Acting Mayor then took upon himself to open the Fifth Regiment Armory as a temporary residence for the homeless families , 1.10 of whom are housed there to-night . The citizens of Pa terson were , more than generous in their gifts to the sufferers . Several wagon loads of blankets , clothing , and provisions arrived at the armory from all quarters of the city . the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widow of the late Vice President , who has taken personal charge of the relief work . Mrs. Hobart sent out a call to teamsters for the use of wagons and horses and sent personal appeals to the wealthy residents for cots and bedding . The supply coming in seems to be ampler , and all will have something to sleep on . There is no need for outside aid . The food supply at the armory is sufficient . and Mrs. Hobart and the ladies who worked with her in caring for the fire distress are once more actively at work . They have simply taken up the work again where they left ito ess than two weeks ago . FIRE ADDED TO DANGER . To the danger from water ? was added in the afternoon the danger from fire . Flames started in the second story of a threeakory frame building in Hamilton Avenue . The lower floor of the building was three feet under water . Had it been a little further down toward the river , the firemen would have been powerless . As It was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fireboxes were but a few inches from the surface . Then the hose was dragged through the water by firemen who waded out until the water was up to their hips . They reached the building , and soon the fire was under control . In the work , of rescue , one of the most earnest toilers lost his life , This was Henry Richards , a carpenter , forty years I old . whlived on Franklin Street . After making REIreral successful trips , on each of which he brought three or four persons from the neighborhood of Kearns ' Brothers ' Dye Works , on Shady Street , his boat was upset , and he was swept away in the waters which were rushing with the force Of a mill race . He clung to the branch of a tree for nearly half an hour , but in spite of many attempts to reach him , he finally disappeared in the muddy waters . Chief of Police F. G. Graul and Fire Chief John Stagg were indefatigable in their exertion for the relief of the distressed , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was a lack of boats to cope with the emergency . and Secretary Dill telephoned to Newark for help in this direction. , This request was answered quickly by the Newark people , who sent a wagon load of boats , a dozen in all , which arrived in good time to give excellent service . The bridge of the New York and Greenwood Lake division of the Erie , which spanned the Passaic River at Singac , went down this evening . The bridge was of wood and rested high above the river on trestle work . The rushing of the waters weakened the centre piers , and the whole collapsed . The Hillman Street Bridge here went down late to-night . It was an iron and steel span with stone abutments and centre pier . One of the abutments went and the bridge collapsed . A Jewish child , named Leusky , is said to have been drowned Saturday night in River Stfeet . The case has not been reported to the authorities . It is said the child fell from a - rowboat in which the family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caused by a gushing manhole . Several persons have been found who aver they saw the occurrence . Ate family is not at the Armory so far as can ' be learned there . If such a thing took place the family is doubtless with friends in another part of the city . One of the sightseers to-night said that he was one of those burned out during the great fire , and then sought refuge for himself and family with a relative on Hamilton Street . On Monday last he established himself in new quarters and Saturday night had to take in the relatives who had sheltered him so recently . Some of the homeless now at the Armory were driven out by fire and had established their new  - -  homes in the district now flooded . The flood cuts the city in half , and travel between the two sections is at a. standstill . Many persons caught on either side of the river from their homes have been hours in getting around by going above Passaic Falls , and the trip is neither safe nor pleasant . Gas lamps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The water flooded the gas works last night , and the only supply was what remained in the tanks . This was all consumed last night . The Arch Street bridge collapsed this afternoon . The pillars gave way , and the steel structure dropped into the river . Against the ruins of the bridge timbers outhouses and debris of all kinds gathered . To prevent a jam men from the Street Department were set to work forcing them past the obstruction . Reports from Little Falls , some miles above the city , say that the great pumping plant there and the new filtration outfit which have been in the course of construction for six years , are ruined . One of the officers of the company said to-night that the loss would not be less than a million dollars and might run to double that . The filtration plant was almost completed and was soon to be put in operation . The stoppage of the pumps has caused much anxiety . This city has several days ' supply in reserve in the reservoir , but just how well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the Little Falls plant is not known . The water for Jersey City and Bayonne , among other places , is sent from Little Falls . The East Jersey can , however , prevent any acute distress anywhere by buying water from Newark , which at present can only be limited in amount by the capacity of her two lines from Macopin to Belleville . It is believed that three men lost their lives at the foot of Mulberry Street . They were seen in a boat . Soon afterward the boat was found floating down the stream upside down . WATER BEGINS TO RECEDE . Between 6 and 7 o'clock the water began to recede slowly , and by 8 the fall was ' noticeable . At 10:30 there has been a fall of a foot , and the conditions are very much improved . So far as can be learned the headwater floods are now passing through the city . This means that the greatest volume has passed down the river , and every hour now will bring the river nearer to its natural size . This leads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will soon be over . The loss to the city In wages is becoming greater as every hour allows the realization of what has happened to be understood . Although , there are many large mills untouched hy the flood , they can only run on dyed stuff on hand , as the dye works will be a week , at least , in getting in operation after the flood leaves them clear . Weideman &; Co. ' s dye works , the largest in the United States and one of the largest in the world , are under several feet of water . Kerns Brothers , Robert Gaete , and the Peterson Dyeing and Finishing Works are all flooded . Besides these big works , a score or more of small t dye wor s are not only without water , but the dye have been washed away . Brown Brother ' shirtwaist factory is In the flooded district . The silk mills flooded are the Phoenix . Adams 's , Levy 's , and the New Jersey Silk Company 's . The mills are said to carry flood insurance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
