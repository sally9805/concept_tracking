Christian Point of View " seems to , have been a pendant to his paper. ? a year ago , against international arbitration . In that he took the highest moral and religious ground against agreeing to arbitrate a quarrel which conscience and the voice of God itself might demand that you should pursue to the bitter end . At Providence he appears to have risen to a similar moral grandeur in classing war , not as an evil ( sometimes a necessary evil , as nearly all admit ) , but as remedial of evil  --  in short , a great engine of civilization and of Christianity . We would not do Capt . Mahan the possible injustice of holding him to newspaper accounts of what he said ; but it is clear that the thing he attacked was a sentiment which he evidently considers mistaken and deplorable , namely , the " widespread feeling that war can not be reconciled with Christian principles . " In other words , he was only , like John P. Robinson , confuting a vulgar error : " We kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' thet eppyletts woi n't the best math of a saint , But John P. Robinson be Sez this kind o ' thing 's an exploded idea , " With Christian apologists for war we have long been familiar . But none to our knowledge have ever before gone beyond saying that " there are some things worse than war " ; that we can not be for peace at any price , and other " inarticulate mumblements " of the sort , as Carlyle would call them . War as a blessing , instead of an evil occasionally to be tolerated ; war as a means of overcoming evil and propagating righteous. ness , war as the indispensable ally and servant of civilization and religion  --  for this we have had to wait till an endof-the-century church congress . It seems to mark the end of other things besides the century . Are not our embattled clergymen coming dangerously near justifying Shelley 's bitter taunt that war is " the priest 's delight " ? The defence of war , thus passing into its apotheosis , reminds one vividly of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We all know how slavery was , at first , a temporary and passing evil ; then a peculiar institution , only indirectly and obscurely condemned in the Bible ; finally a divinely ordered thing , best for the slave , best for the master , best for society . From shamefaced apology , the Southern Senators gradually emerged into open laudation . By 1860 they proudly raised their heads in Washington to declare that " slavery is a great moral , social , and political blessing , " that its " frame of society is the best in the world , " and that it is " ennobling to both races , the white and the black . " ( The quotations slaveholders did slavery . ' Slavery was not made less hideous in the process ; nor can War be . It is only Christianity that suffers from such arguments . We are aware that Capt . Malian draws an ideal picture of war . It must be alwayd " just " ; and those engaging in it must all be Galahads . But we know that , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a war , there never will be such an army , as Capt . Mahan supposes . Let him come aut of his study and ask men or nations why they fight . There is-but one answer : they fight becaude they hate . This is what the philosopher says : it is also what the ' child- says . Goethe was reproached for not taking part in the war against France  --  a - just wart for Germans , if there ever was one . His defence was that he , did not hate the French , so why . should he fight them ? Fighting , said that Igreat clear intellect , depends upon hating . If-hate , then , is the soul of war , we see that the subject of Capt . Mahan 's paper should have been , " Hate from a Christian Point of View . " What the clergy and others who followed in the discussion should have talked about was " Malice and the-Sermon on the Mount , " or " Bloodshed and the Beatitudes . " Capt . Mahan admitted thatTethe Prince @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look as if he was " agin war and pillage " ; but he met the theologians on their own ground , and showed how a little skilful exegesis could get rid of all those awkward words in condemnation of war . Besides , if we were to " follow out to the letter certain words of Christ , " what would become of modern society ? " Resist not evil , " " turn the other cheek " ? oh , evidently , this would never do in the nineteenth century . This is the great Christian anomaly at which Tolstoi has exclaimed . The priests sent him to the New Testament for guidance , and when he camp back a sworn enemy of war , they told him pityingly that those apparent teachings of Christ were not to be taken literally . Then why take the Ten Commandments literally ? Why not say that , this is a workaday world in which men must be practical , and take things as they find them , and that , really , the Ten Commandments are an excellent thing , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Ten Commandments at any price ? There are two great dangers in this whole attempt to give Christian sanctions to war . One is that , instead of producing a race of " Happy Warriors , " as Capt . Mahan desires , we shall turn out a breed of hypocrites . Mr. Gardiner has explained , in his book on ' Cromwell 's Place in History , ' how Englishmen instinctively try to throw a moral and re ligious glamour about their acts of public bad faith , aggression , and conquest They get rich by such means , but it must always be twisted into an " ad majorem Deli gloriam . " But the French and othgrs ' call this hypocrisy . It is hard ' to deny the charge . And it will be harder still if our relfgioud ' teachers encourage us in the old ' Spanish doctrine that loot and ' slaughter are a form of the highedt Christian virtue . The second danger 16 lest Christianity , in the hands of these exponents of its congruity with war , become too openly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to the whims and needs of the passing hour . Just now the world is having a brute revival of war . Ergo , the Christian religion , in order to remain popular , in ' order to keep in touch with the things to which men are giving time and strength and money and life , must go about to gild the grisly horror , and make it out a kind of fireside comfort and - promoter of all the virtues and sanctities . How long will men retain respect for a religion that is thus ready to blur its ideals and make jelly of its imperatives , simply as a handmaid of the powers that be ? How long will they give heed to its prophets and preachers if they so easily transmute the tremendous " Thou shalt not " into " Swim with the current " ? REDUCTION OF WAR TAXES . The question of tax reduction will be brought before Congress at the coming session , and it is said that President McKinley will recommend a reduction equal to about fifteen millions per annum . The country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , inE ; Mr. Cleveland 's first term  --  the condition of an embarrassing surplus . Toward the close of that Administration the revenues exceeded the expenditures 1'y one hundred and twenty millions , and the method of disposing of the sun= plus was the great question of the day . Government bonds were bought in the market until the price was forced up to 128 for the 4 per cents . This was an unheard-of premium , but there was no reason to suppose that this would be the maximum if the purchases were continued . The Government was really at the mercy of the bondholders . It must pay whatever price they chose to ask . So the purchases were discontinued and the policy was adopted of depositing the surplus in the national banks , in order to avoid contraction of the currency through the Treasury accumulations . In August , 1888 , the idle money in the Treasury was equal in amount to one-fourth of the volume of money in circulation throughout the country- . Secretary Fairchild deposited his surplus receipts in the banks to the amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaign was then raging , the cry of " pet banks " was started by Mr. Blaine , and echoed py the Republican orators and newspapers . It was charg ed that the Secretary was favoring par- , titular banks by the deposit of the publk money , and it was insinuated that the Democratic campaign fund was swelled by that means . This was one of the incidents growing out of an unmanageable surplus of public money . The surplus now is again growing unmanageable . It arises from the War Revenue Act of 1898 . This measure in creased the tax on beer from one dollar per barrel to two dollars . It established license taxes on bankers and brokers . theatres , circuses , museums , and concert-halls , exhibitions , bowling alleys , billiard and pool-rooms . It increased the taxes on tobacco , snuff , and cigars , and on the dealers in the same . It imposed stamp taxes on a great variety of legal instruments and on bank checks , bills of exchange , telegrams , express or freight receipts , bills of lading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and certificates of indebtedness , and on sales of produce or merchandise , or agreements for sale at any public exchange or board of trade ; also on proprietary medicines , perfumery , and cosmetics . It also imposed a tax on legacies . The financial results of this measure were even greater than had been anticipated . The internal revenue rose from $173,866,819 to $273,484,573 , an increase of nearly one hundred millions in a single year . Even this did not represent the entire gain . The increase in the first four months of the fiscal year 1900-1901 was $10,000,000 over the corresponding period of 1899 . The returns for the entire year must be awaited . It is much to be hoped that the war in the Philippines will not last another year . In one way or another it should be brought to an end , and the large expense involved in it should be cut off or cut down . It is to be hoped also that Congress will put its foot on the greater part of the senseless and dangerous estimates for increase of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of reducing the war taxes will soon be under debate . It is not likely that the present Congress will touch the tariff . That question , will come up in due time , but it will be taken up by a Congress elected on that issue , but not by the present one or the one which was chosen on the 6th of this month . The question now is , what articles in the internal-revenue list shall be relieved of tax . This question is not so easy to answer as it looks . The truth is , that nearly all the taxes imposed fall upon the classes well able to pay . The stamp tax on bank checks is an annoying one , of course , but as it is one which falls only on those who are rich enough to have bank accounts , it seems to be of the kind which ought to be retained . The stamp duties on . other instruments , being a tax on sales , might well be repealed , since they are an ims pediment to business , causing more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax , on beer ought to be retained , but probably will be reduced in some measure , since the brewers have an organization , backed by the saloon influence , which has strong political power . The tax on proprietary medicines , perfumery , and cosmetics could be easily spared . The legacy and succession tax ought to be abandoned to the States . The whole amount derived from it is but little more than $1,000,000 . It is difficult to lay down any general principle in reference to the war revenue act . It is a matter of detail altogether , upon which very good authorities will be sure to differ . Yet it is imperative that the revenue be reduced unless we are to fall again into the embarrassments of 1888 . AN IMPERIAL QUESTION IN NEW YORK . Just before the London municipal election , which followed hard on the choice of a new Parliament , Lord Rosebery declared in a public speech that there could be no question so Imperial as good government in the capital of the Empire . He said : " The Empire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Australia alone , or India alone The heart of the Empire is Britain , and the heart of Britain is London , and you can not afford to let that source and centre of Empire decay or be poisoned for the want of vigilance and supervision on your part . In another sense even more vital this is an Imperial nuestion What is an Empire unless it is pillared on an Imperial race9 And what are you doing if you allow this Imperial race to be vitiated and poisoned in the dens of crime and horror in which too many of them are reared at this tnement9 Why , if you are an Imperial race , be an Imperial race indeed , so that you will not see these proud citizens of Tours brought up in a manner , reared in a manner , which must inevitably lead to crime , disease , and death " It would be well if New Yorkers , in the coming struggle for the rescue of their city from vile hands , could adopt this large way of looking at the contest If there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about world-powers and Amerka an Empire , let us insist upon applying it to the work of redeeming our greatest city . An imagination which takes fire at the acquisition of islands 7,000 miles away , ought not to be sluggish under the appeal of that vast congeries of life and activity , of wealth and art and literature  --  limitless in its r ossibilities of enlargement and adornment , limitless also in its possibilities of defilement and ruin  --  which we call New York city . We are an Empire by ourselves . In population we nearly equal the number of the entire American nation at the beginning of its independent existence ; in money and power we far surpass it . To cherish and expand and beautify our Imperial city ought to be to us an aim and ambition fully as grand and as ardently to be pits-sued as to Washington and Franklin and Adams and Jefferson was the mighty ground-plan of what Chief-Justice Marshall early referred to as " The American Empire . " They were the true Imperialists before Imperialism . Tawdry names and flashy glories were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precious . To an Imperial domain they wished to wed an Imperial race . They saw dangers , and fearlessly pointed them out . Against the temptation of ' mere numbers and physical strength , they solemnly warned their countrymen . They undoubtedly did perceive and employ the immense motive which is laid upon men by boundless opportunity . If that is Imperialism , we are quite willing to see it preached in the municipal campaign in New York already upon us . In as real and vital a sense as Lord Rosebery asserted for London , the nature of government in New York city is critical for all cities under the American flag . We have heard much silly chatter about a reformed Manila coming to the relief of New York , and a purified Havana bearing help to Philadelphia . We see now how directly the reverse is the true process . The Manila police is notoriously corrupt , and justifies itself by the New York example . In Havana there are confessed election frauds , but the guilty men point , for defence , to the operations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notion that poison in the vital centres could be overcome by injecting an antidote in the extremities has now , happily , disappeared . It is , rather , the weakened heart and poisoned brain which swiftly send the toxic effect to hand and feet . The salvation of New York must be wrought out on the spot , and by her own . citizens ; and yet they may , as we have said , rightly admit the power of an appeal to save the city as the surest means of saving other cities and the whole country . Thus to state the problem is alone to condemn half the solutions offered . To " cooperate with Croker , " as he now solemnly advises us , what a way that would be of attacking an Imperial question ! The most foolish Imperialist going would laugh at the proposal . If an Empire depends on Dick Croker for its saving , it is already lost . But his co-boss is just as manifestly ruled out if we once see that the task before us is one of Imperial dimensions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to another  --  is that the way an Imperial city goes to work ? Will it lie back feebly and say that it is not fit to control its own police force , and that therefore Platt must come to its aid from Albany ? That would not smack of Empire , but of cowardice and slavery . A feeble folk , a degenerate and timid race , might turn whiningly to boss or to machine in the crisis which is upon us ; but a city of 3,500,000 , with the eyes of the world upon it , could not do so without inviting and deserving contempt . If we are an Imperial race , let us quit ourselves as such a race should ; and let us begin here at home , without vague dreams of conquest over the seas , when vice and crime and organized greed which calls itself a political party are at our doors to be fought and overcome . Empire-building is held up to our admiration as the chief glory of the day . Let susnot forget that as keen a satisfaction may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our cities as in the extension of our domain to the ends of the earth . When Mr. Chamberlain was a leader in the regeneration of Birmingham , he said : " I will confess to you that I am so parochially minded that I look with a greater satisfaction to our annexation of the gas and water , and to our scientific frontier of the improvement area , than I do to the result of that Imperial policy which has given us Cyprus and the Transvaal , and I am prouder of having been engaged in warring against ignorance and disease and crime in Birmingham than if I had been the author of the Zulu war , or had instigated the invasion of Afghanistan " Mr. Chamberlain has since run after other gods ; but those of us who can not or will not join in foreign conquest , may just as truly know the Imperial thrill by sharing in the rescue of an Imperial city . T. PLATT , CITY-SAVER . The sudden and consuming zeal of the Hon. Thomas C. Platt in behalf of a good and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the remarkable conversions in the world 's history . Is " Tom " also among the prophets ? We should be only too glad to believe that a leading wrecker of the city had now repented and was bent on saving it , in spite of itself ; but we must say that a sincere penitent is ordinarily willing to be put on probation , and does not insist upon stepping at once from the mourners ' bench to the pulpit . Mr. Platt is now engaged in the attempt to persuade credulous people that he has blossomed overnight into the greatest municipal reformer of the century . But the only way in which he could convince the hard-headed would be to stand in a sheet before the City Hall at high noon , and cry out in a lamentable voice , " Miserable sinner that I am , it was I that made Van Wyck Mayor , I that threw New York into Croker 's hands like an orange for him to squeeze . Now I repent in dust and ashes and ask to be given an humble , Ipart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is so virtuously determined in 1900 to " down Croker " ought to explain why , in 1897 , he deliberately ? flung the city into Croker 's maw . It is " no easy task " to defeat Croker , says the Platt family statement , because there was a Tammany majority of 27 , - 000 for Bryan in Greater New York . But Tammany was in a minority in 1897 . The Low vote and the Tracy vote together surpassed the Van Wyck vote . Who was responsible for this division of the anti-Tammany vote ? Who but the man who now says his sole desire is to save the city from the horrible calamity of Tammany rule ? Was he then more anxious to down Croker than to exalt Platt ? Is he now ? These are questions which serious-minded men will insist upon putting , and getting answered , before they cast themselves into the arms of this astonishing volunteer saviour of society . Platt says that Croker can not be beaten unless the control of the police is taken away from him . To this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have thought of this before he used his sinister rule-or-ruin power to put the police under Croker 's control . This thing was not done in a corner . Platt was openly warned that the patronage of Greater New York , which he was cynically offering to Croker , would so intrench Tammany that the work of dislodgment would be doubly difficult . What did he care for that ? He snapped his fingers at all this , and , when Van Wyck was elected , laughed and jested in public In the second place , we say it is not true that Tammany control of the police makes Tammany impregnable in an election Tammany had the police in the hollow of its hand in 1894 , but was beaten by more than 45,000 votes . After that great slaughter and the election of Mayor Strong , what was the attitude of T. Platt , city-saver ? Does he suppose that people have already forgotten how he denounced and thwarted , as far as he could , the best administration the city had known for years ? Did he not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Col. Strong as a faithless renegade to party , simply because he would not turn over all the spoils to Platt , ' ? . Mayor Strong is dead , and memories are short ; but Platt 's conduct and language all through the Strang term of office , culminating in his cool betrayal of the city 's interest in the Low campaign , are reason enough for not giving him a commission to rescue and reform the city now It is to be noted , too , that Platt 's argument for taking away from the city the control of its own police would apply just as cogently to every other department of municipal administration The File Department can easily be made a political auxiliary  --  perhaps is now ; ergo , give it to Platt . So of the docks , so of the schools , so of the city charities How do we know that Platt , if he has his way about the police , and then fails to carry the election , will not ask next time for all the rest ? He could avow the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good city government7 -- -and could meet all objections in the same way that he does now , namely , that " home rule " is a mere " sentiment " which must be set aside in order not to keep simply a " shadow " and lose the " substance . " The plain truth is that Platt 's character , career , and consistent course for many years would make a ghastly farce of any municipal campaign which called itself reform , and yet put itself under his leadership . He is a part of the thing to be reformed . He is to-day , as he has been for years , the stay and hope of Tammany . " Ask , Platt , " said Croker before the Legislative Committee ; and that is what he and all his coparceners say now when giving the real reason of their confidence in retaining power . They can not believe that Platt , after having played into their hands so steadily , will fail them now . In some way or other , they are confident , he will manage to nedevil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can it be seriously denied that Platt is the greatest single obstacle in their path . Croker they can fight openly ; but who shall deliver them from the machinations of Platt ? The easily fooled people who are taken in by his virtuous protestations in connection with his plan for seizing upon the police power of New York city , should know that , even if he should succeed in this deep-laid plan of his to " save " the city , they would be the first to cry out for some one to save them from their saviour . GOLD MINING ON THE RAND . The resumption of gold mining " on the Rand " prompts the inquiry what will be the effect of a new and continued outpour of the yellow metal upon the commerce of the world , equal to or greater than that which was going on before the war in South Africa took place . The essential quality of gold  --  the fact which distinguishes it from all other substances in or upon the earth  --  is that it constitutes purchasing power . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products of labor , there is no need to wait for a market for it . Unlike all others , too , the precipitation of a great quantity of it on the world does not lower its price immediately in the general markets of the world ; the quantity in existence at all times be ? ing vastly greater than any possible increment in a single year . Consequently , the miner gets full value for all that he can bring out of the ground , as soon as he can place it in the world 's markets . However large the output , some years must elapse before general prices rise to a correspondence with the new supplies of money . The production of gold in the whole of Africa in the year 1898 was upwards of $80,000,000 , of which all except $2,000,000 came from the Rand . At the time when the war put a stop to mining operations there was every prospect that the output of the following year would reach or exceed $100,000,000 , and that there would , be a progressive in crease for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be sure of fulfilment . It is certain , too , that the cost of mining will be reduced by the abolishment of the dynamite monopoly and by better means of transportation tot the bringing in of coal and other supplies . Every new facility , every cheapening of the cost of mining , makes some ores available which could not be worked before . Simultaneously with this expected increase we find also an actual increase of the supplies from the Klondike , Alaska , and British Columbia , and a steady growth in the Cripple Creek district of Colorado . We must look , too , for a material increase soon in the production of Siberia , due to the improved means of transportation furnished by the railway now building there . That this great increase of purchasing power must have a perceptible effect upon the trade and industry of the - world , can not be doubted . It is a part of the world 's history that a similar outpour of the precious metal after the discovery of America was accompanied ty a great extension of commerce and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most part , however , to the inexhaustible market which the New World opened to the products of the Old . An event more nearly analogous to the present is found in the Californian and Australian output of gold in the fifties . This , too , was accompanied by a great development of commerce throughout the world , but there is some difference of opinion among economists on the question whether the new impetus to trade and industry was caused by the new gold or was merely coincident with it . It was the opinion of ' Cairnes , Jevons , I.evasseur , and Soetbeer that the great output of gold in the fifties and sixties had caused an average increase of the prices of commodities equal to about 20 per cent . In some cases the increase was greater than the average , in others lets ; and in still others it counteracted a decline of prices which would ordinarily have taken place by reason of new inventions and improved processes of production . The four authorities named , working independently of each other , reached this opinion about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case for its acceptance by others , but is not conclusive : for although there was in 1865 an average rise of prices of 20 per cent. , taking those of 1849 - as a datum line , yet , if e take the prices of 1820 as the datum line , there was no rise at all , but a decline of 30 per cent . If we go still further back , to 1809 , the decline in 1865 IA as 60 per cent . The abundance or scarcity of metallic money is one of the causes of high or low prices , but not the only one . As gold is purchasing power , new supplies of it are additional purchasing power . The gold miners are enabled to buy more goods and to improve their style of living . There is a demand for more labor to supply the goods , and this causes an advance in wages reckoned in terms of money , and tends to cause an advance in the prices of commodities . It can not be said that the community is richer by using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of business , but a certain stimulus is imparted to industry by new supplies of gold , and a new distribution of property takes place , which Professor Cairnes considers to the advantage of wage-earners and to the detriment of renters and others having fined incomes The former have steadier employment and better pay , while the latter have to pay higher prices for the things they buy without any increase of income . If it be true that new purchasing power brought into the markets of the world has the effect to raise the wages of the laboring class more and faster titan the rise in the price of commodil ies , as Cairnes thought , thus altering the distribution of the wealth of the community in favor of the producing class , it constitutes a real benefit to society as a whole . In this branch of the discussion which raged nearly half a century ago over the Californian and Australian discoveries , Cairnes took issue with Chevalier and certainly had the better of the argument . It seems quite safe to predict that the output of gold now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stress of war , will cause some advance of general prices , and this always stimulates speculation . So we are likely to have a period of industrial activity from this cause alone , to be followed by reaction and perhaps a general crash some time later .
