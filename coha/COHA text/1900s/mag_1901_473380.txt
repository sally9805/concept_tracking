A MAIN difficulty with the Eternal Womanly has always been that she has to be temporally provided for . The care falls not only upon her , but upon her brother , the Secular Manly , who has a good deal to do in looking after himself in a sphere where he finds her intruded while awaiting her apotheosis . He does not complain of it ; she is an agreeable guest , and he has a fine faith in the poet 's notion that she will draw him beyond , draw him onward and perhaps upward , when she goes . But it is natural that he should be somewhat excited in looking out for her wants and tastes , and imagining occupations and amusements for her ; and not unnatural that in certain circumstances he should be - willing to let her do something to pay for her board . Where she greatly outnumbers him , as in the State of Massachusetts , it is almost inevitable that he should be so ; and what was at first an unhandsome necessity of the case has become not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are there as well educated as men if they like . Elsewhere they are eoeducated at least , and everywhere the modern will and deed has been to make them as independent as they could wish ; sometimes , more independent . I It is the fatality of every good to present itself , for purposes of identification , as it were , together with its opposite evil , and woman 's independence has now gone so far that it impeacheS the value of her education . The very agents of her tremendous intellectual development are beginning to feel a subtle mistrust of their work in the presence of its attendant disadvantages , which the least and first of is that it has made her too wise if not too good , and so too unwholesome , for human nature 's daily food . If we are to believe some of the scientific witnesses , civilization is finding the woman of the higher education the most indigestible morsel which it is obliged to assimilate ; and the mere critical observer of its lighter society aspects has noted that they want a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know more , or at anyrate to have read more , and are altogether brighter and quicker , than the young men they meet . They make the best of it , poor things : they adapt their conversation to these lower minds , and their behavior to these ruder tastes . They not only dance gladly , but they golf , they paddle , they bathe , they ride , they climb with these inferior natures ; they camp and cruise with them when they can ; in the last resort they marry them . The last resort is not ordinarily the summer resort , where the spectacle of the numerical disparity between the sexes is much more dramatic than it is in the census , and is adverse to the final mating . The intellectual , or cultural , disparity is doubtless not really so great ; at any rate , in the sympathetic vacuity , the wide , generous inanity , in which the summer resort conditions all life , it is not so noticeable . But even there it is impossible not to feel that the young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swarm in the ideal proportion of sixteen to one upon the undergraduate youth and postgraduate age of the other sex , are their hopeless superiors ; hopeless , in what a dark , double sense ! It is grotesque , of course , and one smiles , but it is tragical , and the question as to what shall he done with the women , or what they are going to do with themselves , is palpitating in the thoughts of many who are most reverent of the problem . The cold science of statistics represents that only about one out of three , or four , or five , educated or coeducated women marry , and of these as few again become mothers , or , if they do , survive the cares and duties of maternity . Perhaps because in such an inquiry one can proceed only by exclusions , the statisticians du not seem to concern themselves with the uneducated , or uncoeducated woman , and we do not know what proportion of these become wives and mothers . It is not credible that the multitudes who moil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their young womanhood out in shops , have a hopeful outlook in matrimony and maternity ; but their case seems to be set aside , or postponed to the consideration of what civilization has accomplished in the case of those women for whom it has done its best , not its worst . This is apparently so little , or so mistakenly much , that the old doubt whether women should be allowed to learn the alphabet is forcing itself into the foreground again in different amiable disguises ; and we have prismatic glimpses of the educated woman as she presents herself to the serious doubt or the polite despair of some who have helped most to make her what she is , whether they would or not . This is saying it roughly , and we must wish to refine still farther as to the involuntary part that the educators of the educated woman have had in her educetimi . They are not singular in largely accepting a tendency and serving it , rather than devoting themselves to an ideal . Men work with what is at hand ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost as often in the air . It is only some original thinker who has the courage or the fear to question the tendencies as well as their effects , and we have had to wait till a very few months ago for such a thinker in the president of Clarke University , who then opened his mind to a reporter in abhorrence of the actual method of woman 's education . We need not suppose that Dr. Stanley Hall is perfectly represented in the interview which resulted . No one ever is , in any interview , however faithful ; for those who think closely think pen in hand ; and the interview is a net which lets slip many precious things that one would have said , and keeps much rubbish that one did say . But upon the whole the quality of the interview with Dr. Hall is so good that we may suppose it largely his mind upon all the matters treated . These were the present methods of teaching by text-books , and the methods of instruction or of suggestion by the teacher himself , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving the reason of things first instead of the things ; the non-literariness of all schooling ; the mistake of teaching boys and girls together after they cease to be boys and girls ; the failure of women 's colleges because the education they von . C/II. ? No. 616. -9 ft provide does not include the strength for wifehood and motherhood ; the physical break-down of most educated American women with the birth of one child ; the small families that are now the rule among Americans . Napoleon , as we all know , told Madame de Steel ( she perhaps needed the snub ) that the mother of the most citizens was the greatest woman . He was always anxious , the dreadful little man , that the provision of chair a canon should not fail him , and doubtless there was earnest in his irony . Of course Dr. Hall 's opinions accuse him of no such insolence or inhumanity ; they are , on this point , so far from solely his that they may be considered apart from his other ideas . He will certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of large families , which were so well in their way and their day . Much may still be said in their praise , as that the children in them helped to bring one another up and to take the nonsense out of one another . They enlarger ' the boundaries of the home , which , however , did not perish with them in this intensely domesticated nation , and they were the fulfilment of a scriptural injunction . But if , as John Fiske so luminously taught , the prolongation of infancy in the tender vigilance of its guardians is the nursery of civilization , then the small family is better for the race ; for every child in it can receive that devoted care which every child has a sacred right to from those who called it out of the cosmic , unconsciousness into this being , pleasing or anxious , or both , as the witness chooses . In any case , the small family has apparently come to stay , and so far as it is involuntary it may be a farther fulfilment of the divine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the large family , which often made an inadequate drudge of the mother , even when an eager one , and a hopeless slave of the father , even when a happy one . In spite of all the cant and all the conscience about it , there are no signs of its coming hack . The substitution of the old-fashioned hearth and brass andirons for the gloomy stoves of the early small-family period failed to effect the recall of the large family ; a scattering child or two gathers before the open fire , as beside the airtight stove , and hangs its solitary socks at Christmas from the chimney - piece where once a score or a dozen dangled . A few enthusiasts in the cause hare succeeded in restoring here and there a fleeting resemblance of tho large family of the colonial times , or the first years of the republic , just as they popularized the reproduction of claw-footed furniture ; but one feels a touch of amateurishness in their work ; it is a pose , a fad ; and it is safe to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear of want , or society can make itself less agreeable to young married people , the American large family must remain a thing of the past . But why should the " girls ' colleges educate primarily and chiefly for motherhood , " as Dr. Hall is said to have said ? Should the boys ' colleges educate primarily and chiefly for fatherhood ? The notion seems to be the same in both cases , and in either form a little offensive . It is more than a little grotesque in the case of the girls ' colleges , and ignores the actual conditions with what seems at the last a touch of cruelty . Girls ' colleges were imagined measurably cut of dissatisfaction with the young ladies ' schools that taught the accomplishments ; but still more largely they arose from the sad sense of the necessity , the generous perception of the propriety , of qualifying girls to earn their living with their heads , since they were too proud to earn it with their hands , and seemed to have a lessening chance to earn it with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vanishing-point for so many more of them , shall they be bidden go to , and get ready to be married , as the main end and aim of their education ? " First catch your bare , " the thoughtful author of the recipe for jugging it premised ; and the girl who has no hope of the husband in the bush can not be expected to qualify herself to meet the exigencies of wifehood and motherhood as she who has him in The band . To require this of her as a chief and primary part of her education is to insult her modesty , to wound her just pride of self-helpfulness , and to suggest as unwholesome an ideal as could well be . Words either mean something or they mean nothing , and the inevitable implication of any such require ment is that the mind of the student shall be , fixed upon her bridals instead of her books . The consciousness of it must spread electrically from the teachers to the taught , and the girls ' colleges , however vigilantly kept against man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the worst enemies of any coeducational institution imagine it to be . It can be said that this is in the scheme of Nature , who demurely winks her other eye at all attempts to keep the minds of the sexes off each other , and that it is well authoritatively to recognize that men and women are in the world for their reciprocal sakes , and that they should be strong and well , no less than learned and wise , in their mutual interest . But besides objecting that the burdensome consciousness of the fact should be loft altogether to the women , we wish to make the friends of this ideal observe that we are facing conditions in which it would be ludicrous and oppressive to realize it . After a girl 's education has chiefly and primarily fitted her for wifehood and motherhood , and she suddenly finds herself in a world where there is little , and seems to be less and less , marrying and giving in marriage , would not she think it had been kinder and truer if she had been primarily and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or study art , or journalism , or medicine , or law ? The chances are even that she will have more use for her education in those directions than in rearing a family , and not because she wilt not marry any one , but because there is no one for her to marry . This is the fact which the critics of the actual college education of women ignore ; and it is not changed by the fact that there are plenty of nice stupid young fellows for the girls to marry if they had not been educated over and above them . Women used to be told , when they ventured into some public fields where they are now such familiar figures , that their place was the fireside , the family altar ( typified by the cook-stove and the wash-tub in most houses ) , and , in fine , the home . We do not remember that they were in the habit of openly retorting , " Whose home ? " but surely their advisers were open to some retort . It is because women have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commercial civilization , been obliged so often to make the homes they were bidden keep to , that we now find them the rivals ( alas ! sometimes the victorious rivals ) of men , not only in the graces , but the industries , the arts , the sciences . The part they play ( it is very like working ) has been less chosen than forced upon them by the brutal and entirely man-made conditions of the life which prevails throughout the world ironically calling itself Christendom ; and their schools can not do better than continue to fit them for it , until their brothers shall imagine some gentler and juster economy , in which they shall each be chosen a wife by a husband worthy of her , and dwell with him in a home of their common creation , safe from want and the fear of want . Even this millennial vision should not involve any obligation to matrimony as to a state more honorable or more ideal than celibacy . The Apostle had something to say for that which will always commend itself to consideration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , or met many maturely unmarried women , without questioning the right of matrimony to hold itself as the only holy estate , or the holiest .. It is holy if the married pair behave themselves ; and if they do not , why , celibacy seems . rather preferable . In millennial conditions , even , it is doubtful if it ought to be commended as the chief and primary motive in woman 's education . In this premillennial epoch ( we now all know that A.D. 2000 is the true millennium ) it certainly should not be suffered to bring ignominy upon any of the occupations in which women find prosperity . INT On the other hand , it should not be disparaged or discouraged ( it might not be possible to discourage it ) , for it is one of several fields of usefulness in which woman shows her superiority . It can not be limited without hardship to her , and no fact of Our recent commercial expansion has perhaps given true patriots more pleasure than the prodigious success of the American female industry of marrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the American woman 's genius that we may justly credit her with far the greater honor in it , though it must be allowed that her social enterprise and personal charm have , in every ease , been solidly backed up by the financial resources of the American woman 's father . He has stood nobly , some say ignobly , by her in those matters of settlement on which the high-born English lover keeps at least one impassioned eye in his wooing ; and it may be safely said that without this backing not one of the matches which have shed such lustre upon the national name would have been effected . At the same time it must always be recognized that no amount of money would have alone sufficed , probably , if the American woman had not been so admirably equipped for conquest , so accomplished beyond all her insular rivals , so richly dowered with the gifts that win and the graces that fetch . This at least is what our whole proud nation believes ; wherever the society column penetrates , it carries the conviction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of millionaires yet only in the way of being , who think they would look well in coronets . It is not only in their beauty and their naivete ( with the gold lining ) that they expect to vanquish , but also in the array of that peculiarly personal American breeding which they understand is preferred by English noblemen to the conventional manners of their own women . No one who loves and honors these heroic girls ( as their countrymen all do ) can help wishing them success , or trembling for their failure , and probably a thrill of tender anxiety mixed with hot resentment ran through the whole length and breadth of this fair land of ours ( as the political orators call it ) when it was lately cabled from London that one of the most unquestioned points of the American woman 's superiority had been attacked in The Dancing Times . Mr. Walter Humphrey is their critic , and he is as much enabled as disabled by the fact that he . is not only the editor of The Dancing Times , but is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ savor of self-interest in his censures , we can not deny him the grounds of judgment when he says : " Englishmen can not admire the art of the ball-room as taught in the United States . It violates every principle of graceful motion . American ladies are especially ridiculous when they try to dance . " But we do not suppose that Mr. Humphrey here wishes to imply that American ladies are otherwise ridiculous . He is probably confining his criticism in his mind if not his language to their dancing alone , which he faults in every particular . " Their vertical demonstrations are exaggerated , not to say grotesque . Their bodies sway about absurdly , and they attempt to lead rather than follow their male companions . American ladies never dance acceptably in smart circles in London without first getting instruction at the hands of capable teachers . Englishmen find it quite impossible to follow their vigorous and complicated gyrations . English ladies permit their gentlemen partners to lead absolutely . . . They preserve an easy rigidity of body , and glide through the figures instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know whether this is the whole body of Mr. Humphrey 's offence ; but it was quite enough to dash for the moment the pride of the republic in the dancing of our women . The attack was promptly repelled by several patriotic journals , but it can not be denied that it has left wounds . Hereafter none of us can exult as before in this dancing with the strong faith that how had soever our women 's voices and manners might be , their dancing was as unimpeachably superior as their dressing . An odious picture remains of their jumping up and down ( for it must be this that Mr. Humphrey means by their " vertical demonstrations " ) , of the absurd swaying about of their bodies , and their bold desire to lead rather than follow their male companionc of their total failure to preserve an easy rigidity , as English ladies do , and to glide through the figures instead of leaping and hopping . Whether the fact that the dancing-academies of London are full of American women struggling to unlearn " the terpsichorean vulgarisms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reported from Mr. Humphrey , will avail to blot the sight , time alone can tell . What is certainly consoling , however , is that our women are qualifying themselves for success in London by even the sacrifice of national pride , if they are making the effort ascribed to them . Their behavior shows them to be truly business in this as in all other things ; and we may trust them to practise the meekest obsequiousness to their male companions in the dance , and the easiest rigidity of body , if that is what is wanted , in order to be in with the first at the coming coronation festivities . Some " new movements " are announced by the London dancing-masters , who profess alone to be in the secret of them ; but we venture to believe that these will cross the ocean and be taught in all our own academies long before Edward VII . wears the crown which has bound the brows of so many of the wise and good in the past . There is a suggestion in all this which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect to the education of women . If it is not quite practicable to make wifehood and motherhood the primary and chief ideal in women 's education , why should it be impossible to embody something like it on a limited scale ? Our girl 's colleges might continue to educate our women to earn their living ; but there might be post-graduate schools in telepathic touch with London which should teach the branches necessary to the American woman 's success in English society . The American woman might be trusted to study these with a zeal which would eventuate in the eclipse of all her English sisters . The danger would of course be that the English lover might miss in these proud vie-tresses , bearing themselves with an easy rigidity in all the exigencies of social life , something wild and sweet that he fancied in the unconventional product of New England , or California , or the great Middle West , or the New South . It is a danger that could be guarded ; and the Easy Chair is net pretending that it is a serious aspect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left to the educated woman herself . She was not a fool to begin with , in most eases , and it is to be doubted if her college has made a fool of her . It has looked honestly after her mind , and in the favor which athletics now find among our students , it seems not to have ignored the fact that she " is not wholly brain . "
