The Republicans at Washington are rapidly working themselves into a frame of mind about the tariff comparable only to that state of nervous dread which afflicted the Democracy , and , indeed , nearly the whole country , in connection with the agitation against slavery from 1833 to 1860 Now as then we have , or are told that we have , a sacrosanct law against which it is a crime to breathe , and which it is almost treason to attempt to modify or repeal . As the old man eloquent , John Quincy Adams , found that even the right of petition must be denied , on the ground that it would " open " the slavery question , about which it was the duty of every patriot to keep for ever mum , so now the most glaring injustices of the tariff , even its provisions that prevent us from honorably and humanely keeping our promises to the Cubans , must not be touched , because to touch them would be to " open " the tariff question . At the sound of these words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Mill said in reference to talk of disestablishment of the English Church , " images of rapine , violence , plunder , and every sentiment of abhorrence which would be excited by a proposal to take away from an individual the earnings of his toil or the inheritance of his fathers . " This spirit of fear has been impressed even on a courageous President . His message regards tariff revision as a kind of calamity from which all Christian folk will pray the good Lord to deliver them . How about Mr. Babcock 's bill to remove tariff protection from Trusts that sell their goods cheaper to the foreigner than to the favored consumer in the blessed " home market " ? Is not that a simple measure of social justice9 Yes , but , you see , that would be to " open " the tariff ? and the opening of Pandora 's box did not let loose more evils than we should see following so reckless a proceeding . So of doing something for the Cubans , so of reducing taxes . We are told that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide a market for Cuban products , that we ought to cut down the surplus by cutting down taxes , but there is the sacred tariff in the way , and who so impious as to propose to take away one jot or tittle of that ? It has its comic aspects , this treating the tariff as a kind of Mumbo Jumbo , which will bring nameless woes upon you if you touch it irreverently ; but the obsession is real enough and serious enough in many honest minds No one can doubt that President Roosevelt is perfectly sincere in thinking a " general revision of the tariff " a thing to shrink from as from the plague . He recalls , we presume , the McKinley tariff and the political disasters that followed it , and the Wilson tariff with the troubles that came after , and agrees with the timid Republicans who flock to the White House to say , " No more of that , an thou lovest me ! " Yet a little reflection will show that a tariff law is no more exempt from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always have needed revision , and always will . Their framers are neither omniscient nor infallible They can not legislate for the unknown future . Conditions change , trade shifts , the incidence of taxation alters , new devices to thwart the tariff or to profit by it are discovered , the needs of revenue change , international relations and foreign commerce take on new aspects of dependence upon tariff revision , and it is absurd to suppose that we can not modify a law made to fit other times and other circumstances . No such old man of the sea , in the shape of a tariff law that altereth not , can be allowed to impede the free play of a nation 's expanding energies . The case is different , of course , if the tariff is not an honest law , honestly in the public interest . If it is a bundle of favoritisms , a combination of bargains , a resultant of log-rolling and selfish interest striking hands with selfish interest , then , indeed , we can understand why it must not be touched . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not be taken away without bringing the whole to the ground . And the old familiar threats we already hear once more about making the grass grow in the streets of manufacturing cities if the McKinley treaties of reciprocity are ratified , or if the duties on hides or wool or sugar are touched , unpleasantly remind us that there is only too much truth in the theory of the tariff as a covenant between its beneficiaries , not one clause of which can be repealed without a loss of honor among  --  protectionists . Now it is exactly this suspicious view of the tariff which the Republicans will do their best to foster if they continue in their present attitude of hare-like timidity in respect to any tariff changes . People will not be put off by the official sighs of regret that the confessed blemishes of the tariff can not be removed . Would the duties on steel and iron have been placed at the Dingley figure if it had been foreseen that a great Steel Trust would arise to sell goods cheaper to Englishman and German than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the blunder be now retraced ? Western Republicans , clear-eyed citizens , everywhere , are not to be told , as if they were children , that this needless and abused protection to the Steel Trust can not be taken away . Only a bill of a few lines would be necessary . Why would this necessarily " open " the whole tariff ? Why , unless it is true that the Dingley tariff was a great grab by special interests , . possible only because they to pool their demands , and stable only as long as each one 's plunder remains intact ? We do not assert at this time that such is an accurate description of the Dingley tariff ; but we do affirm that , if the Republicans continue . to kotow before it in their present cowardly and slavish fashion , this will be the idea of the nature and end of all tariffs which will become fixed in the popular mind . Mere self-interest and self-respect should prompt the Republican party to shake off the contemptible paralysis , as respects tariff amendment , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to appear bound in fetters of its own forging . It can not desire , by a stupid persistence in its alleged helplessness , to create a soul even under the ribs of death in the Democratic party , and see itself turned out of power for not having used its power for the general good The times clearly call for Tariff modifications . They are needed to do justice at home and secure trade abroad , as also to reduce a dangerously swollen revenue . And every day 's delay to urge and secure them is , for the Republicans , to deposit just so much more in what Burke called the " bank of discontent , " upon which every political opponent may " draw at pleasure . " THE NEW TREATY . The surest way to measure the significance of the new Hay-Pauncefote treaty is to compare it with the old one , and with the form of the old one , as amended by the Senate , which Great Britain rejected . We may say , briefly , that all three aim at the same great object @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the ships of commerce and of war of all nations ; that the changes of phraseology successively made look only to the manner of guaranteeing this fundamental principle ; and that the agreement finally reached reveals the ordinary give-and-take of diplomatic adjustment . There is no " backdown , " as there is no sweeping victory , on either side . Sensible representatives of two sensible nations have simply devised a form of words to cover the end which both have at heart . The first Hay-Pauncefote treaty was , in effect , a modification of the ClaytonBulwer treaty . One of the Senate amendments brusquely declared , in reference to the latter , ? " which Convention is hereby superseded . " To this , Lord Lansdowne made the perfectly sound objection that no " international contract of unquestionable validity ought to be abrogated or modified , save with the consent of both the parties to the contract . " Accordingly , we have now the orderly supersession of the Clayton-Bulwer Treaty set down in Article I. of the new treaty as that to which " the high contracting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the British Foreign Secretary indicated as the only proper way . One of the famous Senate amendments is quietly dropped , as it should have been . We refer to the paragraph which the Senate added to ' section 5 of Article II. , to wit : " It is agreed that none of the immediately foregoing conditions and stipulations . . . shall apply to measures which the United States may find it necessary to take for securing by its own forces the defence of the United States and the maintenance of public order . " Such vague language has no place in a treaty . If it was intended to take away with one hand what was given with the other  --  that is , the real neutrality of the canal  --  it should have been so stated in explicit terms . If it was only meant that , in case of war , the United States might defend itself to the utmost of its ability , that was a matter of course , and needed no clause of a treaty to make it certain . All this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its way , however , in the leaving out also of the third Article of the original treaty , agreeing to invite the adhesion of other Powers to the canal convention . There is the less reason for such a provision now since the joint guarantee of neutrality has been exchanged for the individual guarantee of the United States . This is the most marked change of all . Before , the United States and Great Britain agreed together to guarantee that any Isthmian canal should be open to all the world on equal terms ; at present , the United States agrees with Great Britain that it will , on its own responsibility , adopt and enforce rules securing neutrality and equality . It is our own affair now . With England out of it , there is no reason to ask other nations to come in . The old clause prohibiting fortifications commanding the canal has been dropped . That does not mean , however , that forts are now permitted The one military right specifically granted to the United States is that of maintaining a " military police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " By a well-known rule of judicial construction , this specific grant would be held to bar out any not mentioned . Besides , in section 2 of Article III . of the new treaty , the United States definitely agrees that " the canal shall never be blockaded , nor shall any right of war be exercised within it " This would preclude forts , or at any rate the use of them . It is absurd , therefore , to suppose that they will ever be built . The only defence of the canal possible , in case of war , is a naval defence . This is now well settled , and we should hear no more talk about fortifications . One entirely new Article  --  the fourth  --  appears in the latest treaty It provides that " no change of territorial sovereignty or of international relations of the country or countries traversed by the canal shall affect the general principle of neutralization , or the obligation of the high contracting parties under the present treaty . " The need for this is obvious . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By Article I. of that treaty the United States bound itself never to " occupy , or fortify , or colonize , or assume , or exercise any dominion over Nicaragua , Costa Rica , the Mosquito Coast , or any part of Central America . " That restriction being now removed , it was vitally important for Great Britain to obtain a guarantee that , in case the territory through which the canal is to run should ever come under the sovereignty of the United States , the right of English ships freely and equitably to use the waterway ( which would then be domestic property of the United States ) should never be impaired . All told , the treaty is admirably designed to secure the ends aimed at by both parties to it , and the manner of its drafting should quiet most of the old cavilling opposition . There will doubtless arise a few alarmed patriots to scent mysterious dangers in the new document , as they did in the old . And the breed of American politicians who object to any agreement with England simply because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wholly extinct But we believe that the Administration is justified in its confidence that the opposition will amount to nothing , and that the treaty will be speedily ratified . It ought to be , as promotive both of good relations with Great Britain , which should be a prime object of our national policy , and of an Isthmian canal , which the American people are determined to have . Opponents of the treaty may , therefore , be classed as either haters of England or enemies of a canal . THE TREA SURY REPORT . The principal features of Secretary Gage 's report this year are a recommendation for a reduction of taxes to the amount of $50,000,000 , and one for a change in the currency system by a modification of existing requirements for the security of bank-note issues . The reason for the reduction of taxes is that the public revenues for the current fiscal year ending June 30 , 1902 , are estimated to show a surplus of $100 , - 000,000 over expenditures for the same period . These facts are rather grudgingly set forth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole amount of this surplus than the half of it which he desires to retain , not because he has any use for it , but because it is very comfortable for the person who pays the Government 's expenses to have a large pile of money in sight . Here was an opportunity for some wholesome instruction to Congress and the people on the dangers of an over flowing Treasury in the way of promoting extravagance , jobbery , and corruption in public life , but Mr. Gage did not see fit to use his opportunity . He could not have done so very consistent . ly when advocating as he does the policy of " navigation bounties , " otherwise ship subsidies , which he seeks to minimize , however , by saying that they " need not in any year exceed the total cost of a couple of battle-ships . " The last Congress considered Mr. Gage 's plans for revenue reduction much too conservative . It made a much heavier cut in the taxes than he recommended , and yet did not cut deeply enough . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shortcomings of its predecessor and those of the Secretary also . Mr Gage introduces his plan of currency reform with a prefatory treatise on the principles of banking , which is entirely sound and perhaps not longer than needful to explain to uninstructed readers the reasons for the change which he proposes . In brief , the explanation is that a bank is an apparatus for swapping credit rather than for lending money , that its chief function is to supply the means for transferring property without the actual handling of money ; that the means consist of credits transferable in part by checks and in part by notes , and that the checks and the notes are identical in substance , although differing in form . The law sees no objection to the extension of bank credits by means of checks , subject to a certain amount of cash reserve , the custody of which is left to the banker himself . But when the credit takes the form of circulating notes , the law says that the banker must deposit security of a particular kind with the Treasurer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notes . This security is obtainable only in limited quantity , and is constantly diminishing . It is so costly that the advantage of note-issuing , as compared with other investments , is considerably less than 1 per cent . per annum . No banker can buy Government bonds , deposit them in the Treasury , and take out circulation with the hope of making a profit of more than seventy-hundredths of 1 per cent . over and above what he could make by lending the same money on mortgage security . In other words , the profit to bankers is not sufficient to warrant them in increasing their note issues . This is-not the whole story . Government bonds are a diminishing quantity . The fact that they will wholly disappear within a measurable time has been often advanced by economists as a reason for taking timely measures to supply a bank-note currency on different principles ; but men in responsible positions in public life have manifested great reluctance to grapple with that problem . Mr. Gage is the first one , we believe , to face it squarely . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ populatibn with a diminishing paper circulation , and asks how the difficulty and the incongruity can be met . To increase the amount of Government legal-tender notes is not to be thought of . On the contrary , the existing ones ought to be retired , and the Secretary proposes a plan by which this end may be reached simultaneously with an enlargement of the bank currency . The plan which he proposes is that any bank which shall deposit with the Treasurer of the United States 30 per cent . of its capital in the form of United States bonds and 20 per cent . in greenbacks , shall have the right to issue circulating notes to an amount not exceeding its paid-up and unimpaired capital . In addition to the deposited security of 50 per cent. , the plan provides that all banks which issue notes shall contribute a sum equal to one-eighth of 1 per cent . of their capital as a guarantee fund for the protection of the notes of all the banks in the system . Whenever a bank fails , the sum needed for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 50 per cent . of deposited security , shall be taken from the guarantee fund , and when the assets of the failed bank are distributed , the amount taken from the fund shall be restored , so far as the assets will go . The note-holders are not preferred creditors of the bank , except that they have a first and exclusive lien on the 50 per cent , of bonds and greenbacks originally deposited . What would have been the actual results of a system of this kind if it had been adopted at the beginning of the national banking system has been computed by the Actuary of the Treasury , who finds that not only would there have been no loss to noteholders by bank failures , but there would now be in the guarantee fund the sum of $27,421,950 . Mr. Gage 's plan is a modification or variation of the plan which is commonly described as " banking on assets , " Meaning the issue of bank-notes against the general credit of the banks . The Secretary adopts this idea in principle , but would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to the extent of 50 per cent . of their volume . Even this is probably farther than Congress is prepared to go at present , but the time is ripe for a more general discussion of the proposed change than it has yet received , and Mr. Gage is entitled to much credit for having given a fresh impetus to it . FRIEDRICH ALBRECHT WEBER . Born nearly a generation after Lassen and Burnouf , Albrecht Weber for half a century has been one of that German triumvirate to whom Sanskrit scholars in all lands have given the place earned by ability and age . Boehtlingk still keeps his wonderful vigor , but Roth is gone , and now Weber has died ( on December 1 ) in his seventy-sixth year , With his latest ' Vedische Beitrage ' still fresh from the press ; a man whose place none other is ready to fill . For it was characteristic of Weber 's scholarship that it alone covered the whole ground of that immense literature which began a thousand years or more before the Christian era , and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this his genius was more akin to that of Boehtlingk than to that of Roth , the Vedic specialist . A Sanskrit specialist he was always , but there is nothing narrow in a scholarship which touched and illuminated at all points so great a literature as that of India . This is shown most clearly in his ' History of Sanskrit Literature , ' a work which , while It lacks all literary charm ( for Weber did not possess the gift of expression ) , became from the time of its publication , just fifty years ago , the standard book of reference for the history of the whole literature . So , in his occasional publications , he glided easily from a raking critique of a Vedic text to an incisive review of a classical drama , always clear-headed , commanding , and , it must be added , ruthless , in judgment . For the general reader he was too dry ; for the confreres who came under his caustic criticism he was too withering , popular he could never be , but lie was well hated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have died of chagrin after Weber had " noticed " his book , and there were probably few who felt much affection for the hand that chastened them . But , for all that , his own work was so superb that they were glad to come under his patronizing commendation , and forgive him his offenes Wort if , at a later date , they could cite his opinion for support in some new venture of ideas . Even Max Muller , though he depreciated him , was unable to ignore him , and continued sedulously to court his approbation . But , while Weber had many foes , he had many firm friends , and these were the best scholars of the time ; those already named as his peers and our own Whitney , among others . Weber 's great technical achievement was the edition of the White Yajur Veda , the Vedic work next in importance to the Rig Veda , the latter being published in the editio princeps of his friend Aufrecht a couple of years after the completion of Weber 's ten years ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning of his work The seventeen volumes of the ' Indische Studien ' are chiefly from his hand , and , besides these , he has a wealth of observation and new material in the supplementary Skizzen and Strevfen , putting as much new matter into an ordinary review as an ordinary reviewer could put into a book , should he write one . Full forty years were spent on his superb ' Catalogue of Sanskrit Manuscripts , ' and he also edited and translated various classical texts . Of late years be had been publishing a series of Beitrage , concerned chiefly with Vedic text-critique . His style was atrocious , even for a German , and his pet weakness was vain etymologizing and playing with words . His last paper , for example , published this year , gravely proclaims that surds are used to express hard ideas , and sonants , soft ideas ; whence pat , rezogac , means ' fly , ' which is hard , but pact , the root of pes , means ' walk , ' which is easy ' This , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it always seemed as if he took his own etymobigieS with ds little serionSness as did Plato . The old man led a true scholar 's life , Buried in his library all day till the lectere-hour , which he put at as inconvenient a time as possible thereby ( to his great satisfaction ) dissuading many courses out of existence , he would rush out of his house at the last minute , and go whirling no the avenue with coat-tails flying and a slouch hat jammed close over his one eye , dash into the lecture-room , drop into his chair , begin " Moms Herren " before bis notes were ready , ask two questions of interpretation , and then , with a grunt ( generally of disapproval ) , fling himself back and begin to talk , answering his own questions , disputing his own previous interpretations with as much vigor as he did those of others , and genially spending an hour on a single line of text . This was his daily routine till Saturday afternoon , which he gave up to his family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loved an excursion , and would tramp about in the woods for hours , followed by a line of colleagues and students and his own children , leading the march , the singing , and the drinking , till evening brought him back to his study . Though a ferocious antagonist , he was very chivalrous in his way , and , in the presence of his students , always spoke with the greatest respect of those he so bitterly assailed , as if to say , " Ye are not yet of the initiate , and all work is good when done for Sanskrit . " On one occasion a presumptuous student asked him about Haug , that Sanskrit Keats whose life was snuffed out by one of Weber 's extinguishing critiques . The old man stared for a moment , and then lifted his hat ; " Bin ausgezeichneter Gelehrte , " was his sole reply . While it is true that Weber did nothing to popularize the study of Sanskrit , for even his ' History of Literature ' is scarcely readable for one not-a Sanskrit scholar , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record as a scientific writer places him on a lasting eminence . His work was essentially that of an investigator . He hewed out blocks for others to chip at and build ith , but it was he , too , who found the blocks . Owing partly to his political principles , and partly to the fact that his work appealed to few , he was not honored at court , and on state occasions could show only one medal . Yet there were not many of the more decorated scholars in his company who could claim to have done work half so great as his , either in extent or in importance . But it is the lot of Orientalists to be perforce content with the medal of a good conscience and their colleagues ' approval .
