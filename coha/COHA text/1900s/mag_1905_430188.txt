 |p681  THIS place is a silent chaos . I 1 came here a week ago to be many months in Russia . To begin with , I can give only a roughly linked chain of impressions . As I drove from the station the streets ? deep-covered with snow and crowded with little low sledges ? were in striking contrast to Berlin and Paris . Men and women with old dirt-colored coats or cloaks or shawls , with rough caps and broad , coarse faces , walked slowly along . No Marseillaise rhythm here . Most of them paused at every gilt ikon to bow abjectly and make the signs which the Church commands . One woman paused longer , carefully fished Out a coin from a tiny bag . under her shawl and dropped it into the ikon box , while her ragged little girl stood impatiently shivering behind her . There were many funerals in the streets ; I counted nine . Three had men in uniform who strode pompously in front bearing lighted lamps . I am told these lamps help the soul on its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and their funerals were but poor affairs . One was simply a group of five ? two workmen bearing between them a little box covered with fancy white paper , two dull-eyed women Copyright , 1905 , the Outlook Company , New York . walking behind , while between them trudged a chubby youngster who kept staring with big round eyes at the box . From the church spires deep , rich bells were booming . But there were no street cries , no shrewd little newsies darting about , hardly a paper in sight ? but uniforms by hundreds . Uniforms , ikons , poverty , quiet . " Quiet ? Yes , and so it has been , " a bank official was telling me an hour later . The foreign correspondents told the most absurd lies about that Sunday affair . I was here in this room at the . time , and I did not even know that anything was going on . " " Strange , " said an English correspondent to whom I told this soon after . " The troops charged up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over there . " He showed me scores of bullet dints in the walls two blocks away . " You must consider every man 's motives in Petersburg , " he added . There are about a million lies told here daily . Go in there and you will hear another . " I entered a wealthy shop across the street , found the proprietor , and told him I had just arrived from New York to describe a revolution . The proprietor smiled . " The truth is , " he said in French , " that very little has happened . To show you what lies can be told in this town  |p682  I was here during the so-called ' terrible riots , ' and I knew nothing about them till evening . " " Strange , " said my English friend in the street ; " I was here that morning and saw all his shop windows barred . But what was it you heard in the New York papers ? " I told him at luncheon . " About two-thirds true , " was his comment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems a fair one . After luncheon I had an hour with a Frenchman who for months had had business dealings with the Government . " Get men we can do business with , " he said , impatiently . " The present cabal , like the two hundred thousand bureaucrats beneath them , are not only corrupt ? you have ' graft ' enough in America ? but these men are wholly inefficient besides . Their motives and minds were shown best when they induced the Czar to depose Witte , the only capable man among them . They did it by petty Intrigues and scandals . We must get rid of the whole cabal ; we must have new men from the zemstvos ; we shall have the Zemsky Sobor soon ? as inevitably as they had the Estates General in Paris . Through this vent-hole the nation will surge up , and the question is then ? will the hole be large enough ? Did you ever read the memoirs of our poor weak King Louis ? On the morning of July 14th he wrote in his diary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' And on the . day when the Bastille fell he wrote , ' They say there is tumult in Paris . Rien de grave . ' That was 1789 . Last week I heard from high sources that the Czar knew all about the killing on Sunday , but it never entered his head that the people might resent it until five days after affairs grew so grave that he had to be told . He was amazed . Since then , like our Louis , he has vacillated constantly . These promises he has made are nothing . The cabal controls him . There is no man here . The whole system by its very nature chokes men and raises intriguers . The system must be changed . For five hundred years it has worked inevitably to this impasse . Sunday was only an incident . What I mean is deep as Russia itself . The very land is dying from meditval treatment . Russia must die of inefficiency and ignorance , or else throw off its rulers . At present the revolution is ? how do you say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months ? St. Petersburg is quiet. ? On my city map he marked the house of the next man I was to see . In the street I showed this map to an izvostchik . An izvostchik is a big man with fur cap . sad , faded eyes , and a bushy beard . He drives a low sledge and seems to think of nothing . Some people say he does think of demonstrations , freedom , etc. ? and that when enraged he looks like an insane elephant . To such a man I showed my marked map ? silently . He bent over it . At last he looked up with such vast bewilderment in his faded . squinting eyes that I jumped into his sledge , worked hard over the map . then punched him and pointed up a side greet . We started . And ever since then I find that the punch and point system works to perfection . He has had it in Church . army , and State ever since he was born . When we reached the big apartment building ( they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ruble ( fifty cents ) . he grew red with indignation . I could hear him even after I had passed through the arch into the court . With a twinge of remorse , I turned back and peeked out . His big face had grown suddenly jovial , his faded eyes twinkled , and he gestured derisively to the dvornik ( gate porter ) beside him . I burst out laughing . He turned and saw me , frowned , and drove sadly away . I consulted the dvornik , who wore an imposing livery . You find a dvornik at every gate and a Swiss at every door in Petersburg . Both are controlled by the Government , both are spies watching all corners and goers . When the students paraded last autumn , hundreds of these dvorniks and Swiss were kept from early morning locked up in a courtyard . They were given no food , but plenty of vodka ; and then at noon , when wild with drink , they were turned out upon the students . The result was described in American papers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there I found a man  |p683  whom I shall not describe , for obvious reasons . He sat by an open stove and drew caricatures , smiling . He had been six weeks ' in jail recently , and he kindly drew for me two pictures of himself at that time . His work is printed in many European papers . " Always the stove , " he said in broken English . " I keep no drawings ? only in my head . Let me show ? how the people ? ah ? rai ? raigard their Little Father since he have killed them . " He bent over and drew.rapidly . " Before now ? always they think , ' The police are bad ? priests all bad ? ministers all bad ? but the Little Father , if we could only come to him ? he would save us ? cure all our sorrows . ' They come . He say , Kill ! ' Now look . " At eight o'clock I went with another correspondent to call on a well-known radical journalist . When we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I shall be arrested , " he said , quietly . " They have warn me ? to-night ? to-morrow night , maybe . I am waiting . My friend was arrested early this morning at half-past four . Some men came through his kitchen and ran up to his bedroom , woke up his wife and himself , and took him off . My turn comes soon . " Then with a shrug and a smile , " But now come in ? have seats . " He began talking to my friend in Russian . I watched him curiously , for I had heard much about him in New York . He had a strong , broad face , short black beard , and big , piercing , twinkling eyes . He did not seem at all afraid . Once before , on an evening like this some twenty years ago , he had sat waiting , had been arrested at half-past two , and sent for eleven years to Siberia . But now in the next room I could hear his familylaughing and talking ; at intervals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of deep melancholy ; but the talk and laughter ran on ; and beside me the man 's face looked unconcerned as ever ; quite as peaceful a home scene as you could wish . The banker was right . St. Petersburg is quiet . " The French Revolution , " said the man , turning to me , " is nothing . When I think of sights that must here be seen , of sounds that must be heard , I am wretched . We must have here not one but four revolutions burst at one time . It is like there were four mighty rivers rising forty years ago ? swelling , rushing on . I mean trying to rush on , but dammed up , and now the dam must give way . What was this beginning ? The emancipation of the serfs . What are these rivers ? The peasant 's longing to live and not starve . The workman 's longing to live like a man . The longing of the man who thinks to speak out freely what he thinks about Church and State and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's longing to share in the government . All these four rivers are what ? Europe and the twentieth century . The dam is what ? The Czar and the middle ages . They have dammed the peasant with taxes , with fighting in wars he hates , with ignorance , no schools ? ignorance that makes his land grow poorer , poorer ? for he knows not how to save its riches . They have dammed the workman with ignorance , with starving wages , with hours and work that leave him fit only for sleep or vodka . They have made him the worst workman in Europe . When he makes a union , they shoot him down . The man who thinks , they have dammed with their censors . They have dammed the zemstvos with inspectors that spy and presidents that choke every effort at social cure . They have dammed all these four rivers with spies , prisons , Siberia . So , now , when the bursting must come , these four powers work in darkness , suspicion , and ignorance . None pull together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . The Czar and his bureaucrats can not ; they are ignorant ? though they have spent more money on spies than any government in the world . You can not know a people through spies . For is it strange , when spies are promoted for the amount they tell , that they make up false things to add to the true ones ? It is pitiful to see rulers so ignorant that after Sunday 's struggle they say this was caused by Japanese and English who bribed the workmen to strike against their kind Father . With such ignorance the dam is weak . I will give you an example . Why shall I be arrested ? Because I went three  |p684  nights ago to a meeting of forty workmen leaders . What were those leaders doing ? Meeting to petition that they be allowed to organize ? the very same thing the Czar had promised a week ago . So they met . Spies were there . Many were arrested . They say that I shall be arrested . How pitiful is such a government ! But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in poverty and oppression could create such literature , such music ? these people feel now that something is spoiled in their souls . They say , ' It must not be spoiled . Our souls must live free . It is better to die than live as we live . ' And so now we come to the crash . You perhaps think Petersburg is quiet ? all is over . Go to-morrow to the slums and factories and you will see that nothing is all over , but only held down by the army , the telegraph , the railroad , the modern rifle . If Sunday had been fifty years ago , all would have been different . But now a hundred million people are held down ? waiting for a man to lead them . " There was nothing heroic in his voice . It was quiet . An hour later I stood waiting for a friend in a peaceful , snow-covered street . On one side lay a broad canal where blue ice patches gleamed from the halfmoon above . On the other rose an endless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their dark gates into long , winding alleys or moonlit courtyards . Along the soft street came gliding sleighs and sledges . The silence seemed to deepen as you listened . Only the regular thud , thud of tired hoofs and the low , monotonous cries of the izvostchiks . Now and then from a window above me came sweet Russian voices singing . It is a beautiful language . Down the street came a tiny low sledge ; the big driver towered silent in front ; behind sat a little woman with dark , delicate face and shining eyes . Her head nestled back in her soft fur collar ; she was gazing dreamily up at the moon and peacefully drawing on a long Russian cigarette . The two ? the big man and the little woman ? how different ? they passed silently by . The banker was right . St. Petersburg is quiet . My friend came down ; together we went to a pleasant Russian home and drank delicious tea until one o'clock . Later in my hotel room as I dropped off to sleep I vowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I recalled the fat , sleepy , red-cheeked German whom I had met in the train from Berlin . I had asked him to teach me the phrase " Do n't shoot ! " in Russian . His fat face had wrinkled into a grin ; he had looked thoughtfully out of the car window and had then ? taught me the words . " Ven you call so to de poleece dey vill not shoot you , " he had told me . This phrase I had proudly repeated that evening . Every one laughed . It meant " Give me liberty or death ! " I must learn Russian . Late Sunday morning I crowded into the great arched door of a Russian church . Vestibules , aisles , every foot of space , was packed with people . The air was close , the light was dim , and from far down in front came a low chant which rose and fell and thrilled with sorrow . I edged my way up a low side aisle , passing a booth where a new kind of official was peddling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Near him another official sold tallow tapers , three kopecks ( 1 5Z cents ) for the smallest , and so up to the big fat candles that insured you a whole ruble 's worth of salvation . Stopping here for some time , it was easy to see that the trade was almost wholly in three-kopeck tapers ; the buyers were the poorest , the most ignorant . As I stood half-way up the aisle , every few moments I felt a gentle poke in the ribs , turned and received a taper and passed it on toward the chapel ahead . This side chapel was full of women kneeling . The chant rose and fell again and stopped . Then from the great altar came a voice deep and rich as an organ . I could just see a towering , massive head with long hair and bushy beard . The priest had come forth from that mysterious holy place and was bellowing prayers to the Russian God . I say bellowing ; his voice was so deep and rich and coarse that there is no other word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ altars were glittering with gilt and gold and gems . So it is all through starving Russia ? billions of rubles stored safely away in altars . In  |p685  return the priests promise the people a bright , heavenly empire of angels and archangels , a graded hierarchy to match the empire below , a place where souls shall be joyous slaves through all eternity . To protect this radiant vision from rude modern science this Church fought Peter the Great two hundred years ago , and has fought all reforms ever since . Universal education would be a deadly thing for Holy Russia . I turned . Hundreds of faces , old and young , comfortable , poor , and very poor , were all staring alike at the altar . Close behind me stood a feeble old man with long , curly gray hair , a deep-wrinkled face , and faded blue eyes under thick , grizzled eyebrows . These brows twitched nervously , the eyes stared hard , and suddenly ? as the voice of his official shepherd rose in an impassioned appeal for mercy ? this man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the pavement at my feet . I tried to turn away . But now all around me hundreds of men and women fell down humbly , reverently , with faces touching the pavement . At the high altar the great golden doors swung noiselessly back , shutting out the mysterious holy of holies within . I went out into the street . It was good to breathe deep and free again . The Church , the spies and police , the army ? these powers batten down all thoughts of freedom . That afternoon I drove out through the factory suburbs , and there I saw thousands of workmen in scattered groups facing the great mills and factories . Some were on strike , but most were simply enjoying a Sunday 's rest , standing gloomy . and silent in the sooty snow . Some of these men marched to the Winter Palace . Their leaders , who suffered most , were skilled workmen , earning from fifty to sixty dollars a month . They struck , not to raise their own wages , but to raise the wages of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were classed together at forty cents a day . As I saw the places these laborers lived in , and the kind of food for sale in the stalls , their demand for a raise to fifty cents a day did not seem exorbitant . A corner , " as you may hear all through these districts , is a spot on a tenement floor , which a workman rents for two rubles ( one dollar and four cents ) a month . His food is black bread , cabbage , soup , and on holidays enough vodka to get drunk on . He asked for shorter hours . This , too , seemed reasonable . In the Petersburg slums are " Sunday-schools " ? somewhat like our American nightschools ? where workmen are taught on Sundays , and in the evenings of the week . A volunteer teacher here tells me that her great grown pupils are so dead tired at night that they often fall asleep in their chairs . It is these same pupils who have led in the strike movement . The Government and the Church have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? and rightly , for schools are the ruination of submission , superstition , and ignorance . These schools have done much , but still twothirds of the three hundred thousand can not write their own names . In the dull little shops and stalls on these streets you see few shop-signs , but only shop-pictures of the wares to be bought within . But the foremost demand of the strikers is the right to combine , to discuss their interests freely , in order that from now on they may , step by step , force their way up closer and closer to the Winter Palace . This was no struggle for ten cents a day , but the beginning of an economic revolution like the one now under way in America . It was only a beginning in ignorance . In a tenement room near by is a long , ragged pelisse which is kept as a sacred relic , to be gazed upon by hundreds of workmen . This pelisse was left behind by Gapon . The rumor has spread through the whole three hundred thousand that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In their eyes he has already become a deliverer half divine . This is ignorance yearning for a great man , making a God of a simple priest . So in the streets these groups stood in gloomy silence . Only now and then I heard a voice raised angrily . Silence ? for before them down the street came riding a Cossack patrol , a dozen huge creatures splendid as the beasts they rode , with thick mustaches curling up  |p686  over red cheeks , with hard jaws and flashing eyes . They rode laughing by . Inside those factory walls were hundreds of soldiers with modern repeating rifles . In there , too , were modern telephones ; in an hour they could summon a hundred thousand more soldiers ; in a day modern railroads could swell even this army ; in two hours modern Gatling guns could sweep the streets . And so the workmen stood in silent groups . St. Petersburg is quiet . The next day I sat in the office of a Liberal newspaper . Here it looked as though good news had just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You saw only smiles , you heard only joyous voices . Some twenty men and a few women were writing or talking very fast . On the tables stood glasses of Russian tea ; the air was fragrant from cigarettes . I was taken back to an inner room , and presented my letter to a tall man with huge shoulders , heavy pointed beard , deep brown eyes , and a jolly smile . He gripped my hand warmly , as though he felt good . " We are up now , " he said in French , and no censors can ever again keep us down . Each day since that Sunday we 've been speaking out more boldly , and our audacity is only a sign of the many powers rising swiftly , one by one , all around us . As these other powers rise deep and different enough to make ten revolutions instead of one , but all in the dark and groping for levers to pull , we , by suddenly speaking out freely , spreading news and opinions of all groups , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come face to face . So many opinions and interests are bound to clash , we shall have newspaper fights by the hundred . All this is healthy . The question is , Can this wild , quiet , deep-burning soul called a Slav be patient enough to fight only on paper ? Probably not , but at least we can do much to clear away the needless quarrels . We are growing every day . Six weeks ago we had twenty-five subscribers , to-day we have twenty-five thousand . Another paper started three months back and has already forty thousand , while a third still older has sixty-five thousand . Two more have sprung up in Moscow . You see reaction is impossible . The Government has tried hard in the last three weeks , but the people have suddenly changed , and now you might as well try to press down hard rubber . ' The censor grown timid ' is a droll idea , but true . Each night we send our proof-sheets to the censor 's office . but they rarely blot out as much as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's copy he read me an editorial condemning in severest terms one of the Ministers of the Czar . " This does not look like old times , " he added . " But do n't you expect to be suppressed soon ? " " Undoubtedly . Or else they may say courteously to us , as they did to another paper two years back , ' We will not be so harsh as to suppress you . We shall merely appoint Mr. B as your censor . ' This seemed mild enough till the editor learned that Mr. B lived in a town two days off by railroad . When the paper had traveled to him and had come back in five days legalized , its news was five days old , subscribers fell off . and the paper died . They may treat us as courteously ; it is more likely that they will simply order us to stop for three months or more . Good . We have been suppressed before . This paper began last summer . It ran six weeks , was suppressed , began again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for three months , and then what ? Our publisher found a dramatist who had bought a newspaper license but had no money to start a paper ; our publisher bought this license for three thousand rubles ? and here we are again with still another name ? and many of our readers already know the next name we shall use . If any one tells you that Sunday 's affair was but an isolated protest of discontented workmen , please open your eyes , and you will see how many other forces of discontent are noiselessly rushing up . " Two days later the Minister of the Interior issued this notice : " In view of the unceasingly dangerous tendency of the journal as expressed in the following articles . . concerning . . . the Zemsky Sobor . . . popular representation . . . etc. , the Minister of the Interior , by authority of the Statute on Censure of the Press ,  |p687  Code of Laws , Vol. 14 , edition of 1890 , and in harmony with the decision of the Council for the Chief Department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a third warning to , the publisher and the editor , ... together with a suspension of the paper for three months . " " From the editor In regard to means of satisfying subscribers during the period of suspension a special notice will be issued . " The " means of satisfying subscribers " is not hard to guess . This was a Liberal paper . Soon after I had a glimpse of how another kind of paper circulates . I was interviewing a well-known radical in his office when the door was thrown open and a girl came in . She was richly dressed , graceful , her dark face was flushed from fast walking , her eyes sparkled as she hurriedly told him some piece of news . While talking she glanced at me , the man nodded , and then from under her heavy fur cloak she slipped a package of papers which he at once locked into a drawer . When she had gone , we glanced at them together . These newspapers were printed in Paris and Geneva by the Russian revolutionist press , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constantly shifted to elude the spies and mail censors . They had been two weeks on their way , passed on by many different hands . Ten thousand packages like this are constantly dodging through Russia . They are opened in peasants ' huts , in rich homes , in workingmen 's " corners . " Some tell me they are even secretly opened in army barracks . Some months ago in New York I heard a heroic old woman tell how she carried such papers thirty years ago . Her punishment for carrying was twenty-three years in Siberia ; this other girl risks only a few months or years in prison ; the Government can not punish so severely now , for there are thousands of bearers ; the system has spread to every city and province ; and over five hundred thousand people eagerly wait to read its bulletins . So works the underground mail in Russia ? noiselessly . St. Petersburg is quiet . The next night was cold and sparkling , with a moon that seemed to hang halfway down from the heavens . About ten o'clock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the many in the street , made signs to the izvostchik , showed him a street address and displayed fifty kopecks ; he shook his big beard indignantly . I shook my head and walked away ; he called after , the bargain was struck , and we sped off down the street . Although not myself a drunkard , I eyed with approval the vodka bottle which he drew out from under his seat , for I knew that by this our speed would be doubled . Faster , faster the little sledge darted under noses of horses ; it swung against three stout gentlemen , upsetting one and making all three teach me Russian indignantly ; faster , faster , swinging sideways around corners , for the road was gloriously hard . We shot out on a broad stone bridge . Below us to right and left lay the Neva 's cold blue ice and snow ; little tram-cars crossed boldly on tracks nailed into the ice ; and as far as you could see were long , low-arched bridges studded with frosty lights . The moon above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on long lines of Government buildings , palaces , lofty columns ; on Byzantine spires , on gilded Greek crosses , on the dome of St. Isaac 's towering high over all ? a glittering mass of gold . Soon we were slipping along by the edge of a snow-covered square , a place of frost-covered trees and arc lights blue and cold . Through these trees I caught glimpses of endless yellow columns , a richly sculptured frieze , and row on row of lighted windows . The Winter Palace I No charging Cossacks , no leveled guns , no screams , no sheets of fire ? but only sleighs , bells , and merry voices . Suddenly in the distance rose a different voice . Down the sidewalk , reeling , falling and rising , came a huge bareheaded man , with long coarse hair tumbling over his face to his shoulders , with a ragged brown coat belted with rope , with old red and gray cloths wrapped round his legs . Through the hair his eyes glared out , he shook his broad beard from side to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at everything in sight . People stopped  |p688  and listened . When he reeled round the corner I turned back in my seat and then punched my izvostchik to start on , for again his bottle was pointing from his mouth to the moon . What a wonderful thing is this vodka ! A few minutes later I walked up two flights of low stone steps with soft carpets under foot and little incandescent lights above . These apartment buildings seem roomy indeed after the New York houses . I was shown into a quiet , homelike room with open fires and rich rugs and deep , wide lounges . Some thirty people were talking in low voices . When spoken so , Russian is a beautiful language . This was a Russian ' At Home . ' From the frock suits and uniforms of the men you would hardly look here for disloyalty . The gracious hostess , a well-known magazine writer , introduced me to a handsome old lady who spoke English fluently . Our talk turned on many things , but she soon brought it round to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ East , a high officer in the navy . His letters were most irregularly delivered , the mail was bungled , the whole affair seemed badly managed . The Japanese Government was so different . How little she had thought of these laps five years before , when many of her friends had Japanese servants in their houses ! As to the crisis at home ? she had a son , a brilliant lad who had climbed the long ladder toward a Government position as civil engineer . There was so little room in the universities that only one boy in ten gets through each of the many examinations . Again and again her son had been the one in ten ; he had reached the last year , and now , with the commission almost in his grasp , he had suddenly struck work to protest against the present cabal and demand deep changes . She did not like strikes . She had always been most conservative ; she read only the " Novoye Vremya , " the organ of the bureaucracy . It had been much less dreadful to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of starvation , massacre , and strike . But now she felt that her son was right to strike . They must get rid of this cabal . They must have a limited monarchy like the English , with a Constitution over the Czar . About midnight we went in to tea . Here a giant samovar steamed forth delicious odors ; here we drank glass after glass of fragrant tea ; the musical voices flowed on and on , now low and soft , now harsh and strong . Half-way down the table a white-haired old lady was telling a story which the man next me kindly translated . She was narrating how she had heard a young peasant arguing with an old one , how the young man had tried to make the other believe that the Czar had not been elected by God at all , but was Czar only because his ancestors were Czars . The old man had waxed very indignant at this , and had shook his head angrily ? until at last a bright idea struck him and he cried : " If he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make ? His ancestors were elected by God . That is enough . There are now so many souls in heaven that God is too busy . If he elected the ancestors , that is enough . I want no more of this talk . " And even when the young man had shown that even the earliest Romanoff was elected by men , still the old peasant had only cried , " I want no more of this talk . " About one o'clock a younger son came in , and as he spoke English he was placed next me . He was seventeen years old , tall but erect , in the gymnasia uniform . His dark face was flushed , his high forehead was wet ? he was deeply excited . He belonged to a secret society , against the law in preparatory schools ; it had spread in two years to the schools all over Russia . A few months ago twelve of the leaders , his friends , had been sent to jail ; one was kept there three months . Still the society grew . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and on Friday they would strike by thousands , as the school-girls had already struck in Warsaw . They struck because the bureaucracy had squeezed out all the studies that might make a boy want a free country . They wanted history , mathematics , economy , politics ? practical studies that would help their careers . They struck against this system of spies ; spies fol/ lowed them even to their homes to keep them from discussing political questions . They struck most of all for the right to have societies openly , to meet and discuss whatever they chose , to frame petitions to the school authorities . They struck for self-government . Later I saw a paper pass around the table . Many had already signed it . It was one of a thousand papers which are now being passed about in St. Petersburg quietly . It described the " Novoye Vremya " as a journal wholly corrupt , a tool of the cabal , constantly hiding the truth , spreading lies and scandals . Of all these the worst was its statement that the strike of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workmen and women who marched to the Palace were bribed traitors to their country . It ended with these words : " We , the undersigned , do promise never to subscribe to or read this paper or to place advertisements in its columns . " At two o'clock the company dispersed . Not speaking Russian , I had only heard what I have written . As far as I could judge from simply looking on , this had been simply a quiet social gathering . Here , too , St. Petersburg was quiet . And now for the last two days I have settled down to studying , sleeping , and writing . I live with a Russian family . My room is large and comfortable , with a huge tile stove , the slow ticktick of a tall old brown clock , and a view on a quiet street below . For three hours each day I work hard at Russian ; my teacher is a mining engineer student who is out on strike like all the others . He sits here in his resplendent uniform with a Berlitz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarking desperately in Russian , " This is ? a ? stove " ? " a hot ? stove " ? " Is the stove ? hotter ? than me ? " No ? I am ? hotter ? than ? the stove . " And so I stumble slowly into Russian . At meals I hear the family speak it , and again at ten in the evening , as I sit here writing , the blithesome little mother of the home knocks softly and asks , " Meester please ? some tea ? " And then for an hour we sit round the odorous samovar while she serves me tea and cakes and simple Russian words by turns . Like hundreds of women in Russia , she works hard every morning translating English , French , and German books into Russian . Not long ago she completed Booker Washington 's " Up from Slavery . " Her three-year-old boy has a peasant nurse , an old woman with coarse black hair drawn tight back and parted in the middle ; she has a face like an Indian squaw , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turns . All her wrinkles double into smiles when the three of us sit on the floor and I ask the boy names of toy dogs , houses , horses , etc . She tells him old , old legends . I will send you some of them later . Just now she is crooning him to sleep with a drowsy old peasant " sleep tune . " She has been here only two years , but she has already given up the priest 's religion . Last week she was very sad over a letter from her hamlet . The letter was two weeks on the way , for it had to come by rough peasant wagon and river boat for days before it reached the railroad .
