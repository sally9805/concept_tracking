Mr. Edmund Clarence Stedman has assumed the chief-editorship of a History of the New York Stock Exchange , ' undertaken by the Stock Exchange Historical Company . It is expected to be ready upon the completion of the Exchange 's new building . F. Tennyson Neely will issue immediately , to subscribers only , ' Men and Memories , ' by the late John Russell Young , edited by his wife . A FitzGerald Omar , done ( after the first translation ) entirely on vellum , at the Astolat Press , Guilford , England , will be marketed in this country by M. F. Mansfield &; Co , who have also arranged to be Mr. R. Brimley Johnson 's factor on this side of the water . In still another conjunction , they are about to issue ' Fifty Bookplates Engraved on Copper ' and ' One Hundred Bookplates Engraved on Wood , ' done by Thomas Moring . Mr. Berensen 's ' Lorenzo Lotto , ' published by the Putnams in 1895 , has just been reissued , in a " revised edition , with additional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sixty-two , as against thirty in the first edition . A cursory inspection shows no other change in the text than the discussion of certain pictures and drawings by Lotto and Alvise Vivarini , discovered or identified since the first publication . In the additions to the preface , Mr. Berenson shows that he is outgrowing the point of view from which the book was written , and " feels bound to confess that he now concerns himself little with the work of art as a document in the history of civilization , and laments the confusion that such an interest is apt to create between historical and stheti. - cal standards . " In other words , he is coming gradually to have the artist 's concern only with the work of art as such , and the artist 's lack of interest in other and nonessential matters . The book has gained in appearance and material beauty of paper and print . There is a short table of errata , which , however , does not mention the error by which the titles of Lotto 's " S Vito @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barbari have been interchanged - Six additional volumes of Professor de Sumichrast 's admirable translation of Gautier ( George D. Sproul ) demand fully as fervent commendation as their forerunners . Their contents , which include travels , tales , and a selection of artistic criticisms , naturally offer a great variety of styles , to each of which ample justice is done in this most careful English version . Without evading a single serious difficulty , or completely dislocating typical constructions , the translator has nevertheless succeeded in writing eminently readable English Such passages as the descriptions of Venice , the remarks on Venetian painting , and the tales of " King Candaules , " " Arne Marcella , " or " The Vampire " ( " La Morte Amoureuse " ) , are in every respect models of accurate work S. G. Tallentyre 's ' Women of the Salons , and Other French Portraits ' ( Longmans ) falls in the same class with Gribble 's ' Lake Geneva and its Literary Landmarks , ' being cheap and pert in style and extravagant in its judgments , but also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's almost sole return for his money The author 's subjects are Mmes Dudeffand , Geoffrin , d'Epinay , Necker , de Stael , Recamier , Sdvignd , Viz &; le Brun , and Napoleon 's mother , with Dr. Tronchin thrown in . We quote a few phrases from the notice of Mme. d'Epinay . " Not one so characteristic of the worst side of that great eighteenth century as Madame d'Epinay ' " with the falsest smiling face that ever woman had " , her husband " was more cheerfully and good-naturedly wicked than any other Frenchman in history " , she discovered one day that he , " The ' angel , ' had been giving his portrait , mounted in pearls , to Some Other Person " , " there is no sentence in history , perhaps , which reveals so total a depravity of all moral sense as this one " ; " Madame had now the satisfaction of seeing every day the greatest scoundrel and genius of his time Rousseau " ; " there was a coldness . Then she sent Rousseau some flannel for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We need add no more . Prof. Maurice Francis Egan has prepared , apparently for the use of parochial schools , ' An Introduction to English Literature ' ( Boston . Marini ' &; Co . ) . A text-book of English literature so arranged that the notice of Bishop Berkeley precedes by many pages the account of the ' Shepherd 's Calendar ' will not be taken seriously by any but those who are compelled to study it . Indeed , a work which sums up Shelley with the remark that he " was born a poet Of a very high order , he made himself a bad man , " does not rise to a level where serious criticism can touch it . Professor Egan 's book may be characterized for the judicious , and at the same time commended to those for whose use it was written , by the simple statement that in it Carew , Herrick , Suckling , Lovelace , Shelley , Keats , Southey , Landor , Matthew Arnold , and Clough , taken together , occupy no more space than is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ J. ' Kemble 's Pickaninnies . A Collection of Southern Sketches ' ( R. H Russell ) forms a thin folio in this artist 's well-known vein Each plate is a character study , and a single line suffices for legend The humor is unmarred by vulgarity or race prejudice , and the enjoyment of it need not be limited to white folks . Uncle Remus 's imitator , Raymond Fuller Ayers , abandons dialect in his ' Four-Footed Folk ' ( R. H. Russell ) , exchanges " Beer " for " Mr , " and writes as good English as l-e permits himself . Whoever reads his opening story , " Mr. Wildcat and Mr. Owl Go ' Hunting , " will be favorably disposed at first , only to find a writer who is not destitute of invention needlessly indulging in slang which children should be spared and can not appreciate . J. M. Conda 's illustrations also make their best bow at the very beginning , in the frontispiece , though we must say a good word for the decorative vignette that faces the story , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Any child will be interested in the great colored drawings of ' The Big Book of Horses and Goats , ' by Edward Penfield ( R.

' Pictures from Forest and Stream , ' thirty-two proof impressions ( folio ) selected from that journal 's illustrations , are excellent half-tones from nature and froni drawings of wild game ( including nine bird portraits from Audubon ) or aquatic sport . They are naturally of uneven quality , and on purely aesthetic grounds would not have been bound up together ; but they appeal to the sportsman 's taste . In ' Stories of Bird Life ' ( Richmond B F. Johnson Publishing Company ) Prof T Gilbert Pearson does for birds of South-ern States what many writers have done for the birds of New England . He is well acquainted with the literature of his sub-ject , and has a good deal of productive field-work to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caro-lina , and Florida , descriptive chiefly of the feeding and breeding habits of birds , and relating largely to birds of prey and water birds , species often omitted from popular works Some of his sketches have the story form , and nearly all describe individual birds in particular localities . He tells of finding in Florida a bald eagle 's nest that had been used for fifteen years . It was 120 feet from the ground , in a pine tree , but he reached it after an hour and a half of climbing , and inspected it and its two downy eaglets . The account of a robin drunk with the juice of china berries is one of the most interesting notes in the book , for comparatively few observers find so good a verification of the statement that these berries are intoxicating to birds Professor Pearson aims to teach the usefulness of birds and their right to protection . He illustrates the wanton destruction of the useful sparrow hawks and barred owls , tells of robin hunts in Tennessee that caused the slaughter of 400 innocents in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who , on Cobb 's Island , Virginia , gathered the skins of 10,000 terns in a single season to furnish forth the milliners . The book is interesting to the general reader , but is adapted to the school-room by the insertion of questions - and supplementary information and suggestions . It is to be regretted that more care was not taken to avoid errors in style Less than two hours suffice for the perusal of the entertaining little book , entitled ' Louis Agassiz , ' by Alice Bache Gould ( Boston ? Small , Maynard &; Co ) It giveS the main points in the career of the great naturalist and teacher and the more prominent items of his personality The portrayal necessarily lacks much of detail , but is thoroughly pertinent The picture is drawn by a woman , and evidences her judgment and touch , the features that most appeal to her are deftly outlined , happiness and sunshine are dwelt upon , the shadows aremore lightly suggested One is most impressed by the industry , hopefulness , and cheerfulness , by the splendid accomplishments and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappointments as may have been In the difficult task of epitomizing , the author has succeeded admirably , and her book is comparatively free from minor defects The name over the entrance of the museum is " Museum of Comparative Zoology " without the prefixed word " University " of this volume . Apparently the great Professor is not given credit enough for his first grand work in the simple statement , " He edited the Brazilian Fishes . " This gives a poor idea of what the work really amounted - to , it is a very insufficient rendering of the legend on the title-page , " Digessit , descripsit et observationibus anatomicis illustravit Dr. L Agassiz . " The Geological Survey of Canada has begun the publication of a " Catalogue of Canadian Birds , " by John Macoun , in which it is intended to enumerate all the birds of the Dominion , Newfoundland , Greenland , and Alaska , ' and to bring together the principal known , facts in regard to their distribution , migrations , and breeding habits . The first part has appeared , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pigeons . As the work aims at being popular and practical , the English names are placed first , but the species are arranged in their scientific order and in accordance with the nomenclature of the latest Checklist of the American Ornithologists ' Union It is proposed to issue the second , and concluding part as soon as possible . The same Survey has recently published its annual report for 1898 It opens with a summary of operations during the year by the director , the late Dr George M. Dawson , which fills 208 pages . The special reports , all of which are illustrated , are on the geology and natural resources of the country traversed by the Yellow Head Pass route from Edmonton to Tete Jaune Cache , by James McEvoy ; on the geology of the west shore and islands of Lake Winnipeg , by D B Dowling , on the east shore of Lake Winnipeg and adjacent parts of Manitoba and Keewatin , by J.

The Amides de Geographic for November opens with an account of the recent evolution of agriculture in Europe , in which numerous statistics exhibit the increase and specialization of crops , as well as the rise of agricultural schools and cooperative associations There is also a description of the Hungarian plain and the peculiar life of its inhabitants  --  townspeople in the winter , shepherds and semi-nomad cultivators of the soil in summer  --  a condition dating back to and the result of the Mohammedan invasion .

This directory , now four years old , lists not only corporations and firms , but individuals , with local and cable addresses and nature of business , and is a clear economy for those who avail themselves of it . ? In a peculiar sense the December Harvard Graduates ' Magazzne is the Editor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henry Lee Higginson , whose latest munificence to the University has been the Harvard Union , and it contains the proceedings at the opening of this general college club on October 15 Mr William Roscoe Thayer , who first projected the Union , has therefore the satisfaction of recording its realization among the news of the magazine which he conducts and had so large a share in founding also . Both Mr. Higginson and President Eliot in their speeches dwelt on the democratic intent of the new gathering-place for undergraduates , graduates , and the teaching force ; and democratic its operation undoubtedly is , with the sole limitation of the annual fee of ten dollars . That it does not invent democracy at Harvard is suggested by the writer ( in the same number ) of " From a Graduate 's Window , " who takes up the common contrast of Yale and Harvard in this particular , candidly and forcibly . The number is extremely good reading in all departments . Mr Curtis Guild tells not fulsomely of Theodore Roosevelt at Harvard , and there are obituary sketches , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ J. B. Greenough , while Mr F. B Sanborn contributes his reminiscences of Prof E. A. Sophocles , with a copy of a contemporary " caricature " ( by no means gross ) of that monkish but kindly scholar , drawn by Austin Flint and lithographed by Rowse  --  a remarkable combination of talent . Professor Hart lucidly relates the rise and fortunes of the three-year A B. degree , and shows that it is attained byone-sixth of the students who enter and persist to graduation ; and the proportion tends to grow . Amid the various official reports on the departments , Professor Storer 's on the Hussey Institution and its students should not be overlooked . Here will be found a very curious comparison of the receptivity and perseverance of the three classes who seek instruction , particularly the sons of farmers and the sons of florists . Of the former , Professor Storer says that " the best of them have been sons of New England yeoman farmers , descended from the old English stock , i. e. , men of that typical town-meeting pattern which many unin-structed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " ? Not since the publication of the Records of the Plymouth Colony has so important a contribution to the early history of Massachusetts been made as in Mr. John Noble 's ' Records of the Court of Assistants . ' Unfortunately , the first volume of the manuscript records of this court has long been lost , and the present publication begins with the second , but covers the period from 1673 to 1692 , during which many of the early regulations of the colony were in force . The Court of Assistants was the first form of the existing Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts , and represented the highest jurisdiction in judicial matters prior to the granting of the Province Charter in 1692 . Its records , therefore , give the best Picture of the many questions relating to persons and property of which the Government assumed control . and throw much light upon the minute supervision exercised under a body of law strongly influenced by Biblical precept and intense religious fanaticism . The very form of complaint in criminal cases illustrates this , for it reads , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes , being instigated by the Devil " , but the temporal authorities were not overlooked , as the fault was " contrary to the peace of our sovereign Lord the King his Crown and Dignity the laws of God &; of this Jurisdiction . " It is on the criminal side that this book is most suggestive , and a careful study of the procedure and decisions of the court will do much to clarify our ideas of the public and private morality of the time . Whether it was a Quaker , an andian , or a pirate , the charge and evidence as presented in the formal language of the court illustrate the attitude of the rulers towards those who had unfortunately run against their decrees . ? It would be interesting to dip into these pages for striking examples of dogmatic Justice , but the opportunity is offered for dwelling rather upon the manner of their editing Mr Noble has long been known for his interest in the great collection of court records in his keeping , and for the devoted care which has placed them beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case , and the danger of turning editor lay in a too rigid application of mechanical rules . The result , however , disproves the fear , as the volume represents the best example of careful and scholarly editing we have seen in many a year . The old spelling and arrangement are retained , and enough of the odd symbols used by Rawson , the scribe , have been reproduced to increase the flavor of antiquity The names of persons and places are not tampered with , either to confuse or to force upon the reader what is self-evident The marginal notes of the original have been retained in full , and every omission and interlined word is indicated without marring the typographical appearance of the page A page of the original record is reproduced by the photogravure process , and the hogskin cover is also shown , adding to the sense of reality as well as proving the difficulties encountered in transcribing . Finally , a very full index , almost too full for most purposes , offers a complete guide to the contents of this notable book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Mr. Noble and his assistant , Mr Upham The size of the page is dignified , as suited to the matter , and the type is clear , in spite of the old letters and signs plentifully sprinkled through the lines . Altogether , it is an issue that is extremely creditable to the city of Boston and the editor , and of very high service to the student of early Massachusetts history . ? Mr. Charles Hastings 's ' The Theatre , its Development in France and England , and a History of its Greek and Latin Origins ' ( London : Duckworth &; Co. ; Philadelphia : Lippincott ) is a translation by Miss Frances Welby from the original French edition of the work , which appeared some eighteen months ago . It is the mis- ' fortune of writers upon theatrical history  --  that is , upon the concrete , physical factors of the dramatic art  --  continually to defeat expectation . Mr. Hastings has proved no exception to the rule . Despite the presence upon the title-page of the great name of Victorien Sardou , whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Mr. Hastings 's essay , the work itself is far from satisfactory . For use as a supplementary text-book in a college course upon dramatic history it is probably sufficient , but as a treatise for the special student , or even for the general reader , its shortcomings are numerous There is a distinct place for a compact book in Eng : lish presenting a concise documentary account of the rise of the mimetic art , the development of stage properties , the historical schools of acting , the accumulation of conventional stage " business , " the relation of the actor to the dramatist at various periods and in different countries , the psychological evolution in the audience , and similar matters subsidiary but indispensable to dramatic history proper . Mr. Hastings , it seems , has aimed to produce such a book , but he has fallen a little beside the mark In the first place , there is , in the architectonic scheme of his book , a klatus made deflendus By the general tone and temper , the confiding reader will be led to believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his view . But no word is said of the theatre in Ger --  many , Scandinavia , Italy , or Spain . The definitive historian of the theatre will have to consider the play-acting of each of these with the utmost care . To the stage upon which were produced the multitudinous plays of Lope de Vega and the marvellous poetic dramas of Calderon , he must pay particular heed . Moreover , there are similar lapses in the narrative even as Mr. Hastings has limited it . Of many very important matters there is scant mention or none at all . On such significant points as the relation of the masque to the later Elizabethan stage , and of the opera to the Restoration heroic play , or the part played by the corn:media ante in determining the histrionic tradition of Molidre 's comic stage , Mr. Hastings is especially baffling . Indeed , if there were space for more detailed criticism of this unprofitable sort , it would be a long way to the end . It is , perhaps , ungracious to complain that a serviceable text-book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contribution to theatrical history ; but when one contemplates this field in which the harvest is so plentiful , and the laborers numerous but inefficient , it is a cause for regret that a writer with such excellent intentions as Mr. Hastings should not have lent a more attentive ear to counsels of perfection . ? ' The Diamond Necklace ' ( Lippincott ) is a translation by H. Sutherland Edwards of M. Funck-Brentano 's excellent work on this most celebrated of causes cabbres . Never has an intricate story been more lucidly explained . - From the moment when Marie Antoinette arrived at Strdssburg in April , 1770 , to August , 1845 , when the French courts were still perplexed by a lawsuit springing out of the too famous jewels , each figure and each incident are brought forward at the proper moment , given their place in the development of the drama , and dismissed when no longer needed . By combining the critical methods of the teele des Chartes with the talent of a raconteur , M. Fiinck-Brentano creates a vivid effect , while at the same time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much evidence was taken at the time of the different trials that it becomes possible to insert passages of lively dialogue which nevertheless appear to be quite authentic , and thus extraordinary situations are reproduced in colors unborrowed from romance . Regarding the innocence of the Queen there can be no doubt , and her indiscretion is equally unquestionable Had Vergennes been consulted , the arrest of Rohan would not , probably , have occurred , the Cardinal would , have paid for the diamonds out of which he had . been swindled by Mme. La Motte , and a scandal involving grave political consequences would have been averted . The Queen 's dislike of Rohan , which had so long ' been fanned by Maria Theresa , led to the issue of a lettre de cachet , the Cardinal 's imprisonment in the Bastille , and universal publicity However innocent the Queen and however innocent the Cardinal , the mind of contemporaries could not be disabused of the most sinister ideas . As Beugnot says . " The great fact which dominated the whole affair was this , that M @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feign , one night , in one of the groves of Versailles , the Queen of France . The wife of the King had made an appointment with Cardinal de Rohan , had spoken to him , had given him a rose , and had suffered him to throw himself at her feet . That was the crime that respect for religion , majesty , morals , outraged to the last degree , could not but condemn " M. Funck-Bretano gives Rohan full credit for a kind heart and many attractive qualities , but does not spare his incredible gullibility . The daring and ingenuity of Mme. La Motte are also depicted with much force . The translation runs smoothly ; but the author never intended to say that Jeanne de Valois had a " spiritual physiog-nomy " ! ? ' Washington , and Other American Addresses , ' by Mr. Frederic Harrison ( Macmillan ) , recalls a visit which was made to this country by the author in February and March of the present year . Mr. Harrison has recently been much interested in the life and works of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Winchester Millenary that he was led to come to America . " The occasion of my visit , " he says , " was an invitation with which I was honored by the Union League Club of Chicago to deliver the public address in the Auditorium of that city on the annual commemoration of the birthday of George Washington . " The paper on " Washington and the Republican Ideal " furnishes the title , and in importance it is also the most considerable factor of the volume . Mr. Harrison , though in a spirit of profound sympathy , approaches Washington from the European standpoint , and his method of treatment is one which , a citizen of the United States would hardly think of employing . It is perhaps on this account the more interesting ; certainly the , address is in a high and stimulating strain and strikes the right note for its peroration : " He anticipated the great social reformation accomplished in this commonwealth some sixty years after his death , when he freed his own estate by will from ' the curse of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fellow-citizens shrank with a more scrupulous , more religious horror from the thought of ruling by force instead of by free choice  --  no man was more truly the republican to the very marrow of his bones , and was less the despot or the master . May the spirit of George Washington , the just , the free , the far-sighted patriot , inspire the people of this commonwealth in all their problems of government ; guide them in all the tasks they undertake to wise and prosperous ends ; enable them to crown his work when , in the words of our English historian , ' he founded a democratic republic with no shadow on it of military despotism . " Of the other addresses , two are on King Alfred , while the remaining seven deal with such varied subjects as Lincoln , Republicanism and Democracy , the Dutch Republic , recent biographies of Cromwell , municipal government , and the nineteenth century . There is also a delightful discourse entitled " Personal Reminiscences , " which the undergraduates of Bryn Mawr were fortunate enough to hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and its frank admiration for the best in human genius is an invigorating tonic after the vile detraction of contemporaries which is affected by the baser journals and critics . Whatever else Mr. Harrison may or may not have learned from the writings of Auguste Comte , he has been taught by them to revere great men , and to worship the . aspirations by which the noblest souls are moved .
