THE pursuit of science solely for its own sake , however commendable it may be , is not the spirit that animates our government in its support of scientific research . In its aims and ambitions this is a practical age . Thousands of men are experimenting , inventing , and prying into the secrets of nature for the avowed purpose of utilizing their discoveries for the practical benefit of mankind . Applied science has come to occupy a very important place in our government institutions , and in none is it more important than in the Department of Agriculture . From small beginnings , the department in little less than half a century has expanded in every direction , and in the last decade , under the able management of Secretary Wilson , has grown to huge proportions . Its work is divided among numerous bureaus , each with a distinct line of research , and a small army of assistants is employed , many of whom are engaged in various fields of scientific investigation for the benefit of the American farmer . It is the work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that concerns us here . The Survey had its beginning in 1885 , when its present head , Doctor C. Hart Merriam , with one assistant , began to investigate the economic relations of birds to agriculture . The scope of the field was soon enlarged to include the kindred subject of economic mammalogy . In addition to these important subjects , its duties now include the study of the geographic distribution of animals and plants with special reference to the determination of life and crop zones , and the supervision of matters relating to game protection and the importation of foreign birds and animals . RELATION OF BIRDS TO AGRICULTURE When the Survey began its work very few accurate observations on the food of birds had been recorded . Most of the published information bearing on the subject rested on field observation only , and , besides the liability to error from faulty or insufficient observations , the data gathered in this way were entirely inadequate . It is not enough to be told that birds feed on insects ; we must know the particular kinds they eat . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence upon which to condemn  | the bird . We must learn the nature of its food at all times of year , and then strike a fair balance between its good and its bad deeds ; hence the absolute necessity for the examination of the contents of birds ' stomachs , by which means may be accurately determined not only the kinds of food eaten but their relative quantities . This method is exceedingly slow and laborious , requqires a high order of expert ability , and moreover is open to the very serious objection that it necessitates the taking of useful lives . So far as possible , the latter objection has been minimized by utilizing the stomachs of birds killed by naturalists for scientific purposes . This material , which otherwise would be lost to economic science , renders it unnecessary , except in special cases to destroy birds for the purpose of food examinations . In the above connection it must not be forgotten that when a thorough examination of the food of a given species is once made and the results published , the work is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ species having been once determined by this method , no possible excuse exists , so far as food investigations go , for further destruction of bird life ; and the more so because the contents of all stomachs examined are preserved as vouchers for further verification , should that be deemed necessary . Passing to a consideration of some of the practical problems presented , it might seem that the relation of birds to agriculture were simple , since the question is chiefly one of food . Do birds destroy crops ? then of course they are injurious . Do they eat insects ? then of a certainty they must be beneficial . But the problems are not to be settled in this off-hand fashion . In reality they are extremely complex and are to be understood only after much painstaking study . It has been found , for instance , that a bird may be injurious at one time and not another . In one region it may be a pest and in another an unmixed blessing . Some birds ? unfortunately not many ? are always beneficial . Others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the great bulk of birds are both harmful and beneficial by turns , according to age , season of the year , the presence or absence of their natural food , and a variety of circumstances . THE TREE SPARROWS VERY BENETICIAL For present purposes we may roughly group the bulk of our small birds into two classes ? seed-eaters and insect-eaters . The seed-eaters , mostly of the sparrow family , have stout bodies and strong conical bills , expressly designed for crushing seeds . Their name is legion and the  | family contains more species than any other group of birds . It is well that this is 3o , for the destruction of weed seed is of tremendous importance to the farmer , whose trouble to keep ahead of the weeds , great as it is now , would be vastly increased were it not for the soberly clad and unobstrusive little sparrows . We may get an idea of the value of the service these birds render by noting what is done for the farmer by the tree-sparrow , one of the most confirmed seed-eaters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seed per day is a safe estimate of the food of an adult tree-sparrow . On this reckoning , in a state like Iowa , where agriculture is relatively very important , treesparrows annually eat about 875 tons of weed seed : The total value of the principal field crops of the United States for the year 1906 was about $3,500,000,000 . If we estimate that the combined consumption of weed seed by the sparrow family results in an annual saving of only i per cent of the value of the crops , the sum total saved to the farmer in 1906 was $35 , - 000,000 . Though seeds form the chief part of the subsistence of sparrows , the destruction of seeds is by no means all we have to thank these birds for . They eat many insects also , and seem to know instinctively that while seeds are excellent food for adult birds , they are not necessarily good for nestlings , and hence feed the latter almost exclusively on insects . Sparrows , however , are not the only birds that consume the seeds of weeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of weed seeds . Highly exteemed as bobwhite is by the epicure for food and by the sportsman as an object of pursuit , he is probably worth so much more as a weeddestroyer that the farmer can ill afford to have him shot , even though the privilege is roundly paid for . A bevy or two of quail on a farm is an asset the value of which no thrifty farmer should overlook . Doves also are seed eaters , especially the turtle-dove , whose crop often is so packed with the seeds of weeds that it can hold no more . The farmer has no quarrel with birds that confine their attention to grass and weed seeds , and welcomes their presence always and everywhere . There are birds , however , which eat such seeds as corn , wheat , and barley , and whose place in the farmer 's esteem is by no means so well assured ? the crow and the blackbirds for instance . There are several kinds of blackbirds which at times attack crops as also does the crow . The destruction by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other insect pests and the destruction of many kinds of insects by the blackbirds , however , are considered in most localities to offset all damage done in other ways and even to leave a balance in favor of the birds .  | BIRDS THAT EAT INSECTS Many birds , as flycatchers , warblers , swallows , and chimneyswifts , live exclusively , or almost so , on insects , and very many more , as blackbirds , orioles , and some hawks , depend on them for a considerable part of their livelihood . The little sparrow-hawk lives very largely upon grasshoppers , crickets , and beetles , and even one of the larger hawks the Swainson hawk of the western plains ? at certain seasons destroys enough of these injurious insects , together with small rodents , to save the western farmer upwards of a hundred thousand dollars a year . If all insects preyed upon vegetation , our inquiry into the value of insect-eating birds need go no further , since all of them might be set down as beneficial ; but by no means all insects are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to birds are very complex and puzzling . The insects that feed on vegetation at some stage or other of their existence probably outnumber all others , both in number of species and of individuals ; but there are two other classes of insects which deserve attention here , the predaceous and the parasitic . The predaceous insects , either in the adult or larval state , feed upon other insects and hence in the main are beneficial . It would seem , therefore , that in so far as birds destroy predaceous insects they do harm . That birds do destroy a greater or less number can not be denied , but as many species of this group secrete nauseous fluids , which serve , in a measure at least , to protect them , and as many are of retiring habits and not readily found , the number destroyed by birds is relatively not large . Moreover , some of the predaceous insects , when insect food is not available , become vegetarians , and hence assume the role of enemies of the farmer ; so that when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either a good turn or an ill turn , according to circumstances . The relation of birds to the so-called parasitic insects is still more intricate and puzzling . Parasitic insects fill a very important place in the economy of nature ; it is even claimed by entomologists that they do more effective service in aiding to keep true the balance in the insect world than any other agency . They attack insects in every stage of existence and insure their destruction by depositing eggs on , or in , the bodies of adults , their larva ( the worm or caterpillar stage ) , their pup , or their eggs . Now , birds recognize no fine distinctions in the insect world . All is grist that comes to the avian mill , and parasitic insects are snapped up by birds without the slightest regard to the fact that they are useful to man . Hence we have a complicated problem to unravel in respect to the interrelation of insect pests , of insect parasites that destroy them , and of birds that destroy both pests and their parasites . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a flea Has smaller fleas that on him prey ; And these have smaller still to bite ' em , And so proceed ad infinitum . After due recognition of the part insect parasites play in the economy of nature , it is evident that , unassisted , they are unequal to the task of keeping insect life in a proper state of equilibrium . In this work birds play an important , though it may be relatively a somewhat subordinate part . Had parasitic and predaceous insects been equal to the task of holding in check insect pests , there would be no place in the world for insect-eating birds . In the progress of evolution , however , long after insects and insect parasites appeared , birds found a place vacant , which even their reptilian ancestors had not been able to occupy , and proceeded to fill it . Having once gained a place in the world , birds entered into a competitive struggle with each other and with other insect-eaters . In the course of time they developed into a great number of families , each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and each endowed with methods of its own in the pursuit of food . That so many birds are insect-eaters is an index alike of the enormous reproductive capacity of insects and the inadequacy of the forces that warred on insects before the advent of birds . HAWKS AND OWLS ARE NOT MARAUDERS BUT MOST BENEFICIAL The popular idea regarding hawks and owls is that they are nothing but robbers and bold marauders . Their real character and the nature of their services to man are generally overlooked . The fact is that the great majority of our hawks and owls are beneficial , and spend the greater part of their lives in killing small rodents , most of which are always and everywhere noxious . Hawks and owls are long-lived birds , as birds go , and this fact gives a hint of their importance in the eyes of nature and of their value as servants of man . The work of hawks and owls is complementary . All hawks are diurnal , and hunt their prey between the hours of daylight and dark . Owls , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their hunting in the early evening and morning hours , or by moonlight , and when pressed by hunger or when feeding young , they sometimes hunt by day . Hence , between them , hawks and owls  | are on duty throughout the 24 hours , and thus are enabled to prey on all kinds of rodents , large and small , those which are abroad by night as well as those active by day . The bulk of the depredations on birds and chickens due to hawks is committed by three species ? the Cooper and sharpshinned hawks and the goshawk ; and the sportsman and farmer 's boy should learn to know these daring robbers by sight , so as to kill them whenever possible . The so-called " hen-hawks , " usually either the red-shouldered or red-tail hawk , are too often made victims of a bad name ; for while both species occasionally snatch a chicken , the habit is far too uncommon to justify the name " hen-hawk . " The good these two big hawks do in the long run by destroying rats and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damage he suffers at their talons . CURIOUS METHODS OF DIGESTION Both hawks and owls often swallow their prey entire or in large fragments , together with the bones , hair , and even some of the feathers . Avian digestion is both good and rapid , but it is unequal to the task of assimilating such substances , and accordingly both hawks and owls throw up these rejecta in the form of neatly rolled pellets . In studying the food habits of birds of prey much use is made of these pellets , and the vicinity of a nest of a pair of horned owls , for instance , often contains an unmistakable record of the birds ' food , and perhaps that of the young , for months or even years . From the foregoing it will at once appear that the practice of offering bounties indiscriminately for the heads of hawks and owls , as has been done by some states , is a mistake , and results not only  | in the wasting of public funds , but in the destruction of valuable lives , which can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficulty and after the lapse of a term of years . In no one particular does the public , especially the sportsman and farmer , need to be educated more than in the value of hawks . The temptation to shoot a hawk or owl , perching or flying , is well nigh irresistible , and the bad habit is having the natural result of so reducing the numbers of these birds as to make it impossible for the survivors to do the work nature intended them to do . The notable increase of noxious rodents in the last decade in certain parts of the United States and the resulting damage to crops without doubt are due in no small part to the destruction of their natural enemies , chief of which are the birds of prey . When the public is fully informed as to the value of hawks and owls and an enlightened sentiment is exerted in their behalf , they will increase in numbers and the damage to crops from noxious mammals will correspondingly diminish . THE POLICEMEN OP THE AIR Differing widely as they do in structure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interests to police earth , air , and water . The thrushes and other ground feeders scour the surface of the earth and hunt under leaves for hidden insects . The warblers , titmice , nuthatches , creepers , and others search among the foliage and in the crevices of bark for all manner of creeping things . The woodpeckers , a highly specialized group , perform a service no other birds are equal to , since with their specially designed chisels they dig into wood and drag forth the hidden larvae that prey on our forest monarchs . The flycatchers from their perches dash out for their prey as it flies from bush to bush or tree to tree , while the swallows and swifts skim the air , and with intricate evolutions snap up such insects as have escaped the active search of their brethren nearer earth . The waters too and their shores have their feathered denizens which exact special tribute of the insect world . So that , quite aside from questions of sentiment , birds must be adjudged to play an active and important part in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more important , since no ether creatures are fitted for their special duties . Moreover , if we may judge the future by the past , the services of birds must become increasingly valuable as time goes on . Agriculture , always important in the United States , is constantly assuming greater importance . The stream of immigration from the Old World and the steady increase of our own millions mean an ever-augmenting consumption of food at home , while the demand from abroad  | for American foodstuffs never ceases for a moment . To supply this triple demand , better methods of tillage must be devised and more and more acreage must be ' devoted to agriculture . In part this need of creased acreage is to be met by irrigation projects , which when they materialize will make available for farms and homes millions of acres of sterile desert . WITHOUT BIRDS SUCCESSFUL AGRICULTURE WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE . But increased acreage and larger crops mean a vast increase of insect life as the result of a more constant and abundant supply of food . Even now , despite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diminishing in numbers . On the contrary , in many localities they are increasing . Especially are new pests finding their way into the country , and as these usually are unaccompanied by the enemies which keep them in check at home , they frequently run riot in the newthese usually are unaccompanied by the enemies which keep them in check at home , they frequently run riot in the newfound Paradise . Well-known instances are the cotton boll weevil and the gypsy and brown-tailed moths . It is estimated by entomologists that the annual loss of agricultural products from insect ravages in the United States is not less than $500,000,000 . To birds , then , we must look for allies in the continuous warfare against insect pests , and if they are to play even the same relative part in the future as they have in the past , they should not only be protected , but determined efforts should be made to increase their numbers and make their work more effective . What would happen were birds exterminated no one can foretell with absolute certainty , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain ? that within a limited time not only would successful agriculture become impossible , but the destruction of the greater part of vegetation would follow . It is believed that a permanent reduction in the numbers of our birds , even if no species are actually exterminated , will inevitably be followed by disastrous consequences . The strict enforcement of bird-protection laws is the more important , since of recent years thousands of immigrants from the south of Europe have reached our shores who appear to be wholly ignorant of the value of birds to man except for food , and who exhibit a total disregard for the spirit of bird laws , and little for the letter , except in so far as infraction brings sure and swift punishment . In the eyes of many of these recent comers , no bird is too small to serve as food ; no bird too valuable to serve as a mark for the gun . Birds ' songs have  | no purpose in their ears but to indicate the whereabouts of their victims . Hunting small birds with them is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this rapidly increasing class of immigrant 's , some of our most valuable song and insect-eating birds will be in danger of extermination . It should arouse a feeling of pride in Americans that our Republic has taken a foremost place among the nations that care for and protect birds . Much has already been accomplished in this country in the cause of bird protection , but much still remains to be done . So long as dead birds for hat gear are valued at a higher rate than living birds , and so long as game birds count for more in the way of sport and food than as active working friends of the farmer , so long will there be missionary work to do for such organizations as the Biological Survey and Andubon Societies . MANY OF ' THE SMALL MAMMALS BECOME PESTS The relations of mammals to agriculture are very different from those of birds . Most birds , as has been shown , are beneficial , even those with injurious habits , as a rule , compensating in whole or in part for the damage they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mammals . As a result of the investigations of the Biological Survey , some of our common mammals indeed have been found to perform valuable service to man . To this class belong the bats , moles , and shrews , which are insectivorous ; the badger , which is an indefatigable mouser when it can not find larger game in the shape of prairie dogs and similar rodents ; and the skunks and weasels , which destroy vast numbers of insects as well as mice . The fox , wild-cat , ring-tailed civet , and opossum also are believed to be useful in the main , as they eat many insects and small rodents and by no means destroy as much game as is popularly supposed . Reynard 's raids on the poultry yard are not common , and they are so easily guarded against that they should count but little in the scale against him . Even coyotes when they follow their ' natural bent perform an important service ? they keep down the number of rabbits , which constitute their natural prey . Unfortunately , however , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some regions successful sheepraising is practically impossible because of its destructive raids . Experiments are being made by the Biological Survey and Forest Service to discover a cheap method of fencing by means of which depredations on sheep may be prevented . Effective fencing of sheep against coyotes will compel these animals once more to rely for food chiefly on rabbits , prairie dogs , and other destructive rodents . When all has been said , however , the list of our wild mammals that are of essential service to man is comparatively small , even if we include in it a number which are harmful and beneficial by turns , like minks , coyotes , foxes , and others , compared to the army that are always and everywhere injurious . WOLVES CAUSE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF ' LOSS YEARLY It was predicted that the extermination of the buffalo would be followed by that of the big wolf , so intimately associated were the two in the days when the wolf used to prey on the young , the aged , and the crippled buffalo ; and for a time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed as if the prediction was likely to be fulfilled , so scarce did wolves become . But the old buffalo ranges soon filled with cattle , and the wolf took on a new lease of life , and in some localities now threatens to become as numerous as in former times . The value of the cattle destroyed annually by wolves amounts to millions of dollars , and this despite the payment of large sums as bounty for wolf scalps . After investigation the Biological Survey has recommended measures which it is believed will prevent the greater part of the damage . The most important of these are the systematic use of poison and the destruction of the wolf pups in the breeding  | dens . Wolves breed early in the year , and when snow is on the ground may be tracked to their dens with absolute certainty . Even when the ground is bare , a skillful tracker , familiar with the country and with the habits of the animal , can usually locate the dens . By destroying the increase and by the judicious use of poison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ millions of dollars may be saved to the stockmen annually even now , while the measures recommended , if energetically and persistently followed up , are likely to result in the practical extermination of these savage pests . RATS AND MICE , ARE OUR MOST DREADED ENEMIES But the damage by wolves , panthers , coyotes , and all the carnivores put together does not begin to equal the destruction wrought by the army of small rodents , individually insignificant but collectively a mighty pest . Rats alone do an almost incalculable amount of harm in the United States , and everywhere they are deservedly dreaded , all the more since by long contact and constant conflict with man they have become extremely sagacious and wary , and thus far have been able to defy his utmost efforts  | to exterminate them , or even to seriously reduce their numbers , and as if the measure of their iniquity were not filled by the wholesale destruction of merchandise , household goods and foodstuffs , they are now known to serve as carriers and disseminators of that dread disease , the plague @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is possible , are doubly important . When is added to the total damage done by rats the results of depredations by meadow and house mice , by prairie clogs , rabbits , gophers , ground squirrels , and other small gnawing animals , the resulting total , could it be ascertained , would stagger belief . Unfortunately accurate statistics of such damages are for the most part wanting , but a single item is suggestive . One of the small ground  | squirrels of Washington injures the wheat crop in a single county of that State to the extent of half a million dollars annually . While the loss to this country by rodents by no means equals that caused by insects , the total reaches far into the millions and is a serious drain on the national resources . To devise methods of combating these pests , of reducing their numbers , and , if possible , of accomplishing their extermination is one of the important problems dealt with by the Biological Survey . By the use of traps , of poisoned foods , and of gases to kill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Failure to secure the utmost results aimed at by these methods is due chiefly to the difficulty of securing the cooperation of all the farmers in an infested region . It is evident that if a number of landholders withhold their aid , their farms become nurseries from which to repopulate adjoining districts . Moreover , in most regions there are sterile and unproductive areas which receive no attention , and these again are harbors of ref- uge for the pests which later emerge to restock farming lands . Hence the contest appears to be a never-ending one , and is a constant source of loss and annoyance to the farmer . The difficulties of warfare against rodents are in inverse proportion to the settlement of the country . Where farms are large and there is much waste land , the difficulties are very great ; but when farms are comparatively small and there is little unoccupied land , cooperation between landholders is easier to secure and results are more encouraging . In parts of Kansas , for instance , where formerly farming population was scarce and prairie dogs numerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the result of the continued effort of numerous ranchers working together for a common end and aided by the state . In attempting to devise more effective means of abating rodent pests the attention of the Survey has been turned to a  | study of the use of epidemic diseases ? nature 's own method of destroying surplus population . It has long been known that at irregular intervals , when mammals , especially rodents , that live in crowded communities increase till they are very numerous , they are suddenly smitten with an epidemic which almost wipes out the species over a considerable area . In the case of such epidemics a certain number of individuals either are immune to the disease or recover from it ; for while nature is prodigal with the lives of individuals and wastes them with apparent recklessness , she cherishes the species and is chary of exposing one to the risk of elimination . After a few years the animal that has paid the price of too great prosperity again multiplies beyond limits , to be again reduced . Efforts are now being made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more destructive of our rodents , so that they may be employed in other regions where the animals are pests . Since the cultures may be renewed from time to time , they can be kept indefinitely and be ready for use as required . If they prove as effective as when employed by nature , the problem of a cheap and reliable method of dealing with destructive rodents will have been solved . FOX FARMING Time was when it might almost have been said that America furnished furs for the world , and even now no inconsiderable part of the fur harvest comes from America . Year by year , however , the harvest is diminishing , while the price of furs is steadily advancing , till the finer and rarer kinds are within the reach of only the very wealthy . Foxes of the more valuable kinds , for instance , once so numerous in this country , are now comparatively scarce . Their fur is so valuable and so much sought for that , instead of trying to discover means to compass their destruction , the Survey is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a view to making the breeding of the  | animal in confinement not only possible but remunerative . When silver fox skins are worth from $300 to $600 a skin it does not need a Colonel Sellers to see golden possibilities in the business . The raising of mink and beaver , and perhaps otter , for their fur is also thought to be entirely feasible . The beaver is being protected in Canada and in some of our own states . It should be protected in all , for apparently protection is all that is required to enable the animal to reestablish itself in many of its old haunts . After being safeguarded for a term of years , judicious trapping might then be allowed . and thus this remarkable and valuable fur-bearer be preserved indefinitely , to be a source of both interest and profit to future generations . Even the despised skunk . which is easily cared for and as wonderfully prolific , can , it is believed , be - raised in confinement with profit . The idea of raising furs for the market is by no means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for profit , especially in certain islands of Alaska , where the conditions would seem to be ideal . Some of the ventures appear to have proved remunerative , but many failures have resulted , chiefly as the result of inexperience and lack of knowledge , especially of the proper feeding and care of the animals . It is thought that the difficulties are by no means insuperable and that they can be overcome by study and carefully conducted experiments . Thus the ends sought by the Biological Survey in its investigations of mammals differ considerably from those aimed at in its study of birds . The more carefully birds ' habits are studied and their food investigated , the more apparent is it that man can not do without them . Such is by no means true of many of our indigenous mammals . Some are valuable because they destroy noxious insects and noxious mammals ; others because they furnish skins for use and comfort ; but many are wholly noxious , or so nearly so that they can be safely classed as such , and their destruction compassed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as little suffering as possible .  | LIFE AND CROP ZONES It has long been recognized that plants and animals are not distributed fortuitously over the earth , but in their distribution are governed by well-defined laws . Certain species and groups of species are restricted to certain regions because of peculiarities of climate , temperature , and soil , summed up under the word environment , essential to their well being . Cultivated plants are wild plants tamed ? wild plants modified to some extent by care and cultivation ? but in their nature and all essentials akin to their uncultivated ancestors . To a great extent , then , the laws of distribution that apply to wild plants and animals apply equally well to cultivated varieties . The ready application of these facts will appear from an example . If on a certain mountain side a particular crop is found to thrive , and the observer happens to know the particular plants , birds , and mammals natural to the locality , when he visits a different region where the same plants and animals find a congenial home he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there also . Such being the case , it was early perceived that a study of the distribution of wild plants and animals and the mapping of the natural areas of distribution could be made to serve a practical use , whereby the farmer would be saved enormous expense in experiments to ascertain the particular crops adapted to new localities . Accordingly , in the summer of 1889 Merriam selected the San Francisco mountain region of Arizona for an experimental survey , and it is not too much to say that the results of the work there revolutionized prevailing conceptions of the principles of geographic distribution . In ascending the mountain a succession of climatic belts were traversed , similar to the ones to be noted in traveling from our southern boundaries to the Arctic , each zone or belt being characterized by a distinct set of animals and plants .  | Among other results it was demonstrated that the laws governing the distribution of mammals , birds , reptiles , insects , and plants are essentially the same . Hence a map showing the boundaries of an area inhabited by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the other groups . Comparison of the facts of distribution as noted on this mountain with corresponding facts over the country at large disclosed three important truths : ( a ) That the several life zones of the mountain could be correlated with corresponding zones long recognized in the eastern United States ; ( b ) that these same zones are really of transcontinental extent , though never before recognized in the West ; and ( c ) that the faunas and floras of North America as a whole , and , for that matter , of the Northern Hemisphere north of the tropical region , are properly divisible into but two primary life regions ? a northern , or Boreal , and a southern , or Austral ( then termed Sonoran ) , both stretching across the continent from ocean to ocean . Subsequently a careful study of the geographic distribution of plants and animals was undertaken , to include the whole of the United States and , where necessary , the region contiguous. * The practical use of zone maps is easily understood . If , for instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one part of a particular zone , it is to be expected that elsewhere within the zone , where similar local conditions prevail , the same or a closely allied crop will do well . As each zone includes thousands of square miles , the value of such information is obvious . The final step toward making such  | zone maps of the utmost practical use ? and a very important one ? is to accompany the maps with a list of the fruits , grains , and vegetables best suited to each zone . Thus the necessary experimentation on the part of the farmer is reduced to a minimum . The farmer who wishes to find land where a certain crop may be planted with success , or the emigrant in search of conditions similar to those he is familiar with at home , has only to refer to the zone maps and to the lists connected therewith . A small scale zone map of the United States has been completed , with lists of the farm products most likely to thrive in the several belts . While for general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no means detailed enough to give all the information the farmer or emigrant in search of a new location desires . It is the present purpose to survey each important agricultural state with sufficient detail to enable life and crop zone maps to be published , with lists of the crops specially adapted to the several parts of the respective states . Such crop and zone maps are useful in still another field . At the present time the whole world is being searched by specialists for fruits and plants , suited to the conditions that prevail in our own country . The usefulness of such maps as a guide to the most favorable localities in which to test the value of these foreign importations can hardly be overestimated . Noxious insects also in their dispersal over the country follow the same faunal belts , as do also many of the diseases of domestic stock and even of man . Yellow fever , the germs of which are now known to be distributed by a mosquito , has been shown to be limited to a transcontinental belt the boundaries of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Curiously enough the regions formerly occupied by particular tribes of Indians correspond in a general way with these same life zones , as was pointed out by  | Merriam . The Indian was largely dependent for his livelihood upon the natural fruits of the earth and upon game , in the same way , though not to the same extent , as were wild animals . Thus the distribution of acorns , camas , pine seeds , wild oats , and the thousand other wild crops , as well as that of the birds and animals which furnished them food and raiment , to a great extent determined the favorite haunts of the aborigines of this continent . GAME PROTECTION AND KINDRED SUBJECTS What a glorious heritage of game , both bird and beast , was bequeathed by the Indians to our forebears , and with what prodigality has it been wasted by them and by ourselves ! Neither motives of humanity nor far-sighted prescience deterred the Indian from wanton slaughter of game . He killed animals and birds , however , not for sport , but for food , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game and his imperfect weapons made game laws restrictive measures in his time as unnecessary as they were undreamed of . Very different are present-day conditions . Of the almost infinite number of game birds and animals that once filled our mountains and valleys only a small remnant is left . The buffalo , that ranged from the Atlantic to beyond the Rocky Mountains and blackened the plains with its countless numbers , is practically extinct in its wild state ; the antelope , bands of which everywhere dotted the plains , is rapidly approaching the same fate ; moose and caribou , though still occurring over much of their former range , are being greatly reduced in numbers ; while elk , deer , and mountain sheep are quite unknown over much of the territory they formerly inhabited . Our game birds are facing the same fate . The present generation knows not the wild pigeon , flocks of which used to darken the sun as they swept across country . The various  | species of grouse and quail have been decimated in many regions till only a beggarly remnant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the changing seasons once thronged our tidal waters and waterways , have been so mercilessly slaughtered that the future prospects of more than one species looks dark . All of our waders have been reduced in numbers and many are almost unknown where formerly they used to cover the sand and mud flats . Such facts sufficiently empasize the need of game protection , and the study of ways and means of preserving such of our game birds and animals as still survive is regarded as one of the pressing duties of the Biological Survey . We Americans did not at first welcome the idea of close seasons , license systems , game refuges , game wardens , and the other measures necessary for the protection of wild life . To our forefathers of not long ago the privilege of killing game when needed was an absolute necessity , and we have been so long accustomed to the idea that game is public property , to be appropriated by the first comer , that we do not take kindly to restrictions of any sort . Nevertheless both the theory and practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this country ,  | simply because of the self-evident fact that without at least a measure of protection there will soon be no game left . No duty can be plainer than to so care for our game animals that the species may be perpetuated for the pleasure and use of future generations . We can not indeed pass on in full measure the heirloom we received , but many of our finest game birds and animals still survive , to insure a future supply , provided we refrain from wanton slaughter and protect both wisely and well . The theory that wild game is not and can not be made the property of the individual , but that it belongs to the state , which has the power to regulate its use and preservation , is now recognized almost everywhere , and the recognition of this principle has greatly aided the cause of game protection . As the supply of native game birds diminishes , there appears to be a growing tendency among sportsmen to import birds from foreign countries for restocking covers , and the Survey is constantly in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partridges , capercailzie , black game , willow and hazel grouse , and several kinds of pheasants have already been experimented with . It is yet too soon to decide as to the ultimate outcome of most of these efforts , but in the West , especially in Oregon and Washington , the introduction of pheasants has been successful , and in certain localities two species of these superb game birds are very numerous . In parts of the Atlantic States also they have been successfully acclimatized . Should it prove , as now appears probable , that along with pheasants and other  | foreign game birds diseases have been introduced which threaten the safety of our own native game birds , sportsmen may conclude that by the importation of foreign species they have lost more than they have gained . As most birds , including ducks and geese , are migratory and do not breed in the states through which they pass in spring and fall , many now advocate measures placing all migratory birds under federal control . The present diversity of state laws and the wide differences in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief arguments for delegating the care of migrants to central authority . That the effect of such a measure would be to improve existing conditions and extend the lease of life to many species of ducks and shore birds now fast approaching extinction can hardly be doubted . BIG-GAME REFUGES The use of government reservations for the preservation of wild animals in danger of extinction is a practical form of protection which can not be too highly commended . The experiment on a large scale was first tried in Yellowstone Park , and the results there have been most encouraging . Despite some poaching , elk , antelope , and mountain sheep have steadily increased in numbers , while buffalo also have thriven wonderfully . The high price paid for elks ' teeth is a constant temptation to lawless hunters to kill these superb animals . It is to be hoped that the organization chiefly responsible for this demand will by official action repudiate elks ' teeth as a necessary emblem of the order , and thus lend material assistance in the effort to preserve this , the noblest of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cooperation of private parties with the government authorities in efforts to perpetuate our game animals are not wanting . An instance in point is Miller and Lux 's generous offer to the government of their herd of elk on the Button Willow Ranch , California . In 1905 , under the direction of the Biological Survey , some 20 of these animals were successfully transferred to the Sequoia National Park , in Tulare County , where they promise to form the nucleus of a large herd of this fine species . The New York Zoological Society is also actively interested in the preservation of our big game . Through its generous cooperation , the Wichita Game Preserve in Oklahoma has become the permanent home of a herd of buffalo . The animals are confined to a suitable area by means of a strong fence , and , as the preserve is in the midst of their former range , the success of the experiment would seem to - be assured . Under what appear to be ideal conditions , the herd is likely to increase notably , so that in time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other reserves from the surplus . 13 BIRD RESERVATIONS The theory of the bird reservation is nearly akin to that of the game refuge . Formerly our coast teemed with bird life , which consisted not only of migrants from the far north , but of summer residents , which found the rocky and sandy islets of our shores a very birds ' paradise . The rage for hat birds changed all this and converted most of the former bird resorts into solitudes , so far as bird life is concerned . By setting aside here and there an island of no particular use for other purposes , the government has established nurseries and winter resorts where sea birds undisturbed may rear their voting and find shelter . The plan has the energetic cooperation of the National Audubon Society , which has established island reserves of its own , and whose good work in this and other fields can not be too highly extolled . The results attained are exceedingly satisfactory , and thousands of gulls , terns , pelicans , and other sea birds are reared each year in these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the sights of Florida . and already many tourists have sought permission to visit  | it to view the ungainly but interesting birds attending to their domestic duties . As a final result of the establishment of bird refuges , there is every reason to believe not only that these island bird colonies will be maintained intact , but that in time the birds will so multiply as to restock other islands not under the control of specially appointed wardens . Thus far 13 reservations have been set apart by the Government : Breton Island , Louisiana ; Pelican Island , Passage Key , and Indian Key , Florida ; Stump Lake , North Dakota ; Huron Islands , off the south shore of Lake Superior , Michigan ; Siskiwit Islands , south of Isle Royale , Lake Superior ; and a series of islands off the coast of Oregon and Washington . PROTECTION OE GAME IN ALASKA The big game of the world is fast being killed off . Nowadays no region is too wild or remote to attract the sportsman and the trophy hunter . Those who read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a generation ago never dreamed that in a short time the vast herds of wild game over the greater part of that continent would be a thing of the past . Alaska has now become the Mecca toward which the eves of sportsmen are longingly turned , and were all restrictions on the export of trophies from that territory removed , a very short period would suffice to see the end of several notable game animals . The Kenai Peninsula contains the largest of the deer tribe in the world , the big Kenai moose , and horns of one of these animals , which sometimes spread 74 inches or more , command fabulous prices . Other Alaska game animals are greatly prized by sportsmen for trophies . In a territory so remote from supplies as Alaska , game possesses more than ordinary value to its inhabitants , and the primary purpose of the Alaska game law was to preserve the game for the use of the people , both natives and white . To provide for emergencies , a special clause in the present law allows Indians , Eskimos , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or clothing , to kill game for their immediate use . Prior to the passage of the law , so many deer were killed for their hides as to threaten the extinction of these animals within accessible territory . The law has been thought by many too drastic , and has caused much dissatisfaction . A bill was introduced in the 59th Congress , and passed the House , which materially modifies the present law and is very liberal with regard to the shipment of trophies . It provides , among other things , for the issuing of licenses to hunt and to export a limited number of trophies and for the employment of game wardens and guides . Should this bill become a law , many of the present causes of complaint on the part of sportsmen and residents of Alaska will be removed . THE LACEY ACT The so-called Lacey act , approved May 25 , 1900 , marked a long and important step forward in the cause of bird and game protection . Prior to its passage the several states attempted in vain to prohibit the shipment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states and sold in distant markets , without respect to season , under the plea that by such shipment it had become an article of interstate commerce and hence was beyond the jurisdiction of the state where offered for sale . All this was changed by the Lacey act , which struck at the root of the evil by prohibiting the shipment from any state of birds killed in violation of local laws , and placed imported game on the same footing as birds or animals produced within the state where the game was sold . This act confers upon the Department of Agriculture important powers also in relation to the importation of foreign birds and animals , which prior to its passage was without check . It specifically prohibits the introduction of certain species , such as the English sparrow , starling , flying-fox , mongoose , and such others as may be declared injurious to agriculture ; for with the growth of our  | commerce the danger of the introduction of noxious birds , mammals , and insects is ever present . To prevent the introduction of birds and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duties of the Biological Survey . GUARDING AGAINST DANGEROUS IMPORTATIONS The English sparrow serves as an ever-ready example of the disastrous consequences of the unwise introduction of a species into a new home . Under the present law and system of inspection , this pest could never have obtained a foothold in America , since so well known were the bird 's habits in its native land that its disastrous career on this continent would have been foreseen and its entry prohibited . Under the mistaken idea that the mongoose would prove beneficial by devoting itself to the destruction of small rodents , and ignorant of the fact that the animal is omnivorous and one of the most destructive creatures in existence , more than one attempt has been made to import it into the United States , where its successful introduction would prove nothing less than a national calamity . Attempts to bring in numerous noxious birds and beasts have been frustrated only by the vigilance of the inspectors . It is , however , necessary to guard not only against intentional importation of noxious species from mistaken philanthropic motives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that under the 433 permits issued last year for the entry of foreign birds and animals were included 274,914 canaries , 47,383 miscellaneous birds , and 654 mammals , it will be seen that mistakes of identity by importers might easily be made , and that under the guise of innocent species noxious ones might find entrance . Every shipment of birds or beasts , therefore , is carefully scanned by expert agents , who seize upon noxious species and prevent their entry into the country by compelling their destruction or their return to the port of shipment . The Lacey act is not intended to restrict legitimate trade or work undue hardship on importers . In the great majority of cases it can be enforced so as to cause only slight delay and yet prevent the entry of species which may become pests . As will appear from this short sketch , the work of the Biological Survey is eminently practical in its nature and intent . Beginning with investigations of the food habits of a few of our most important birds , the scope of its work has widened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mammals in their manifold relations to man . The essential objects of this branch of the work are to show from a basis of ascertained fact the particular species that are beneficial and those that are injurious , and to indicate the best methods of preserving the one class and of destroying the other . Incidental to its main object , it endeavors to collect and to supply to those interested all available information relative to the distribution and abundance of our game and of our birds and mammals . Its list of publications is already a long one . Many of its reports are purely practical , intended for the information and guidance of the farmer ; others are more strictly scientific and are designed to serve educational purposes . Strange as it may seem , the United States , one of the youngest of the world 's powers , is a pioneer in the kind of economic work outlined in the present paper . European countries , however , are now recognizing the immense importance to agriculture of such investigations and their absolute necessity as the basis for national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and as vast regions of land now wild and uncultivated are brought under the plow , so must investigations of the kind entrusted by Congress to the Biological Survey ever assume more and more importance .  |
