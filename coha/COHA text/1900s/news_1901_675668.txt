txt The family fight for the millions of the late tea merchant , George Francis Gilman , began in the Probate Court here this afternoon . The half-blood relatives were not represented in court , and the much-vaunted basis for the claim of Mrs. Blakeley Hall to the entire estate of the deceased failed to materialize . Many violent differences of opinion between the various branches of the f ? ll-blood heirs were revealed upon the question of the appointment of administrators for the estate , and after nearly three hours of argument Judge E. P. Nobbs reserved his decision upon the appointment until to-morrow morning . Judge Nobbs made his position clear upon several paints to-day . In the first place . he required the attorneys to establish at least prima facie evidence of domicile . It had been agreed by the representatives of the half-blood heirs that no contention would be made against administrators nominated by the whole-blood faction . Judge Nobbs forced the lawyers to show their hand , however , by saying that it was necessary for him to make a finding upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resident of Connecticut . The lawyers were apparently disposed to be non-committal at first , but the Judge quietly waited , intimating that he would do nothing until this point was settlen . Finally . George W. Smith . the late ' Mr. Gilman 's personal friend and confidential employe , was put on the stand . Lawyer Styles Judson , Jr. , 1 a Bridgeport lawyer . representing the majority of the whole-blood heirs , then asked these questions : - Where was Mr. Gilman dwelling at the time of his . decease ? " " At Bieck Rock . " replied Mr. Smith . " How many years had he dwelt there ? " " About twenty-three . " Judge Nobbs said this satisfied him , ana the hearing proceeded . It was said afterward by several of the lawyers in the case that for all purroses in Connecticut this established the legal residence as having been in that State . This would deprive the half-blood heirs of any part of the estate located in Connecticut . It was prophesied as likely that the half-blood heirs would seek in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This . it was said , would provoke a clash between the two jurisdictions which might take the case to the United States Supreme Court before being : Fettled . LAWYERS RECOMMEND G. W. SMITH . The Probate Judge also decided that he would not appoint Edward L. Norton and Edward S. Percival administrators of the estate , as had been petitioned ? by . a little more than a majority of the interests involved . Judge Nobbs was just upon the point of appointing some other administrator , when Mr. Judson asked that the attorneys be allowed to consult and recommend some substitute . The Court permitted this . and the lawyers reported that they would ask that George W. Smith be appointed either by himself or to act with a trust company . In this consultation to recommend a substitute for Messrs . Norton and Percival , the attorneys for the heirs of Winthrop Gilman , a full brother of the deceased , and for Mrs Caroline McClellan , refused to join . In fact , these lawyers , on behalf of their clients , opposed every move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Norton and Percival interests . It is regarded by nearly all the lawyers interested that Judge Nobbs will appoint either the Bridgeport Trust Company or some independent individual resident in Connecticut as administrator . This disposition of the case is considered by the attorneys to be due more than anything else to the interposition of the Attorney General of Connecticut in the appointment of the administrators . In his address before the court Mr. Judson said concerning this action of the Attorney General : " I challenge contradiction of the statement that this is the first time in the history of Connecticut when the Attorney General of the State has interfered in the settlement of the personnel of administrators . I resent such interference . It is well enough for the State to Intervene when the question do domicile becomes an issue . n But it is of o legal interest to the State of Connecticut what person who shall he under legal bonds shall be appointed . " State 's Attorney W. W. Williams of New Haven . representing the Attorney General , said that it was very evident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who would look out for certain particular interests , and he thought the interests of the State of Connecticut were so great that the State had a right to appear there . and that the State recommended that either the Hartford or Bridgeport Trust Company be appointed to wind up the estate . Judge Nobbs , in his partial decision later , sustained the contention of the State of its right to appear as a party in interest . One surprise was sprung on the lawyers representing Edward L. Norton in the charge made by John J. Carr . representing the heirs of Winthrop Gilman. that the appointment of Edward L. Norton and Theophilus Gilman as New York administrators was a proceeding that had been " railroaded " by the petitioners through the Surrogates ' Court without notice to any.of the other heirs . Mr. Norton 's attorneys denied that there had been any " railroading. " but Mr. Carr refused to retract his charge , even when asked by the court if he would do so . A large crowd witnessed the proceedings to-day . The City Council Chamber was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawyers were present , and among the heirs in court were the three daughters of Winthrop Gilman . Mrs. Blakeley Hall was not In court , nor were her attorneys there to represent her . Lawyer Judson made an address opening the proceedings by urging that the Winthrop Gilman daughters were disqualified from administering the estate by reason of their being women . He urged that Norton and Percival be appointed , because they were capable and because their appointment was asked for by a majority interest of the heirs . OBJECT TO NORTON AND PERCIVAL . John J. Carr , representing the ' interests of the ' Winthrop Gilman daughters , opposed the appointment of Norton and ? Percival . He said that Percival was not a competent man , according to his information , and that Norton had shown a too great eagerness by his hasty action in getting appointed an administrator in New York . " All we want . " said Mr. Carr . " is some one to administer this estate who will do it for the benefit of all the heirs at law . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afraid that by him the estate would not be so administered . " James C. Cropsey was the next lawyer to object . He represented Mrs. Caroline McClellan , a sister of the deceased . He asked that some Connecticut individual be appointed . He argued that some of the heirs in this case were still in litigation among themselves , and that it would not be right to have some relatives appointed who might - work against the interests of others . Charles P. Haviland , as attorney for George James Percival , nephew of one of the nominees for administrator , objected also to the appointment of Norton and Percival . He wanted a resident of Connecticut who was not connected with any of the relatives . Sanford S. Gowdey of New York , a lawyer representing Alfred Gilman of Milwaukee , a son of Winthrop , said he did n't care who tIse was appointed , but that his client demanded to be one of the appointees . John J. Crawford of Brush &; Crawford , the lawyers for Mr. Norton , at this point was about to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ W. W. Williams arose . The fact that the State would interfere was evidently not expected by the attorneys . Mr. Williams safd that Mr. Norton was already an administrator in New York , and if he were appointed one in Connecticut , too , he might administer the whole estate in such a way as to be antagonistic to the domiciliary *interests . He hinted quite palpably that there was an alliance between . the whole-blood and half-blood heirs which the State of Connecticut should guard against very carefully . In response to the demand of Mr. Williams . Mr. Crawford then arose and said the heirs he represented were willing that George W. Smith should be made an administrator too , he being a resident of Connecticut and familiar with the business of the deceased . Mr. McCormack. of Ormiston &; McCormack , indorsed the nomination of Smith and urged that Percival be appointed . Attorney Carr urged that it was very strange that Mr. McCormack. who was the attorney for the half-blood relatives , should be here so strenuously urging the appointment of these administrators , who would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other clients . Mr. Williams again opposed the appointment of the nominees of the Brush and Norton faction . He said he hat made inquiries about Mr. Smith , and had learned that he was allied with the half-blood interests . Mr. Judson subsequently denied this allegation . Mr. Williams said the Attorney General had evidently made no mistake in wanting to be represented there because of the palpable alarm his being there had created . Judge Nobbs began to make his decision by affirming the right of the State to appear . He said this was an unusual case : that here was a determined resistance on the part of nearly half the heirs to the appointment of administrators recommended by the other half . He said he was forced to take notice of the contention that the interests of the nominees were antagonistic to the interests of the State of Connecticut . He therefore felt it necessary to exclude Norton and Percival from consideration . It was at this juncture that the lawyers asked for time to confer , with the result mentioned . NO BASIS FOR MRS . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enter to-day some claim for an interest in the adu inistration is regarded by the lawyers as a certain indication that she has no basis for ary sweeping claims , such as have been imputed to her . One of the lawyers prominent in the case said regarding her : " Mrs. Hall may now safely be dismissed from serious consideration . If she had a will she would have produced it before this . The matter of adoption is impossible , too . If she had a deed she would have produced that when Mr. Percival went to demand the custody of Black Rock . She has been simply putting up a big bluff . When the administrators arc appointed she will doubtless make some claim against the estate for services rendered , or something of that kind , but the idea of any substantial claim on her part for a large interest in the estate is now exploded . ' Mr. Crawford. discussing the relation of Mrs. Hall to the case , said that she need no longer be reckoned with . He said that as soon as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vacate Black Rock . she having no apparent right to rematin there . It was said at the Gilman homestead yesterday morning that Edward S. Percival , Frazier Gilman. and Mrs. Hall had had a conference Sunday right in New York . and that a full agreement with reference to the harmonizing of their intereS " ts was reached . If any such agreement was reached . in the opinion of those in close touch with the case , it was fractured by the various contentions made by the opposing interests in court to-day . MORE PAPERS REPORTED FOUND . It was reported here to-day that Edward S. Percival had found some important papers at Black Rock tending to establish certain mooted facts in this case definitely . It was asserted that these papers were responsible for the merged interests of Mrs. Hall and George W. Smith . No one would confirm this report authoritatively , however . The most important find of the day , in the opinion of the interested parties . was made by Raphael J. Moses . the attorney for Mrs : Garczynski , one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the record of a suit , adjudicated in 18115. entitled Gilman against Sawtell . It was a suit for a plot of land . In the complaint Gilman had declared that he had moved to Black Rock in 1870 with the intention of . ' acquirin- a residence there . The complaint was not sworn ' to , however , and it was pointed out by Mr. Moses that it conflicted with the affidavit of Mr. Gilman made in New York in 1S85 , when it was sought to require a heavy bond for him as his father 's ' executor , in which the tea merchant declared , that New York was iris home . Mrs. Potts . the mother of Mrs. Blakeley Hall . was seen at Black Rock to-night after the hearing in the Probate Court . Mrs. Hall herself was not there . Mrs. Potts said : " No matter what administrators are appointed . my daughter has a claim which she will assert at the proper time . She is not interested in the fight among the heirs . " Asked if Mrs. Hall would vacate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making preparations to do no such thing . The administrator will not seek to have her leave . " LINER 'S INJURED PASSENGERS . Some Hurt in the Explosion on the New York Sent to Hospital  --  Steerage Passenger 's Orphans . Dr. M. Victor Safford of the United States Naval Hospital Service yesterday examined on Ellis Island twenty immigrants who were injured by the explosion of ammonia aboard the American Line steamship New York , which arrived here on Sunday night and reported , besides the explosion , a broken port shaft . Some of the injured were found in a condition that necessitated their removal to the Long Island College Hospital . Rosa . Boch , a Russian baby of nine months , had bronchitis , thought to have been made serious by the ammonia vapors . Anna Boch , two and a half years old , was found suffering with inflammation of the eyelids . Bertha Boch , the mother  - -  Of the two , had bronchitis .

Walter is ten years old , Elsa eight . When the cabin passengers heard about Engkiest 's death , they subscribed . $450 , to be used for the three children . James A. Wright , Vice President or the International Navigation Company , said this money would probably be handled by the line . In answer to a question as to whether the line would do anything for the children , Mr. Wright said that his company was " inclined to be liberal in such cases . " Both he and Manager Clement A. Griscom , Jr. , said that the damaged steamship would be sent to Newport News for repairs .
