txt Lest the unwary or the unobservant should be taken in by the earnest conference of Republican members of the House in which it was decided that the Townsend Railroad Rate bill should pass , a few facts may be submitted to i candid world . Inasmuch as the Republicans have resolved and the Democrats are din-Dosed to pass the President 's bill giving the Inter-State Commerce Commission the power to fix railroad freight rates , it may be presumed that the Townsend measure , or one like it , will receive a majority vote in that Chamber and be sent up to the Senate . It twill then be in order for members of the House to send to their constituents marked copies of the roll call recording their votes in the affirmative . The country will applaud the virtuous members of the lower branch ; there , at ! east , are to be found friends of the plain people . It is at this point that the candid world should get its eye fixed upon the facts . One is , that before resolving to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the precaution to impeach Judge SIVAYNE and send his case before the Senate as the trial courtWith great presence of mind the date for beginning the trial was fixed , not yesterday , Feb. 4 , or to-morrow , Feb. 6 , as would have been the case had the distinguished legislators of the Nation been deeply concerned about the dis , patch of public business , but on Feb. 10. which falls upon a Friday . On Sat . urday and Sunday nothing will be done . Monday is a holiday . By Wednesday , the 15th , at the earliest , . the Senate will get to work on the case . ? Is anybody so foolish as to imagine that the Townsend Rate bill stands any chance of enactment , or even of discussion , while the minds of the Senators are preoccupied by their duties as a high court of impeachment ? Let us suppose that the Senate gets through with Judge &WAYNE,; say , in a week . With the intervening holiday on the 22d. that brings us to Thursday , the 23d , with eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In eight days , of course , the Senate could enact into law the Executive will as to railroad rates . Hardly . There is the Smoot case ambushed in a committee room . ready at any moment to be sprung upon the Senate as a matter of the first urgency . The Senate would be incapable of unseating one of its own members without a great deal of talk . If pressure is applied to the rate bill resistance will be offered by the Smoot case  --  provided the Swayne case does not adequately serve the intended obstructive purpose . There is another fact , in our judgment a fact of high significance . NELsox W. Awnicii , United States Senator from Rhode Island , sailed for Europe last Wednesday . A citizen of this Republic who would believe that Senator Au:mien would take ship and sail away if he felt that the risk of insur- ing the country against the passage of a rate bill in the Senate was not mere- ly nominal would believe anything . So , in spite of the deep tone of con.viction with which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of passing a rate bill in the House , in spite of the action of the Republican conference , we think all railroad Presidents of reasonably good digestion will continue to enjoy untroubled slumber o ' nights .
