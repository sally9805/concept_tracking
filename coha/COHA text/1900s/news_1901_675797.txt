txt Half a century or so has passed since Emerson reported his literary acquaintances in London as saying to him : " So long as you do not give us copyright , so long we shall have the teaching of you . " Nothing was further from the mind of atost or guest than that the time might come when the relative positions might be reversed and the Americans should have " the teaching " of the English . In simple fact , it has not come yet , and we see no chance of its coming . The literary sceptre has by no means passed , nor does it give any signs of passing . When , to speak only of the recently dead , the United States can produce in one generation , or at least as contemporaries , a Tennyson , a Ruskin , and a Stevenson we may begin to talk . But nevertheless the copyright law , scanty as it is , has already produced unexpected effects . One of them is recorded by the London correspondent of The New York Evening Post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bewails the hard fate of the British novelist , whom he calls " the British fictionist . " The poor man , he says , was first thrown out of a job by the South African war , which disinclined Britons to read about anything else , and then by the death of Queen Victoria . which set every Briton to reading about her . Now that he has recovered from these two interruptions of his audience , the British novelist finds himself confronted with American competition . Of thirteen new novels in one week the correspondent finds five are " of American origin . " and conjectures that 20 per cent . or so of the output of the last few months must be transatlantic . It is quite true , as we have more than once pointed out , that the successes of a season do not have anything necessarily to do with literature . And , moreover , most of the recent successes are evidently non-exportable . Take " David Haruin , ' ? for an example . There is a truth in the picture of manners which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows the manners . But there is no reason why it should interest any foreign reader , unless he be a student of sociology . The manners are not pretty nor is the picture beautiful . There can be no British circulation for a tale of that kind , and apparently not much more for a tale which makes its appeal to the atavistical instinct of Americans for their " side " of the story of the American colonies . But our huge public , our " market . " has attracted the interest and the cupidity of British writers and British publishers of fiction . The wisest publishers , in their generation , are those who have taken the precaution to plant a foot in each world . It is not true , according to the best of our observation , that literature of the English language is rapidly or markedly ceasing to be literature of the British Islands . At the same time , there are evident reasons why the British " fictionist " should visit the United States and inquire what manner of people these are who buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he must often be tempted to say , without any regard to their quality .
