PEDANTRY , " said an eminent prosewriter , " though it were unconscious pedantry , once steadily diffused through a nation as to . the very moulds of its thinking and the general tendencies of its expression , could not but stiffen the natural graces of composition and weave fetters about the free movements of human thought . " So wrote De Quincey in his " Essay on Style . " In these words he indicated the only serious peril which can menace a tongue , the users of which hold up before themselves high ideals of moral and intellectual excellence . So long as such continue to be cherished , no fear need be felt of any harmful consequences befalling the language from so-called corruptions which are always on the point of ruining it beyond redemption , according to the belief of those who possess little familiarity with the historic development of speech . In pedantic usage , however , there is a certain , though fortunately but a slight , degree of danger . Under its influence the disposition comes to prevail to set up artificial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look with disfavor upon what is idiomatic and natural when contrasted with what is formal and precise . In every community where the subject of usage comes up for discussion , a body of men can be found who are not content with perfect propriety . They are determined to have what may be called pluperfect propriety . This disposition takes frequently the form of preference for an affected precision which has all the disagreeableness of pedantry without being based upon the adequate knowledge which serves as a palliation of pedantry when it is not its justification . It inclines to the policy of restriction . It insists upon some particular construction not as being a proper C%II. ? Nur671. - 92 one , but as being the only proper one . It therefore attacks on the one side the employment of long-established idioms , often under the mistaken impression that they are of recent introduction . On the other side it manifests an uneasy hostility to any later modes of expression which the language has struck out or is striking out for itself . Out of the large number of illustrations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here the consideration of but two belonging to the first of these classes . These , however , are glaring instances of the pedantic stiffness which would sacrifice ease or variety of expression or idiomatic energy to the fancied requirements of formal grammar . The first of these two concerns itself with a very common idiom in our tongue , the use of the present tense of the verb for the future . One particular illustration of this there is which comes up pretty constantly for discussion . A person wishes on some given day , say , for instance , Saturday , to designate the day following . He ordinarily says , " Tomorrow is Sunday , " ? that is , he says so if he uses the language as if it belonged to him and not as if he belonged to it . If he chance to be in the company of one who is in the latter unhappy situation . he is not unlikely to be interrupted by some such remark as this " Pardon me , you should say , To-morrow will be Sunday . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examples usually adduced by scholars as an illustration of pedantic usage occasioned by imperfect linguistic training . Yet in spite of its commonness it does not strictly belong to the class of cases here under consideration . It is merely one of many instances where the idea of future time is conveyed not by the verb but by some other word or phrase in the sentence . In the example just given it is found in the subject lomorrow . If any person take exception to the expression , it is perfectly legitimate to ask him if the day specified be not Sunday , what day is it ? Important engagements will usually compel him to betake himself elsewhere before he finds time to answer . In all cases of the sort it is of course proper enough to use the future tense . Occasionally it may be necessary to do so , either for the sake of contrast , or of emphasis , or even of securing variety . But ordinarily its employment adds nothing to the clearness or force of what is sought to be said . It therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , the use of the present tense not only makes the idea just as distinct , it sometimes renders it far more effective . " Let us eat and drink , for to-morrow we die , " wrote Paul , arguing against those who denied immortality . Undoubtedly , " we shall die " would have expressed exactly what the apostle had in mind ; but it would not have given his words the vividness and energy they now have . But there are plenty of instances in our literature where the present tense is used independently , sometimes to express directly , sometimes to imply the idea of future time . The subject is too extensive to receive here little more than reference ; but the examples of the usage are frequently striking . When Othello threatens the brawling combatants at the court of guard that he who lifts his arm in further quarrel shall meet with immediate and condign punishment , be adds to the effectiveness of his speech by employing the present tense and not the future . " Ile dies upon his motion " are his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verb in the present tense indicating future time has sometimes been opposed in the same sentence to another verb in the present tense indicating present time . Take a short extract from Milton 's ode on the " Morning of Christ 's Nativity . " Contrast the future sense of is with the present sense of begins in the following lines : And then at last our bliss Full and perfect is , But now begins . This use of the present for the future , perhaps known in all languages ever spoken , has , however , a more than ordinary justification for itself in the class of languages to which English belongs . In these there were originally but two tenses . The present , therefore , indicated not only what was but what was to be . In the case of English it took several hundred years to develop fully the modern future . " Six days thou workest ; the seventh day thou restest , " says the Anglo-Saxon version of the Decalogue , literally translated . The verb-phrases , consisting of will and shall with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it was committed to writing . But so far from having then attained supremacy , they secured at first little more than recognition . It was a slow process that established them in general use . The encroachment of these special forms for the future upon the domain of the present must have brought sorrow to the linguistic conservatives among our early ancestors , so far as such persons then existed . But the protracted grief of centuries has long been forgotten , and the lesson conveyed by it is unheeded . There are those of us , in consequence , who are now insisting not merely upon the further extension but upon the exclusive sway of a usage which some of their forefathers doubtless deplored as a corruption . But of all these assaults upon idiom made in behalf of pedantry , the most vociferous is the one directed against the construction in which the passive voice is followed by en object . Certainly there is none which involves completer ignorance of the best usage or more absolute defiance of the authority of the great writers of our speech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English . It is found in Latin , more frequently in Greek . No student of the former tongue needs to be told that verbs of asking and teaching in the active voice govern two accusatives ; and that in the passive these same verbs can be followed also by one of these two accusatives . It is in English , however , that this sort of construction has undergone a development so full that it has come to partake almost of the nature of a special idiom . A noun as object follows the tenses of the passive voice or the passive participle in the ease of no small number of verbs . The usage has never been made the subject of exhaustive investigation , especially as regards the early periods of the language . But about its later history and its increasing frequency in later times very positive statements can be safely made . While so common now , the construction does not seem to have been known to our tongue in its earliest form . No example of it occurs ? I speak subject to correction ? in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the language as early as the end of the twelfth century . During the three or four centuries following it was seemingly but little used , though the fact that but few traces of it have been found , or at least have been recorded , may be duo to the further fact that they have not been diligently sought for . It is enough here to prove its early existence by citing two or three illustrative passages , the spelling of which is here modernized . " I found Jesus bound , scourged , given gall to drink , " says Richard Rolle de Hampole . " The merchant was paid thirty pounds fine , " is the statement made in the metrical romance of " Sir Amadas . " " Fie I the tales that I have been told , " is the speech of one of the characters in the " Coventry Mysteries . " It is not worth while , however , to linger over the occurrence of this eonstruation in writers whose names , even if known , would carry no weight . The examples given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are not of sufficient consequence to establish its authority . Let us pass on to the sixteenth century . By the end of it the idiom was flourishing in full vigor . From that day to the present its employment has not only been frequent , it has become increasingly frequent with the progress of time . Still , from the very nature of things the construction is limited to a comparatively small class of verbs . In one sense , therefore , it can never be exceedingly common . It may be that it was for this reason that for a long time it seems to have escaped the attention of grammarians . It was not , indeed , till the latter part of the eighteenth century that notice seems to have been taken of it . It was during that century that men became linguistically self-conscious on a large scale . It was then they began to feel resting upon them the burden of preserving the speech in its so-called purity . Naturally , a construction of this sort would arrest their attention . It was opposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they called anomalous . Still , it unquestionably had abundant authority in its favor in the books men daily read and in the speech of those they met . The attitude of grammarians towards it therefore varied widely . Many continued to ignore it , either because they did not remark it or because they did not know what to say about it . A few accepted it with apparent approval . Most , however , looked at it askance , even when they refrained from condemning it . The more intelligent of this last-named class , daunted by the frequency with which the construction was found in the best writers , submitted sometimes meekly , sometimes grumblingly , to the condonement of this grammatical offence . That there were authors so linguistically depraved as to employ the construction was , indeed , something to be deplored . But these were so many and so great that the censors of speech , while they lied the desire , did not have the courage to condemn . But no small number of grammarians stood up stoutly against the usage . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they deemed grammatical purity , must be preserved , no matter how much expression suffered . Two or three representatives of these classes may be cited to illustrate the views just described . Noah Webster in his Philosophical Grammar mentioned the usage . One of the examples he quoted was taken from Blackstone 's Commentaries . " The bishops and abbots were allowed seats in the House of Lords , " said the great jurist . Webster observed that the true construction would be , " Seats in the House of Lords were allowed to the bishops and abbots . " But he clearly took a despairing view of the possibility of effecting any reformation . The comment he made upon the examples he cited of the practice reveals his state of mind . " The idiom , " he wrote , " is outrageously anomalous , but perhaps incorrigible . " Later Lindley Murray considered the usage . He borrowed Webster 's examples and reechoed his sentiments . But the construction was itself too much for the grammarian . It requires , indeed , painful and protracted vigilance on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the use of an idiom so common , so convenient , and supported by authority so abundant and so great . Murray , in consequence , was apt to resort unconsciously to a practice which in theory he condemned . The lapses he made from linguistic virtue brought infinite satisfaction to a grammarian who flourished in this country about the middle of the nineteenth century . This man was Goold Brown . He published in 1848 a bulky volume entitled the Grammar of English Grammars . It is not of so much value for what it directly teaches as for the estimate it indirectly leads us to set upon works of this nature . It abounded in examples of errors or assumed errors in the use of speech . They were gathered in the largo majority of instances not from the classic writers of the language , but from the works of grammarians . These persons , Brown assured us , were misleading the schools . It was his delight to point out and to exemplify the various blunders they committed and the false doctrines they inculcated . Lindley Murray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he , for that reason apparently , exhibited special rancor . There is scarcely one of his collections of passages containing real or assumed errors of speech in which this grammatical hero of former generations does not figure as a conspicuous offender against some principle of grammar . Brown himself never doubted in the slightest his own knowledge both of what was and what was not correct English . A passive verb followed by an object was a construction which stirred his soul to the depths . He was not in the least disposed to follow the pusillanimous course of those grammarians who were inclined to put up with it as a necessary concession to man 's grammatical hardness of heart . Not for an instant would hetamper with the unclean thing . He took Webster to task for his faint-heartedness . He quoted his despondent remark already given as having been written " with too little faith in the corrective power of grammar . " The betrayal of his principles which Lindley Murray had disclosed in his practice naturally called for severe comment . " We too , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forming our own laws . " In this sentence , which Brown cited as a specimen of false syntax , his predecessor had uttered a great truth about his own language without being aware of the extent of its application . These fulminations against the idiom have had as little weight with the great authors of the present as they would have had with the great authors of the past , had the latter been called upon to encounter them . The antiquity of the construction has been shown by examples . It is now worth while to show its universality . Here , accordingly , will be given a few examples of the usage taken from the greatest authors of our literature from the and of the sixteenth century to the present day . Out of the mighty mass of illustrations at disposal the choice ? has been dictated largely- by the demand for brevity , but even more by the desire to represent the employment of as many different verbs as possible . As , however , two or three of these have served as subjects of frequent censure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of instances of their use .

Otherwise it would be a satisfaction to fill scores of pages with further illustrations of this idiom , drawn not merely from the authors already cited , but from writers of every kind and grade of achievement during every period of modern English literature . No construction is more firmly established in our language than this . It is on the whole commoner in prose than in poetry . It is more common in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance , in Shakespeare and Milton : it is rare in Spenser and Bacon . It is frequent in Browning : it is rare in Tennyson . But it is found in all , as well as in all sorts of productions . Furthermore , its employment seems to have been on the increase since the sixteenth century . It has assuredly never been more used than in the middle and latter half of the century which has just closed . From the authors who flourished during this period ? intentionally excluding those now living ? examples can be drawn from the writings of Disraeli , Bulwer , Dickens , Thackeray , Charles Kingsley , Hawthorne , Trollope , Stevenson ; from those of Mrs. Browning , Charlotte Bront6 , George Eliot ; from those of Washington Irving , Carlyle , Emerson , Cardinal Newman , Walter Savage Landor , Lowell , Ruskin , Fronde , Matthew Arnold ? in fine , from the writings of every author worth reading . The antiquity and universality of the idiom is one thing ; its origin is quite another . In the comparatively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ syntax he is treading upon insecure ground who now attempts to set forth the precise cause which led to the introduction into our speech of an idiom which did not belong to it originally . But three agencies in particular have contributed to its prevalence . There is first the combination , so common in English , of a verb with the substantive it governs , gaining thereby a special meaning allied to the substantive . This compound phrase is usually , though not invariably , followed by a preposition . Thus we can say indifferently to notice , or to take notice of . No one would feel any hesitation about using the construction , " he was noticed . " But by so doing he is led almost inevitably to employ the equivalent passive construction , " he was taken nutice of . " It is worthy of remark , as regards the origin of the idiom under discussion , that the first example of it which has been adduced ? the first , at least , of which I am aware ? is an expression belonging to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirteenth century " they are let blood " occurs in Layamon . Another agency which has contributed to the prevalence of the usage is the not uncommon fact that a verb followed by a preposition is often equivalent in sense to a simple verb . To present with , for illustration , conveys a meaning not essentially different from to give . Such a sentence as " The boy was presented with a book " would bring no protest from the sternest of grammarians . But so long as such expressions are in use , it is asking too much of human nature to expect that the equivalent given will not be substituted for presented with . In that case the passive followed by an object has descended upon ua in all its assumed horribleness . But the main agency in bringing about the wide extension of the usage is something quite different . The construction in question belongs primarily to a verb which in the active voice governs two accusatives , the one of a person , the other of a thing . But it so happens that early in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the accusative , originally separate , were melted into the one we call the objective . When the distinction between the two appealed no longer to the eye or the ear , it was sure , in the case of most men , not to appeal long to the mind . In such a sentence as " They paid the man twenty pounds , " the verb seemed to the popular apprehension to govern two accusatives . Consequently , when the passive construction was employed , the original dative of the person , conceived of as an accusative , became the subject of the verb , while the actual accusative remained as its object . Accordingly , the sentence assumed the form , " The man was paid twenty pounds . " This particular kind of usage did more than establish itself ; it gained strength and expansion in various ways , into the details of which there is no room to enter here . But whatever may be the origin of the idiom , there is no more question as to its legitimacy than there is as to its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compelled to employ it . With the exercise of sedulous care and at the expense of much tribulation of spirit it can always be avoided . Every man has the fullest liberty to indulge in any sort of linguistic asceticism under the illusion that he is setting an example of linguistic holiness . It is only when he insists that others can not be pure without accepting his notions of purity that he becomes objectionable . It is not particularly creditable to the English-speaking race that at this late day any necessity should exist of defending a construction like the one under consideration . Here is an idiom which has been in use for more than six centuries . For the last three of these it has been in use by every writer whom we regard as an authority . It is , furthermore , an idiom which adds ' facility and variety to expression , and thereby increases the resources of the language . No more preposterous proposition was ever advanced in the history of . any cultivated tongue than that all men should deliberately abandon a construction now embodied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it offends the linguistic sensibilities of some men who have studied grammar without studying the literature upon which any grammar entitled to consideration is based . It is said that there are newspaper offices in this country where this construction is strictly tabooed . Were this true of all , as it may be of some , there would he a certain justification for a common but essentially absurd charge that the press is doing all it can to ruin the language . No anxiety , however , about the success of such an undertaking could be entertained by any one who has made himself familiar with the history and development of speech . The futility of the attempt would be more conspicuous even than its fatuity . Yet efforts directed to the accomplishment of this impossible task will without doubt always continue to be put forth by a certain class of verbal critics who can never free themselves from the impression that man was made for language and not language for man .                  @ @ @
