She made known her secret yesterday in suits filed here and in Hartford , Conn. , in which she claims the entire estate of the deceased . When Gilman died , Mrs. Hall stated that he had left his estate to her . No will was found , however , and there was great speculation as to the basis of her claim . She would not tell . She allowed administrators to be appointed here and in Connecticut without protest . Lawyers for the relatives said her claim was all " bluff . " Now she has told her secret . Her claim is based , in short , upon the following allegation : That George Francis Gilman had great personal regard for her , and that on Nov. 1 , 1900 , he entered into an agreement with her according to which if she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inherit all his property . She says that she fulfilled her part of the agreement . The lawyers for the numerous heirs , fullblood and half-blood , were not aware until late yesterday afternoon of the nature of Mrs. Hall 's claim upon the estate . Her move did not find the heirs unprepared , however , for they say they had been expecting something of this kind , and are ready to push the matter to the bitter end . The heirs will file an early answer to Mrs. Hall 's suit , and they will demand that the case be heard with exceeding dispatch . Mrs. Hall 's suit has had the further a feet of bringing all the heirs togethe . Notwithstanding the disputes the application for administrators in Connecticut brought about , the heirs , both full blood and half blood , had agreed before yesterday that in the event of any suit being brought by Mrs. Hall , they would all combine to fight it . It was said yesterday by one of the lawyers interested , that attorneys for all the heirs have been in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are in full accord in what they do now . MRS . HALL ASKS FOR AN INJUNCTION . In the suit brought in. the New York Supreme Court , Mrs. Hall , through her attorneys , Hatch &; Wickes , seeks to enjoin the Bridgeport Trust Company , as administrator %of the Connecticut estate , and the heirs-at-law and next of kin of Mr. Gilman , from interfering with George H. Hartford in his management of the busi.ness of the Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company , from which Mr. Gilman realized his vast fortune . Mrs. Hall asks the court to ' , enjoin both the Connecticut and New York administrators of the estate from interferes ing with it in any way , except so far as it may be-nerasSary ' to use it ... tri payment of ' debts and Other lawful expenses . ' The tea busihess , Mrs. ? gall says , was conducted in twenty different . States. , and comprised over 200 stores ih alt of which the late Mr. Gilman , in co-partnership with . Mr. Hartford , carried on the business . This part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been understood that the Bridgeport Trust Company , - as administrator ; takes the position that Mr. Hartford was manager only . and not a part , ? owner in the tea business . ' Mrs. Hall , in setting forth the reason why she , claims she is entitled to share in Mr. Gilman 's estate , alleges that for several years prior to his death , " He , having conceived a strong personal regard for this plaintiff , and being desirous that she should become a member of his household , adopted this plaintiff as his daughter , and did . make her a member of his- household , and thereafter , until the . time of his death , plaintiff resided with him  - -  as his daughter , receiving from him the care , support , and affection of a father , managing his household , and rendering to him the same obedience and affection as if she had been his natural daughter . " In consideration of her services and affection , she avers , and as an inducement for her to render , the same as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and valuable consideration , Mr. Gilman. on Nov. 1 . 1900 , entered into an agreement with her that if she should continue to live with him and care for him as a daughter until the time of his death , she should have and be entitled to all his property , both real and personal , as fully and to the same extent as if she were his sole lawful issue . " SAYS SHE LIVED UP TO IT . Mrs. Hall says she at all times lived up to this agreement , " according to the true intent thereof , abandoning for such purpose , and upon the wish and desire of said Gilman , all other prospects in life , and devoting herself solely to his care , welfare , and happiness , as a daughter should . " That the considerations and services so rendered by plaintiff were . as she Verily believes , of great value and benefit to the said George P. Gilman , and were so appreciated and regarded by him , and were no less than would have been rendered by a dadg-hter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they can not be readily measured , and are not capable of exact ascertainment or valuation . Mrs. Hall says none of Mr. Gilman 's relatives lived on terms of intimacy or cordiality with him , but had for many years been estranged from ' him , and many of them were bitterly hostile to him . She says that relatives of Mr. Gilman instituted litigation against him arising out of his father 's estate , which caused an estrangement between him ' and them for many years before his death . Mrs. Hall alludes to the appointment of Theophilus Gilman and Edward L. Norton as temporary , administators in this State , and says that the proceedings in the Surrogate 's Court here were taken without notice to her . She then deals with the probate proceedings in Connecticut , and claims that the appointment of the Bridgeport Trust Company as administrator in Connecticut wad improper and-illegal . The appeal , however , can not be heard , she says , for a considerable time , and a final decision could only be reached after long and expensive ligitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Gilman 's estate . Mrs. Hall adds that it la immaterial to determine the question of the legality of the probate proceedings as in view of her agreement with Mr.- Gilman all his estate belongs to her , and the contest will unnecessarily waste the estate and irreparably damage her . HER ATTORNEY NON-COMMITTAL. - Edward S. Hatch of Hatch &; Wickes , Mrs. Hall 's attorneys , was asked last night if he would make known the nature of the evidence upon which Mrs. Hall would rely to prove the agreement between herself and Gilman . " I do not care to say whether it was a verbal or a written agreement , " replied Mr. Hatch . If . Mrs. Hall was entitled to the whole estate , why did she not ask that her interests be respected in the appointment of administrators in Connecticut ? " Mr. Hatch was further asked . ' " Because it would not have been proper to do so , " he answered . - Mr. Hatch further refused to disclose the legal ' steps he proposed taking to enforce Mrs. Hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say why - he had waited so long 10 make known the basis of his client 's claim : Charles H. Brush , attorney for Edward L. Norton , one of the New York administrators , and by general consent the representative* of the heirs at large , said last night to a NEW YORK TIMES reporter that he was glad Mrs. Hall had made known her secret , for the heirs would ; low know what to count on . " I doubt very much , " continued Mr. Brush , ? if , granting that there was such an agreement duly made between Mrs. Hall and Mr. Gilman , it would be valid . And I doubt very much more if any written or legal agreement was ever entered into between them . " We shall fight this suit , of course . We shall demand the earliest practicable trial . I hope the case can be brought to a hearing-within the next month . We do not propose to let the settlement of this estate be tied up by any such claim as this . The heirs are in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no disposition on the part of any of them to interfere with one another in this proceeding . " THE HEIRS WILL FIGHT . It was learned yesterday that while the heirs are agreed in their determination to fight-Mrs . Hall , they are not agreed upon two essential points . Part of the full-blood heirs are determined to take every measure to oust the Bridgeport Trust Company from the administratorship of the estate and have appointed one of the heirs . The other full-blood relatives are equally determined to back up the Probate Court in that appointment . The half-blood heirs have not surrendered their claim that George Francis Gilman was a resident of New York . When the time comes , said one of the law ' - *rs yesterday , they will seek to prove nis New York domicile . The full-blood heirs , likewise , will attempt to establish a Connecticut domicile . The action of Mrs. Hall in refusing to appear in the administrator ? proceedings was explained by a lawyer yesterday to have this probable significance . Had she claimed the estate before the Probate Court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her claim . If it had been granted , she would have had thrown upon her all the tea stores and the remainder of this great property in such a condition that she could not get any sort of value for it . If administrators were appointed , on the other hand , they would turn as much of the estate as possible into cash , and it would be settled up in such a way that she would get the greatest possible value out of it . If she had made her claim and the appointment of administrators had been delayed until any controversy upon the subject should be settled , it was explained that the estate would have suffered very materially , to the detriment of all parties in interest . As the case now stands , Mrs. Hall can sue the administrators for the possession of the estate , and be herself saved all the bother of looking after it . She has placed herself in a position to demand that no money be paid to ny of the heirs until her claim is judicataed .
