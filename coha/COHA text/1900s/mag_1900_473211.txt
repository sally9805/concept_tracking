IT is a theory in our family that discipline is a maternal function . It found expression the other night when we were playing whist . As we cut for a new deal the clock struck eight , and eight o'clock still being bedtime in our family , all three children furtively looked around at their mother , who lay on the sofa with her eyes closed . Then it was that one of the family maxims first clothed itself in language . Some one said , softly , " Let a sleeping mother lie ! " and the new deal proceeded . We have realized the existence of that ? maxim for years past , and lived up to it so far as it promoted our own comfort . It would be a good deal more to our credit if we had practised it more thoroughly and unselfishly . Unhappily the sleeping mother in our abode lies undisturbed just about so long as it better suits the aims and purposes of the younger members of the family to let her rest . When Jaquoline wants to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blandina beyond the very moderate limits of her patience , Blaudina retorts with due outcries , and if Discipline happens to be dozing. it has to rouse itself and supervene . How fierce it is ! How excoriating in censure ! How adamantine in injunction ! Oh , a real lion ! ? lo the claws and the tawny mane and terrifying eyes ! Nothing less could reduce Jonas 's vociferous defence to tearful and somewhat injured meekness , and drive Blandina to the sugar-bowl for solace , and make Jaqueline careless for the moment whether she knew or not . Pnnr children , to be caged with so fierce a creature ! And yet they are fairly efficient tamers . Look at them all , in the same cage , half an huur later . What ! That a lion that they are all sitting on at once ? That creature fierce ? That a tawny mane ? No , no A fleece , a woolly fleece ; and yet ? odd Phenomenon ? the cre ? Ature does n't bleat , ' , ne pure . Aknost any kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a liar . If we are exceptionally commendable persons , as people go , so much the better for our children , for like not only breeds like but trains like , and " good father , good child , " is a fairly reliable rule , though " good mother , good child , " is a somewhat surer one .. But even if we are not notably exemplary we may hope to get along as parents if only we are honest . We may as well make up our minds in the first place that in so far as we are reproduced in our children , and in so far as we influence them , it is what we really are that is reproduced and that has influence , and not what we pretend to be . Judicious grafting and training do some curi-ous feats . Families of figs ? somewhat prickly , but still figs ? are sometimes raised from what seems thistle stock- In such cases it will be found that there was more fig in the stock than appeared , or else that the young shoots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or else that , the parent thistles themselves yearned sincerely to be figs , and tried to , and transmitted their aspirations and the fruits of their efforts . But parents who are - thistles at heart , and in intention and practice , wo n't raise figs merely by cloaking their truer inwardness with occasional fig leaves . Like begets like . Gentleness is not induced by stormy exhortation , nor manners by precept alone . Conduct in children is the resultant of various forces 41f training , instinct , and imitation , and of the three the last is not the least . Every parent who al-lows himself the luxury of his children 's society may expect to be imi-tated in such measure as each child approves . Such imitation is a form of obedience , even though it may accord very imperfectly with the word of the paternal com-mand . When I set Jo-nas an example , I Count with fair confidence on his appreciation of it . He will imitate me , not perhaps in my ex-emplary action , but in setting an example . He will set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the example he sets will bear about the same relation to the general Line of conduct which his fallen nature prompts as the example I set does to mine . That is why I do not hold very closely to the Sunday-school in-junction to set good examples . With fair-ly clever children it can not he trusted to work well . Their instinct of imitation is too quick and thorough . Unconsciously they pick up the parental hypocrisies and adopt them , and pass them along . I do n't pretend not to subject myself to some rea-sonable restraints of conduct on account of Jonas and his sisters . They are all , for example , so intelligently critical as to quality in food that I try to restrain , when they are at the tabie , a propensity to grieve audibly if the plates are not hot or the soup lacks flavor . Even if Jonas feels as I do about hot plates and tasteless soup , 1 trust he will imitate my exemplary self restraint , which is really too imperfect as yet to be more than moderately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my faults , for he has an intelligence of his own , and discriminates , but I do expect him to diecern and realize them . Many of them , with his mother 's help , he has already been able to appreciate as faults , and 1 am glad to say that the more I fall into them , the more deplorable they seem to him , and the less inclined he is to adopt them . That propensity which I have of being a little behind the stroke of the clock , of which all the family ? under maternal tuition have come into so vivid and constant an appreciation , is really likely to be a blessing to Jonas , for he is by nature inclined that way himself , and observation of the ignominy and suffering that procrastination and dilatoriness bring upon me has strengthened a good deal in him the purpose to thwart his natural leaning towards these evils . So in the matter of the practice I follow occasionally of adding a suggestion of spirits to my water at dinner . I am not sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He has a sensitive throat , and one of the finest natural gifts of abstemiousness I ever saw . I am somewhat less gifted in that particular than he , and he watches my potations with mathematical attention , insisting , when I get more than two table-spoonfuls of whiskey at one sitting . that I am on the downward grade , and likely to come to grief . On the whole it is probably more advantageous to Jonas that he should feel anxiety about my drinking habits than that I should be anxious about his . If I should set him an example by never drinking whiskey in his presence , I would deprive myself of the benefit of his AS . valuable warnings , and he would lose whatever advantage there is for him in observing how little . spirits a man may consume without becoming a teetotaler . What the parental example should re be in this matter of drink is a good deal mooted . I trust my course may be blessed to Jonas , and if it is n't I shall be disappointed . At any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ didactically exemplary would be better , for some of the most deplorably thirsty persons I have ever grieved over have been the offspring of parents who were aggressively abstinent . One of the comforting experiences that come to parents when they see the blemishes in their own deportment cropping out in their children is that their redeeming features may also be repro duced . Each of us must be conscious of tendencies in himself wind ' , if they had full swing , would take us to the poor-PARENTS. 21 house or worse , or at least bring us into disfavor with society . The reason they have n't wrecked us is that counter-tendencies , and obstinate compunctions that would not be denied , have existed along with them . My hopes fur the future usefulness of Jonas are largely based on the activity of his compunctions . He responds to appeal , and if he is somewhat impatient of direction in matters of detail , he has fairly lucid ideas of his own about what it is expedient to accomplish , and how . The swift succession of his aspirations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love before he seems fully justified in abandoning the old , would cause me more misgiving if I could not hope it was based on a rather unusual faculty for getting the available meat off most bones in exceptionally short time . If Jonas is to become a compendium of superficial and inaccurate knowledge ? jack of all sciences , and master of none ? it will truly be rather a sore fate , and he may never make as good a living as I hope he will . But after all ? he is growing up in a generation whose specialty promises to be the development of specialists , and perhaps a lad who reads a hundred different books in a hundred days , and has fifty violent interests annually in as many forms of amusement , will be pinned down soon enough to a duminant occupation . If Jonas is discursive , he is also energetic and aspiring , and by no means content to be satisfied with second best if his powers of attainment can readily do better . After al ! there are a lot of things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good many of them a taste is enough . Moreover , it is by tasting and subsequent comparisons that the eventual preference which we call taste is developed . I hear it suggested in the family that Jaqueline has no natural manners ; that the instincts of grace are not as ready in her as they might be ; that her communications tend to brusqueness ; that her salutations are somewhat short and careless ; and that when she condescends to blandishments they incline to be overwhelming . Nevertheless , there has never been any doubt in the family about the expediency of raising Jaqueline . She lives in a measure behind defences , but they are worth passing . If she is in any wise deficient in her courtesies to her own species she makes up for it in lavishing ' attentions on dogs , cats , rabbits , squirrels , and horses . If she is somewhat chary of letting her affections go out overmuch , I suspect it is the protecting instinct that guards a nature that does nothing by halves . No- member of our family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us loves clothes so much , or has such positive notions of the fashion of them ; none of us has more advanced opinions about trimming hats , or deeper convictions about dressing hair . Curls are satisfactory to Jaqueline ; braids are not . None of us is so obstinate in her detestations as she , or so candid in expressing them . Her likes and dislikes are serious matters . Just at this writing she is raising green shoots from an onion in a glass of water in the library window . It is a trial to the family . We all wish she were less attached to the onion , which is not handsome nor sweet-smelling , but Jaqueline 's griefs are too heart-rending and too impervious to solace to be lightly incurred . It is quite well understood in the family by what inheritance she happened to he its most shy , erratic , helpful , and in some respects reliable member . She has in herself , more obviously than most of us , a warring community , whereof antagonistic members strive pretty constantly for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , for she is equal to every conflict , even that which rages daily between her fatal gift of beauty and her contempt for soap . Children are unquestionably useful to parents . So , as a rule , are parents to children . To be sure , some babies are raised on bottles , colic notwithstanding , and some children cared for in institutions grow up to strength and usefulness . But persons who know most about institutions ? even some of those who have the must to do with managing them ? are agreed that it is distinctly to the advantage of children whose parents are at all tolerable to worry along with them . The use of mothers , particularly in early life , is rather more obvious than that of fathers . Children must be fed , clothed , washed , scolded , kissed ; manners must be taught them ; medicine must be put in or kept out of them ; their health must be watched ; they must be kept in or sent out judiciously , and presently their education must be seen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Fathers are consulted at times on such questions as what doctor or which school . In a good many families an appeal lies to the father in difficult eases of discipline . Fathers sympathize , advise , spoil , and pro vide , but it is remarkable how much a normal father , who has stood over the raising of several children , can manage not to know about the details of it . He may be a fair judge of results , and really an important contributor to the happiness of his family , but unless he happens to be a doctor , what is his opinion worth about foods and their qualities , times , and amounts , nr about what weight of clothing a given child needs by day , and what by night ? Is the average father of any real use when a child is sick , except to amuse it , to encourage the mother , and to go on errands I The primary duty of the father of a young family is to go out daily and get an adequate supply of money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is considered that he has done well , and great , verily , is his reward . The other details of management fall to the mother . Now mothering is a complicated matter , and to be good at it is a very pretty gift , and one not always as closely allied with other abilities as one might expect . Some good women are pretty bad mothers , and some women that are not nearly so exemplary are good ones . Some obtuse women are good at raising children , and some very clever women are no better at it than institutions . There seems to be a good deal of animal instinct and animal capacity about it ; and yet there is the same difference in various animals . I was never so much impressed with the difference in mothers as in viewing a collection of families of pngdogs . " Here 's a good mother , " said their owner . " She always raises most of her puppies . That one 's a poor mother . Hers are apt to come to grief . " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talent for taking care of puppies and inducing them to grow up , and others had n't . So it is with women . Mother-sense is a subtle matter . Some women lack it who have the most admirable theories shout raising children , and the most outspoken views as to the errors and PARENTS . 23 delinquencies of other mothers . Therefore , when you are looking for it , if you want to be particularly sagacious , look not at the mother , but at the children . The proof of the mothering lies in them ; but even that is not infallible , for sometimes a good deputy does wonders . The apparent severity of some mothers has scandalized me a good deal . Their household laws are so Draconian , and the enforcement of them secuis so relentless , that at times I am torn with sympathy for the children . But children seem to judge the maternal tree more by its fruit than its bark , and they have their compensations in kind . You usually find that the children of vociferous mothers talk hack . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You may see soft-voiced women maintaining an easy but very effective discipline in their families by very gentle means . Fathers , too , have their uses in families , uses besides that of providing . They are not so indispensable as mothers , but even in cases where the wage-earning usefulness of the father is not of vital moment , getting along without a father seems no better than a making the best of things which are not as they ought to be . Under present conditions in this world we seem to need practising fathers up to the age of twenty-five or thirty , and consulting fathers for an indefinite space beyond that . It is remarkable over what a protracted period a proficient father who keeps himself in fairly good order can continue to be useful and generally popular in a family . Fathers who are unduly modest and disposed to underestimate their domestic value may often draw conclusions flattering to themselves from what they observe of the experience of fatherless families , and especially of fatherless boys . indeed , it is - universally admitted that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are few that are competent , or seem so , on whom outside jobs of fathering are not pressed . Undoubtedly it is the duty of every father to do what he can to supplement the schoolmasters , doctors , ministers , and others on whom the protection and guidance of the fatherless devolve . There is solace and reassurance for all parents in the thought of the large charity of children , and the allowances they make for their parents ' errors . Walking a chalk line and posturing as a model of conduct is not easy oven for a grown-up person . Parents who entertain the theory that it is their province always to appear to their children the embodiment of abstract right , cut out hard lines for themselves , and entertain ambitions doubtful in value , ' and still more doubtful of realization . Being- godlike is a condition that doubtless has its justifications , but being tin-god-like yields neither sport nor emoluments . Much safer is the state of the erring parent who tries to shape his conduct so that it will bear reasonable scrutiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's love to make them tolerant of his defects . After all , love is the most indispensable element in the relation between parent and child . It is lucky it is so common , for raising families without it is hard work and ill done . The great detail in which parents most excel institutions in bringing up children is that they love them more .
