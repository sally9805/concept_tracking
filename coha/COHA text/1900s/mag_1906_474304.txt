UR little bird , garbed in olive tints , with golden - gray breast , wings and tail feathers touched with scarlet to make her gay , located her first nest in our vicinity five years ago . This first nest I was able to secure in the early summer , and a bird 's nest is an ever-varying marvel , each year differing in its construction , even though the same material may be used . This first one , however , was but the precursor of better things to come . A new era had arrived , and an esthetic sense was being de ! veloped in my lady . The nest had been placed in the most secure nook imaginable , just under the overhanging eaves . The roof was so thickly draped with vines , neither sun nor rain could discommode the little Hausmutter as she brooded her young . Usually the cardinal makes her nest loosely , hut , watching the robins and orioles busily gathering up strings , this one grew covetous , and came herself to the grape arbor , daintily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found them twisted into one side of the nest . The next year we found her again picking at the revellings of the rags we had torn into strips for the other birds , and , understanding at once her desire for liner material , we hastened to hang in cobwebby festoons upon the trellis a few yards of spool cotton cut into lengths . Hardly waiting for us to leave them , she flew down , and in the most dainty , careful way drew out one at a time , not taking greedy mouthfuls as robins do , and carried it off to her nest , the long thread trailing through the air behind her as she went . Her delight was evident , and she worked all the morning , cheered and encouraged by her beattiftd , ' but lazy , spouse , who whistled his loudest in approbation . Our first intimation that the young birds were hatched came in the tiny ehirpings we heard ? " zip , " " zip , " exactly like the note of the old ones , only much softer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the locality of the previous year , showed us , some two weeks later , three dove-colored young ones . That very evening the mother bird warned them to fly , probably fearing depredations from us ; but we were fortunate enough to find one of them fluttering in the grass , And were surprised to discover all its plumage of a warm dove color . Spreading out the wings of the little bird , each quill showed a rosy tint , and beneath the wing , also , was a promise of the brilliant garb they would put on when baby days were over . Until the cardinals are nearly grown , the two sexes are very similar in coloring . After shifting all responsibility for the young birds on to their own inexperienced shoulders , the old ones began a second nest . The first neat we then captured , to find it truly up-to-date , tailor-made . The second nest showed very little until the falling of the leaves , but the locality was an open secret , for the male bird roosted in the thick vines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his singing , no one was at a loss to tell the whereabouts of his home . This bird had , and lies , the most astonishing voice I ever heard , and it did seem that summer as if even the birds themselves stopped to listen when he sang at twilight . One by one their voices dropped away as , just when the stars came twinkling out each evening , he flew to the highest tree-top in our garden and poured out his heavenly notes . The purity of tone it is impossible to describe , and his wonderful range and flexibility of voice I have never heard equalled in any bird . The vesper song , even . ( lid not satisfy his soul , and often when a light shone from our window across the vine where he slept , at ten or eleven o'clock at night , he suddenly awakened and began to sing . Out into the stillness of the night he flung the exquisite sweetness of his song . His first note was always very high , then a slide down one octave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trilling , perfect bubbles of music , and a run from low C up to B flat and C , in endless repetition , until , breathless and sleepy , he must perforce give over the concert until dawn . But repeatedly subdued halftones came out from among the leaves , as if he were hardly yet persuaded that the lamplight was not some new kind of sunrising . The next year , on a May-day morning , we , sitting under the branches of a mapletree , suddenly noticed a cardinal bird diligently bustling about under the hedgerow . She looked at us , then flirted the leaves about in a tremendous " pother " ; pulled bark fibres , filling her mouth with material , then tossing it recklessly away ; slipping up and down through the hedge , incessantly calling out , " Chip , " " Chip , " and flying ostentatiously into the maple above our heads , deporting herself in a manner that plainly betokened a wish for somebody to interest himself in her affairs . Naturally , we were the ones she had in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , as I idly watched , it gradually dawned upon me she must be the last year 's tenant of our garden , and , remembering old favors , was bidding for new , and I hastily ran into the house for some thread with which to test her memory . I lightly laid the first strand of spool cotton on the grape - vine trellis , when , like a flash , the bird darted to it and swept away with it down into the garden . This proved her identity . A new cardinal would have been quite ignorant of the uses to which thread could be put , but this little home-maker had sampled the material last year and the year previous and found it good . Thus , you see , she remembered , and , as her nest was not even started , showed her preference at the outset , and also knew where to come . While she was gone on her jonniey I pulled yards inore thread from the spool , breaking it into lengths of ayard and a half or two yards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Back she came , and almost beneath my hand gathered up thread after thread , until she had a mouthful , then off again around the corner of the house . Again and again she returned , in a positive ecstasy of delight over the thread . She would alight an the end of the trellis and then hop bravely up to within my reach , daintily select her threads , and away she would sail through the air , with long streamers floating after her . Little wonder she disdained ordinary things ? straws and sticks and bits of bark , when she had in mind the lacy fabric she wove on the leafy spindle of a maple branch . For she had begun her nest at the very top of a young maple ? a maple just planted and putting forth new leaves . How she revelled in the abundance of the material I gave her ! Last year she had shared it with the robins , jays , and vireos ; this year she herself was the " early bird . " It was all her own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the year previous , she had used it tentatively , one thread at a time , watching carefully as the other birds had gone away laden with the spoil of rags and twine , and contenting herself with a smaller quantity of thread , as if she were not certain how to use it or how it would wear . Last year it was only the finest ravellings she daintily plucked from strips of cloth used by other birds , and the several threads I gave her on the hint she gave me that rags were too coarse . This year the thread was what she wanted , nothing more , nothing less , and before she was through with me she had used that morning between two and three hundred yards of thread . Last year she daintily tested the thread before finally appropriating it , pulling it over and over the trellis ; but this year 's eagerness showed her evident satisfaction with last year 's architectural efforts , and also showed the larger development of her artistic talents . Her royal mate offered no helping hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fro on her journeyings , whistling loud approval ; and , as for herself , she kept up a continual sort of " croon " as she busily worked . Such treasure-trove was not found every day , and she made haste to secure as much of it as possible . As I unrolled the last yard from the spool , I told her firmly that she could have no more . " What you have done with the quantity that you have already taken is a mystery that remains to be unravelled when you are through with your nest , " I said , " but there is an end to all things , even to a spool of thread , and you have reached it . Take , then , if you will " ? and she stood with her head on one side , listening wisely to my words , if not understanding them ? " the spool itself , for I have a fancy to see how much weight you can carry in that rose-red beak of yours . " Tying a yard and a half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ground , twisting the thread up among the grape-vines , and sat down to see what she would do . The spool was a new object , and as such was to be guardedly examined and mistrusted . So the madame perched herself above the spot where it lay , tilting far over , first on one side , then on the other , consumed with curiosity , but not quite daring to investigate . But the last remaining thread she coveted , and she finally gave it a vigorous jerk . Up bobbed the spool like a live thing , and down it dropped again as , in affright , she retreated to a pear-tree . Returning to the charge , she was accompanied by her mate , and together they discussed the dangers of the situation , he , following an ancient example , urging the feminine part of the family to make the venture . And she did . Boldly snatching the attached thread , she rose into the air , dragging with her the spool . Startling apparition ! And she promptly freed herself from it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over , and after repeated urgings , " Oh , try it once more , " the female pounced bravely into the grass after the white trail of the thread , and this time , regardless of consequences , swept away with the spool dangling half a yard below her . After her I ran to see the result . Into the top of the maple she went , and there deposited her thread , for her nest was cozily placed on the exact top of it , with the threads woven about the young branches springing thickly . In a twinkling , as she released the thread , down came the spool through the leaves , VOL. : MIL ? No:470 , - 78falling directly at the foot of the tree . Astonished ( for she had just turned herself about to secure it ) , but not vanquished , she flew out of the tree and to the ground , again seizing the thread and carrying the spool aloft once more . This time she pulled it over the branch , and , evidently thinking it secure , let go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This second accident caused great excitement . The male bird joined her , and the two birds , with heads high and crests erect , hopped around and around this inanimate object that firmly refused to stay " put . " Whatever were their thoughts or the trend of their conversation , with great patience the female cardinal tried once more to weave the attached thread into the lacelike structure of her nest , but to no purpose , as the spool fell for the third time through the leaves ; and then she let it lie , and to spare their feelings I carried it away . As I looked up into the tree , the finished nest presented a beautiful and wondrous appearance . The thread , snow white , hung like festoons of hoary lace from all sides of the nest , curiously woven and intertwined , and , from beneath , it hung to the length of nine or ten inches as the nest rested among the thick foliage of green leaves . Of nothing but thread was the foundation , as we found after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maple branches , as an oriole twists her threads , and with strands innumerable . Syringe twigs in great number were mixed into the upper part of the thread , to make a firm foundation , then above all this came the piece of paper the cardinal invariably uses ? a twist of clean white tissue-paper in this ease . Had that bird an idea of the fitness of things ? Did it not seem so ? But white tissue was a scarcity in the market , evidently , for above this were laid , one upon the other , three pieces of clean manila paper . Then came strips of grape-vine bark , a bit of blue and white cord , and some withered grasses . The upper part , composed of hark , was most carelessly tossed in ; the lower part was of thread woven , intertwined , looped and draped with as much care as any skilled lace-maker could have given to it . How did she do it with her blunt beak , made only for rough work ? Love of beauty she must have had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not much of anchorage , and were entirely useless and unnecessary in the nest proper ? the upper part made of bark , where she placed her eggs . Imitativeness ? I wonder . Had she watched the oriole ? If so , she far surpassed her teacher . And such rejoicing as followed the completion of this wonderful nest ! Such foolish rejoicing , far too loudly voiced for safety . Almost the entire day that unwise male bird sounded a " Rubaiyat " in praise of his home ? such a jewel of a nest ! What jubilant notes ! What a medley of trills and whistles and shouts ! The old proverb was again fulfilled ? pride and vainglory met with their deserts . The period of incubation had almost rounded out , when I noticed on a day a certain very silent blue jay sitting meditatively about . To my eye he had a guilty look and , on general principles , I drove him out of the vicinity . Then I went to investigate . The beautifully woven fabric was torn and tangled in hopeless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and , as the nest hung at an angle , I could see that the eggs also had disappeared . This accounted for the appearance of that brigand , the jay . Dnring the day the cardinals returned to our trees , the jay also , with whetted appetite ; but the outraged parents pounced upon him as furiously as a pair of cats and buffeted him until he was glad to escape with his life . But the maternal instinct was strong in that softly feathered gold-gray breast , and in three days the brave little mother budded a second nest . She did not go to the old nest , as you might think , and pluck from it the now useless threads to weave into her second nest ? not she ? She never went near it , for I watched every moment of its building . Why did she not , I wonder . It would have been an easy matter to pull some of them out , and it was quite near the place where she made her second home . Like a true philosopher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from suggestive scenes , and as energetically , if not quite as joyously , prepared the cradle for her second brood . Did we help her again ? Well , we did , and watched her fly thistime quite over the house to her new home . Where , then , could it be ? I ran around the house , and there on the windlass of the well I surprised the male bird in full song , gazing with upturned head into the woodbine . In among those leaves must be the persevering home - maker , and , sure enough , out she flew as we watched , and away she went over the house to the place of the thread . " Well , " I said , " I 'll lighten your labors pretty quickly , also coax you to where my mother can see you , " and on a near window-sill ? a sill as near to the windlass of the well as to the nest , I trailed long lengths of thread . They caught her bright eyes instantly on her return . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have them so near ! Dare she really venture to the sill of that open window ? Down she flew , but just missed grasping a thread as she passed swiftly by . On to the windlass , then down again , again missing the thread . It was quite evident she must alight to gain her object , and , deciding to risk it , she plucked up courage and flew on to the sill . There she lifted her head high , took a cool survey of us , of the room , and finding things very peaceful and quiet on this summer Sabbath morning , I watching her from my chair and the dear mother gazing delightedly at her from the pillow , she leisurely selected thread after thread until she had a mouthful , and off she went to her nesting-place not ten feet away . " Hurrah ! " shouted her mate from his fence-post of observation ? and though he did n't exactly say these words , his notes were plainly congratulatory , " that 's great ! " but he took precious good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ female had become more confident , and as she lingered each time a little longer on the window-sill , he finally plucked up sufficient manliness to come himself and wake at least a. show of helping her . His enthusiasm for work soon flagged , and he contented himself with watching her and whistling to keep her courage up . This nest was placed quite near to an up-stairs window and on a level with it . I could lock into it from the window and easily reach it with my hand . It was modelled on the lines of her first nestthreads and syringa sticks ; but time seemed to press , and she worked in a tremendous hurry , using much less thread and with little artistic effect . In all , I think there were about seventy-five yards of thread in this nest , as my spool was a little more than half full . The season was advancing ? June 10 ? and as yet she had neither chick nor . child . On Tuesday the first egg was laid , so you recognize her need for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ egg was in the nest on Wednesday , and on Thursday the last egg appeared , and again the patient little bird began her vigil . I now spent most of my time at the window watching the ways of my bird neighbor . At first she eyed me with suspicion . It was pretty close quarters , but I had conversed with her at such length during the nest-building time , that she knew my voice and soon began to answer me in low trillings ? trillings that could scarcely be heard ? and turn her head to look at inc in a friendly way . The mate was not friendly . When he first darted in among the leaves , bearing to the lady of his choice a fine green worm , and espied me at my window , he left in great alarm , not even stopping to feed his mate , and alighted on the windlass , shouting loudly , " Whoo-oo ! " " Whoo-oo ! " over and over again . But I never stirred , and as he could not , as a gentleman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had finally to give in and come back to her with the worm . How she coaxed and called him each time he returned with food and affrightedly made many dashes at the nest ere he alighted ! But he soon learned to look upon me as a fixture and to regard me with indifference . The hot summer days ran on and on , adding familiarity to our friendship with the birds , until the mother bird and I reached that enviable stage of long silences , and my lady would barely open a sleepy eye if I essayed conversation , and then , closing it , would sit and nod , nod , nod , as an old lady does over her knitting . it was amusing to see her thus napping in the summer heat , wearing the most utterly bored expression you could imagine , her head slowly dropping to one side until it reached an angle too acute , when she would pull herself together and straighten up , only to yield a moment later to the utter weariness caused by engrossing cares of motherhood . Fancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her on a certain hot noontide was received with warlike demonstrations . She had fed from my hand as she sat on the nest many and many a time , but now , as I held out to her a morsel of white bread , she started up with glittering eyes and wildly ruffled plumage , a perfect fury in feathers , betraying by the glitter of her eye her kinship to the snake . Innocent of offence , I continued to urge upon her my largess , when she slipped off the nest and gave my finger a vicious dig . Her loss of self-control proved her undoing and betrayed her secret . A tiny pink morsel lay in the nest ? the first bird was hatched ! No wonder she was fierce , after the mishap to her first nest . Who would want a giant 's great big hand to come poking insolently about the cradle of one 's firstborn ? No wonder she stood " at arms " ! But , really , I think , after all our goodfellowship , she might have trusted me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little human baby , and possibly thrice as large as a young humming-bird . It was almost naked , only a little fuzz showing on the wings and on the top of its head . Little time was given for even a glimpse , as the mother bird was back on the nest in a trice . Nor did I ever know her to be away from the nest unless the male bird was on guard , until the birds were nearly grown . Experience had been a good teacher . On the next day two birds were in the nest ; the next , three yeungsters crowded together beneath her warm breast . How wonderful now was her instinct ! No more close sitting on the nest ; rather , she seemed to hold herself over the young birds so lightly as if to give breathing-space for the small lungs . How they did sleep , those youngsters ! Cuddled in a warm little bunch , they slept by the hour , the mother , perched on the edge of the nest , keeping guard . Their rapidity of respiration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if they must breathe as fast as they could and grow as fast , so as to lose nothing of life . Whether birds so young already partake of the peculiarities of what is called " immature " birds  --  half - grown birds , ? I do not know , but I do know that two of these birds looked gray even when only economically wearing their skin , and one was quite pink , and in the third nest made all three birds were pink . Possibly all of them were male birds in the last case , the pale rosy coloring being only a forerunner of the vivid red of the future . Well , my young birds grew and grew apace , and the old birds gradually lost the puffed-up pride of first parentage , admitting my **29;28;TOOLONG self again to their confidence , and the female came quite readily on to the window-seat for the crumbs I laid there , and even inside . It was marvellous how they feathered out . The wings on one day showed only gray quills with tiny paint-brush ends sticking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dove-colored feathers ? dove color with a warm rosy tint ? precisely as a flower blossoms in a night . On the fourth day , Tuesday , a slit appeared in the centre of the eyelids of the first-born ; the next , the slit had widened ; and on the sixth day the young bird had its first glimpse into a wonderful world of leaves and blue sky . The eyes of the remaining birds opened in succession , and on the tenth day after the first hatching , when I made my noonday visit , two birds were just fluttering from the nest . Between bopping and beating their wings , they managed finally to climb out of the nest , one perching on the rim of it , the other fluttering on to a twig close to my window . There they sat in roundeyed wonder , staring about them Eke owls , as though they would say : " Well , this is the kind of place the world is , is it ? Not so very much , after all ! " And when I reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bird in , it evinced no surprise of any kind , but sat gravely on my finger , eying me with an unblinking stare . But the old ones took things not so easily , for they flew at me like demons until I retreated into a farther room , carrying off my prize for closer inspection . What a beauty it was ! and how complacently it hopped from finger to finger of my hand ! But as the outraged parents dashed against the now closed window in fierce rage , I opened the door down-stairs to which I had carried my captive and lethim go , not an instant too soon , for the cardinals flew at me viciously . It scented inexcusable , but the dooryard was unsafe for the rest of the day , for as the third youngster fluttered out , they all three fell among the woodbine , and when one of us made a dash to bring in a bird to examine it , it was at the risk of our eyes . They permitted us to throw out crumbs , and came quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was very evident that it was their day " out " and our dry " in . " We secured the nest and found it made of successive layers , first a piece of paper bearing the words , in large letters , " Premium , " " A number One , " evidently the heading of some prize-paper advertisement . Then came the thread , yards and yards of it , secured to the woodbine and interlaced around many tiny syringa twigs . Then upon this a piece of brown manila paper , and then a few pieces of bark ; then a third piece of paper with large type head-lines , " What shall be done with Aguinaldo ? " more twigs and bits of bark ; then a fourth piece of paper from a select sheet headed " Times - Star , " announcing a bargain sale of housekeeping goods . Such a tiny pocket of a nest as it was , after all , to have held such a vigorous family ! The hollow of it was no larger than the curve of my palm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following the female was again at nest-making ? her third nest , two sets of eggs having been laid already and one brood hatched . This nest was hung to the wire netting where the honeysuckle clung . It could be entered from either side ? outside from beneath the leaves , or inside from the porch side . It was cunningly located beneath the thickest leaves . But did my lady choose the easier way ? Not at all . No matter how many people were occupying the porch , she would , after exercising or going for water on the south side of the house , fly into the maple-tree at the south end of the porch , and from there sweep over our heads , the entire length of the porch , alight on a tiny twig that protruded on the wire side of the nest , and then slip through the meshes as neatly as you please . She sometimes added to the charm of her flight by sitting on the twig for two or three minutes , before stepping into the nest , and pouring forth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? to fly home and , before settling down to the monotony of brooding , whistle ecstatically . Many times in the day did she repeat this . Occasionally on the nest she would whistle and call in such low , clear tones , raising her head to listen for my answer or for her mate 's , if he were in the vicinity , that I felt she had , in the joy of maternity , forgotten all its pain , and the tragic episode of the blue jay was as though it never had been . Oftentimes I held my face close to the netting and conversed with the little mother as she wearily wore away the hot , hot , hot days , and she would respond by an uplifted head and a kindly reception of my words . In this nest , in course of time , were three babies , all of them pink , pink as pink , and even smaller than the first ones ? the first day one , the second day all three . On a certain day the female would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat on the twig or the edge of the nest , and we knew that flying-time was at hand , and promptly posted ourselves near by to observe . When her patience was almost worn out , one little bird struggled out of the nest and up on to the vine , then a second and a third A flutter of wings , a fitful stirring , A little piping of lea ? bid birds , truly , ? and guiding them , guarding them , cheering them on , the parent birds hung about the young adventurers . At nightfall they were yet in the vines , but in the morning all were gone but one , and as I picked him from the leafy covert , with kindliest intent to show him the way to his " mammy , " that " mammy " swooped down upon me from goodness knows where . for I had not suspected her being in the neighborhood , and showed me so unmistakably that she could take care of her own family , that I dropped her birdling and retreated in anything but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leafy garden lonely . The friend of all the birds , one blossomy April day , fled into a Far Country , and , missing her , my bird went away , bewildered , choosing a location in my neighbor 's garden , building her first nest away from our place . One day later , as I sat lonely by my window in the still house , into the grape trellis descended our cardinal bird , peering at me with inquiry . With a jumping heart I watched her , and wildly hoping she might even at this early date want to build again ( the young ones were scarcely out of the nest ) , I dropped my work , snatched up a spool of thread , and hurried outside to tempt her . There . by the trellis , I unrolled yard after yard of thread as she cunningly watched me , but I had scarcely left them when my lady came edging shyly along the trellis , snatched up one thread and flew away with it over the low root of the kitchen . I returned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of the thread ; then I went out with more , and this time following her flight , behold ! there where she had built the year before was a tangle of white threads hanging in the green leaves of the woodbine . She had come back to me ; old friends were best ! This second nest was not long a-building . Her second brood was scarcely on its wings when my lady again turned over to her almost exhausted mate ? for he had had all the rearing of the first brood ? the three hungry youngsters who had quickly become burdensome to herself , for she wanted to build again . This time she made a nest in the Osage hedge , still using the thread . So ended the fourth summer .
