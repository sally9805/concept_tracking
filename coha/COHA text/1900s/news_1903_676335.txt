txt Charges were filed with the President to-day by T. C. Campbell , a well-known lawyer of Cincinnati , in which it is alleged that with the connivance of the postal authorities the mails are being improperly used in carrying matter that is fraudulent in character and the transmission of which is forbidden by law . The particular matter complained of relates to a so-called turf investment company in a Western city , which professes to guarantee to subscribers 6 per cent . a month on the money invested . For a year or more charges of this character have been made , but the investigations that followed failed to sustain them . Some time ago , in consequence of information that reached the postal authorities , an investigation was quietly started , and this is still in progress .
