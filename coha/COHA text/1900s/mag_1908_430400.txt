 |p497  WE were threading our way westward through the thousands of brown-winged fishing-sampans and . the rocky flotsam and jetsam of the Inland Sea ? humpbacked islets and upthrust fangs of granite that strew those waters as though a giant had crumbled a world in his fingers and cast the fragments from him in rage . " The most hated American in China , eh ? " I offered , agreeable to the comment-inviting glance of the man formerly of Shanghai , who was telling me the story . " Who is that ? " demanded another man , joining us in time to catch the question . " Wilfley , damn him ! " snapped the man formerly of Shanghai . He spat over the rail , as though to cleanse his mouth of the flavor of the name . That was the way the tale followed the arch of the great circle across the Pacific ; in Yokohama , Tokyo , Nagasaki , Kobe , and beyond ; in Shanghai itself , Hongkong , and Manila , wherever the spicy current of international gossip , running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eddies and backwaters . The man formerly of Shanghai , I found , was unerring and not without justification in his personal judgments and estimates of Wilfley . We may trace a connection and learn a why and a wherefore . He was a most likable rogue , the man formerly of Shanghai . His high popularity aboard was attested by his smoking-room chits , vastly more imposing numerically and in total than those of any three other passengers . He was doing a flourishing business in the Straits Settlements ? something in the gambling line , to be precise . His had been a lion 's share of the spoil of the rooking of Shanghai 's gilded youth and gamblesome old age before Wilfley 's advent . Hence Shanghai is the Paris of the Orient . Of that fame it vociferates its boasts . But our interest ? the United States 's ? in Shanghai 's distinction of being the only original , nameblown-in-the-bottle , high old rip-roaring , snorting , whoopity-whoop , wide-open , lidless town of the Far East has now been ceded , without benefit of treaty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other nations that enjoy extraterritorial rights in the Chinese empire . Ichabod for us . Our glory has departed . Wilfley , the most hated American in China , did it . Shanghai suggests the saloon which was situated conveniently near a popular penitentiary . On the wall farthest from the prison the saloon bore a sign reading , " The  |p498  Last Chance . " On the wall giving upon the grilled and gloomy windows , signaling cheer to the freed , was another sign , " The First Chance . " Shanghai is a first-chance , last-chance town . It sprawls at one of the gateways to the enormous interior of China . All steamships that furrow the face of the ocean in that part of the world breast the bar at Wusung . White men the length and breadth of the East undeviatingly seek Shanghai for relaxation , to rid themselves of the bitter tang of life apart from their kind , to get in touch again , to make up for enforced abstinence from indulgence , to " organize " with crook of elbow and significant Hows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , or when sailing away . It is their first chance after weary months , perhaps years , of exile in remote regions where all faces are yellow or brown , or at the end of hot and tedious wallowings through the oily seas of the tropics . More so than in Paris , even , has the great American cocktail established itself in the affections of the foreign male populace of Shanghai . It is violating no confidence here to supplement international drink statistics with the information that the Shanghai Club holds the world 's record for cocktails . The daily average per member is reputed to he seventeen ! LAWLESSNESS OF THE AMERICANS IN SHANGHAI Sundry and divers Americans had been carrying things with a high hand in Shanghai for years before the advent of Willey . As aliens residing in China , theoretically they were subject to the laws administered by the American consular courts . They were living in a condition of extraterritoriality . Broadly speaking , extraterritoriality is a term employed to describe the act by which a state is allowed to extend its jurisdiction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its subjects who , for the time being , are sojourning in that state . So far as phonetics and theory go , this definition is sufficiently comprehensive and efficient . But unregenerate Americans in Shanghai set an original and sweeping interpretation upon the real meaning of extraterritoriality . To these it meant , " When out of the United States , especially in China , do as you blooming please . " As consistently as lies in the power of weak mortals to do so , and avoid jail , they lived up to their extraterritorial status as they chose to understand it . Occasionally they were aided and abetted in keeping the bars behind them by United States consuls who had sometime served in various Chinese cities , but had been removed from office for the benefit of their country . The names and crimes of these corrupt consuls are on the State Department 's roll of infamy , so it is not necessary to recapitulate them here . By and large , the preponderant fraction of all the Americans in China were , and are , reputable and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them . All the same , there was a supineness , a pliant acquiescence , on their part in conditions as Wilfley found them , when he embarked on his hatred-acquiring career in China , which  |p499  went far to burden them with a share of the responsibility for the things which blotted the ' scutcheon of the United States in the Far East . It was unfortunate that the moral tone of the American colony in Shanghai took its most pronounced shadings , as viewed by an outsider , from the acts of the disreputable minority rather than from those of the virtuous majority . The bad Americans ran the American end of the common interests which our nationals in Shanghai share with the English , German , French , and other extraterritorial residents there . The good Americans let them do it . They were too deeply engrossed with their private affairs , with the errands that had taken them to China , to concern themselves considerably with the task of upholding the honor of the nation 's name . Then , too , the had Americans were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clubs and of some reputable houses . They dressed well . They were money-makers , and they spent their gains with a degree of celerity and free-handedness proportionate to the ease with which the gold was acquired . Blood is immeasurably thicker than water when one is half the span of the globe from home ; and Americans anywhere are never prone to stand-offishness , or to withhold the slap of good-fellowship from the broadclothed shoulder of rascality , providing the rascality is not overly flagrant , or offensively in evidence . So the good and the bad Americans in Shanghai fraternized , and the had ones fattened through nefarious practices and were not ostracized , or classed as pariahs . Notably after the American occupation of the Philippines did Shanghai become the roostingplace of American birds of prey . There had been a lesser influx subsequent to the Boxer Rebellion and the shameful looting of Peking , where American thieves were as greedy and conscienceless as the rest . Manila sheltered a pest of these American renegades , army followers who did sturdy rogues ' full share in fleecing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Filipinos with no uncertain notions as to the racial probity of the regenerators who had benevolently hurried thither to save them and their islands . William H. Taft brought his weighty fist down stunningly upon scores of these gentry . He was aided by Wilfley , who for five years prior to 1907 was attorney-general of the Philippines . Edicts of banishment , promulgated according to due legal forms and rites , sent the rascals scurfrom Manila to Shanghai , a city of refuge , prodded at every jump by impending jail sentences . several lawyers who later attained positions of eminence at the bar of Shanghai and soared high , fleecing the unwary , inciting litigation , an d defending gamblers , swindlers , disreputable women , and scourings of that ilk ? until Willey came . It was the crooked American lawyers of Shanghai who did more than anyone or anything else to man the ramparts of the citadel of crime which Wilfley overthrew , and to put heart into the scurvy garrison . The worst phase of the situation , so far as the American name went , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dissolute women of Shanghai . Nine-tenths of the disorderly resorts , " the foreign houses , " were run and tenanted by American women , or women who called themselves Americans . They were brazen above the ordinary . They traded on the flag . It was  |p500  their trade-mark , virtually . It was when they wrapped the Stars and Stripes about them , figuratively speaking , that they put out their strongest and most lucrative plea for patronage . The facts can not be overstated . I know , and every American in China knows . Throughout the East " American girl " had only one meaning ? the worst . To illustrate the significance of the term . I sat with a party of American men in the dining-room of the Astor House in Shanghai . One was a resident of the city , and we others were just from the States . A group of tourists , comprising several handsome young women palpably irreproachable in social position and demeanor , entered . " There are some fine-looking American girls , " admiringly commented one of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a decent woman out here , " cautioned the Shanghai man . " We do n't . We can not . American girl ' is n't a pleasant expression to American ears in the East . We feel so deeply about it that none of us think of referring to our daughters as American girls . ' Stay here a while , and you 'll appreciate how we feel about it . " He added a regretful comment that we do not do as the English , who sternly prohibit Englishwomen who are not reputable from taking up their abode in British colonies or extraterritorial establishments . They deem it of extreme importance that the natives are not given an excuse for lightly regarding Englishwomen . DISGRACEFUL SOCLAL CONDITIONS The domination of the " American girls " in Shanghai was actual and absolute . They had their fingers in all the concerns of the city . They lived extravagantly prodigal lives on money sucked from the community . In the afternoons , during the fashionable driving hour , they were vital and bedizened figures in the pageant in the Bubbling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . runners and drawn by blooded horses with jingling , silver-mounted harness . They were on terms of closest intimacy with Shanghai 's men of affairs , foreign as well as native . Each of them kept under perpetual retainer a graceless American lawyer . What they paid the lawyers was protection money . In return the lawyers held them harmless from punishment . The moral atmosphere of the city was rendered turbid by the power and impudence of the securely entrenched " American girls . " They had a society of their own , too , and gave brilliant entertainments . At their afternoon teas , conducted with much pomp and circumstance , it was quite the thing for business men to drop in for a drink and a chat , on their way from their countinghouses to the club , or home to dress for dinner . These harpies specialized at gripping their talons into young men despatched to China as local representatives of American , French , German , and English firms . The absence of restraining and conventional ties . of espionage by business or family superiors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and frown upon moral sagging . tempts fiercely when one is young , ridden , perhaps , by nostalgia , and sees flagrant examples of loose living supplied by elder and putatively reputable men . Small salaries and lack of ready money did not keep them straight . They did not need a pocketful of cash . Here the chit system , that superlatively necessary evil of the Orient , came into play . In the East , instead of paying cash , one signs a chit , or a memorandum of debt , redeemable at an indefinite date . Little money passes from the palm of the buyer to that of the seller at the moment of purchase . If you live in Shanghai you may sign a chit for almost any article , or for any sum within reasonable limitations . But you must pay or , so far as you are concerned , the chit system crumbles and you are buried in the debris , a discredited man who has not honored his chits . Hundreds of men with bright futures have signed away their prospects , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tithe of which on the day of reckoning they had no resources . They have fled the East , disgraced , ruined . In such manner business houses at home suffered through the derelictions of their representatives . It discouraged trade . It struck directly at the tills of counting-houses in New York , Boston , Chicago , and other American cities . There was an angle of the situation with a more grave bearing upon our national reputation and well-being . The Chinese are honest , to a jot . His word passed , the Chinese will do what he says he will do if the breath of life remains in him and the power to fulfil is within his most remote capability . What shining marks the Chinese offered for the sharks , the schemers , the gamblers , the blacklegs that infested Shanghai ! Such gentry had rich picking . They robbed the @#  |p501  Chinese right and left . Wilfley gave an American a year in jail for taking three thousand dollars from a Chinese for the lease of a house for gambling purposes after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not permit the place to be used for gaming . In the old days , when the mulcted Chinese appealed to the law it was exceptional if he got justice . The sharpers and their lawyers usually were able to convince the consular courts of the unsoundness of the plaints of the Chinese . Not always did this argue that the consuls were corrupt ; they might have been , and probably were , fooled . But incidents where consuls laid in with the swindlers and profited by their machinations at the expense of the Chinese have been notorious in China . The result was apparent in a feeling of mistrust and resentment that arose gradually among the Chinese when they pondered upon American methods of business and justice . All the rogues of both sexes in Shanghai were not Americans ; but an excess of a just percentage were . The East seems to fancy our men and women with discreditable pasts more than it does those that prey beneath the banners of other nations . The " American girls " are better looking and smarter . The men not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and savoirfaire , accustomed to associating on terms of camaraderie with gentlemen . It is stating neither more nor less than the fact to say that in the beginning of 1907 the American flag in China stood absolutely for shame , dishonor , and ill repute . It was forced to be sponsor for manifold illegitimate traffickings . When the dissolute women of Shanghai gave parties , at the top of their engraved cards of invitation invariably was embossed the American flag . Over the guests as they entered depended canopies of red , white , and blue bunting . The flag was draped upon the outer walls . It formed the center of the scheme of decoration . Americans of probity and influence in the East were alive to the situation and deplored it . They studied and cogitated remedial ways and  |p502  means . The State Department , primarily at fault for its persistent policy of torpid indifference to the degrading of the flag in China , careless as to what was done there by the crooks who panoplied themselves with its folds , bestirred itself . Representative Edwin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States minister to China ; Charles Denby , another son , now consul-general in Shanghai ; Secretary of War Taft , Senator Spooner , Secretary of State Root , and some others , were responsible for the inception of the movement to clean up China . They got through Congress a bill creating the United States Court for China . This was the broom . Wilfley was chosen the sweeper . LEBBEIIS REDMOND WILFLEY Lebbeus Redmond Wilfley is a hard-shelled Gold Democrat from Mexico , Missouri , forty-two years old , with a near-bald head , a jaw that is as bluff and uncompromising as the bow of a canal-boat , plenty of " beef " and height , a mouth that looks , when it shuts , as if it would have to be pried open with a jimmy , a sanguine temperament , a handful of diplomas , not enough legal lore to unfit him to be a man of action , and a complete and cheerful disregard of other folks ' shins when he knows he is right and throws in the high-speed clutch for a whirlwind dash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Hadley , two other Missourians of parts and accomplishments . When he was attorney-general of the Philippines , Wilfley broke heads right and left . Some of the folks he welted are still rubbing the place where the stave hit , and uttering lamentations . Others are in Bilibid Prison , or with the reek of the jail still hanging about them have taken their stand just outside the fence that marks the limit of the jurisdiction of the United States , where they make faces at Wilfley and yell , " Ya-a-a-a-h ! " The American newspapers of Manila have an antipathy for Wilfley ? " Leb , " as they call him ? and waste much space printing anything they think reflects discredit upon him and his work . In the old days in Manila Wilfley had a hand in hustling a few tatterdemalion newspaper men to Bilibid , or in running them out of the country . He is a bull-headed , uncomfortable sort of individual to have cutting your trail if you 've been up to mischief . But the germs of social graces are there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours . With his peculiar constitution Wilfley could n't help being wrong some of the time , but he is right oftener than he is wrong , so his batting average in that regard is up to league standards . Generally , the man he gets after goes to jail , and in all great reform movements an occasional thwack or so is apt to land on the cranium of an innocent bystander . WILFLEY STARTS TO " CLEAN UP " Wilfley was called to Washington . Secretary Root handed him his commission and instructions , definite as to purport , but vague ato details . They were delivered with " the ace running wild , " as they say out West when they throw dice . " Clean up China , " ordered the secretary . Wilfley packed his commission and one thousand dollars ' worth of law . books in his trunks and started eastward . After three or four days of spying out the land he saw where to put his peg as a point toward which to work for the first stage of the job . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keystone which he must dislodge before the arch that upheld the rotten fortalice of graft , chicanery , and immorality would collapse . High standards of professional ethics must be plucked from the mire into which they had been allowed to fall , With a purged bar , the reputable lawyers who might survive the fiery ordeal which Wilflev planned for them would , he was certain . stand with him . The undesirables would bs deprived of legal aid and succor . To a degree he was hampered by the failure of the law creating the court to provide a rule governing the admission of lawyers to practice . In the long run this turned out to be a benefit , because it gave Wilfley the chance to lay down the proposition that in the lack of specific provision the right inhered for the judge of the court to prescribe rules . He requisitioned the rule in force in the United States and caused it to be known that all lawyers desiring to plead cases before the United States Cour for China would be required to pass an examination and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , satisfactory to the court . The test fell upon an evil day for the distinguished representatives of the American bar in Shanghai . Eight lawyers went up for examination . Six of the eight flunked . It would have availed few of the six but slightly had they convinced Wilfley of their mental fitness , for he had the ammunition ready with which to bowl them over on the score of character deficiencies . By this simple method the attenuation of the American bar in  |p503  Shanghai to two members was accomplished . One was T. R. Jernigan and the other Sterling Fessenden , a scion of the New England family of Fessendens . It was at this juncture that Wilfley began to be the most hated American in China . Friends of the disbarred attorneys took up their cause and ranted raucously about " high-handed methods , " " taking the bread and butter out of the mouths of honest men , " " driving old men to the poorhouse , " and so on . Wilfley pointed to the records of the outcasts and rested his case there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who sinned in China from going to prison , was played as a trump card by the disbarred attorneys in a desperate endeavor to discomfit Wilfley and defeat the purpose of the law creating the court . They combined , formed a pool , and sent one of their number to Washington to batter at the doors of Congress and wail , " Oppression ! Injustice ! " He did . The sympathetic Senate , which confidently may be depended upon not to side-step any opportunity to obstruct the progress of reform in matters connected with our national welfare in distant lands , passed a bill admitting to practice in the China court any lawyer who could show a certificate of admission to the bar of the federal courts in the United States . The House voted down the measure . Impeachment proceedings with Wilfley as a target also failed . Ended with prophylactic activities along this line , Wilfley dug the broom into the next dark and unwholesome corner that was obvious . Arthur Bassett , the United States district attorney , laid before Wilfley information charging eight women with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all " American houses . " Warrants were issued , and Marshal Hubert O'Brien served them forthwith without sending word in advance that he was coming . Shanghai seethed that day . The event was unprecedented . The " ladies " were n't granted even the least of the prerogatives which they had come to look upon as inalienable ? of being politely requested to come to court , and fixing their own time to do it in . They were ignominiously and incontinently " pinched . " Such an upheaval of the established order of things had never before been heard of in the Paris of the Orient . In informal mass meetings in the clubs , hotels , and other places of rendezvous Americans who should have known better , and who probably by now have the grace to be heartily ashamed of themselves , denounced Wilfley as puritanical , unpatriotic , bigoted , and as an arrant enemy of the commercial and vested interests of the foreign colony ? all with as many qualifying adjectives as they thought the occasion demanded . Low throaty growls on the Wilfley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought they could discern what would be the consequences to his imperial majesty 's representatives in China if , by polishing up our front steps , Wilfley should continue to pass the work of reform along . THE ROUT OF VICE The business of Messrs . Jernigan and Fessenden boomed that day as it never had before . Deprived of their legal props by the disbarring of the crooked lawyers , the eight women besought the two-man law-monopoly of Shanghai to hold a lamp to guide their trembling footsteps . So did various and sundry worthies who misdoubted their ability accurately to decipher the signs of the times and negotiate Wilfley 's curves , and who were eager to know what they should do to be saved . Messrs . Jernigan and Fessenden shook up the bottle and administered the same dose to all . " Quit , ARTHUR BASSETT The district attorney who prosecuted the criminals taken before Judge Wilfley  |p504  unless you want to go to jail , " was their advice . In the vernacular of the race-tracks , it also was the one best bet in Shanghai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is too humbly housed the American consulate-general , where the United States Court holds its sessions , was choked with the carriages , the champing , fretting horses , the rickshaws , and the chairs of the eight women and their friends when their cases were called . They made a brave show , but the chalky pallor of fear underlay the rouge on the women 's faces . The display of costumes and millinery was superb . The spoil of Shanghai 's leading jewelers and diamond merchants flashed from ears , throats , and wrists . Chinoboy messengers bearing bulletins of the progress of affairs kept the dust spurting from the paths diverging from the courtroom to the clubs , the hotels , and certain counting-houses and offices . Sikh policemen had to club an alley out of the congestion when the honorable judge appeared . Bail was fixed in each case at four thousand dollars . The extent of the financial resources of the women was shown when , in less than an hour , thirty-two thousand dollars in cash were deposited with the clerk of the court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cash handy they got it ? and there are no professional bondsmen or straw-bail merchants in Shanghai , either . The women , save one , pleaded guilty and paid fines of one thousand dollars each . The exception established her right to German citizenship , but , stimulated by the scare , she concluded that the bottom had dropped out of business in Shanghai and went away from there , promising never to return , The release of the seven upon the payment of their fines was conditional upon their covenanting to retire from trade and abandon Shanghai to its fate . While the town was yet rocking from Wilfley 's second jolt , upper-cut number three followed . Bassett ordered every " American girl " inmate to report to him instanter . Direful was the bruit as to what unusual and barbarous treatment Wilfley and Bassett were to mete out to them . They suspected the worst . Even feminine curiosity was not sufficiently potent with these women to move them to linger to see what would happen . Seventeen of them departed that evening on one steamship , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half a hundred women had voluntarily enrolled themselvs. as former residents of Shanghai . " American houses " in China were things of the past . It was an exodus , a hegira . And they all led hating Wilfley . Now there is not an " American house " in the empire run by an American woman . If there is an American girl in any disorderly house Wilfley and his district attorney do not know it . There have been those who in recent months have won back to the scenes of their dimmed glories by espousing men of other nations . When such cases have come to the attention of the court due notice has been served upon the representatives of the countries under the flags of which the women have crept . " We 've hoisted the flag of their adopted country over them , anyway , and that is some satisfaction , " commented Wilfley . Gamblers and swindlers , sharks and sharpers , all have scuttled from within the pale of the torch of national decency which Wilfley is keeping snuffed and burning brilliantly in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another place in the empire where the fair fame of the United States and of the flag suffered through the lawbreakers who utilized it as a talisman to ward off punishment . These evacuated precipitately when they heard what Wilfley was doing in Shanghai . And they , too , left hating Wilfley . Gamblerand swindlers were haled to court as opportunity offered . They found the meshes the legal net which Wilfley was casting into the deeps of Shanghai 's nether world too tin for them to slip through . Heavy fines and sentences sickened them of the climate of Shanghai . And they also have left hating Wilfley . Stock-gambling , a practice which had its part in the general moral let-down. has been banned . In eight months Wilfley snatched national decency in China from the gutter and set it on a rock . He wrote a new and important chapter of American extraterritorial law . He did n't do it without hurting the feelings of a lot of persons , and I should n't be surprised if he committed several mistakes . Like the little boy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HE DID IT ! @#
