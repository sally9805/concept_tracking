txt A Dominican plot to assassinate William F. Powell , United States Minister to Haiti , and Charge d'Affaires at Port au Prince . Santo  --  Domingo , was announced yesterday in a communication from a high official of the present Dominican Government to a Dominican citizen in this city , who formerly was an official under Wos Y Gil , the recently deposed President of the republic . The letter told also that the plot had been so arranged that ex-President Jiminez , under ' whose - leadership - Wes y Gil ? was overthrown , should be killed at or ' about the same time . . The plot to assassinate Minister Powell , it was asserted , was conceived in the Cabinet of the Government , and the reason the officials desired his removal is said to have been the fact that he was too independent and could not be induced to act in accordance with their wishes . The plan , as reported , was to let two or three men get into a fight on a street along which Mr. Powell was passing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engage , and it would be an easy matter to kill the American " by accident . " ' More daring and open was the reported plan to assassinate ex-President Jiminez . In fact , according to the letter , the arrangements for this murder were not carefully studied out so as to avoid detection of the perpetrators . Any means would be satisfactory so long as they were successful . Already two unsuccessful bold attacks had been . made on the ex-President . The letter which told of this plot of assassination was brought to New York by a passenger on the steamship Foxhall , which arrived yesterday morning . The recipient gave out its contents , but said that he was not in a position to permit the use of his name or the name of the writer . who , however , he described as a prominent Dominican who took a high office in the Government when Wos y Gil was deposed . According to the official it was proposed at a meeting of the Cabinet that some means be taken to remove both the United States Minister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Presidency of the republic . Morales is holding office only temporarily , and while Morales and Jiminez are said to be on friendly terms personally , their followers are very bitter in their fight for their respective leaders . When the plan was suggested , according to the letter , several of ? those present , all of them Government officials , fell in with it and began to discuss details enthusiastically . One of them suggested that it could easily be arranged for a party of soldiers , who could congregate under arms without exciting comment , to carry out the plot with relation to the American representative. ? Carlos Ginebra , Minister of Posts and Telegraphs , the letter says , vehemently opposed the idea , saying : " I will never consent to such an outrage . Minister Powell is a good man , and it would be an outrage to kill him . Even if we had cause to do so , such an act would bring down on us swift vengeance from the United States Government . Unless this idea is given up immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Government . " The plot was then abandoned . ostensibly at least , but the few influential citizens who know of the plot , the letter says , are in constant fear for Minister Powell 's safety . Whenever he leaves his house he is carefully watched over by friendly citizens . The first attempt on the life of ex-President Jiminez occurred on Sunday , Dec. 6 , the letter says , when , a shot was taken at him in his carriage . The second attempt was made three days later . It is firmly believed by friends of Jiminez , says the writer of the letter , that Morales is back of an organized attempt to put Jiminez out of the way before the election is held to choose a permanent successor to Wos Gil . Morales has the army under him , and a general fear is felt that some of the soldiers detailed to guard Jiminez 's house will assassinate him . For this reason the citizens of Santiago have organized a vigilance committee , and a number of members guard the ex-President 's house every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plots against Jiminez , and that he had these things which have been reported in mind when he cabled the State Department last Sunday that " War is being made on Jiminez .
