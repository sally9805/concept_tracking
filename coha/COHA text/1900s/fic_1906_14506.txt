Door at back R. of C. , leading into corridor . Large window at R. with cushioned window-seat . The room is gotten up in true college style , with banners , posters , photographs , odd sofa pillows , etc . A study table at L. side of room . At rise of curtain , MADDEN is discovered sitting at study table from which he has pushed books , papers and writing material on to the floor . He is lying so that his head and book come immediately under the drop light . An unfilled pipe is hanging in the corner of his mouth . The curtains drawn close and the lights are down . As curtain rises , boys are heard in the distance singing , " Up the Street . " It dies away . CLAXTON MADDEN ( suddenly sits up , throws his book across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to try to study . I can smell the Spring ! The air 's full of it ! ( knock at door R. C. ) Come in . ( Enter GERALD THORNE and JOHN CARTWRIGHT . THORNE is a tall , ungainly Southerner , rather poorly dressed ; strong , stern face . CARTWRIGHT is of the studious type , pale , stooped , wears glasses . He is secretary of the Lend-a-Hand Club for aiding poor students . p. 3 JOHN CARTWRIGHT Hello , Madden . CLAXTON MADDEN Hello , Cartwright ! JOHN CARTWRIGHT What are you all shut up for ? CLAXTON MADDEN ( dismally ) Ca n't bear to see the sunlight , and think of all the fellows out there on the river , while I 've got to stay here and grind . It would n't be so bad if I could smoke . JOHN CARTWRIGHT ( crossing to window ) Oh , nonsense ! Let the sunlight in . You 'll feel all the better for it . ( pulls back curtains ) ( Stage lights full up . ) CLAXTON MADDEN ( L. C. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nerve ! Where do you think you are ? ( goes C. , sees THORNE ) JOHN CARTWRIGHT ( R. ) Madden , this is Thorne , Gerald Thorne . Fellow of your class ; I think he can do all the coaching you need in astronomy . ( THORNE extends his hand . MADDEN snubs him . ) CLAXTON MADDEN ( to THORNE ) How are you ? ( crosses to desk , takes lamp , puts it on mantel ) p. 4 JOHN CARTWRIGHT Well , so long ! ( to THORNE ) Wish you joy , old man , with your brilliant pupil . CLAXTON MADDEN ( L. ) Oh , get out ! ( CART . exits R. C. Turns from mantel ) Well , sit down , ( THORNE looks embarrassed and ill at ease . Crosses to R. of desk . MADDEN looking at him with disfavor ) Huh ! ( throws himself impatiently into chair L. of desk . THORNE takes out a note-book and fountain pen . Short silence ) Well , fire away . ( sits L. of desk ) GERALD THORNE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a  --  may I ask how far you have gone in this year 's work ? ( puts bag on seat , takes out book ) CLAXTON MADDEN ( blankly ) Gone ? GERALD THORNE Yes . What was the last lecture you attended ? ( leans over table ) CLAXTON MADDEN You can search me ! GERALD THORNE Do n't you remember when it was you last attended a lecture ? CLAXTON MADDEN No , I do n't . See here , old man , just cut out the inquisition , ( THORNE draws back ) please , and let 's get down to business . If I had the faintest idea about these Agols and Sagittarius and all that rot , do n't you suppose I 'd be out imbibing the atmosphere , instead of sitting here chinning with you ? ( THORNE looks hurt ) This is the first of April , all right , but I 'm not playing any jokes upon myself . p. 5 GERALD THORNE Mr. Madden ! I  --   --  CLAXTON MADDEN Ah , ( rises ) sit down . No offense , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bag beside desk ) This thing has got on my nerves . If I 'd known there was so much mathematics in Astronomy I 'd never have taken it up . I thought it was a cinch  --  a sort of fortune-telling business , you know . " Born under the planet Mars , you will have a big head and a warlike disposition , " and all that . I never dreamed what I was going up against . But come on  --  let 's get to work . It 's got to be done . ( assumes attitude of strict attention ) GERALD THORNE ( reaches , takes book out of bag ) Well , I presume we 'd best begin with the first lecture of this half year , regarding binary stars . CLAXTON MADDEN I suppose so . GERALD THORNE In the first place  --   --  CLAXTON MADDEN ( rises ) Wait a minute . ( quickly ) I 'd better get a pencil , I can see that . ( goes and gets pencil on mantel , returns and sits ) Ah , now we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , old man . GERALD THORNE Well , following the mathematical investigations of Professor George Scannel , it is found that binary stars will tend to separate . Inertia will cause the tidal protuberances to lag behind so that the axis of the Ellipodal  --   --  p. 6 CLAXTON MADDEN Hold on ! ( THORNE lowers book with intense astonishment ) Now look here , old man ; really , seriously , I do n't care to know anything deep about the subject ; deep , you understand . My idea is just to get few handy catch-words that 'll make a good show on the paper , see ? GERALD THORNE ( puzzled ) " Catch-words ? " CLAXTON MADDEN Yes . ( Whistle heard from street , R. ) GERALD THORNE I do n't understand . CLAXTON MADDEN ( rising ) Excuse me. ( whistles , crossing to window at R. ) Wait a moment .

CLAXTON MADDEN So long ! ( turns from window , rushes back , thrusts his head out ) Say , Thurston ! HAPPY THURSTON Hello ! CLAXTON MADDEN Say , what sort of time did you make up the river to-day ? HAPPY THURSTON Fine . 7-32 . CLAXTON MADDEN Good ! Twenty-five seconds gain over yesterday ! We 'll do those Beef-eaters to a turn . So long ! ( turns back into room ) Now look here , Mr. What's-yer-name , you 've got to get a move on you . ( crosses to chair R. of table ) I ca n't waste my time like this .

Go ahead . GERALD THORNE Well  --  CLAXTON MADDEN Wait a minute . I 've lost my pencil . Ah , here it is . GERALD THORNE Well , in the first place  --  ( song : " John Brown " we have  --  Sirius  --  Magnitudes of components 1 &amp; 9 , period of revolution 49 years . The proper motion of this star is subject to periodical variations and in investigating these variations , it was found they could be completely represented by supposing a satellite was revolving around the planet in a certain orbit . The elements of this orbit have been determined , except the distance of the satellite which did not admit of specification . Then we have Ursus Major  --   --  ( At cue : " in the first place , " singing is heard off R. ) ( SONG : ) " Tom Brown 's body is alive and feeling good , Tom Brown 's body here 's fact that 's understood , Tom Brown 's body has a head that 's made of wood , As we go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singing comes nearer MADDEN tries to write , his mind is distracted .

But say , fellows , is n't it a shame he 's got to work , and such a bully day , too ? Say , Clax , could n't you shut yourself up in your room and leave this to me ? I 'm expecting some ladies to tea . CLAXTON MADDEN ( L. C. ) You do n't mean to say you 've invited a bunch of dry-goods here when you knew I did n't want to be disturbed ?

What 's up ? WILFRED KENYON Kid , I 'm in an awful hole . ( crossing to C. ) TOM BROWN That 's about the tenth hole you 've struck this year . You want to be careful how you walk . WILFRED KENYON Oh , hang it , Kid ! do n't be so coldblooded . I should n't have come to you if I had n't known how fond you were of my mother and sister . Say , Kid , may I have a drink ? TOM BROWN Certainly , help yourself . ( KENYON crosses to sideboard at L. ) But do n't take too much or it will go to your head and you 'll feel like the devil in the morning . WILFRED KENYON Hang it , I 'm desperate . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --   --  TOM BROWN Oh , the dickens we do n't ! You never heard my governor laying me out , did you ? ( Opening drawer of desk and taking letter ) Just listen to this . Got a letter from him this morning . Gave me the Dickens . " My dear Tom :  --  In answer to my question as to what you intend to do on leaving college , you say you will follow your literary bent and write for money . You ought to be very proficient in that , as you have done practically nothing else for the last four years . " Did you ever meet him , Wilfred ? He has the keenest sense of humor . " Twice you have overdrawn your account and if you do it again I 'm going to take you out of college . " p. 13 WILFRED KENYON Your account . That 's just it .

WILFRED KENYON Kid , I know I 'm a selfish brute , but you need n't be so hard on me. ( sits in chair L. of desk ) TOM BROWN Oh , I 'm sorry , old man , really I 'm sorry . I 'll help you out all I can . Well , what is it ? How much ? WILFRED KENYON It 's everything . In the first place , money . I lost a hundred dollars to Ansen last month , and you know what a cad he is . TOM BROWN Oh , yes ; he 's the kind of fellow who never has but one cigarette in his case , and a pretty bad cigarette at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Hell 's that check-book ? Oh , I 've got it , under all those bills . I could n't see it . Well , how much ? A hundred ? p. 14 WILFRED KENYON Yes  --  he says he 'll go to my mother . Oh , Kid , I know I owe you a lot already but if you 'll just help me out this time  --   --  TOM BROWN That 's all right . I just said I would , did n't I ? ( KENYON rises and crosses up behind desk and to c . ) Now you want to make this go just as far as you can . I 'm rather short this month myself . Well , here it is . This is the first of April , but I guess this check is all right . ( crosses to WILFRED , hands him check ) WILFRED KENYON ( C. R. ) Say , Tom  --   --  TOM BROWN What ?

( KENYON turns as TOM calls him , and stands by door ) Wilfred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't like to knock a man , but there was n't a man in his class would have anything to do with him when he was in college . He  --  but what 's the use in repeating what he was ,  --  you know what he is ; I tell you he 's simply a shark , hanging about and looking for fool " freshies " who want to gamble and drink themselves into disgrace . WILFRED KENYON Like me ! Oh , say it ! ( crossing to C. ) When a man 's down  --  But Colton 's stood by me many times when I was down on my luck , and other fellows would n't .

He 's drinking again and I do n't know what to do with him , and  --  Oh , do n't bother about that  --  ( as CART . hands him letters ) Thank you . JOHN CARTWRIGHT Say , Tom , there 's another matter I want to see you about  --   --  ( MADDEN Enters from room at L. ) CLAXTON MADDEN ( crossing to C. and CART crossing to R. ) Say , Kid , how do I look ?

JOHN CARTWRIGHT ( takes no notice of their actions TOM begins to whistle and read book ) ( MADDEN later rises and sits on desk L. C. ) I came across a case of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South ; parents , ignorant mountain people in Tennessee . He was full of ambition  --  got a common school education , somehow  --  taught a country school  --  educated his own sister and when the old folks died , sold out the little place for a few hundred and , with his sister , came up here to work his way through Harvard . p. 19 CLAXTON MADDEN Well , why did n't he stay home and work the farm ? I 'm tired of having my leg pulled for ambitious backwoodsmen who come here with fifty cents and a writing-pad and expect to get through college on them . JOHN CARTWRIGHT Oh , now , wait a moment . CLAXTON MADDEN Oh , chestnuts ! TOM BROWN Oh , shut up and give him a chance . JOHN CARTWRIGHT He gave her most of the money left of their joint inheritance which enables her to live in a good boarding-house , and took himself to a garret in De Wolfe street . There I found him the other day , in a positively starving condition . He had lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oatmeal and water ? For three days ? My Lord ! JOHN CARTWRIGHT He was mighty stand-offish at first , but I got around him and fed him up and got him some work to do . ( rising ) Oh , he 's that fellow , Thorne , who was here to tutor you to-day . By the way , I hope you paid him . CLAXTON MADDEN No , I did n't . TOM BROWN Why did n't you ? I 'd given you the money . CLAXTON MADDEN Well , to tell you the truth , I forgot all about him . ( crossing up and around desk to door ) R. C. To door and opening it ( CART , up to C. L. of MADDEN ) Oh , hang it , I ca n't remember all these things . I 've got too much on my mind .

JOHN CARTWRIGHT ( c . ) I presume you do n't feel inclined to imitate Madden 's example this time , eh ? TOM BROWN No , I ca n't say I do . JOHN CARTWRIGHT Oh , very well , there is no reason why you you should if you do n't feel so inclined . Good-bye . TOM BROWN Good-bye  --  Oh , Cartwright , Cartwright ! JOHN CARTWRIGHT Yes . Oh , want a match ? TOM BROWN No , thanks ; this is electricity and it 's matchless . ( dodging imaginary missile ) JOHN CARTWRIGHT Oh , that ought to cost you about forty . ( closes door and comes down L. of C. ) TOM BROWN Well , it wo n't . As I was about to say , I do n't feel like imitating Madden 's example because I do n't see what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do for a fellow , if he 's the kind of fellow you say . By Jingo , there must be something pretty decent in a fellow like that , to take care of his sister and live three days in a garret on oatmeal and water . Now I 'll tell you what you can do . ( putting hands in pockets for money ) You put him down for a weekly allowance , whatever you think he can get along on , and charge it to me. ( hands money to ) CART . p. 21 JOHN CARTWRIGHT By George ! that 's great of you , Brown . TOM BROWN Oh , now , cut it out . The truth of the matter is , that fellow Thorne was here a while ago , and I dismissed him rather brusquely and I 'm sorry . I 'm easing my conscience , that 's all . JOHN CARTWRIGHT Well . Thorne will be eternally grateful to you , and he 'll pay you back , too ; he 's that sort of a fellow . TOM BROWN Now look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is that you say nothing about it to Thorne or anyone else , for that matter , you promise ? JOHN CARTWRIGHT I promise . TOM BROWN You see I do n't want the reputation of being an Andrew Carnegie . JOHN CARTWRIGHT Well , it 's a blamed fine thing you 're doing , all the same , ( crossing to door R. ) Good-bye .

If I could only see him and talk to him , my influence with him has always been good , and no matter what he is , or what he has done , I can never give him up . TOM BROWN Do you think he is really worth it , Miss Thorne . p. 23 MARIAN THORNE I know he is . It is the drink that has done it , and the cards . TOM BROWN Drink and cards . Yes , both bad things for a young man . Father told me about them the night before I came to college , but I fell asleep and it did n't do much good . MARIAN THORNE Mr. Brown , I want you to tell him that I will wait every afternoon in the same place ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to meet me there .

" ( Sung by TOM . ) ( Copyrighted by Henry Miller Company . ) I.The bead 's on the wine in our glorious youth , &nbsp; &nbsp; And life 's full of fervor and zest , And the world is made bright by the light of a smile &nbsp; &nbsp; Or the sound of the voice we love best . There 's a thrill of delight in the touch of her hand , &nbsp; &nbsp; All the earth 's bubbling over with joy ; Oh ! the love that we give to the girls that we love &nbsp; &nbsp; When we 're boys , boys , boys . Chorus.When love is young in springtime , &nbsp; &nbsp; And boys are youthful , too , And girls are so alluring &nbsp; &nbsp; What can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dimple , &nbsp; &nbsp; You 're caught , you 're captured , stung ! There 's danger in the very air , &nbsp; &nbsp; When love is young . II.There are various ways that a fellow may love , And most of us sample them all ; And the older and stronger you are when it strikes , The harder and deeper you fall.But there 's no love on earth that holds half the thrill , No love that has half the joys  --  As the love that we give to the girls that we love , When we 're boys , boys , boys . ( Chorus is repeated three times after first verse .

TOM BROWN You 're a fibber , Thurston ; that sunny smile of satisfaction on your face would bring out the dogwood blossoms in December . HAPPY THURSTON Well , you know , Kid , you 're out of the running in that direction . TOM BROWN Well , I may be a back number , but I 'm not out of print . Now you watch me.

It did n't seem like the Kid , somehow . p. 53 TUBBY ANDERSON Well , you could n't blame Miss Kenyon for being angry . CLAXTON MADDEN Yes , but she need n't have kept it up all this time .

VICTOR COLTON What a grouch you have on , Kenyon , ever since you 've been on the water-wagon you have n't been fit company for man or beast . Come on over to-night and let 's have a try at Bill Moran 's . No big game , just a little quiet  --  WILFRED KENYON ( R. of C. ) No , I wo n't . Why ca n't you let me alone , Colton , when I 'm trying to be decent ? VICTOR COLTON Let you alone ? I will , by Jove ! Why , you talk as though we were a sort of Mephisto and Faust layout . Nice innocent little Faust , you . Well , you ca n't say that I 'm the cause of all your troubles anyway . Day-day , until you are better humored.

How you have bored me about that girl  --  Oh , see here , Kenyon , do n't you look so down . I 'm a friend of yours , we 've had some bully good times together and I 'm not going to let your little temper spoil it all . Come along over to town and let 's make a night of it . WILFRED KENYON I ca n't if I would . ( crossing in front to C. ) I have n't any money . VICTOR COLTON As if that made any difference . I 'm reeking with coin .

VICTOR COLTON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about enough cheek from you ! ( crossing to KEN . at C. ) Oh , but I 'm not going to quarrel with you . I like you , Kenyon , and I want to help you out of the hole you are in . Why , I came over especially to-day to put you in the way of making a nice little sum of money , just for the trouble of stooping for it . p. 55 WILFRED KENYON Stooping for it ? VICTOR COLTON Well  --  er  --  I suppose you 'd call it stooping . You see the odds on the big race are two to one for the ' Varsity against the Englishmen . WILFRED KENYON I know that ; but I have n't any money to bet . VICTOR COLTON Ah , but I have ! you see , and I 'm placing every penny I can get hold of on the English crew  --  because they are going to win and it is you who will be the cause of their winning .

On the morning of the 30th , just before the race , his sister is going to leave Cambridge suddenly . WILFRED KENYON What are you proposing to me ? Betray my college  --  my own friends  --  Colton , I know I am of no account , weak and good-for-nothing , I know that , but , if I am capable of such treachery  --  such rottenness as you seem to think , then I want to die right now .

You 're no worse than any of the other fellows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ask you to do ? You told me yourself you were going to marry the girl in spite of her brother and your family 's objections . All I ask is that you fix it up a little sooner than you otherwise would , on the morning of the 30th , and if the Englishmen win , I owe you five hundred dollars . Shall I put that down as a bet ? ( he takes book from his pocket ) WILFRED KENYON No  --  and , Colton , I tell you right now , I am done with you ! ( crosses in front to R. COLTON grabs his arm in passing ) VICTOR COLTON ( detaining him ) But I have n't done with you , not quite . What would Thorne do to you if I should tell him what I know ? Fellows like that do n't handle men of your sort with gloves . You will do as I tell you or I shall accomplish the same result in another , and for you , a very unpleasant way .

MARIAN THORNE ( coming to him ) Oh , how happy that makes me . WILFRED KENYON ( turns to her ) Marian , does it ? Ah , then it is worth the fight . ( crosses to R. ) If I were to come to you some day , and ask you to go away with me , if I were not to explain why , but just say to you that my whole future  --  my whole happiness  --  depended upon your placing yourself blindly in my hands ; that by doing so you would give me a fresh start , a new lease on life , would you give up everything for me ? Would you go , dear , would you ? p. 58 MARIAN THORNE Why you know that I would . WILFRED KENYON And  --  you would n't  --  you would n't fail me ? MARIAN THORNE No , never  --  but why ?

Marian , I ca n't understand your silence in a matter of this kind . I do n't like any of that fast rich set . A poor girl , such as you , is better without acquaintances of that kind . Understand , Marian , it is my earnest wish that you will not speak to him again . I dislike Brown above any of them except Madden . They despise us because we are so poor . Well , let them . MARIAN THORNE Oh , they do n't feel that way , Gerald . GERALD THORNE Oh , yes they do . They 're all rotten with the pride of inherited money . They have n't any use for the man who has n't the price . MARIAN THORNE Brother , do you ever think it may be one of these rich students who is helping you through college ? GERALD THORNE ( savagely turning to her ) If I thought that  --  Oh , but no  --  you do n't know them . Selfish to the core . Help me ?

TOM BROWN Really ? What do you want to see me about ? p. 61 MARIAN THORNE Yes . To ask you if my rash folly in coming to your rooms that day had hurt you with your friends ? TOM BROWN No , it 's all right . Do n't you worry about it . It 's bound to come out all right . MARIAN THORNE It is then as I feared . Miss Kenyon is angry with you still . TOM BROWN She is a little angry , I confess . She has n't answered any of my letters . MARIAN THORNE Oh , it seems dreadful that I should have brought this on you , who have been so kind to Wilfred and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? MARIAN THORNE Why , the money you loaned him .

She was n't so awfully angry , she speaks to me at least . And then I saw your mother and explained it to her , and she understood it perfectly . She thought I got out of it nicely under the circumstances , and said that I might call again . But you  --  you wo n't forgive , so I know it 's gone deeper with you . That 's how I know you care . EVELYN KENYON I do n't consider the explanation you gave mother a satisfactory one at all . TOM BROWN Well , I can give you an entirely different one if you want it . EVELYN KENYON Tom , you 're so  --  so provoking . Now why wo n't you be frank with me ? TOM BROWN How can I be " frank " with you when I 'm " Tom " to everybody else ? EVELYN KENYON Oh !

TOM BROWN Oh ! no , not Madden . But I assure you there was no disloyalty to you in her being there , and  --  you know , Evey , this spirit of suspicion is a very bad thing ; do n't let it grow on you . You see , when a wife ca n't trust her husband  --   --  EVELYN KENYON ( amazed ) But , I 'm not your wife . TOM BROWN No , but you 're going to be .

TOM BROWN Yes , but there 's a lot of fellows fussing around you all the time , and there is n't one of them thinks half as much of you as I do . EVELYN KENYON ( crossing slowly to L. of tree ) Oh , I do n't know . Mr. Thurston just told me that he loved the ground I walked on . ( leans against tree , back to TOM ) p. 73 TOM BROWN Well , that 's very nice of him . Is that all he loves , just the ground ? ( crossing to her ) You know I 'd rather love you than the ground . ( places his arm around her , she releases herself , goes around L. of tree , comes down R. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'll  --  you ca n't get around me that way . TOM BROWN Well , I 'll get around you this way . ( tries to embrace her . She turns to C. ) EVELYN KENYON ( R. of C. ) Tom , you wo n't take me seriously . TOM BROWN ( c . ) I 'll take you any way I can get you . EVELYN KENYON ( turning to him ) Now I 'm really hurt and angry  --   --  TOM BROWN No , you 're not .

Say , Evey , let 's come to Hecuba ! Wo n't you let me put the ring on again ? EVELYN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decidedly ) No . TOM BROWN I wish you would . You do n't know how broken up I was that day you sent it back . You know I 'm not much on talk , but there has never been anyone but you , Evey , ever since I first met you , you  --  you know we are just like that  --  every member of our family . ( quartette singing " Fair Harvard " is heard off in L. , and vestry bell is R. ) Father could never see any other proposition but mother , she was " the one " and , only , ever since he was a boy . Oh ! hang it , Evey , let me put it on again . It will make me very happy . Let me put the ring on again . ( puts his arm around her ) EVELYN KENYON No , Tom , no . It was foolish anyway  --  you pledging yourself before even your college days were over , before you 'd really known any other girls . TOM BROWN Oh , hang it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( turning to him ) Honest ? p. 75 TOM BROWN Honest . EVELYN KENYON Well , you may keep the flower  --   --  TOM BROWN Then you will take the ring ? EVELYN KENYON No , I wo n't take the ring . TOM BROWN Well , just take it till over Sunday . EVELYN KENYON No , not yet , but  --  you may come and see me . TOM BROWN May I ? EVELYN KENYON Oh ! but I have n't forgiven you , not really forgiven you ; and you are not to try to kiss me , never . TOM BROWN What are you talking about , never ?

TOM BROWN I gave her no money . GERALD THORNE Do n't quibble with me ! But you gave her a check . You 're a liar and a scoundrel , and I 'm going to treat you the way we do thieves down in my country !

You , Madden , my room-mate for four years , you ought to be ashamed of yourself ! And you , Thurston , and you , and the rest of you . I tell you you 've got to stop sitting in judgment on me . I ca n't explain about the check and I 'm not going to say anything more about it either , but every man in this room has got to say he believes me , or Damnation and Hell !

What kind of fellows are you talking about ? Wilfred , I 'm no saint , but if a girl  --  young , pure and innocent , which Miss Thorne is  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the opinion of the world on the other , I 'd stick to that girl through Hell-fire , for I 'd know that she loved me , and nothing she might gain in all the world except that love I could give her . You 're ashamed about that check because the rotten standards of our world have made it a worse thing for so-called gentleman to steal money than to steal woman 's heart ,  --  something , Wilfred , that all the money in the world ca n't buy back again . I tell you , that girl , with her purity and devotion , is a queen . She 's much too good to be thrown away on a deucespot like you . WILFRED KENYON Oh , Kid , you 're right . I 'm rotten clean through . I 'm worse than you think . That girl 's leaving town was nothing ! I never intended even to follow her  --  I  --  did it for Colton .

Why did you send that girl away ? Why did she have your check ? How could you , when we all loved you so ? How could you have broken our hearts like this ?
