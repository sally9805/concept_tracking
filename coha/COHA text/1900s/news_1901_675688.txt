txt As the curtain fell on the excerpt from " Uncle Tom 's Cabin . " which vas the fifteenth and last number/ on the programme of the annual benefit given at the Academy of Music last night for the Actors ' Fund of America by the vaudeville profession , William A. Brady , De Wolf Hopper , and Dan Daly were arrested on a charge of violating the statute prohibiting performances in costume on Sundays . Messrs . Hopper and Daly had e rpearcd in costumes that , according to Inspector Thompson . wade them amenable to the law , while Mr. Bm ady was arrested as manager , he with Hornier having promoted the affair . Mr. Hopper wore a dress coat with tails reaching to the ground , and , of course , the wig that always conceals his lack of hair , while Mr. Daly was dressed in a white duck suit with trousers tucked into boottops and a long bristling gray mustache . The audience was leaving the theatre and the.great majority of them were on their way home before any one knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known to those who had not gotten away there were many expressions of disgust and condemnation of the proceeding . which all of them seemed to regard as arbitrary and uncalled for . Mr. Brady , accompanied by Edward Gilmore , manager of the house , went to the East Twenty-second Street Station with Inspector Thompson . while two detectives remained behind to bring Messrs . Daly and Hopper as soon as they could doff the offending costumes . At the station house Mr. Brady turned upon the Inspector . " I suppose , " said he , " the Committee of Fifteen is responsible for this ? " " I 'm doing my duty . Sir , " returned the Inspector . " No Committee of Fifteen runs this Police Department " Mr. Brady . aughed and asked if he could use the telephone , and the Inspector consenting , he called up the Academy of Music . " Have Daly and Hopper left yet ? " he asked the man at the other end . He waited a few seconds and then laughed . ? " They 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says he 's no jailbird , " Mr. Brady told the Sergeant . Inspector Thompson clapped a hand into the little aide pocket known to fame , and the equally well-known and frequently described little billy came to light . Shaking it savagely in the direction of the Academy the Inspector shouted : " I 'll swear out a bench warrant for him in the morning and serve it on the stage at Weber &; Fields 's to-morrow night . " " He 's a fighter and you had better look out , for he 'll lick yon , billy and all , " returned Mr. Brady . " I 'm something of a fighter myself , ? ? snapped the Inspector . The listeners smiled in remembrance of Madison Square Qarden . At this point th appearance of Mr. Hopper in full dress and silk hat cooled down the Inspector . " Mr. Hopper , " he said . " I understood from Mr. Brady that you had skipped , and I told him that if you had I would arrest you on the stage at Weber &; Fields 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean : Why , that would break up the show , I 'd be out of the east , and they have only a week more in town , " answered Mr. Hopper with a smile . " Why , take your part ** interred the Int pector , ? ' and Lillian would n't object . ' e 'd make the hit of the season . " " You 'd better ask her first . " said Hopper. " she 's rather particular . " " Leave that to me . Now , you 'd better sign your bonds as It 's getting late , and I 'm not used to staying out late . Besides . I 've got to get up my part in the morning , " the Inspector said . " How old are you Mr. Daly ? " asked the Sergeant . " Twenty-one , " said the comedian , with that sad expression at which people smile . On the blotter his age was made thirtyfour . " How old are you ? ? ? Hopper was asked . " Seventy-five , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sergeant , looking at hint reflectively . After answering the usual questions as to occupation , &r..; they signed the bonds and were told to be in court at 0:30 o'clock this morning . Edward Gilmore went on the bonds of all thre e . " Well , Dan , " said Mr. Hopper , " we were pinched for acting in the legitimate . Never again will I stray from the happy family of Weber &; Fields . " " Yes , that 's why they pulled us. " assented Mr. Daly . Before he went , however . Mr. Hopper said that a clergyman was at the bottom of the arrests . " We got a tip yesterday , " said he , " that trouble was abrewing . A preacher in the city complained to the police . and of course the Inspector had to do exactly what he did . " " Was it Dr. Parkhurst ? " asked the reporter . I do n't know his name , " replied Mr. Hopper . ? ' It 's a funny thing , " he continued , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one of the most worthy causes in the world , should have been so dealt with . We 've had a hard time getting a hall , the White Rats having most of them . When we did manage to secure the Academy , we worked night and day to get together a good show . i-paring neither time nor pains . As to the fact that the performance was given on a Sunday . I may say that that is the only day that the actor is not engaged with his company . For my part I do n't care anything for this arrest . I 'm so happy on account of the magnificent house that we had and the money that we 've been able to get for the cause . We gathered in over $3,000 for the fund . Still , it does seem to me that when actors who are busy the rest of the week decide to do something on Sunday for their unfortunate brethren and give a performance so clean as that of to-night , those who say they are religious ought not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
