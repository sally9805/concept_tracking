 | ONE of the deepest of the many pleasant impressions which New Zealand makes upon the visitor is that in its public affairs it is a land of peace and probity . The incessant clamor of investigation into the conduct of public and semi-public business , the dust and stench of constant disclosures , which have come to be almost the normal condition of life in the United States , are practically unknown in that island colony of the southern seas . Such a national disgrace as the insurance scandals , which have so shocked and amazed the American public , would be impossible there . The methods of the Government insurance department and the honesty and publicity with which the office is administered give absolute confidence to the New Zealander insured therein . In thirty-six years there has not been even a suspicion of wrongdoing in the department . Government life insurance has had a thoro test in the colony , but fire insurance is one of its recent experiments . The life insurance department began work in 1870 , having been established because of the failure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policies . It was the result of a general public conviction that there must be greater security in life insurance and that their own government was the likeliest place in which to find it . The act establishing the department was passed by unanimous vote of Parliament . The Government insurance office does business in competition with all the other companies that wish to enter its field , and it has not only beaten them in the contest but is steadily gaining on their business . It does 41 per cent . of the entire life insurance business of the colony , and now transacts the largest amount of new business . Ten foreign companies compete with it . Six of these are Australian , two British , and two are American , the New York Life and the New York Equitable . The two latter have been in the colony nearly twenty years , and hold together only 3,000 policies , assuring $5,500,000 . The big Australian Mutual , Provident Association is the only foreign company that transacts anything near the amount of the Government business . It has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policies , assuring $40 , - 000,000 . The Government office has in force over 44,000 policies , assuring $55 , - 000,000 . The utmost publicity is afforded by the reports issued annually and triennially , which give full details of the work and progress of the office . An English insurance expert has declared that in form and contents its annual report is well deserving of imitation by all offices that court public inspection . But the unique distinction of this insurance office is that behind every policy stands the Government of New Zealand . guaranteeing its payment . No fears need ever disturb the mind of the policy-holder concerning his security . The department is co-operative and is conducted on practically the same methods used by private mutual life insurance companies . , It is entirely self-supporting . even to its telegrams and postage , and the expenses and taxes are borne by the policy-holders , who share the whole of the profits . Its officials work for modest salaries , comparable to what they would be able to command elsewhere , and these they endeavor to earn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The department does not consider the creation of a big surplus to be sound business management , and , as it does not have to pay large sums to legislative agents , contribute to campaign funds , or create kind-  | ly feeling by means of expensive social functions , the policy-holders find there is something to share when the profits are divided . These now accrue at the rate of nearly $350,000 per annum . The department has distributed in dividends to policy-holders $5,000,000 in cash . Bonuses are allotted every three years , out by a recent arrangement interim bonuses are given in the case of claims by death or maturity , and are included in all calculations of surrender values , whether the policies are actually surrendered or are borrowed upon or the premiums are overdue . It is the policy of the office to make things as easy as possible for those who get into temporary financial straits , and in accordance with this purpose the policy-holder who is compelled to surrender receives the proper proportion of accrued bonuses for every premium paid since the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brotherly spirit which marks the administration of every department of the New Zealand Government . This kindly unwillingness to take advantage of another 's necessities is shown also in the system by which a policy on which premiums are overdue continues in force automatically . The 27,000 policyholders in the Equitable who have allowed their policies to lapse during the insurance disclosures and convulsions would no doubt be thankful were such a scheme in force here . Surrender values and loan values are allowed after two years , and if after that time the premium is not paid an account is opened crediting the policyholder with the surrender value and increases therein , and debiting him with premiums and interest thereon as they fall due . As long as the amount to credit exceeds the amount owing , the policy is in full force , and in the event of death or maturity the sum assured and bonuses less the arrears with interest are paid . During one recent year twenty-nine overdue policies fell in by the deaths of the persons assured , and , altho on most of them not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or more , the department recognized claims upon them to the amount of $40,000 , exclusive of bonuses . Lapsed policies which have not acquired a surrender value , or in which the surrender value has become exhausted , may be revived within twelve months by giving proof of health and paying arrears and a fine . The policy of a holder committing suicide within six months of the date of the policy does or does not become void , according to the discretion of the commissioner . If he is satisfied after making careful inquiry that there was no suicidal : intention at the time of the taking out of the policy he pays the claim . The extent to which the officials of the New Zealand Government are allowed to exercise their common sense and their human feeling in their dealings with the people is a hit surprising . In every department one meets with that same kindliness and fair play instead of a strict adherence to the letter of the law . It has the effect of making the Government in its relation to the people seem more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Endowment assurance is the class of policy chiefly issued . This fact makes comparison of New Zealand rates with those in this country somewhat difficult , but they are lower than those charged by the private companies doing business in the colony . The Australian Provident Association pays larger bonuses , but charges higher premiums . But it is a much older institution and has branches in many parts of the world , while the department does little business outside the colony . The death rate in New Zealand is the lowest of any country in the world , and this fact , of course , helps to make possible both lower rates and larger profits . The premiums originally adopted by the insurance department were very low , and were not framed to provide bonuses . But even these low rates produced surpluses from the beginning , and when it was found necessary to provide bonuses in order to compete with the private companies the rates were raised . The premium now charged on an endowment policy for $500 taken out at the age of thirty years and payable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; in thirty years , $15 ; in twenty years , $22 . Extra premiums are not charged for women , nor for any occupation other than that of engaging in the manufacture or sale of intoxicating liquors . Under-average lives are accepted at increased rates , or the proposer , instead of paying an increased premium , may agree that a de-  | duction shall be made from the sum assured in the event of death within a certain period . The liquor question is always alive and extremely vigorous in New Zealand , and therefore it was found advisable to start a temperance branch , which contains only policies on the lives of total abstainers . The accounts of this branch are so kept that if there are any profits arising from superior vitality they may be enjoyed exclusively by those who have earned them . The bonuses in the two sections do not differ materially , sometimes one and sometimes the other being a trifle the larger . The investments of the insurance department are controlled by a board consisting of the Colonial Treasurer , the Surveyor General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The investments are mainly confined to New Zealand Government securities and to loans to local bodies and policy-holders and on real estate . Its assets are $18,800,000 . Its income for 1904 , from new premiums , renewals and interest , amounted to nearly $2,500,000 and its expenses were 20 per cent . of the premium income . Since its inception it has paid $13,500,000 in claims . During the last fifteen years there has been an increase of 62 per cent . in the number of policies in force , of 40 per cent . in the sum assured , of 265 per cent . in the bonuses , of 768 per cent . in the annuities , of 61 per cent . in the income , of 132 per cent . in the accumulated funds , and a decrease of 6 per cent . in the expenses of management and of 33 per cent . in the ratio of total expenses to total income . An accident insurance branch was opened in 1901 , mainly for the purpose of covering the liabilities of employers of labor , which had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act passed the previous year . Personal accident policies are also issued . The costs of conducting the business are carried entirely by the accident branch and the life funds are in no case liable . A combined insurance and annuity scheme has been in operation since 1893 . In return for monthly deductions amounting to about $25 annually for every $500 of salary the insurance department contracts to give a uniform initial insurance of $500 , increasing with the salary , until the age of sixty is reached , and after that an annuity varying with the age at entry . These policies are placed in a separate table , but are merged in the general business , and share in the distribution of profits . The scheme is compulsory upon all civil servants who do not insure of their own wish . But more than 90 per cent . of the Government employees have taken out their insurance of their own initiative . They may insure in whatever company they choose . A little more than a year ago a fire insurance department was established , in compliance with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept rates at an exorbitant figure , and , as the life insurance department had proved so successful , the people all over the colony demanded that the Government should go into the business and establish fair rates and a more liberal policy . The department opened its doors with a flat reduction of to per cent . in all classes of business . The private companies met this , and then cut under still farther by a reduction of 33 1-3 per cent . on dwellings ? the " W " of insurance classification ? and the Government promptly made its rates the same . There the rate question has rested ever since , while the companies have been trying a flank movement . 1 f the owner of an insured property takes out a Government policy the underwriters cancel his insurance . If the Government can not take a risk the owner finds that the private cornpanics at once raise the rates . The companies refuse to recognize the department or reinsure its risks . But it has been able to make reinsurance arrangements with Lloyds ' in London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is careful not to jeopardize the interests of its clients in its fight with the private companies , and if it can not take the whole of a big risk it cancels its own business rather than subject the owner of the property to the boycott of the combine . The fire insurance department has saved to the people in the first year of its operation more than half a million dollars in premiums . The commissioner is well satisfied with the results of the first year 's work . But he is a conservative man , and said that he did not consider it a sufficient test of the merits of the scheme .
