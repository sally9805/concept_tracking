 | THE possibility is suggested of a Congressional compromise on the Ship Subsidy bill which has just passed the Senate but is yet held up by the I louse Committee . It is asserted that this compromise may result in a new bill practically eliminating the Pacific mail lines , and l am asked to give my views as to the absolute needs of other transpacific lines than those which may run to the Philippines , which are excepted from the proposed elimination . Briefly , the necessity is imperative that the mail routes in question receive Government protection and encouragement , if they are to continue to fly the American flag on the Pacific . I might speak in a general way , as an American citizen conversant with Pacific commerce , as a resident of the Pacific Coast jealous for its development , knowing the local benefits and the possibilities of trade to the whole country to be derived thru American shipping for American products , and the blow which it must inevitably be to our entire nation if our flag is forced from the Pacific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple business proposition , if obliged to comply with American laws and shipping conditions , which render the cost of operation very materially higher than is the case with the ships of any other nation , and left without Government aid to compete with these ships , all of which are heavily subsidized by their respective Governments . I might , on purely patriotic grounds , refer to the disastrous effects if our products , our manufactures , mails and traveling public are to he left to depend ? even in time of peace ? entirely upon such service as foreign ships find it for their advantage to render . I might suggest the embarrassment to our nation in time of war and the fatal blow to our commerce if our flag is removed from this ocean and the supremacy of the Pacific which she is so assiduously striving to obtain , is thus early and and easily surrendered to Japan . Put in so doing I might lay myself open to the charge of speaking with a double purpose or sinister motive , on account of my personal interest in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ocean Mail Route No. 75. 1 will , therefore , take the bull by the horns and use this line as a single instance , giving as briefly as possible a few exact and significant details which will be more convincing of what I have already suggested than any general argument could be . I will confine myself to the potent facts in the story of this one line , running from San Francisco to Australia , via Honolulu , Pago Pago and New Zealand , with exact figures and careful comparisons , sufficient I am sure , to convince any thinking man ? patriot . shipper or producer ? that if there are benefits to be derived by our commerce or our country , thru an American merchant marine , such Pacific lines as the Oceanic have a more just claim for Government protection , stand in greater need of it and will return a better compensation than any other lines engaged in ocean traffic . It should also be borne in mind that the trade already gained by this line , thru a losing struggle of years ,  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may follow the opening of new lines ? and is as well worth saving from surrender to some foreign nation as any new trade is worth achieving . I confine myself to this one line not because it stands alone but because concerning it I know every minute detail and can be frank to acknowledge its losses in exact figures which tell the whole story better than many words and place the proposition fairly and clearly before the mind of any practical business man . Previous to the McKinley Administration the Oceanic Steamship Company was operating a line between the same points as at present , composed of two American steamships and one British ship , of a little over three thousand tons each , jointly making thirteen trips a year and receiving $135,000 per annum for carrying the American outward mails . The growth of commerce , competition and changing trade conditions rendered it necessary to increase the size and speed of these ships if the route was to be sustained . President McKinley and Postmaster-General Smith , recognizing the importance of maintaining the only direct mail route between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the law of March 3d , 1891 , for a service to be performed by vessels of the second class ( not less than 5,000 tons register ) , making seventeen trips per annum , time of voyage to be twenty-one clays ; these vessels to be constructed in America , capable of sixteen knots speed and to meet the requirements of auxiliary naval cruisers ; the rate of compensation for such vessels , for mail carrying , to be not over $2 per mile for the outward trip . The Oceanic Company was the only bidder , and entered upon a ten-year contract with the Government , immediately building three steamers , as required , of a little over six thousand tons each and of seventeen knots speed . It began the new service in 1901 . The schedule time requires an average speed thruout the voyage of fifteen knots . The distance in nautical measure is 7.210 miles . Most of the voyage lies thru the tropics . No other steamship line in the world performs such a fast service under similar conditions of climate and distance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three American steamships available as auxiliary cruisers , a reduction of time in the delivery of mails from twenty-four and three-quarters days to twenty-one days , an increase in the number of voyages per annum from thirteen to seventeen , with better facilities for transportation , an increase in the number of crew demanded , from T82 to 471 , all , by law , required to be white , a certain percentage American citizens , all shipped in. the United States , and eighteen American boys as cadets ; resulting in an increase , in wages alone , of 8144.120 per annum . Each of the three steamships thus made available as auxiliary cruisers , built under Government inspection , is capable of mounting at least four sixinch guns and a large complement of smaller caliber , has a steaming radius without refueling of 8.25o statute miles at fifteen knots average speed ? shorter distances at seventeen knots ? and must always be maintained at the company- 's expense , at the highest rating known to maritime commerce . All of this advantage to commerce and postal service , increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States , annually , less to maintain than one man-ofwar , of the type of the " Buffalo , " and that without any consideration of interest , depreciation , insurance and taxes , borne by the company . Years of actual operation have clearly demonstrated the inadequacy of the compensation already allowed , under the conditions of speed , frequency of voyage and size of vessels required on the Australian mail route . I believe that the figures will easily demonstrate this . The Oceanic line must maintain its position against the operation of six important steamship companies , all heavily subsidized by their respective nations ? England , Germany , France and Japan ? in order to secure for these nations the valuable trade of the Australasian markets . England has the natural advantage that they are British colonies . ' The American Consul at Sydney . in his report of November roth , 1904 , says : " There is a strong sentiment favoring British goods . without regard to quality or price . ' ' Germany and France seek  | by greatly overshadowing subsidies to enable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the race more vigorously than all the rest , not only to secure the trade , regardless , but to establish herself in maritime supremacy on the Pacific . Incidentally , as the result of increased subsidies , German lines , a few months ago , began carrying freight from Europe to Australia for five shillings a ton . This indicates the appreciation of the German Government of the value of the Australasian trade . Speed , frequency of voyage and type of vessel employed are all factors in this race , and we must meet a constant advancement along these lines to keep pace with the growth of commerce and competition . But in addition to this United States ships must meet by far the most stringent and exacting shipping laws , greatly increasing the burden and expense , on one hand , while it contends against heavily subsidized ships on the ether hand , handicapping it beyond the possibility of sustaining itself in the unequal struggle . The Oceanic Line is hopelessly outclassed by these others , not only in the matter of subsidies , but also in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must pay , in the original cost of its vessels and in the cost of maintenance and operation so that above the compensation for carrying the mails , under the contract I have mentioned , the average annual loss , on ocean mail route NO. 75 , has been just $373,349.02 . To make clear what I have said of the direct competition with which the Oceanic Line is brought in contact , as effected by subsidies , on one side , the accompanying table of lines . all having Australia as their terminal , will show something of the present inequality . It will he seen by this table that the lowest subsidy paid is to the British Peninsular and Oriental Line -- $313 per voyage less than the amount paid to the Oceanic Line ; but the British line is allowed to carry Lascar crews , giving it overwhelming advantage in the matter of wages as well as in the cost of feeding the crew , and two knots an hour less speed is required of their vessels , while their original cost , to build , ton for ton was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Allowing 20 per cent . for greater efficiency of American firemen , the wages paid by the Oceanic company still exceed those paid by the British company just $123,404 a year . The excess of speed required of the Oceanic Line means the additional consumption of over thirty tons of coal a day , which amounts to $97,996 a year , besides the loss of freight space required by the extra coal . The insurance , interest and depreciation on the extra cost of its vessels amounts to $123,690 a year to the American line . I t the same scale of food were used on the American and on the British line the saving in the cost of feeding the men , alone , would amount to $32,217 per annum . So that the actual cost of operating the Oceanic Line exceeds the cost of operating the British line under precisely the same conditions , $447,567 a year . In other words , if the Oceanic steamships were British built and allowed the freedom of the British line it would cost $447,567 a year less to operate them . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a schedule of fifteen knots , so that so far as this comparison relates to a claim upon Government aid , the items bearing upon coal consumption should be eliminated , which would leave $285,311 as the actual difference in operating the line under American conditions as against British conditions ? the actual handicap placed upon the line by American shipping requirements . And it must be borne in mind that these comparisons are based upon the conditions of the lowest subsidized of all the lines with which the Oceanic comes in competition . Any advantages which the line may have are represented in its gross income , and the disadvantages in its gross expenses . The annual deficiency of $373,349 tells the story and the comparison shows where it occurs . Ob-  | viously this must in some way be made good if the mail route is to exist as a distinct American service , for the Oceanic Line has staving qualities and has proven its ability to exist against odds , if any line could . Personally I can not conceive of arguments which could justify encouraging new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this established line to Australia . In this latter connection there are doubtless very few who realize the difference in cost of operation which exists even in our own shipping between the Atlantic and Pacific . The experience of years confirms as a conservative estimate that there is a difference of over 30 per cent . in the price of wages and fuel , between the two oceans . 1 wish that I might emphasize this fact . If it were possible to apply the Atlantic Ocean rates of wages and price of fuel to the American steamships sailing out of San Francisco , the Oceanic line would effect an annual saving of $249,883 . The Oceanic Line is obliged to pay the highest wages of any ocean steamship line in the world . Its ports of call bring it under the law which prevents its having Lascar crews . It employs all white men and besides carrying eighteen American cadets , required , and shipping its crews in the United States , in order to obtain the necessary percentage of American citizens for its crews , it is forced to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hire none but union men . The total amount paid per annum in wages by the Oceanic Line , is $235,440 . If the same crews were paid on the basis governing the CanadianAustralian Line , the total amount would be but $176,690 . If they were paid on the basis of the Peninsular and Oriental line , the amount would be only $123,404 . I f they were paid on the basis of wages on the Nippon Yusen Kaisha , the Japanese line , the total amount would be $97 , - 708 . The importance to the United States of maintaining the present mail service is significantly expressed in the growth of our trade with British Australasia . From 1896 to 1900 our imports were $20 , - 449,640 . Our exports were $79,095,730 . From 1900 to 1904 , the four years following , our imports were $24,250,761 , an increase of only $3,807,121 , but our exports were $118,756,924 , an increase of $39,661,194 . It does not make the prospect of new trade with South America less alluring to protest , as an American citizen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Our exports to Australia compare well with others that we consider valuable markets .. In the year ending June 30th , 1904 , our exports to British Australasia were $27 , - 343,741 , to Cuba were $26,908,986 , to Japan $24,955,032 , to China , including Hong Kong , $28,861,035 . Surely such a trade is worth conserving. especially when we consider that of them all it is vet in its infancy and that it has been wrested for America under difficulties which , if removed , leave promise of still greater increase . The thread which binds this trade to the United States is the one direct mail service performed by the Oceanic Line at an annual loss of $373,349 . This , to my mind -- and I am sure without prejudice ? constitutes as good a claim as could exist , for Government protection . No market in the world can be won and retained without mail communication . It is the imperative need of commerce . It compels the nations , regardless of expense , to foster and expand their postal service . The better the facilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All nations transport their mails under their own flag if possible , and the constant effort , everywhere , is to secure the most rapid and frequent means of communication between cities , States or countries , because all the world recognizes that the approach to the market must be quick and convenient . Hence the imperative demand for fast and frequent passenger and mail steamers on all the ocean highways of the world ? steamers flying the American flag if we would induce foreign capital to invest in the products of the United States . I feel this as an American , not as shipowner personally interested in any  | line ; not even as a Californian jealous for the development of the Pacific Coast . For even if the portion allotted to the Oceanic Steamship Company in the original subsidy bill is finally credited to her . it will not make the line a paying investment . It will only enable it to continue the service which it has heretofore been rendering at such a loss as to make further efforts hopelessly unadvisable . The foregoing is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines to South America should be encouraged by subsidy , in the hope of building up a trade , while the Pacific , with such trade as I have indicated already established and a trade that is rapidly increasing , should he ignored and the position deliberately sacrificed and abandoned . Wholly aside from its commercial value there are two reasons of national importance ? grave and economical importance Lo the Government ? why such a line as the Oceanic should be protected and sustained . It is the only means of regular communication with Tutuila , the insular possession of the United States , where the Government Naval Station of Pago Pago is established . This is the best port of the South Pacific Ocean , a highly strategic position of great value , nearer to Manila by 1,341 miles than by way of Honolulu and Guam . Oceanic steamships call there twice every three weeks , thus saving the Government the expense of a special service , which would be indispensable , as there is no cable or other means of communication . The other reason is the naval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Spanish War , in the Russian-Japanese War , in the British South African War . The three United States converted cruisers , " Buffalo , " " Yankee " and " Prairie , " of practically the same registered tonnage , of only 11,200 horsepower and fourteen knot speed , with an armament of twenty-two guns , from four to six inch and other of smaller caliber , cost the United States , in 1904 , over $1,041,000 to maintain and keep in commission . The Oceanic fleet , " Sonoma , " " Sierra " and " Ventura , " built under Government specifications for speedy conversion into auxiliary cruisers TIII PACT FIC I3 for the navy , 22,500 horse-power , seventeen knots , capable of an armament of twelve six-inch guns , with a large complement of smaller caliber , cost the Government only $196,402.84 , in 1904 , by way of a mail contract . Is it not obviously cheaper for the Government to subsidize naval auxiliary cruisers which in time of peace are upbuilding commerce at private expense and anxiety , ready at short notice to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bear the entire cost of maintenance of an equal amount of tonnage of no practical service except in time of war ? Within the past few weeks imaginative Americans have talked of immediate war with japan . It is not immediately possible , but every one knows that it is a remote contingency . Every one knows , too , that Japan , having already a steamship line from Yokohama to the Pacific Coast and from Yokohama to Australia , is anxious to complete a triangle , tending toward her ambition for Pacific supremacy , with a line from America to Australia . Suppose that thru lack of protection to balance the imposed burdens the few American flags now flying on the Pacific are forced to surrender our commerce , mail and passenger traffic to the waiting Japanese , and then ? suppose the Nvar ! Suppose it occurred before the Panama Canal was completed . It is not commerce and passenger traffic and mails alone which would suffer . Where would the United States find ships even to transport her soldiers and war material beyond the coast to all our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ships from everywhere on the Atlantic for the puny Spanish War , and even then we were very short . Ships are not so abundant on the Pacific , and would be very scarce if the war was with japan . To my mind it behooves us to make every effort to get more instead of abandoning what we have , looking at the matter from whatever point of view we may , and it is difficult to comprehend as statesmanlike the penny-wise and wasteful and sacrificial economy which objects to just protection enough to protect our merchant marine on the Pacific .
