A. C McClurg &; Co. , who have had in preparation for some time a new edition of George Eliot 's ' Romola , ' edited and illustrated from the historical standpoint by the distinguished Italian scholar , Dr. Guido Biagi , have just received the following note from him ? " The work is more important than I imagined I have found the original cards of all the books studied by George Eliot here in the National Library for ' Ito-mole , ' These books , with their ancient views of Florence , gave to her the first idea of the scenery of the novel I have reproduced the cards , signed by Lewes , studying with her " The work is to be issued uniform with Mrs MciMahan 's ' Florence in the Poetry of the Brownings ' and ' With Shelley in Italy , ' in two volumes The American Unitarian Association announces ' James Martineau , Theologian and Teacher , ' by J.

Nevertheless , " abridged " and cheaper editions ( at twenty-five cents ) will help supply the semi-popular demand for those translations in the schools . This abridgment of Homer , accomplished by Prof G. R. Carpenter , however convenient for the general and hasty reader , will hardly content every teacher who wishes to put either the Iliad or the Odyssey into the hands of a class in English Some teachers , confessing a peculiar respect for the translations in question , must still desire to see them obta n-able entire at a price that is not prohibi --  tive for large classes Further , useful and careful as Professor Carpenter 's excision of Homer may be , one may doubt whether SO delicate an operation should not have been entrusted to a professed Grecian The untutored may likewise raise this query ?

There is much refreshment in coming upon a collection of folk-tales which are really new and not an imperfect retelling from other tongues of the same old motifs  --  alter et dem Even though their absolute authority may be dubious and their artistic elaboration certain , Madame Helene Vac/reset:as ' Songs o ? the Valiant Voivode ' ( Scribners ) , a sequel to her ' Bard of the Dimbovitza , ' takes us into a Marches-world as far from that of central and western Europe as any collection of Turkish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tone are these Rumanian stories , and yet it is plain that the centuries ? of Balkan conflict have fused into them , in strange mixture , both the Slavic melancholy ? that strange modern melancholy , different from the Celtic and still more from the Teutonic  --  which meets us only there , and also the Turkish gorgeousness , its nomadic instinct and sense of space and air . Entirely different are the gypsy stories , half picaresque , half supernatural , altogether humorous . To what degree the form is the collector 's and translator 's , only a native of the Balkans could tell , and the Balkan peo , , pies are too deadly at odds among themselves to be willing to tell truly . Yet an outsider may conjecture , and feel tolerably confident , that the base here is solid and genuine , although this is certainly not a contribution which folk-lorists may use and catalogue with an easy mind .

The lack of Miss Alma Strettel 's help in this volume , and the extent of it in the previous one , are very plain ' The Lands of the Eastern Caliphate Mesopotamia , Persia and Central Asia from the Moslem Conquest to the Time of Timur , ' by Mr G Le Strange , is a worthy complement and sequel to the same a.uthor 's ' Palestine under the Moslems ' ( 1890 ) and ' Bagdad under the Abbasid Caliphate ' ( 1900 ) . It forms part of the Cambridge Geographical Series ( New York . The Macmillan Co ) , and , as - the title suggests , deals with these countries from the point of view of Moslem historical geography Of geography , as the simple description of the surface of the earth , it has little Rather , Mr. Le Strange takes the books of the Arabic geographers and travellers , works out , province by province , the material which they give  --  routes , boundaries , town-sites , etc ? and , with the as sistance of the reports of recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have With this he combines an immense mass of informatron , historical , descriptive , economic , manufacturing , agricultural , drawn from the same sources At - the foot of each page is a wealth of aeferences ; at the end , an index of forty-six pages ; throughout the volume , ten excellent schematized maps Of course , these last have almost no geographical features ; the reader must take the best map accessible to him and lay out upon it that of Mr Le Strange The title fairly gives the ground covered , with the large exception that Syria , Arabia , and Egypt are excluded To digest - the material on Arabia would take a volume in itself , Syria is treated in ' Palestine under the Moslems , ' and Egypt has been already most broadly mapped and described , though net after this fashion . Of course such a book can not be very readable , but its value for the student of mediaeval Hither Asia can not be exaggerated , and even for the student of civilization in the broad it will be full of suggestion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immense wealth , of information in the Arabic geographers , and furnishes clues which it will be comparatively easy to trace out to the end . It is greatly to be desired that , this survey of the Moslem world may be completed and even carried into Spain . The task lies at the door of the author of this book There is no subject , however grim , which the human mind may not view humorously , and those predisposed to ' Auto-Fun : Pictures and Comments from Life ' ( T. Y Crowell &; Co. ) will find it highly amusing . There are plenty of crashes and smashes , but no corpses , and much ingenious satire for juggernaut and victim Love scenes , or it could not be Life , are interspersed effectively , and the level of these caricatures is uncommonly high in respect of invention and artistic technique ' Future Forest Trees , ' by A. Harold Unwin ( London : T. Fisher Unwin ) , is a good translation of an Austrian account of experiments in the introduction of American trees . The recorded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ East and West North America , planted not alone in Austria as might be supposed , but in Germany , Switzerland , and Great Britain as well The little treatise was originally prepared for a " Forestry Magazine , " and hence might better have been recast before going into book form . But , in spite of its lack of proportion and its marked gaps , it is likely to be of use in any forest library . Volume iii. , ' Flowers and Inflorescences , ' in Prof. H. Marshall Ward 's " Trees : A Handbook of Forest-Botany for the Woodlands and the Laboratory " ( Cambridge , Eng. , University Press , New York . Macmillan ) , is , like the earlier volumes in the series , thoroughly interesting and accurate . Even the amateur , who may justly regard most botanical treatises with suspicion as likely to be desperately dry , will find this work charming and very intelligible .

In elementary education there had been a considerable advance during his term of office . There was now a permanent annual grant of thirty-five lakhe of rupees ( $1,155,000 ) for this purpose , thousands of new primary schools were opening their doors , training schools for teachers were springing up in every direction , and the pay of primary teachers had been raised . Similar progress was noted in secondary and commercial education , while in the higher university education the Government policy had assumed a wider scope , and had , he hoped , effected a more drastic change in the emancipation of the youth of India from the gyves and manacles of the past A gratifying feature of the awakening of interest in these reforms was the stimulus it had given to the liberality of wealthy Indians The hearty appreciation of his work in these directions was shown by the fact that many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ native sources placed in the forefront the services he was generously credited with having rendered to the cause of Indian education . The establishment of a " free university " in Moscow has , according to the report of the Berlin Rundschau , been made a certainty by a special gift of 500,000 rubles from a friend of free thought in the Empire It is expressly announced that it is not to be a rival or competitor of the Imperial University : it will probably take the place of the institution that for years has been maintained in Paris by Russian refugees , which now is to be closed . For the present , courses are to be given only in philosophy , political economy , and kindred branches . It has been decided to invite German savants to give semester courses of lectures . In connection with this project a Russian university congress was assembled in Moscow recently ; fourteen cities , among them Tomsk and Paris , being represented in a total of 110 university teachers . The convention gave its time and attention to political as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the admission of educated women as students and as teachers in the universities . A valuable literary find has again been secured from the Egyptian papyri fragments in the shape of a commentary on the ' Themtetus ' of Plato . The book dates flom the period of the Roman Empire , and is of importance both in furnishing us the ancient interpretation of this difficult dialogue , and in giving new data concerning the later philosophers The papyrus is now , preserved in sperlua , and is being published by Dr. Schubert and Professor Diels . An important archeological discovery has been made in Sicily , near Collesano , about fifty miles from Palermo . In preparing some land for planting American grape-vines , workmen uncovered , one after the other , forty large skeletons . Further excavations were authorized , and several ancient tombs were discovered , and the fronts of houses with very unusual ornamentation .

Members of every branch of the Government , national , State , and focal , were invited to attend , and representatives of the most diverse forms of Christian belief met to discuss the religious needs of university students Perhaps the most original contribution to educational thought furnished by this notable gathering was the meeting of university and college trustees for the discussion of the one wholly chaotic branch of our educational system , if there be such a system , the business management of institutions of ' higher learning .

William Barclay Parsons , of the Board of Consulting Engineers , contributes to the November Century a paper en the Panama Canal conspicuous for its plain statement of the problems to be met in making the Culebra cut and in handling the floods of the Chagres River To complete the Culebra out to sea level , we are told , means the removal of 5,000 large carloads of material each day for ten years . A dam 150 feet in height will form a lake capable of holding an entire year 's flow of the Chagres River , and by under sluices its average flow can be delivered continuously into , the canal With a depth of 100 feet in this lake sufficient pressure would be developed to generate electric power enough to do all the work of the canal and the Panama Railroad , light the canal itself , the cities at its ends , and all the villages of the canal zone , and still leave a surplus for commercial disposal . Ralph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ School and College Sport " deals with English and American football . The chief source of all the present troubles , he is convinced , lies in the evident fact that the game has been carried by false methods to a point where no considerable number of bona-fide college students can hope to play it successfully Hence ' the continualsearch for men who are not bona-fide students , with all ' the attendant dishonesty , so disgraceful to American colleges . Students of Whitman will be interested in a few pages of extracts from Mr Horace Traubel 's records of the poet 's conversation during the last few years of his life . In one passage Whitman traces the genesis of the ' Leaves of Grass ' to Walter Scott : " If you could reduce the ' Leaves ' to their elements , you would see Scott unmistakably active at the roots " Beside this some will be inclined to place a remark made but a few days later .

The Bancroft letters , in Scribner 's , drop suddenly a quarter of a century to the period of Mr. ' Bancroft 's mission at the Court of St James . The letters of the present instalment , however , deal exclusively with the ' historian 's frequent visits to Paris in search of material for his great work , which had now reached the ' period ' of the Revolution . An incident of these visits was the opportunity to hear Rachel in Racine 's " Andromaque , " and it scarcely need be said that the result was complete captivation . " Her utterance was ' inspiration , love , hate , tenderness , revenge , all the passions that can agitate the breast of a fond woman ; the torture of love unrecognized , the gentle relenting at the slightest transitory hope , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been plighted to her , the infinite remorse at the consummation of her vengeance , ' all flowed from her lips and impressed themselves on her face and mind , in her eyes and person . " In the " Point of View " we find an-earnest , and certainly a timely , protest against the tendency to make the novel of manners a novel of social usages- " We should be freed from constant attempts on the part of popular novelists to instruct us in matters of etiquette " Let us resort to some " Guide to Good Manners " if deficient in early training , and have an end of " covert hints on behavior coated with the syrup of fiction " Though no names are mentioned , one does not feel sure that these strictures are not partly aimed at ' The House of Mirth , ' which reaches its inevitably unmirthful conclusion in this number . ?

Mr. Nevinson 's slave-trade revelations continue the monotonous story of heartless greed and oppression , though we are assured in the advertising sieges that " it is probable that , owing to Mr. Nevinson 's work , the Britisa Government will intervene to put a stop to prevailing conditions on the Portuguese West African coast " Hamilton W Mabie 's paper on East Side kindergarten work , of which we spoke last month , is followed by a description of an East Side music-school settlement , by Philip - Verrill Mighels .

That this year 's loan collection of portraits at Oxford was less brilliant than the collection of last year is to be made out from the illustrated catalogue which has re cently been published ( Frowde ) The period covered is the whole of the Stuart era , with the exception of the reign of James I Here the names of Van Dyck , Lely and Kneller at once suggest themselves , but Van Dyck , the greatest of the three , was occupied almost exclusively during the six years and a half of his residence in England with painting personages of the Court , while neither Lely nor Kneller found his chief subjects in the dons and bishops of Oxford Of the forty-two painters represented , little more than twenty were born in Great Britain , and of three we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Greenhill , and Mrs. Beale " In looking on the portraits of this period , " says Mr. Lionel Cust , " let us remember the words of Thomas Carlyle , ' In short , any representations made by a faithful human creature of that face and figure which Tae saw with his eyes and which I can never see with mine , is now valuable to me and much better than none at all . ' " No quotation could have been better selected for the purpose of bringing out the characteristic features of such an assemblage as is represented here Men like Harvey , Falkland , Clarendon , Cowley , Cromwell , Hobbes , Bishop Ken , H. Lewes , Locke , Milton , John Wallis , and Sir Henry Wotton , have a claim upon the interest of each succeeding age , and any portrait which rises above pure crudeness must in such cases possess a measure of historical value . Unfortunately , the Oxford collection did not contain the best extant portraits of Falkland , Clarendon , or Cromwell , to take typical examples , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well worth bringing together . The catalogue , as in the case of its predecessor , is beautifully printed and well illustrated . ? It is convenient for literary students to have , in one neat , well-printed volume , the ' Essays on Medieval Literature , ' by W. P. Ker ( Macmillan Co ) , that were formerly scattered in various quarters . Although the book is quite devoid of learned apparatus and seems to appeal to the general reading public rather than to the professional scholar , it shows not a trace of the carelessness or the superficiality that we generally associate with the term " popular " On the contrary , the author has , in addition to an unusually thorough acquaintance with the themes discussed , a knack of viewing old subjects from a new angle and looking through petty details at the great principles behind them , which , coupled with a graceful style , makes the ' Essays ' not only attractive and valuable to the layman , but instructive even to the specialist Tne longest essay deals with Froissart . Originally written as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John Froissart ' in the Tudor Translations , it treats first , and very fully , of Berners 's merits and defects as a translator ; after which we have an account of Froissart and a penetrating criticism of his style . Shorter studies are devoted to Boccaccio. , Chaucer , Gower , and " The Earlier . History of English Prose " The book closes with a sympathetic and judicial estimate of Gaston Paris , first printed in the Quarterly Review . With the exception of this tribute , the shortest of the papers is a discussion of the " Similes of Dante , " which , to most readers , is likely to prove the most interesting of all , The author illustrates the difference between epic simile , as Homer used it , and Lyric metaphor , as we find it in the troubadours , dwells on the striking absence of simile in modern epic poetry before Dante , and its natural infrequency in the lyric poets , and establishes the importance of Dante as the transmitter of this chief adornment of narrative verse from the ancient world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flower chilled and drooping at night and reviving with the sun ; Chaucer , who employs it in the ' Troilus , ' got it from Boccaccio , who , using it twice  --  in the ' T'eseide ' and the ' Filostrato ' ? derived it in turn from Dante This particular simile might have been traced back one step further , to William of Poitiers.  - -  'Espagnols et Portugais chez eux ' ( Paris : Cohn ) is not a suggestively auspicious title in the eyes of those who grasp the difficulty of penetrating into the domestic and inner life of the Peninsula , even with the favor of exceptional introductions . M. Quallardet , the writer of this work , has scoured the two Iberian kingdoms , observed with the alert coup d'teil of the French traveller , and doubtless taken copious notes , yet without conveying the sense of such intimacy as one gets from the still unmatched , if - antiquated , Ford Valencia and the whole Eastern swath , except Catalonia , are scantily discussed , though here may be seen many signs , quite vital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convince the traveller that Gautier ( who likewise slurred this region ) is much less out-dfaclate than the average Spaniard of to-day can be brought to admit .
