txt This has been a day of conferences on the Vice Presidential situation , with the rooms of Gov . Roosevelt and Senator Hanna the storm centres . The earliest conferences were those with Gov . Roosevelt . Men who had gone to bed satisfied that the work of the convention had been cut but . hurried to the Governor 's room to " learn the meaning of disquieting rumors that he had renewed his  - -  determhmtion not to be a candidate . They found him still ' tinprepared " to ' say - anything% SENATOR HANNA CALLS . Senator Hanna was an early caller . He had been obliged to admit before he called that Gov . Roosevelt appeared to be the choice of the convention and would be nominated . Fred W. Rolls , Dr. Murray Butler , and Dr. Albert Shaw . who were present when Mr. Hanna made his visit , sympathized with him , but for reasons different from those that control Mr. Hanna . Mr. Hanna 's call lasted forty minutes . When he left the Governor was ready to say that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roosevelt was subjected to great pressure all day long . In nearly every Instance they favored his nomination , but there were many visitors who were willing to have the convention do what the Governor desired , and who went away impressed by Mr. Roosevelt 's friends with the hope that he would not be named , but would be chosen again for Governor . To the politicians the situation had come to be one compelling the nomination of Mr. Roosevelt . Should he decline , it was not certain that he would be renominated for Governor . Peculiar conditions might make it inexpedient to present him . The opposition of the corporations , in consequence of his attitude on the franchise tax , was mentioned by some of the visitors to his room as a menace . Just before Gov . Roosevelt gave out his statement this afternoon there was a consultation at the Walton . There were present Senators Hanna , Allison . Burrows , and Lodge ; Representative Cannon , Cornelius N. Bliss , H. C. Payne , . Joseph Manley , and a few others . F. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to present the statement that Gov . Roosevelt proposed to give out . After it had been read and it had been accepted as a fair statement of Gov . Roosevelt 's wishes . Mr. Wetherbee and Mr. Stewart withdrew . After they had departed Senator Burrows proposed that as the Governor was out , they should discuss the field . " If yeti propose to nominate an Administration candidate , it is high time , " he said . " that he be decided upon . " After - prolonged but rapid discussion of all names . that had been mentioned , it was concluded that only two men , Dolliver awl Long , were really available . Further talk led to the conclusion- that neither Dolliver nor Long would easily detach popular support from Roosevelt , that the delegates still wanted Roosevelt . and that perhaps it would be best to give up trying to defeat him . Senator Burrows described the statement of the Governor as " A flat bid for the nomination . " THE GOVERNOR 'S STATEMENT . There was a great throng of newspape ? men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the stroke of the hour . " Come in , gentlemen , " he called from pin inner room . The chamber was crowded in an instant . Reporters swarmed all over the bed , the trunks , and the furniture . Gov . Roosevelt stood over in the corner behind the bed , wills Representative Littauer , Fred W. Hons . Dr. Shaw . Secretary Youngs , and Dr. Butler , sitting on the bed edge or behind him . " I shall read very slowly , " he said , taking up sonic sheets of paper . Then he read , slowly announcing the punctuation as he went along . ? ? " In view of the revival of the talk of myself as a Vice Presidential candidate . I have this to say : It is impossible toe deeply to express how touched I am oy the attitude of those delegates who have ished me to take this nomination . " Moreover , it is not necessary to say how thoroughly I Understand the high honor and dignity of the office , an office so high and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ey man in the . linked States . " But while T. fill/recia.te sli thin in the full , nevertheless I feel most deeply Um : . the field of my beat cs &fulness; to the polllic and to the party Is in New York Statf ? and it the party shuttles see fit in renominate me for Governor r can in that position help the 1 , : ationa ; ticket Wi in no other way .

' That 's all , " said the Got  --  arnor . " I have nothing to add . Do n't ask : Pe any more questions . I Then the Governor sxkce , to Le permitted to have the room , and he was left to confer with Lemuel E. Quigg and H. C. Payne Of Wisconsin . EFFECT OF THE STATEMENT . ? The purport of the statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighborhood . It did not change matters at all . Everybody said it was a dignified . creditable statement , but it was pot a declination . And while the statement was being thus discussed the news Was going about that Pennsylvania 's delegation had voted , 33 to 4 , to vote for Roosevelt , and Senator Penrose had pledged his - word that Roosevelt would accept . Penrose had been repeatedly at Roosevelt 's rooms during the day . It wits believed by the Pennsylvanian that he spoke with authority . At all events he spoke positively , without qualifying his assurances . STATE DELEGATIONS CALL . A . delegation from Kansas , headed by the Candidate for United States Senator , T. R. Burton , called , and the Governor chatted with them Turning to Mr. Burton just as - they were leaving , he said : " My dear fellow , I want to do what is right by the party , but I honestly believe that my path of duty lies in New York - State . Well , " said Mr. Burton , " If we do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A delegation of Iowa men also had a ' long interview with Roosevelt . At the conclusion of the interview the situation was summed up as follows by Lafe Young , who headed the delegation : " He did not say he would , and he did not say he would n't , and as we came out of his room Mark Hanna ' was waiting to see him to urge him to refuse the nomination . and Henry Cabot Lodge was waiting to urge him to take it . That is the situation as we left it . " The interview opened by a statement by - Mr . Young to Gov . Roosevelt to the effect that the Doiliver men desired if possible to gain some definite idea as to what he desired or intended to do . " It is easy to say what I desire to do , " replied the Governor with a laugh . " I desire to be Governor of New York again , and I do not desire to be nominated for Vice President of the ' United States , " " Can you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " asked Mr. Roberts . Well , " replied the Governor , " these fellows have placed me in an awful position . I want to he Governor of New York for another term at least , and I do not care to be nominated for Vice President . But they are forcing the matter on me on all sides , and it is going to : be Very difficult to decline it . If I refuse it people will say that ' Roosevelt has the big head and thinks he is too much of a man to be Vice President . ' I do not care to be placed in such a position , for it is not true that I hold any such opinion of myself . " Then why , Governor . " said Mr. O'Connell , " do n't you take the stand taken by Senator Allison when they tried to get him to take the place ? He simply said , I do n't want it , gentlemen . I will not take it . Good day . ' " " Possibly the pressure brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Senator , " replied Roosevelt . THE SITUATION DEFINED . " The situation is right here , Governor , " said Mr. Young . " These people who are trying to get you to take this place do not care anything for you . They simply think that you of all men can lend strength to the ticket . They think you can carry the State of New York . They do not care to have you carry it for the Republican Party . They know you can carry it either as Governor or as Vice President . They want you to carry it as Vice President for their own purposes , and they are unwilling that you should carry it for your own purposes , or for the good of the- party . Now , if you accept the nomination , you are simply playing into their hands and . making yourself a party to their schemes . " ' " Oh , come now , Young . you are too hard , " said the Governor , with a laugh . " I am not hard at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stating the situation as I know it exists , as you and everybody else know it exists . These men can not hurt you if you decline to take the nomination . No man can hurt Roosevelt save Roosevelt himself . " " Well , gentlemen . " said the Governor , - " I have said all that can say at - the present time . Mr Hanna and a number of other gentlemen are waiting to see me , and I will be glad to see you all at any time . " Then you can not give us any positive assurance at this time as to what you will do ? " asked Mr. O'Connell . " I have said all that ? I can say at the present time . " was the reply , and the committee left without securing any more definite assurance than they possessed when they entered the Governor 's room . A delegation from South Dakota called upon Gov . Roosevelt about noon . He said in response to a query from the head of the delegation , Emil Branch : " Gentlemek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I am not unmindful of the honor which you all want to confer upon me . I do not scorn it or scoff at it , but I believe that I can the better serve my party in New York State than in the Nation , and I am still of the mind that I should not be nominated for Vice President , but for Governor of New York . " Then he hesitated until one of the delegation asked : " Will you refuse ? " Roosevelt flushed . and then said slowly and distinctly : I do n't see how I could . " and then quickly added : " But I have not yet entirely made up my mind . "
