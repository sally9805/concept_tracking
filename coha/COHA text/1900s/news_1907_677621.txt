While being taken in a cab from the Queens County Jail to Mrs. Simonson 's house at Elmhurst for identification by her as one of two men who washed their hands at her pump on the afternoon of the murder , Becker made his confession to Detectives Galvin , ' riche. and Graham . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any other time since his arrest on Thursday , so the detectives questioned him about the case . At first he repeated the story he told beside the dead body in the Morgue on Friday that he had seen a Slav kill the girl . Being convinced that this was false , the detectives urged him to tell the truth . Then Becker voluntarily made a. sweeping confession , which furnishes a full description of the crime . How the Crime Was Committed . While walking through the old Seitz farm on Wednesday afternoon he saw the Staffeldt girl picking dandelions . The girl , who had often boasted to her chums that she was not afraid of men in the fields because she had no jewelry or money that they could steal , did not run when Becker accosted her . Instead she told him that if he did not go away she would call a policeman . Then she went on picking dandelions . Picking up a stone , Becker struck her on the back of the head with it . The girl pitched forward on her face , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German silver handle with which she had been hickitig tee dandelions fell beside her . As she gradually regained consciousness the Staffeldt rite moved . Fear of detection for the crime he had committed seized Becker . Grasping the knife he plunged it into the back of the girl 's head twice . The first blow severed the jugular vein , and blood poured from the girl 's mouth , soaking into the soft earth . The second blow severed the spinal cord . There was blood on Becker 's hands , and an impulse to remove this evidence seized him . From where he stood he could see a pond shaded with trees not more than 100 yards away . Leaving the knife behind him , he ran from his victim . Breaking through the hedge at the end of the field , Becker hurried toward the pond . His course was through Engel 's radish patch . While trampling down the green leaves just peeping above the earth he heard a man 's voice warning him to " Get out of that patch . " Turning , he ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road . Running along this he reached Mrs. Simonson 's house . At the pump he saw a man washing his hands . There was a chance to remove the evidence of his guilt . He went into the yard , and the man pumped water for him while he washed his hands . This man was the Slav companion upon whom Becker placed the guilt in his confession in the Morgue . Several feet from the pump he saw a handkerchief , which had fallen on the ground from a line . He put this into his pocket . Then he wiped his hands with paper , intending to take off the " rough " with that and then dry his hands with the handkerchief . Mrs. Simonson appeared at this time . After a parley with her , which has already been told , he went down the road with the Slay . Later they parted company . When night came Becker boarded a trolley oar and went to Corona . There he removed the shirt with the bloody splotch on the left shoulder . Tearing it Into ribbons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ station . It was his habit to wear two shirts . After disposing of this evidence against him , he went to sleep in the fields . At daybreak he returned to Elmhurst , because " I wanted to see what had become of the body . " Then his arrest followed . When he finished his confession Becker turned to Detective Galvin and said : " I thank God I have told the truth . I hope He win forgive me . " Later Becker went over the entire field with the detectives , showing them just where he killed the girl and the direction he took in looking for a place to wash his hands . When questioned , ho admitted tearing up the two transfers of the 138th Street Crosstown Line . Manhattan , which were found in pieces beside the body . The detectives say that he talked rationally and appeared to feel relieved when he hnd made the confession , like a man who had taken a great weight off his mind . Searching for More Evidence . The detectives searched for the bloody shirt yesterday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . They hope to get it to-day . It was a white negligee shirt with a dark stripe through it . It was very dirty . Although they did not get the shirt , the police found a policeman , named Williams , connected with the Flushing precinct , who says he gave the shirt to Becker . Williams told the detectives that he gave Becker two shirts . He described these as the dirty white negligee , which is missing , and the flannel one , which Becker wore when arrested . If Williams positively identifies the white shirt , when it is found , the chain of evidence against Becker will be made complete , the police believe , without his confession . When the knife was found beside the // BECKERTNOVOtit " ' HE 'S THE-gURDERER // bpdy the - police . noticed several finger marks upon it , Capt . McCafferty has turned this knife over to an expert in the Detective'Bureau for ' examination . The finger prints will be photographed and an enlargement made . Then an impression of Becker 's fingers will be taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impression of Becker 's fingers will be compared. , Another item of evidence interested the police yesterday . ' , It was the bruise on the back of the girl 's head , discovered by the autopsy . When asked by Capt . McCafferty where he struck the girl with the stone , Becker pointed to the base of the skull with his hand . That is exactly where the bruise was found on the girl 's head . Capt . McCafferty will consult today Coroner 's Physician Frey , who made the autopsy , to establish this fact . If ' necessary the body will be exhumed . " You 're the Man , " Sang Mrs. Simon-1 son . The identification of Becker by Mrs. Simonson as the man she saw In her yard wiping blood from his fingers with paper was dramatic and complete . About 3:30 o'clock the carriage containing Becker and the detectives drove up to the little ' white house on Trains Meadow Road , where Mrs. Simonson lives . Soon afterward Capt . McCafferty appeared . He told Mrs. Simonson he wanted her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would know him among a hundred , " said Mrs. Simonson . " If I see a face once I can see it again . " Then Mrs. Simonson took a position just inside the front door of her house . She was very nervous . Sleep had not come to her the night before , she said . The face of Becker and his bloody hands were constantly before her . At a signal from McCafferty the detectives brought Becker from the carriage . He was brought face to face with Mrs. Simonson . The tell-tale slouch hat with the colored band was pulled down over h1.8 ... - face . The rain beat down upon the pEsoner and the detectives . The group fairly held their breath and watched Mrs. Simonson . She leaped at Becker , and , pointing at him , said Quickly : " You 're the man . You had blood on your hands . I would know you anywhere . " Becker shivered nervously and then said sheepishly : " Is this Mrs. Simonson ? " Then Capt . McCafferty ordered him to turn his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around ! ? ordered Capt . McCafferty . " We are not going to shoot you in the back . " Becker turned and Mrs. Simonson again swore he was the man . Then the detectives took Becker to the pump in the rear yard . Mrs. Simonson appeared at the back stoop . Look at him closely , " said Capt . McCafferty . " Are you sure this is the man who washed his hands at this pump ? " " Yes , he 's the man ! " snapped Mrs. Simonson . Then shaking her finger at Becker , she continued : " I will never forget you . " Capt . McCafferty asked Becker to indicate where he had picked up the handkerchief . He pointed to a depression in the earth several feet from the pump . Then the detectives hustled him Into the carriage . They drove to the scene of the murder and Becker took them over the entire ground . Later Mrs. Simonson said that Becker was not the man who attacked her daughter Eva about three months ago . " If he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the police to take him away , " she added . The Chain of Evidence . The police are convinced they have a strong case against Becker outside his confession and no matter what his mental condition may be . The identification by I Conductor Lobel of the 138th Street crosstown line of Becker as the man to whom he gave two transfers on Wednesday inoriiihg is - the first link in the chain . The . tern-up transfers issued by Lobel ; Which were found beside the body of-the girl , is the second . Engel 's description of the man he saw- running through his radish patch on Wednesdayl afternoon is the third . The fact that Becker 's shoe filled out an impression found in the radish patch , even to a break in the sole and a worn-off portion of the heel , is another link . Mrs. Simonson 's identification of Becker is another strong one . The handkerchief marked . " S " found . on Becker , which Mrs. Simonson identified as hers , is still another . If the shirt is found and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's , two more strong links will be added to the chain . What has been learned of Becker 's history is also considered strong evidence against him by the police . His father called him a " lazy loafer , " and declared that three years ago he attempted to kill a man with a meat cleaver . Becker admitted that he was arraigned before Magistrate Steinert on a charge of attacking a girl in Manhattan . The police are not relying on Becker 's confession and are working to corroborate every Statement he makes . They are doing this because they believe Becker an impressionable creature and that it might be urged that under the influence of a stronger intellect he could be led to say anything . They have not yet put his confession into writing and obtained his signature to it . Capt . McCafferty declared yesterday that he believed Becker mentally deranged , though he did not doubt the truth of the confession . The case has been remarkable in many features , and yesterday Capt . McCafferty congratulated Detectives Galvin , Ticho , and Graham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , practically in open view of a dozen houses , and yet nobody saw it . The chance of catching the culprit looked slim . To aid the local police under Capt . Kelly Capt . McCafferty of the Detective Bureau hurried to the scene with his best detectives on Thursday . Detectives Calvin and Graham had been in Elmhurst only fifteen minutes when they picked up Becker on the street . He seemed to answer descriptions furnished by Engel and Mrs. Simonson . When they n crested him they frankly admitted they " had nothing on him . " On Friday they confronted him - with the girl 's body , and he broke down and confessed to knowledge of the ( Arne , but accused the Slav of the murder . On Saturday the detectives practically established that Becker did not meet the Slav until he went to Mrs. Simonson 's . And yesterday Becker told all .
