The worst of the scores of accidents that trailed in its wake was reported from the Bronx . A tall brick chimney on a tour-story apartment house at 605 Eagle Avenue was blown over at the height of the gale anCt several tons of brick and mortar crashed into the street , Five persons were more or less injured , and two others were so terrified that they collapsed . The back and side walls at the rear of the top floor of the building were wrecked by the crumbling chimney , and the roof at that point caved in . The apartment immediately below the chimney was occupied by Mr. and Mrs. Edward Breck and their two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's brother John . Breck and his wifel escaped with only.a few scratches , when the avalanche of bricks and mortar came down Over their heads . John Breck was struCk on the head and his skull was fractured . Both of the children were cut - and bruised . Walls Fell Outward . To - the fact that the walls fell outward instead of in under the tons of brick from the chimney , those in the Breck apartment doubtless owe their lives . The floor sagged down , and only the quickest work on the part of neighbors saved them from being pitched to the paved court nearly fifty feet below . The crash started a 13 , nic , and in a minute there was a mad rash among the half hundred tenants to get into the street . All believed the building was crumbling about their heads Mrs. Caroline Blues . 50 years old , and her daughter , Frances , who own the building , fell fainting in the hallway , and had to be carried out .

As for the harbor , there was where the wind showed its power . The water was churned into countless whitecaps , while some of the seas running were so high that they broke well up . to the pilothouses of single-deck ferryboats . Every craft in river and harbor had a thick armor of ice . The army transport Wikoff , which was busy with stores all , day , looked like a huge ice craft as it fought its way through the monster ice floes . The steamships that came in , among Ithem the Savoie , the Philadelphia , Rheinfels , and the Montserrat , all reported the worst kind of weather outside the Hook , and , like the smaller vessels in the harbor , they seemed like marine spectres as they wended their way to the , docks , clad ' from stem to stern in shimmering ice. - Toward night , when the gale began to abate , there came a sudden flurry of I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Weather Bureau reported last night that to-day would be cold and windy , I but the indications were that there would be no snow .
