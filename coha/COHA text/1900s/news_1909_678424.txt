txt The gentlemen who give a Republican flavor to the veracious statistics sent out from Washington strike a joyous note . " Renewed activity in the country 's manufactures " is the more or less judicious inference from the fact that imports of manufacturers ' materials have increased recently . " In not a few cases the figures are actua:ly larger than those of January , 1907 , when all the industries of the country were running to their full capacity of production . " The Winter wheat ' which pushes its green shoot above the snow , is not more welcome than such facts at a time when trade and industry seem still clasped in the depth of wintry frost . Except for the tip from Washington nobody would imagine that any department of employment which con- , sumes manufacturers ' materials is exceptionally active at a time of unusual unemployment . On looking through the list a. clue to the mystery seems to be discoverable . The imports are not disproportionately large of articles on the free list and likely to be left undisturbed , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or those which conceivably may fall among the few which even the reforming Mr. TAFT thinks may be raised . It may come as a shock to some that the best and bravest tariff which the United States has ever enjoyed should be so barbarous as to levy an exclusive duty upon materials . For eleven months of 1908  --  the latest period for which the classifications are available  --  crude materials constituted 14.81 per ceilk of all dutiable imports , while crude materials free of duty comprised 52.76 of all free imports . The contrast shows the exclusive effect of the duty and the consequent burden at this time upon a re -- thing industry . Just in proportion as it is justifiable to rejoice that the ma-terials for manufacture are enlarging for any reason whatever It is also necessary to regret the repressive effect of the exclusion protracted through long years , of which we are approach ' ing the happy ending . Even our friend The Tribune , which many a time and oft has lamented our heresies regarding ' the sacred - tariff , sees better things ahead . Says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pass a protective law , but not to over-4 protect industries merely for the sake of protection . " With all our hearts . We have our suspicion , for instance , that the overprotection now passing away was rather for unearned increment than merely for protection , but we rejoice with The Tribune over its end for whatever reason . Since we are of one mind upon this matter , would it not be a fair suggestion to the over-protectionists of the past that industry may as well be overburdened as overprotected , and that the removal of burdens may be as much a reform as the reduction of rates in preposterous schedules . There is joy in our hearts at the breaking of light into the dark places , and we would like to see some of the reform spirit directed toward this question of raw materials as a factor in the cost of production - which plays such a part in the reform programme . Would it not be the first step toward equalizing costs to allow our factories to get their materials as cheaply as their competitors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
