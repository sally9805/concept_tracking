We begin the art education of children when we give them picturebooks . They learn to know what is good and what is bad , they learn to love the good and dislike the bad by means of the illustrations they see in the books they read . Under every picture , if it be historical , should be the name of the artist and of the gallery where the original is exhibited . Children should gradually acquire some knowledge of artists and their works , art and literature always going hand in hand . " No thought so buried in the dark It shall not bear its gloom in light ; No act too small to leave its mark Upon the young heart 's tablet white ; Our grand achievements ' secret springs Are tempered among trivial things .

" A MOTHER 'S CONVERSATION Language is the splendid possession which lifts us above the lower orders of creation , and , more than any other faculty , allies us to God . When God made man in His image , He endowed him with speech . Do we prize sufficiently the value of words ? The good Book says , By thy words thou shalt be justified , and by thy words condemned . Our thoughts are our own ; until they are translated into language they can do little harm or good . It is by the words we speak that we make those around us happy or sorrowful . Take , for example , the common instance of the hasty word . Few of us do not have it to regret . Children are told to think before they speak , and the caution might well be given to children of an older growth . Something occurs to 152 // i i i i oy or vex , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sword leaps from the scabbard , the hasty word springs out to do its baleful work . Friends of many years are sometimes separated by ill-considered words , which , too late , they would give the world to withdraw . And words that wound are apt to leave scars . The wound of a friend heals slowly . There is also the fault finding word . No other has such frost-like effect on the household joy . A continual stream of fault finding is so depressing that presently every one ceases the effort to do well . Children and servants comprehend that they have no chance with a chronic fault finder . A teacher who finds constant fault loses influence over pupils , and an employer who has this wretched disposition is never well served . Words of praise , on the other hand , are like sunbeams and dewdrops , and all other gentle and tender things , which coax plants into bloom and fruit . They do for character what the sunbeam does in the realm of // nature . The words most to be dreaded are those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words which stab an absent acquaintance in the dark , which lend themselves to the repetition of unkind stories , and to the service of unfriendly gossip ! Words that are deliberately misleading and deceitful wear the livery of the devil . They have no use or place in the vocabulary of sincere , noble and right-living people . We need not dwell on words coarse , vulgar , or profane ; nor , except in our own case , need we feel called upon to think very much about impulsive and vehement words . These latter are at least not cowardly . It is our privilege to set a watch over our own lips , to restrain words of indiscretion , and to refrain from words that are ill-natured and savage . Words of intentional exaggeration are to be avoided . It is possible to uplift a soul and turn the whole tide of affairs from defeat to victory , simply by speaking words of real encouragement and approval . From the present purpose it is apart to say much about // the beauty and rhythm of words , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dictionary through , and you will find that words have color and music , and that they represent with vivid clearness and picturesque beauty ideas for which they stand . They come from many sources and many lands . They are as old as the Garden of Eden , as new as yesterday . One finds the sonorous word coming from old Rome and the mellifluous from the honeyed tongue of the Greeks . There are words in our English language from the Danish , Swedish , and Saxon ; from the German ; from the dialect of the Red Man ; in fact , from every part of the world , and every age of history . How beautiful are most of the words which are the names of flowers : as heather-bell , bluebell , lily , snowdrop , rose , daisy , hyacinth and forget-me-not . A flower is seldom christened by an ugly name . How beautiful are the names which describe running water : river , brook , cataract , stream , fountain ! How picturesque are certain words // which describe certain conditions : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cloth or silk ; draggle , which is a disagreeable , slovenly , bespattered sort of ' word ; drain , which carries in its very sound the thought of extreme exhaustion , of never stopping until the last drop be gone . What a beautiful word is dainty ! What sound of cymbals is in the word clang ! What a brazen sound is in the word effrontery ! How the word quell carries with it the thought of vanquishing a riot ! How cool , and pleasing , and fizzing and bubbling , is the word effervesce ! With what charm is the woman endowed who has a good vocabulary , who uses the right word in the right place , at the right time ! How unpardonable is careless speech , and how povertystricken and meager is the speech of those who dwell habitually with mean people , and indulge in sordid thoughts ! One 's power to use rich and beautiful words is greatly increased if one either have the advantage of living with scholarly persons , or of constantly reading good books . // The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine passages which illustrate what I mean . No one can read Ruskin , Carlyle , Stevenson , Emerson , Matthew A mold , Augustine Birrell , Macaulay , , ongfellow , Whittier , Browning , Tennyson , or any other author who brings to us n message without receiving an enrichment , in thoughts and words , beyond the power of i rithmetic to compute . The Bible is a mine of wealth in terse and beautiful words and phrases . We are not half so careful as we ought to be about the words we use . We may not ourselves acquire the quality of brilliance by reading the brilliant book , or talking with the brilliant friend , but we shall be much less dull than we would have been , had we limited our association to that which was prosaic and common . I knew a mother who had three sons between the ages of twelve and sixteen . Their father , a man of sanguine temperament , was subject to fits of great despondency which alternated with moods of overflowing gaiety . Ordinarily , // he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find the pot of gold at the foot of the rainbow . Each new invention was to tide the family over reverses , and bring them a great fortune . Meanwhile , troubles thickened , they grew poorer and poorer , and it was an unceasing struggle to make both ends meet . The mother never lowered her head before calamity . She sat at her table , when the meal was meager , and presided with as much grace and cheer as if the slender provision had been a banquet . Always noted for the cleverness of her repartee , and the sparkle of her conversation , she still maintained her tone of dignity , and talked with her growing lads as she might have talked at court . Years passed , fortunes mended , the boys added to their father 's genius that touch of the practical which he had lacked , and each in turn became a successful man , filling well his place in society , and going forward to a useful and honored life . One of these boys said to me long after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // owe everything that we are and everything we have done to our brave little mother . " The little word yes or no , so decisive , yet so easy to speak , often determines destiny . The girl 's yes to her lover , the mother 's yes at the right moment to her boy , may change in every essential the course of a life . If only we were brave enough to say no at the critical moment , how often we should be saved from trials and tribulations that rend the heart . Doctor W. Robertson Nicoll has told us that in order to have real conversation it is necessary that those who talk should be friends . " They need not necessarily be intimate friends , but there should be a feeling of sympathy between them . There should be the basis of common affection . Without these there is not the reciprocal interest in one another 's affairs which is necessary . Each should be interested in the joys and sorrows , in the failures and successes of the other . One should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend is // bored , and the sympathy that he receives he should be able to give back in full measure . Then it is a great advantage if the two are working in the same line . It need not be ' identically the same , but it should be partially the same . Once more , the two should be fairly on a level . Again there ought to be that perfect frankness which is based upon firm , mutual confidence . Conversation is ruined if you have the least suspicion that your companion , meaning to do no harm , will repeat your chance half-meant observations . " It would be difficult to find a better description of the kind of conversation which may be carried on at home than is here given . Between whom shall there be confidence , sympathy and a common interest , if not between parents and children , and especially between a mother and the sons and daughters she is bringing up . She has known them from the dawn of their being , and to their thoughts she is no stranger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the art of conversation . // Back of what we say and back of the way we say it , for ever stands what we are . If we are genuine to the core , those around us know it . Our young people catch our tones , our very cadences , and our style . If we are simple and straightforward , so are they . If stilted and affected , they will repeat our unfortunate defects . A mother whose character is intensely spiritual or finely intellectual can not but be fastidious in the words she uses , selecting them with perfect adjustment to her thought , and she can not fail to impress her manner on her children . If she is elegant in social intercourse , they usually can not help being the same . There are pitfalls into which affectionate and devoted mothers stumble quite without intention . " Mrs. L. used to be a most interesting woman , " regretfully commented a man , when a lady had taken leave after a call at the house where he was staying . " But she has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal of charm since her marriage . She has merged every16Q RADIANT MOTHERHOOD thing else in maternity . She talks of nothing but the baby , its teeth , its lisp , its clothes , its croup , ? one would think it was the only baby that had ever lived . When it is n't the baby , it 's Florence , and when it is n't Florence , it 's Jack . Does the woman , I wonder , ever have a thought beyond that tiresome trio ? " In the obvious hope and expectation that they may be contradicted , I have seen mothers flushed , animated , and excited in exploiting to a group of listeners no less a matter than their children 's faults . " Willie is as obstinate as a mule . What we are going to do with him heaven only knows . Louis is the most selfish child we ever had . He refuses to give up his toys , or share anything with the others . Marie is most untruthful . " You would imagine their children were only fit to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the endless variations on the theme , but should you venture to agree with them , and to condole their hard fate , it would be another story and they would turn upon you with indignation . // The occasional waywardness of children , the wilfulness and insubordination of young people at certain transition moments in their lives , are subjects to be covered up and hidden away . None of us should dilate to indifferent outsiders on the ill-behavior of our own children , any more than we should plume ourselves on their loss of a leg or an arm , or be proud of some defect in their sight or hearing . Even in our own minds , it is unwise to dwell on the faults and foibles of children . Rather should thought be steadfastly fixed on the good qualities which are to be cultivated , and not on the evil which are mere weeds to be uprooted and tossed into the fire . The temptation sometimes assails us to monopolize the conversation , and fill up its measure with anecdotes of the children 's sayings and doings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Very carefully , too , we should refrain from talking about children in their presence ; to enlarge , while they are standing by , on their astonishing cleverness is the fatuous blunder of the thoughtless mother . I have seen chil164 RADIANT MOTHERHOOD dren loiter about in visible impatience , while their elders were chatting , the little ones waiting to hear their own names brought into the conversation . Sometimes a child poses quite openly , giving but a half-attention to its doll , or its game , while the hungry little heart yearns to hear some complimentary word about itself . Self-consciousness is at the bottom of ' most of our grown-up awkwardness and reserve . We are hampered by the fear tha 1 people are not pleased with us , and that we are not making the best impression . We can do nothing natural because of this distressing apprehension . The specter , What will people think ? stalks in front of us and robs us of ease and grace in company . Mothers do not mean to bind this agonizing burden on their children , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children step unduly into the foreground , and when they forget that older people have rights and privileges as well as the little ones , who at the moment seem more important . To reprove a child when any one else is // present or within hearing is so unkind that one almost apologizes for mentioning it , yet the word of caution needs to be said . Mothers do this partly through impulse , partly because they do not comprehend a child 's capacity for pain . It is better to speak of faults to a child when alone , taking some quiet opportunity for the purpose . At the family table , a mother should tactfully interpose if the conversation drop below the level of safety and kindness . If it happen that we know something about a neighbor or a friend or another family , that we suspect they would not like to have repeated , let that secret remain with us . The mother 's arresting voice and look should repress the first intimation of gossip which is touched with the slightest malevolence . The matter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We need not banish references to people and to friends from the family talk . But we may frown upon that blunt and careless candor which reveals to a circle that which was never meant to be mentioned beyond // the person whom it concerns . It is well t emphasize the point of honor in all our talk . " Loving words will cast but little , Journeying up the hill of life ; But they make the weak and weary Stronger , braver for the strife . Do you count them only trifles ? What to earth are sun and rain ? Never was a kind word wasted , Never one was said in vain . When the cares of life are many , And its burdens heavy grow , Think of weak ones close beside you , If you love them , tell them so . What you count of little value Has an almost magic power , And beneath their cheering sunshine Hearts will blossom like a flower . So , as up life 's hill we journey , Let us scatter all the way Kindly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloudy day . // Grudge no loving word or action As along through life you go , There are weary ones around you , If you love them , tell them so . // father 's door opens is probably not a r away , and he is a convenient little neighbor to the boy clothed in purple and fine linen . He probably has a great deal more fun than the other , and his mother who goes out to wash and iron has not cheated him of this part of his birthright . " I have done everything in my power , " said a woman of pronounced social ambition , " to throw my son Tom into the company of Judge G 's and Doctor A 's sons , but he does not care for them in the least , and slips off with little rowdies and roughs whose fathers drive trucks and dig ditches . " She did not seem to know that a child whose father drove a truck might not be a rough or a rowdy , and that she was trying to cultivate snobbishness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child that he does anything furtively . A boy should not slip away to any set of companions . Interrogated as to what she meant by rowdies , she explained that she did not like dirt and ignorance . None of us does . Yet a certain amount of dirt is good for a growing boy , and this mother would have tolerated ignorance had it worn fine clothes . A question that forces itself on the fastidious mother and causes her hours of agony arises when her boy has lost his childish ringlets , and begins to wear the closecropped hair of seven . About this time the joy of ' battle first throbs in a youthful soul . The question of fighting is simple enough to fathers , but it puts mothers in a dire dilemma . A refined woman loathes street combats , and revolts , almost to faintness , when first she sees a bruised and bleeding little fellow , who has engaged in fisticuffs with another on the play-ground . He is excessively proud of his blackened eye , and does not mind a torn jacket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother is sorely dismayed . Her husband laughingly tells her that the thing is all right , that every boy has to win his spurs , and that Jack is not to be blamed , so long as he fights with a fellow of his own size or a bigger boy ; that the only disgrace for a boy is to be a coward or a bully , and to attack the weaker party . Boys are very // likely to go in gangs . The boys of one school often have stubborn fights with the boys of another , and take a fierce delight in the onslaughts and forays which constitute for them a large part of the joy of life . T. B. Aldrich in his Story of a Bad Boy , who was not after all so very bad , tells of the intermittent warfare carried on by the lads in different parts of the seaport where he lived . Successive generations of boys repeat this history . It almost goes without saying that some physical fighting will be done by all manly boys , and that mothers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moral courage is no doubt a finer thing than mere physical bravery , yet the latter is sometimes a stepping-stone to the former , and on the whole the worst thing a boy can do , either morally or physically , is to show the white feather . We do not want our boys to run away from an antagonist , and we do want them , wherever they are , to stand their ground . If a boy 's rights are disputed it is well for him to have a loyal ally in the boy next door . Our Saviour said , " I came not to send peace , but a sword . " The white flower of peace blooms most radiantly over battlefields . Let me guard a point . No figure is more contemptible than that of the braggart who is for ever seeking a fight , and going about with a chip on his shoulder . A boy must be taught to endure a certain amount of injustice with patience , and to look upon a fight as the last resort . The truculent boy who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighbor his life long . A mother in a western town confessed to me that her special difficulty lay with the boy on the other side of the garden fence , but it was purely on account of her fourteen-year-old daughter . I wish you could have seen Milly . She was as pretty as a picture , ? tall , straight , with brown eyes full of laughing light , and a cheek the color of a ripe peach . A mother might well cherish her tenderly . So dimpled and delicate , with that bewitching look of dawn in her face , it seemed strange that this problem of // the boy and girl should so soon have obtruded itself in her case . " She and Fritz have played together all their lives , and it did very well when they were little , but Milly 's tomboy days ought to be over . I wo n't have her mixed up with his people , with a family of whom I do n't approve . I have put my foot down . Fritz and she may be civil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come here and take up her time when she ought to be busy with her books . I will not let her drive in his cart to the Centre , and I have forbidden all intimacy between them . " " How has your plan worked ? " " Not very well . I ca n't shut Milly up in her room , nor send her to bed in the daytime , and she seems more than ever interested in Fritz , since I have set myself to keep him at a distance . I hoped that he might go away to business , but he stays right here . " " Well , " said I slowly , " I would not have adopted your methods . You have deepened desire by emphasizing denial . Milly wants what she can not have . Fritz , who was a commonplace boy friend , has become a romantic figure . Clandestine interviews have probably succeeded the open and frank friendliness in which there lurked no harm . " " Yes , " she replied , " when I hear him whistle softly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ library window , I know Milly hears him , too . ' Tis n't long before she steals out and joins him . Tell me what I can do . " " Several things . You may invite one of the cousinhood , Ralph , Justin , Will , to come and pay you a visit . You may get your sister Lucy to invite Milly to spend a winter in Richmond and attend school there . You may withdraw your opposition , let Fritz come in and out whenever he pleases and make the house pleasant to him . Give the little friendship your sanction , and you will soon find that it will cease to be exclusive . " Another mother has been disturbed over her son , nineteen years old , and in every way satisfactory , except that he is devoted to a // young woman whom she thinks not quite a lady . " With his sisters and me as patterns , how can Lester be infatuated with a girl whose manners are hoidenish and whose people are low ? I mean just that , low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word , but they are coarse and common . " " What have you done ? " " Oh , I 've talked and talked and talked . The more I 've talked , the more Lester goes visiting up the hill where he says all is free and easy and he has a good time . It all comes of living near underbred people . Lester met her first through the boy next . door . Goodness ! If I could only have my own way and keep Lester to myself , I 'd be a happy woman ! " " What a pity that sons and mothers have such different notions of beauty ! " I said , reflectively . " Lester is twenty-five years your junior , and you might not be enthusiastic over any girl he fancied , but if this young woman is really very objectionable. why not try the power of a counter attraction ? Invite some other girl here , a girl from another place , and try what there may be in the expulsive power of a new affection . That is what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to express aversion or criticism in a style that instantly ranges their children on the opposite side . Of f all desirable qualities in a mother , tact is preeminently the one most to be sought . Though it is popularly supposed to be a feminine attribute , mothers are often deficient in it when their hearts are deeply involved . They find fault and nag and object and interpose obstacles , when it would be better to use a gentle diplomacy , and gain their end by a flank movement instead of a direct attack . A tactful woman will often succeed in extricating her son from an entanglement or freeing him from a false position , when another will precipitate an issue by the energy of her opposition . A great deal of trouble is made by superfluous talk . Silence is useful where speech is worthless . Expostulation and criticism seldom prevent a boy from paying his de178 RADIANT MOTHERHOOD voirs at a shrine not pleasing to his mother but she may show him the difference between one girl and another by inviting them both to visit her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nicer . By taking merely tentative and passing admiration too seriously , a mother has often brought to pa the very thing she most dreaded . Lev should be discreet and very fertile in expo . dients . One pays dearly for blunders , and blunders made with the young foot up to a weary sum total with compound interest . Associates and companions influence young people to an extent beyond that exerted by other education . Your boy receives a great deal from his teachers , of ' course , but his teachers are older than he ; they are clothed upon with authority and are on another plane than that on which their pupils stand . A man of twenty-eight or thirty seems venerable to a lad of twelve . and to eighteen or nineteen he does not present himself in the light of an equal . But the boy next door , the fellow on the team , the comrade of sport and study is potential . hat he says and does reach far and mean uch in building character . Shall we quote merson ? He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more kindness than is ever spoil . Maugre all the selfishness that chills e east winds the world , the whole family is bathed with an element of love like a fine ether . How many persons we meet in houses , whom we scarcely speak to , whom yet we honor , and who honor us ! How many we see in the street , or sit with in church , whom , though silently , we warmly rejoice to be with ! Read the language of these wandering eye-beams . The heart knoweth . " The effect of the indulgence of this human affection is a certain cordial exhilaration . In poetry and in common speech the emotions of benevolence and complacency which are felt toward others are likened to the material effects of fire ; so swift , or much more swift , more active , more cheering , are these fine inward irradiations . From the highest degree of passionate love to the low182 RADIANT MOTHERHOOD With a fearless pride that has naught to hide , Though he bows like a little knight , Quite debonair , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swift as light . Does his mother call ? Not kits , or ball , Or the prettiest game can stay His eager feet as he hastes to greet Whatever she means to say . And the teachers depend on the little friend At school in his place at nine , With his lessons learned and his good marks earned , All ready to toe the line . I wonder if you have seen him , too , This boy , who is not too big For a morning kiss from mother and Sis , Who is n't a bit of a prig , But gentle and strong , and the whole day long As merry as boy can be . A gentleman , dear , in the coming years , And at present the boy for me . XII BETWEEN TIMES The transition between childhood and adolescence is a time of peculiar pleasure and peculiar anxiety , about equally mingled . What we call the awkward age passes sooner with girls than with boys . The former have their brief interval of lean body and long limbs , or of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suitably , and they suffer from self-consciousness and are snubbed by elder sisters and pretty grownup cousins . Nobody on earth can be so pitiless as a pretty girl of twenty to a sister of fifteen who envies her elder her privileges and her beauty . Sweet-and-twenty has no intention of cruelty . She is simply radiant and absorbed , and condescends from a height to her junior who is neither baby to be petted , nor equal to be respected . The 183 // attitude is that of a senior in college to all in-coming freshman . Fifteen feels it , but makes no sign . She merely stays more closely by her mother , that intimate friend whose sympathy is a strong tower to which she may run . With marvelous swiftness the younger girl slips the husk of awkwardness , and blooms out into the rare and exquisite loveliness of eighteen . Her brother is slower to change and leave behind him the crudeness and rawness of the hobbledehoy . Of all insufferable beings , except to those who love him best , a boy between sixteen and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are exceptions , but the majority of boys , who are approaching the border of young manhood , are either defiantly self-assertive and amusingly selfconceited , or else they are painfully diffident and correspondingly clumsy . Their period of emerging from the shell is later than that of their sisters and , on the whole , they , as well as their friends , have more disagreeable experiences to bear than falls to the lot of girlhood . A boy who has his mother at his side , affectionate , good-humored , gay , cheery , and always sure to understand the situation , is to be congratulated . For him the chrysalis state will be shortened . His mother will claim him for escort duty . She will quietly take care that he is not overlooked in company , and she will not make fun of his first shy advances toward the other sex . A lad who is used to the society of girls has a better manner , sooner loses his air of defiance , and sooner enters on the stage of easy assurance that befits the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they were the plague . In a hundred small ways life is hard for the growing lad . There is a moment when people hesitate how to address him . To call him Edward or Theodore seems too familiar to strangers , the Master of childhood would be an insult , and Mister is a trifle absurd . A mother tides over this infelicity . She presents " My son , Ralph , " or " My boy , Jack , " with so sweet an air and so delicate a pride in the pronoun , as well // as the substantive , that no awkwardness is remarked or , if there , it is gone in the twinkling of an eye . The lad who was in knickerbockers yesterday shoots up into long trousers and dinner-coat before you are aware , and the Mister becomes his natural designation . When the children are babies the nursery takes precedence of everything else . But when Jim is at one college and Jeanie at another , and the brother and sister next older are in society , and the brother and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hastening on , father and mother have their hands full with the young people . When means are limited , this is a time of great strain . Three or four children in the midst of the educational process , a debutante in the house with her train of attendants and admirers , or a son in the first strenuous and unremunerative years of his professional career , make formidable demands on the purse of a man who has been able to save little , or who works on a salary . The educated man , lawyer , doctor , clergyman , though his income be small , is willing to make almost incredible sacrifices , that his children may receive a liberal education . It is only the one who has struggled up from poverty without the aid of culture who puts a low estimate on what the schools do for youth , though in these days , it is not often we meet any man of force and character who does not covet for his sons a better start than he had himself . But though money is scant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a jubilant and exciting and significant time when Myrtle is just out , and Jessie is at college , and Will is in the law school . Change the figures as you please , the names and the places do not matter . The house is full of a happy expectation . The children are coming and going , are writing letters home , are wanting new frocks , new books , new outfits of this kind or that . Their friends are many and as eager and gay as themselves . Father and mother renew their own ( lays of youth and romance , remember what they had half forgotten , the days they had // before he began to be bald and feel a little afraid of Time , and before she lost the roundness from her cheek and the gold-gli i It from her hair . Father ages faster than mother at this particular period . He knows that he is growing old . But she laughs merrily in the face of the spoiler and her dimples are unconquered . " Her mother ought to keep Cynthia at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the effort made to let the daughter have the four years at her alma mater , on which her heart was set . But if the daughter long for it , the mother would rather be lonely awhile , would rather wear old dresses and furbish up old hats , would rather dismiss a maid and work harder herself , than deny aught to her darling . " I can not find it in my duty to deprive my child of so great an opportunity , " the mother says , though more brightness than the daughter dreams goes away with her , and the four years seem a desert-stretch in the quiet home . // A many-sided question is this of the daughter 's college life . The mental discipline , the balance of faculties , the admirable poise gained in college , can be so surely gained in no other way . If a young woman is to be self-supporting , her college diploma will aid her either in at once securing a foothold , or in preparing for further professional study . If she is to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mart , her college life will do for her precisely what it does for her brother : it will broaden her horizon , add to her resources , and increase her powers of independent happiness . That it inevitably defers her marriage to a later date than was common in the days of her grandmother , and-popular in the days of her mother , is not a fact to be deplored . Girls in new countries , as ours has been till very recently , always marry early . Yet they are entitled to a pleasant girlhood as well as a happy wifehood , and the college curriculum at least restores to them their birthright . But , when college days are over , and the // mother , thankfully triumphant , fancies that she is now to have her daughter 's companionship , she is often doomed to disappointment . Few girls easily and immediately adjust themselves to the routine of home , after a prolonged and semi-cloistered absence at school . College life is stimulating , full of gaiety and fun , full of agreeable work ; after it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dull . The girl has dropped out of the home circle . The differences in atmosphere , aims , and daily conversation , not tangible , but very real , are sufficient to disturb her , and the girl at home is homesick to be in college again . Let it be stated that the most delightful of relationships is that which exists between a mother and daughter , when the latter has just reached womanhood . The two are , in the fullest and completest sense , friends . They are like sisters . Their companionship is ideally pleasant , and the number of interests they have in common strengthens the bond that unites them . Yet a rift may come within the lute . The younger of the two needs and wishes to feel herself of real use . Her mother , on the other side , has an almost passionate desire to save her daughter from toil and care . She tries , self-abnegation having become second nature , to give the best of everything to the girl . There is not much money , perhaps , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a trip is planned for Cynthia . Duly chaperoned , in company with a group of classmates , the young girl sets foot on the Atlantic steamer , and away she goes for six months or a year , mother contentedly staying at home to receive with joy the reports of her daughter 's journey . This is usual , but it is unfair . Mother has earned her own holiday , and she should take it , leaving her daughter to manage the household , and take a post-graduate course in the kitchen and drawing-room as her mother 's vicegerent . Her holiday should come later . The mother among her young people must pardon a little homily . She is far too selfdenying , too ready to efface herself , too // willing to retreat to the background . Every mother , who has piloted children through the shoals and past the quicksands of their infancy and school-days , has arrived at a point where she should fold her hands and sit still . For her , for a while , there should be repose , and hers should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the outings among old friends . Youth is the season of intense and vivid pleasure in the present , of energy , of hope . But it has its corresponding depressions . Later on , a temporary delay , the postponement of plans , the slowly-opening door to advancement , does not depress the mind , as the same thing does when one is young . Our daughters , more than our sons , suffer from the shadow of morbidness and the strain of unrest , and chafe at the inertia of waiting for events to shape themselves to their desires . A mother said to me one day , " When my children were little , I knew how to comfort them in every trouble . They climbed into my lap , their heads were laid against my // breast . I sang away their griefs . But now that they are grown up , I have to stand aside , helpless and useless , and let them fight their battles . I can not soothe their pains . I can not ward away misfortunes . They will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law . " Precisely . No grown person is bound to take the advice of or surrender wholly to the opinions of another grown person . One of the most difficult lessons for a mother to learn is that her children are grown , that they must decide many points without reference to her judgment . Affectionate sons and daughters will treat with tenderness the feelings and listen with deference to the conclusions of their parents , but the period of pupilage , in the order of nature , passes with childhood . The young men and women are in the van of a new generation , ? the generation that is to take and hold the worldstage for a time , when the preceding one joins the great majority . This should be remembered . The girl of the period , restless unless able to work out // her salvation in her own way , should not be hampered by an overbearing mother . In the past , an unmarried girl remaining at home , under the control of a dominant mother , often withered like a specimen in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fifty , not one day older in experience of the world , or in youthful sentiment , than if they had been twenty . The imperious old mother still treated them as though they were children . They had no freedom to go on a visit , to invite a guest , to change in the least the routine of the household . Nothing is more pitiful than such instances of arrested development . The rosebud is beautiful in its season , but only compassion befits the dried and faded bud , that lives on and never becomes a rose . A mother who magnifies her authority to the extent of cramping and fettering her children 's souls is the least excusable of autocrats . But if the iron of absolutism is in her blood , she goes on sinning against her daughters , and denying them their right of way , almost in ignorance of what she does . Her sons escape from her power , and take their natural place , for over them she can not exercise her prerogative of eminent domain . The subtle influence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a weakling , will not brook being for ever tied to his mother 's apron-string . Curiously , the dominant and peremptory woman adores her sons , sees in them no wrong , and accords them the liberty she withholds from her daughters . An unfair partiality is frequently observed when the young people are at home together , in the manner of the mother to her boys . She is almost their slave . She studies their caprices . She arranges the order of the day with a view to their pleasure . Some old-fashioned women expect the girls to concede everything to their brothers , and to wait on the latter . Fortunately , the sister in our day does not graciously yield in this regard , and properly expects . her brother to wait on her . Reciprocal courtesy should be the rule in the household , and the stronger should be the burden-bearers. // If mothers are disposed to spoil their sons , fathers keep the balance even by their devotion to daughters . A man is apt to idolize his little girl , and to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insecurely across the floor , and slips her mite o 1 ' a hand into his big palm . Through her childhood she is his little sweetheart . When she reaches womanhood , he treats her with playful fondness , and his air toward her , as well as his proud ownership , is tinged with i chivalry . Father and daughter have an intimacy as charming as the affection of mother and son . To both parents , by an indefinable reflection , youth , buoyant and beautiful , seems to return , not merely as a reminiscence , but in verity , as they look into the enchanted mirror , and see their old selves repeated in the persons of their sons and daughters . In Sleepy Hollow villages , where the children have grown up together and gone away to college or business about the same time , a delightful stir and effervescence comes to pass , as successive sets of young ! Il // people step to the front . Holidays bring them home in force . The old streets blossom with their brightness . They call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hello , Marjorie ! " " Good morning , Jack ! " of the old schoolmate is like music to the ear of the neighborly shopkeepers , to the farmers jogging to market behind fat ponies , and to the doctor going his rounds in his old gig . They have seen the young people grow up . Their successes are the successes of the township , and , in a sense , the whole countryside is a setting for their drama , the whole country their bailiwick . Take it all in all , the time of the young people , the May-time of life , is a happy time for mothers . The ruffles and flurries are like ripples on the wind-tossed lake , but underneath are depth of affection , loyal trust , and a steadfast looking for what the future will unfold . As for youth itself , it asks only the glory and the wages of " going on . " " If mother would listen to me , dears , She would freshen the faded gown ; // She would sometimes take an hour 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it should n't be all for the children , The fun , and the cheer , and the play ; With the patient droop on the tired mouth , And the Mother has had her day ! ' True , mother has had her day , dears , When you were her babies three , And she stepped about the farm and the house As busy as ever a bee ; When she rocked you all to sleep , dears , And sent you all to school , And wore herself out , and did without , And lived by the Golden Rule . And so your turn has come , dears ; Her hair is growing white , And her eyes are gaining the far-away look That peers beyond the night . One of these days in the morning Mother will not be here ; She will fade away into silence , The mother so true and dear . Then , what will you do in the daylight , And what in the gloaming dim ; // And father , tired and lonesome then , Pray , what will you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother , You must make her rest to-day ; Must give her a share in the frolic , And draw her into play . " XIII WHEN THE CHILDREN MARRY Homes do not disintegrate , they rather expand and , like the banyan tree , send fort h other homes from their branches , when the children marry . Yet to the parents the effect is that of disintegration , when the first wedding in the family takes son or daughter out of the group , and makes needful a widening of the circle . . What sort of wife shall the son choose ? The mother asks herself the question with anxious thought . If she might choose for him , she would feel a greater security , but , as his father did before him , the lad select s his bride for himself . In many older lands , the young people have little to say on this momentous question of marriage , every detail being arranged by others and the element of romance completely eliminated . 200 // The parents chaffer and bargain , the wife is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chess-board , and the whole affair , reduced to its simplest terms , is an affair of the market-place . This is the immemorial custom of the Oriental world , and of the venerable civilizations in which woman is not much considered , and the home-idea in the sweet sense of Christianity is unknown . In several European countries , the marriage of children is a matter practically in the hands of parents , and the bride 's dower is so important to her settlement in life that money is laid aside for it , from the day of her birth . With us , sentiment obtains preeminence , and unless there be love and individual seeking and surrendering , the wedding bells do not ring . A young man meets a girl , is interested in her , why or how , who can explain ? She has a dainty flower-like face , a graceful turn of the head , an erect carriage , a winsome manner , or she wears pretty clothes , plays tennis or golf to perfection , and has an air of good society . Propinquity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // two young people of marriageable age be thrown much in each other 's company , let them be of equal education , birth , and social standing , and the probability is that they will be mutually attracted . Organizations in which young men and women work together for common improvement or a public charity are fruitful in promoting marriage , certain groups separating naturally into pairs , and certain girls being appropriated by certain men , until liking grows into loving , and friendship heightens into intimacy , and then follow betrothal and marriage . The simpler life and fewer distractions of the rural community favor early marriage . Our towns foster selfishness , and form a background for the bachelor who declines to give up his liberty , and his counterpart , the independent girl , who equally prizes hers , and prefers self-support to marriage , unless the latter can bring assured material prosperity in its wake . Cupid flies the town , routed by the arrogance of Mammon . But town or country are the same , when // the question presents itself to the mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first necessity of her child . Few people are able , without a hidden pang , to see their sons set forth on that journey which shall take them in some measure out of the old life , and bring to the old home a sense of loss never to be made up . Not jealousy precisely , nor envy , nor reproach is in the mother 's heart , but a mingling of all three embitters the hour , when her boy tells her that he has found the one woman out of the wide world , ? the one who is to be his wife . She does her best to conceal her coldness , she would not , for the wealth of the Klondike , let him fancy her critical , yet she can not share the lover 's enthusiasm , and she can not behold his future wife without some misgivings . If only she might have chosen for him ! This is her thought , though all the while she knows that a man worth his salt must choose for himself . In private conference with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often they , who are on the plane with the younger woman , and who do not // invest their brother with the wonderful charms he wears to maternal eyes , win her to resignation , if not to contentment . " Marguerite Maxwell is engaged to Walter Gordon , " said one friend to another , over a cup of afternoon tea . " The announcement has just been made . " " Ah ! Marguerite is a dear girl , but Walter 's mother will not be pleased . Mrs. Gordon resents marriage on the part of her sons . She opposed Louis when he was in love with Amy Mulford , until she fairly drove him out of the house , and she has never spoken to him since the wedding . " " What was there against Amy ? " " Not a thing . She makes Louis the best of wives . The trouble is that Mrs. Gordon wants to keep her sons for herself . She would not consent to their mating with angels . She will be heartbroken at giving up Walter . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not an unparalleled one . Mothers are not , fortunately , so self-absorbed and tyrannical that they stubbornly // stand in the way of a son 's happiness , but they can not help their attitude of the lookeron who views through eyes of long experience , and wonders and pauses , and wishes , all in vain , that she might choose . Nine times out of ten , she could not have chosen for another , ? and that other , bone of her bone , and flesh of her flesh , ? so well as he chooses for himself . Each successive generation has its viewpoint , not that of its predecessor , and each soul has its individuality , its solitudes , its reserves , and its requirements . Heredity brings out contrasts as well as resemblances . The law of reversion to type has never been repealed . Your son with his baffling characteristics , his little ways , his tendencies that are not yours , his preferences that puzzle you , may but repeat the traits of an ancestor , whose name on earth survives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a mossgrown stone . Whatever has been the history of any love , if it be true love , the rest of us , mothers included , should not interfere , // Put off thy shoes from thy feet : for the place where thou standest is holy ground , if thereon be kindled the flame of a love that shall burn through the years of two lives , shining , glowing , warming , comforting , but never consuming the fabric on which it feeds . What ought the mother to do ? Obviously , her duty is the thing that actuates what she does , exceptions noted only to prove the rule . She sets aside her prejudice , her interrogations , and her forebodings , and , with royal and beautiful generosity , welcomes her prospective daughter-in-law , and determines that she shall be a daughter in love . She gives her son the sympathy he craves , she rises to the fullness and dignity of true motherhood , and self once effaced , permits no unworthy after-thoughts to mar the sincerity of the relation . Should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love-making , ? those tentative stages which are by way of experiment , when he may still advance or still retreat , in either case with honor , - feel assured that he // is about to make a great mistake , she would best not show hostility . Open opposition is sure to confirm him in his course . Diplomacy , discretion , and tact must be used , and , if practicable , the distracting and diverting power of a new interest . Mothers sometimes force their sons into marriages exasperating to the mothers and mistaken for the sons , by the sheer compulsion of avowed dislike and declared war . They might as well give a push downward to a man giddily perched on the edge of a precipice . A touch , and over he goes . The most amiable , the most pious , the most gentle of mothers may plunge into this error , and live to lament it , for Nature will rout her in any attack in the open field . Nature can not possibly be routed , except by a flank movement . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all who are mothers of marriageable sons are on guard lest their sons fall in love . There are women , deep-natured , broadminded and true-hearted , who rejoice when their sons find the fitting mate , and who have // so brought them up that they are prepared to be good husbands . A man 's mother determines what rank he shall take as a husband , to what class he shall belong . She it is , who , in his boy- trains him in the practice of little observances , little amenities , little courtesies that make the world beautiful . After all , most of our happiness depends on the way we use the little things that lie in our path . " We take our share of fretting , Of grieving and forgetting ; The paths are often rough and steep , and heedless feet may fall , But yet the days are cheery And night brings rest when weary , And somehow this old planet is a good world after all . " Notwithstanding the impression everywhere conveyed in fiction , reality does not bear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughters married . To read current novels . especially those written in England , one would suppose that every // mother 's chief ambition was to marry off her girls . Formerly , before the clock had struck the hour of the higher education , and before young women had taken to business and professional life in such numbers as to crowd men from hundreds of remunerative places , once theirs by right , parents were justified in hoping that their daughters might be well established in homes of their own . Girls marry later than they once ? did . Girls are much harder to please , and demand more of their suitors than when Jane Austen and Maria Edgeworth wrote , and , at present , no girl is obliged to marry that she may have a man to care for her . She can stand on her feet and care for herself . So , she is in no haste to say yes , and her mother is blissfully contented to keep her in her childhood 's home , its light and joy . The term old maid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One never hears it . The lady who used to be called an old maid is a leader in society and in the church , very probably has her assured position , it may be , her sepa9,10 RADIANT MOTHERHOOD rate home , if her means permit , and does whatever she pleases , as is her unquestioned right . An unmarried woman , beyond fifty , is a personage of independence and , whether poorer or richer , asks nobody 's pity or tolerance . And still the plain truth is that mothers , when their daughters marry , revive their old romance , see again the flowers of a spring that was sweet and blooming in the long ago , and receive the approaching suitors most graciously . A mother takes a great deal of pride in her daughter 's trousseau . She may drop a furtive tear on the wedding-day , but tears do not fall on the wedding-gown . Here again Nature advances with flags flying and bugles blowing . All our modern improvements and conveniences to the contrary , a colony of self-supporting wageearning girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home . A home to be the real thing is a paradise of two , and it takes a new Adam and a new Eve to make a new Eden . The woman who has rested all the years of her married life on the faith , // the truth , the sleepless love of her husband , knows that life can offer her woman-child no better , no more satisfying thing , than a good man 's steadfast love . Marriage is the founding of another family . The original home becomes a sort of homestead , to which the children will return on anniversaries and in every hour of gladness or of pain , after a while bringing their children with them . Motherhood and fatherhood receive their coronation when the second generation stirs them with its throb of exulting life . To feel the truest joy that can brim an earthly chalice , one must be a mother , but that cup , sweet as it is , takes on a flavor of heavenly ambrosia , when the mother holds the child of son or daughter in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Over the cradle , asperities vanish , doubts are exorcised , the discontent ceases . A mother may have her little reserves about Harold 's wife , but the mother of Harold 's children has a claim on her inmost heart . A mother may privately wish that Juliet 's husband were more am212 RADIANT MOTHERHOOD bitious , more pushing , a little more likely to succeed , a little more demonstrative in manner , but what cares she for the little more or the little less , when she and he together look into the wee face of Juliet 's first baby . Their hands clasp . They strike a new compact of love . Grandchildren bring the new family straight into the citadel of the old . The two mothers , hers and his , are drawn into friendlier confidence beside the crib of the new-born . An immense amount of pure nonsense is always afloat about the mother-in-law . She is supposed to be a legitimate target for the arrows of ridicule . One finds her depicted as the potential cause of family jars , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Jenny retires to her chamber in tears . Jenny announces a forthcoming visit from her mother , and John takes the opportunity to go on the road . Any mark suffices for cheap wit , and occasional mothers-in-law are fairly hit by random strokes . But the mother-in-law is just a mother , and after // everything has been said against her , she is the children 's grandmother . She is the champion of both children and parents , the friend of her son or her daughter-in-law , and worthy , in most households , whether she come as a visitor or remain as an inmate , of confidence and esteem . One can but wish that there might be fair play in the matter of the mother-in-law . The prejudice against her harks back to other days and other lands . It is a remnant of the patriarchal rule , universal in primitive times , when the sons brought their wives home to live under the old roof , or in the tent , and the mother 's rule was rigid , and her sway supreme . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the relation had its origin . We are neither cave-dwellers nor tent-dwellers , and the mother no longer controls the movements nor arbitrates issues that concern her married children . From being a formidable figure , the mother-inlaw has become a charming personage , honored and beloved , and here she belongs in the calendar of gracious maternity . // Plain prose never fails to come marching in on the heels of poetry . The drums beat , the banners wave , the general rides at the head of the column . But back in the dust and heat trudge the weary men-at-arms , the rank and file . The wedding-day heads the procession with its flowers and music , its brave apparel , its clustering of friends and kindred . After it follow the common days , days of varying weather , when the fire must burn under the pot , and the man must work , and the woman keep house , and the commonplaces of kitchen and shop become part of the daily grind . People who rush into matrimony without any notion of the cost of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wealth is not needed by a young couple , but there should be a modest income , and an intention to live within it .

Parents are justified in asking that the new family shall // not be a burden on the family exchequer , but shall be sufficient to itself . For to us all come The Common Days . " In days supreme , of fond delight , When happy thoughts within us dwell , Like vestals robed in stainless white , Who time their footsteps by the swell Of sweet-voiced bells upon the air ? Then have we least the need for prayer . In days obscured by veiling folds Of grief , or clouded o'er with dread , While dumb suspense relentless holds Its sword above the shrinking head , ?

In days of slowly fretting care , Then most we need the strength of prayer . " XIV MOTHERS BY ADOPTION The never-settled question whether heredity or training is the more influential in human lives comes to the front when one dares undertake the responsibility of adopting a child . Always there are childless mothers and orphaned children in the world , and it would seem that no asylum can do for a motherless and fatherless child half so much as a good home , with its life of the family group , surely can . Given enough means to maintain a home , it would again seem as if the Heavenly Father meant that the roof should shelter some small waif of destiny who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abundant provision for a family , and no children are sent , the empty heart of her who is a true woman calls for some one to mother . Childless people are 21Z // very tenderly devoted to one another , and yet they do not reap quite the satisfaction they might , if they steel their hearts against the lifted voice of the orphan . There are more ways than one of fulfilling the duty of being a mother by adoption . You may accept the privilege by proxy . You may support a little one in an orphanage . Compared with the rough treatment received by the children of the alley and the street , the gently cared for waifs in an institution are fortunate , for they have good beds , warm housing , lessons , food , comfortable clothing , and a measure of technical preparation for maturity . There is , too , always the chance that , some day or other , a visitor may lose her heart to a round , rosy , dimpled child , and carry it off to live in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chosen for adoption by kind visitors . They must stay where they are , and they might be worse off . And yet , here Nature again utters her protest . Who would not rather , as a child , live in the poorest place with a mother , who may scold , but // who kisses , too , with crusts to eat , and a poor bed to lie in , than be an orphan in the finest orphanage ever built ? The institution does what it can , but it seldom stamps on one of its wards the genuine hall-mark of home . Do the best it can , it exacts a rather cramping uniformity from its boys and girls . They must be dressed and trained alike and they grow alike outwardly , while often their inner natures are dwarfed for the lack of individual guidance and love . The mother who is hesitating about adopting a little one , particularly if she is ignorant of its antecedents , says to herself , " This child 's father may have been a drunkard . Its mother may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inherited tendencies to depravity , lurking like a poison ? " Against this very reasonable fear may be cited the tragedy of destiny which occasionally gives saintly parents children who surpass their fellows in wickedness . Your own child , born of a line of the noblest and purest of men and women , may fall into evil ways , and prove a sorrow and disgrace . // Heredity is not an armor of proof against the assaults of the devil . There may be a weak spot , some drop of blood may spread darkness and stain , and the life that started with high hopes be wrecked on the shoals of unbelief , dishonor , or greed , while generations look down from Heaven in surprise at the failure . Human nature is a strange bundle of contradictions and paradoxes . Nothing about it is stranger than its duality , its weird possibilities of evil that war for ever with its probabilities of good . The little child of nobody , tracing genealogy back nowhere , a little vagrant ship sailing into a harbor of love and home , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth 's benefactors . At least , the adopting parent will have given this child a chance ; will have done all that in her lay to train the conscience , elevate the ideals , and establish habits of rectitude . Every child on earth , however lost and degraded , is God 's child . The Lord made this child , too , waif of some derelict family , in His own image . // In numerous instances of adoption , I have seen in the outcome , a success equal to the success attained in bringing up the children of the home . The adopting mother will be on the alert to note tendencies , to restrain , to encourage , and to promote the best interests of the little one she has taken to be hers . Many years ago , after an epidemic had laid waste a manufacturing town , a millowner and his wife , middle-aged and childless , adopted a sweet-faced little girl of six . Father , mother , and brothers had been swept away by the fever . The dark-eyed , gentle Jeanie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful home , and nestled into the hearts of her new parents like a bird that folded its wings in gladness . A year passed by , and they had a daughter of their own , and two years afterward a son came to be their pride . As though the dormant instinct of parenthood had wakened when they adopted Jennie , or as though God rewarded them by giving them the long-denied desire of their hearts , when // they had cared for an unsheltered little one , their home became joyous and their hands full . Lo , children are an heritage of the Lord : and the fruit of the womb is His reward , sang David in the ancient days . Did they regret their act in adopting Jeanie ? Was she discarded , or put in a lower place than the daughter who followed her ? Not at all . Jeanie remained the elder sister , she shared equally in fortune with the others , and she bore the family name . When old age came to her adopted parents , it was she who stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was their blessing to the end . A childless couple , longing to have the patter of little feet and the melody of little voices in their home , went to an almshouse of the great city where they lived , and adopted a foundling . Their kindred and friends held up protesting hands . There was the merest shred of evidence as to the nationality of the child , who was supposed to belong to a fair-haired foreign race . // The child not only in every way satisfied those who became her sponsors , but grew up , tall , strong , beautiful , with a peculiar grace and dignity and an almost phenomenal talent for art . She was far in excess , as to brains and breeding , of the plain people who adopted her . Chosen for her dimpled prettiness and coaxing , kittenish ways , out of a charitable home for friendless children , another girl proved a lifelong vexation and torment in the household that made her its charge . But their own , had they had a child , might have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-centered and querulous , " said a mother . " She is in danger of being spoiled because she is our only one . " So , with her husband 's approval , this mother adopted a child from an orphanage , and because that child pined for her little brother , adopted him , too . This investment proved all that was hoped for . Questions arise in the minds of the prudent as to what they can afford , and there is reluctance to assume a burden that may // grow heavy and that may then seem less supportable , ' than if it had come by birthright into the home . The answer is in the words of Scripture , According to your faith be it unto you . If you adopt one of God 's poor , God will see to your basket and your store . Let us take another view of the shield . You may never be called on to settle the question of adoption , as it concerns a stranger 's offspring , but you may take on you the office of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fair enough , loving enough , to forget the " step " and be a true mother to your husband 's children ; and if you can not say yes with all your heart , beware how you enter into such a relation . Literature reflects public opinion , and in every period , literature has dealt unkindly with the stepmother . She is cruel and spiteful in the fairy tale , she is seldom other than very disagreeable when she figures in a novel , and in real life , she is surrounded with suspicion and , in most courts of inquiry , condemned without a hearing . // Bravery of no mean order is required of the woman who in the fullest self-abnegation enters a home in which another has reigned before her , and gives herself to the arduous task of bringing up the motherless children there . If she can but find a clear path , and the children are young , she will have very little difficulty in winning their affection . Children are easily won by tenderness , and are held fast by justice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the early blossoms of the spring . The stepmother has no monopoly of injustice . It is the crying evil of a thousand homes , where the mother is unjust many times a year , in her treatment of her own children . But the faintest reproof of a stepmother awakens criticism from outsiders , when punishment administered by an own mother would not be so much as observed . Servants sow the seeds of dissension in the house to which the second mother comes . Kindred of the first wife , or of the husband , are on the watch for errors , and are often // too ready , with criticism and comment . Everybody is in arms to defend children whose mother is in another world . They are , of course , in much peril , either from over-indulgence on the part of those who have their care , or from neglect . A subtle jealousy pervades the minds of those who remember the mother who has gone . Her faults , if faults she had , are forgotten . Love evermore idealizes the departed . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interloper . Sometimes the new wife is secretly jealous of the woman who was first to claim her husband 's love , and this jealousy extends to the children . Overlooking the consolatory fact that whatever the past may have been , the present has poured its whole treasure of love upon her , the poor , petty , dissatisfied soul torments itself with half-concealed aversion , and declares its incompetence for vice-maternity , in a bearing of toleration , not of love , toward the children whom she is pledged to mother . Pledged , not only by the sentimental // promise exacted by the widower when he sought her , but pledged , by her very womanhood , to the mother who has left her brood for some one else to nourish , the conclusion of the matter is that it takes a large , fine , noble and true woman to be a good stepmother . There are , God be thanked , many such , and they achieve in the difficult role they undertake , a success that the recording angel marks with a white line . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have made no difference between the first family and the second , that the advent of their own babies does not cause them to treat the older children with coldness , and that , in brief , they do angelic work against odds , in a world that finds minding its own business the most insuperable of enterprises . But harken , 0 daughter , and consider , before you leave your father 's house , and go to the house of your husband to be the mother of a little group of children , waiting for your molding band ! Children are not always good . They have their naughty fits . They are not always clean . Can you love them // when they are dirty and grimy , when they tear their frocks and trousers , squabble in the nursery , and riot on the stairs ? Can you stand up for them when they get into trouble with the neighbors , and excuse the transgression when they take cookies from the jar , and jam from the pantry without leave or license ? A small curled darling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the wedding , is picturesque and pleasing . The same child , in the every-day escapades of an ordinary week , may be a tantalizing vision of disorder , a baffling problem harder than any you solved in college . Therefore , once more harken , 0 daughter , and consider before you become a stepmother ! Having considered , if in love and sweetness and the full surrender of gracious womanliness , you assume the scepter and undertake the office , may God bless you . May you be happy . Certain problems may arise from the conflicting claims of pecuniary interest in a household to which a second mother comes . Little children never give such matters a // thought . Into their Eden of life the serpent has not yet glided with his smooth seductiveness and his poisonous fangs . When a man in middle age , with sons and daughters grown , chooses to marry and bring a new wife into his home , it is little wonder if troubles assail her . The memory of the mother has become very precious to her children , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although they acquiesce in what they can not help . The sons yield more graciously and more completely than the daughters , and , unless they are exceptionally grasping , they do not much mind the fact that the family estate will be lessened when the day of division comes , by the portion of the stepmother . Men can fend for themselves , and they are not , as a sex , so given over to small jealousies or to strife against things inevitable and accomplished , as we women are . The circumscribed sphere of woman through many centuries , has obliged her , or has taught her , to survey things at close range , and she is apt to be deficient in a sense of values , and to get // her perspective rather distorted in consequence . All day the husband and sons are away at business , and the wife and daughters are at home . If the latter choose to be perverse or disagreeable , or if they are by nature incompatible , they may strew the wife 's path very thickly with thorns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is likely to be too often a feeling of thunder in the air . The husband will either refuse to take sides , or temporize , and , let him do his best , he will not find success easy in reconciling parties in an unequal and futile conflict . He will grow weary . A man desires peace at home . Perhaps it can be secured only by the expensive plan of maintaining two establishments , one for the wife and another for the daughters . There is no faintest recognition of motherhood by the latter , and the endeavors of the former , if they exist , are soon defeated . The situation is full of perplexity to every one involved . A sensitive man may be utterly worn out // by his efforts to maintain a truce , and at last lie down and die , his reserves of vitality all gone . This , strange to say , has happened before now . Then has ensued a disgraceful contest between the widow and the children , carried from court to court , before the litigation was ended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successive groups of children , the strain is intensified , and no one can marvel that this is so . Is there any lesson , any moral to be drawn from a state of affairs patent to every observer ? If there is any , it is this , and this only . Subordinate passion to justice , make the best of what is settled , and let every one in the family put self and pride and obstinacy aside , and cling to whatever is just . In this world justice is the one pearl in the amulet , that will keep home life intact , and home felicity unimpaired . My plea is that no woman shall lightly take upon herself the grave and far-reaching responsibilities of a stepmother . If I could reach daughters , I would urge them , on their side , to be fair , to be sincere , to be // above reproach , in their acceptance of her who stands in the place of their mother . " Out in the wide world , where the tempests beat , And hurtling hail falls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dismayed , alone , There may be one whose little heart makes moan , Unmothered in this place that is so cold , A poor lost lamb , that hath no sheltering fold . Perchance , some angel , bending , says to thee , Thy hands are empty , rise and come with me , Take thou this labor : ' t is a task divine , But Heaven hath not this day ordained it mine . Be thou Earth 's angel ! Clasp the little one Close to thy breast ; learn peace through duty done . " XV THE MOTHER IN THE TENEMENT Ours is an age and country of sharp contrasts . With a tide of immigration pouring in from Europe and the East , with a constantly shifting population and all that belongs to a new and aspiring republic , we have varieties of condition that are seen in no other land . Motherhood is fundamentally the same , so far as the primitive instinct and the deathless love for offspring prevail . In common with the bird on the nest and the lion in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And it may be that there is as great rejoicing in the heart of the mother who cradles her babe in the arc of her arm , in a hospital ward , as in that of the empress who looks into the face of her firstborn in a palace . I remember one day paying a visit to a 233 // friend who lived in two little rooms in a very humble rear tenement . When I knocked at the door , a faint voice bade me come in . Opening , I saw no one for a moment , but the door into the bedroom stood open , and I was bidden to come there . On her bed in this little dark room , which was lighted only from the other , lay my friend Gretchen , her long golden braids lying on the pillow , and her sweet face illumined by a radiance like the sun . She pulled down the cover and showed me a little round head and a little crumpled baby-face . " See , " she said . " Is n't he a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you came to see him . " " Are you all alone ? " I said . " Not in the least alone , " she answered . " Baby and I are together . John takes care of us both and mother looks in morning and evening . " They were as poor as the poorest , but Heaven had come into their home with the coming of the little child . Although in the mansion the mother is influential and honored , and her hand the one ever at the helm , she is no more an autocrat // in her domain than her sister in the tenement is in hers . If it is your good fortune to have had friendships among the poor , you can personally testify to the truth of this statement . Never are there warmer hearts , never are family ties more closely knit , and never are mothers more beloved than in homes where the means are of the narrowest , and the living is from hand to mouth . Walk , if you choose , through the most thickly inhabited quarter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closely as sardines in a box , each house sheltering many contiguous families , and in each small home you will find the mother reigning supreme . There are three little rooms , or perhaps five , ? oftener the former than the latter . In a thriving family there may be a room sacredly kept as a parlor , the pride of the good woman 's heart , and as highly prized by her as the stateliest drawing-room in the land by its owner . It will have a sofa , several plush-covered chairs , a marble-topped table and a lamp with gay shade and beaded fringe . Two or three framed photographs // will be on the wall , and very likely a sacred print in gaudy colors . Many tenements can afford no such luxury as this which indicates immunity from the pawnshop , while the good man has work , and something to pawn when the long strike or the long illness throws him out of a job . The family living-room in which the cooking , washing , ironing , and sewing are done , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the husband smokes his pipe beside the range , is the tiny kitchen , the real heart of this home . Whatever other space there is furnishes sleeping accommodations for the children , and sometimes for one or two boarders . Families of ten and twelve often spend their nights in two small and stifling rooms . It is little wonder that the people of the tenements are pallid and sallow . During the daytime their mattresses are piled one above the other ; at night they are spread side by side on the floor . No ceremony is used about meals and there are tenement families who never sit down together , even on SunIN // day , for a breakfast or a dinner . The mother stands beside the table and cuts slices from a loaf , or ladles stew from a pot , and gives a portion to each of her family in turn . One is not surprised that men spend their evenings in the saloon at the corner , where they find warmth , light , and comradeship , and for a little while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discomfort . Laboring men have long hours and hard toil , but in this country they do not share the stolid contentment of the unthinking . I sometimes fear that they think too much . At all events , their evenings in the saloon often do for them something worse than foster a love for drink . Here they talk of the doings of the day , and one half-tutored and rebellious spirit often draws others after him into envy of those who are better off . It is fortunate that the mother in the tenement does not seek the relief from fatigue that seems so often the bane of the father . Her life is hard , too , hard almost beyond bearing , but she carries her loads bravely . If her husband is incapaci238 RADIANT MOTHERHOOD tated for work by accident or illness , or i f discouragement ends with him in chronic laziness , she often goes out herself and by day 's labor earns her children 's bread . With her little ones in the day nursery and the older ones in the public school she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a helper . When I think of the cheery women I have known who have counted it a cause for thankfulness that they had four or five days ' work a week , and remember how well they have brought up their children , I am glad that I have seen heroines who never dreamed that there was an aureole about their heads . In the tenement home the mother sways an absolute scepter , whether she go out or stay in . Her husband has the excellent habit of bringing her his wages at the end of the week , and on pay-day , if he comes straight to her , she is willing to give him a certain portion for his own spending , even though she knows that the saloon-keeper will soon find it in his till . Unfortunately , the man sometimes takes the saloon on the way home , // and then only a small part falls into the wife 's purse . The mother among the very poor is the manager and economist . As the children grow old enough to help her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a question , and accept whatever portion she returns to them . A girl of the tenements has seldom much to say about her father . He exerts no appreciable influence in her life . The mother is frequently quoted and whatever she says , by her boys and girls both , until they reach the later teens , is regarded as law . Considering that this mother is , as a rule , a terribly over-worked and perhaps ill person , that she has few resources , that her only recreation is a bit of gossip with her next neighbor , and that her days are spent in a neverceasing conflict with poverty , it is marvelous how much she accomplishes . Her passionate love for her offspring is lavished on whichever child happens to be the reigning baby . Babyhood does not last long in the tenements . At a very early age little be240 RADIANT MOTHERHOOD ings , who in happier spheres are petted and cared for , learn to creep about and walk and take care of themselves . The little girl of six or seven must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child of ten shed bitter tears at the coming of another babe . There were so many to look after already ! The mother is often quick with a word and a blow , but her children do not doubt her affection and she retains their confidence . Her religion depends a good deal on the quarter in which she lives . An Italian neighborhood is of course devoutly Romanist in its creed , and mothers and children go to mass and look with loving eyes on the Madonna whose picture hangs in the poorest home , its benediction . To the exile from a Catholic country , the church means father and mother and friends and home , and though nothing else in the new land is familiar the ritual of the church and the face of the Virgin have a sound and a look of home . The Hebrew residents , driven hither by blasts of persecution or by want and destituIN // tion , swarm in the poorer quarters of such a city as New York . Their children are multitudinous . The men , pallid and gaunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , carrying a peddler 's pack from door to door , while the women help so far as they can , accepting without complaint whatever burdens are laid upon them . Least of all do they complain of the burdens of maternity . Indeed , one remarks with a feeling almost of surprise that there is little complaint , much resignation , and much philosophy in the homes of these poor Hebrews . Beyond others they prize the advantages given in our free schools , and the acute Jewish intellect enables the children rapidly to assimilate the education afforded there . We have had brilliant students in the normal colleges , students whose attainments have been fairly dazzling , whose homes have been in the little , dark , uncomfortable tenement rooms of the Jewish quarter . When these boys or girls attend school their dress is not inferior to that of their companions . The mother sees to it that their clothing is clean and neat and // properly repaired ; and when fashion prescribes shirt waists , it is possible for the girl who has only two , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the mother , many a time , sits up at night to wash and iron the dress in which her child , whether a little maid of ten or a girl of fifteen or a young woman of twenty , must appear the next day in the class room or the shop . The tenement mother , whatever her creed , or race , or country , impresses herself upon her family with an ineffaceable stamp . If she be a Lutheran , her children are brought up as they were in the old parish , under the old pastor at home . She gathers them about her if she be Swede or Dane or Finn and teaches them the folk-lore and the songs of the dear old home which she never more expects to see . This mother of poverty looks well to the morals of her girls . While the fashionable mother is ' chaperoning her beautiful young daughter , the mother who has never heard of the thing or the name , with watchful care so far as in her lies , guards her woman-child // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which a girl may entertain her friends or receive young men callers , she is compelled to meet and walk with them in the streets ; but her mother knows all about the lad who comes whistling below the window and is confident that her daughter will not disgrace her bringing-up . The young people who occupy the benches in our parks and sit with arms around one another in the moonlight , whispering happy secrets to one another , are morally as pure as those who have very different surroundings . A rough notion of chivalry and a degree of honor are seen in the courtships of the poor , and marriage with them , often improvident enough , is also often very early . Working-girls ' Clubs and Neighborhood Settlements and the various University Settlements which aim to uplift and train young men and boys are great allies of the tenement-house mother . The social instinct is as natural and the desire for pleasure as inevitable in the districts where poverty skulks in the shadow , or stalks in the // open , as in the most luxurious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , and to afford an outlet for legitimate mirth and fun . The saloons cater to the young man and the young girl . Brightlylighted , with magazines and newspapers and a concert program , they strive to attract within their doors those who are tired of the street and anxious for some pleasure in the evening . We are all gregarious ; the poor not less so than the rich . One might say the poor even more so than the rich , for the latter seek country homes and rural seclusion , while the former cling to the city and refuse to leave it , though the country offers them good inducements in work and wages and health . Every evening at the Settlement there are friendly faces where music and good cheer abound , and there are classes in whatever one wishes ; dressmaking , millinery , cooking , arithmetic , history , stenography and other branches are open to learners . A girl of twenty sometimes confesses with shamefaced bashfulness that she has learned nothIN // ing since she was ten , and is not able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In this case she receives individual instruction , and soon catches up with the rest . A mothers ' meeting or a mothers ' club at a Settlement is interesting , because one sees how much the women who attend it want help , and how dull and narrow are their lives . They have had nothing but hard work all their days . Sometimes a clever girl entertains them with a monologue or music , and it is a delight to see how they respond and how they appreciate what she does for them . The woman who comes to such a club , intent on giving good advice , and who stands and utters a little homily very often finds that her words fall like seeds on stony ground . Nothing is so stupid as what one does not understand , and the most eloquent talk falls flat , if there is no antecedent preparation on the part of the listener . The speaker who wishes to get the attention of the tenement mother must be sensible , sympathetic and practical . She must be on a plane where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring their sewing and it is a kindness to teach them how to use the needle well . Often , as girls , they have married directly from the shop where they toiled , and they know little of cutting or fitting , of making and mending . In this case the destruction of the poor is their poverty . They enjoy afternoon tea precisely as other women en joy it , and over a fragrant cup they relax , talk and laugh and tell stories and have what they need more than anything else in their lives , a really good time . Whoever undertakes the leadership of a mothers ' club must be bright , alert and fertile in expedients . She must show herself the friend of each mother . Nothing is more keenly resented by the dwellers in the tenements than calls of patronage where visitors come in , look round critically , and ask a number of questions , each impertinent and interfering and not the sort of question that would be asked of one 's own friends . The answer given by one woman to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " was // " No , does yours ? " which was the only return proper in the circumstances . - CHILDREN 'S SLUMBER SONG " All the lambs in all the folds are sleeping by their mothers ; All the birds with golden wings have tucked their heads from sight ; Far away and near at hand , let sisters wee , and brothers , Kiss , with lips like rosebuds cleft , and bid the world good night . All the stars in fields above shine out like jeweled flowers ; Whereso'er the flowers be , they fold their petals up ; While silently and tenderly steal on the dreaming hours , When all the little merry ones have sipped the Lethe cup . One by one , with soundless feet , go forth the slumber angels , And sift the silver sand of rest o'er all the quiet land ; // Till cheeks are flushed and voices hushed , and , with their sweet evangels , The happy messengers have lulled each darling household band . " XVI THE MOTHER WHO IS PASSED AROUND When the children are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter , or a bachelor son , it is mother 's turn to be passed around . Gertrude who lives in Kalamazoo can not find it in her scheme of life to see her mother only once or twice in seven years , but with the cares of a little family , she can not expect very often to go to Augusta or Boston , or Washington , in whichever of these cities the old home is . She is quite sure that father will be generous and let mother come to her , and some bright morning a letter is received at the breakfast - table , so earnest in its pleading , so insistent in its coaxing , that mother reads it aloud , wavers , looks around the family , and says , " I really do n't know how I can possibly manage it , but I do believe it is my duty to 249 25O RADIANT MOTHERHOOD go and stay a little while now with poor Gertrude . " Then there is some discussion , time-tables are consulted , a new dress is made , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Marjorie , or father and Benjamin , see mother off by the train . " Be sure you telegraph as soon as you arrive , " is the parting word . The hot-water bag and the slumber shoes are safe in the satchel , presents for Gertrude and the children are in the trunk , and away flies the mother-bird to brood over the nest of the one who used to be her baby . In Gertrude 's home , her mother is more than an honored guest : she is the pride of her daughter 's heart , and the idol of the little ones . She fits into every niche . Before long she has found out the dropped stitches in Gertrude 's housekeeping , and is taking them up with a deft hand . Never have the little stockings been so beautifully darned , and nobody has ever known , as mother does , how to mend little trousers and sew buttons and strings on little frocks and sunbonnets. // The comfort of her presence is felt through all the house . Maybe another little visitor from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the other children nestle close to grandmamma , while the little new-corner and the mother are in seclusion . Every one in town is glad that Gertrude has her mother with her , and she renews her youth in the happy interval during which the household grows accustomed to its new treasure . " How should I ever have managed without you , mother dear ? " is Gertrude 's cry , and there is a wrench at parting when the letters from home become imperative , or father , like a planet that has wandered from its orbit , suddenly presents himself , one day , at the door . Mother goes home and takes up her old occupations . Housekeeping cares do not burden her , for Marjorie long since assumed them , and the older woman is enjoying the leisure and serenity that come in the Indian summer of a woman 's days . The woman 's club of which she is president takes up a good deal of time , and church work absorbs no end of energy , add252 RADIANT MOTHERHOOD ed to which her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days of their youthful prime . Married lovers , who have grown old together , have a beautiful season of confidence and understanding , of enjoyments that belong to them only , and that none may share , when , the cares of the earlier time over , they stand on the first incline of the westering slope that leads gently on by a smooth and lovely road to the journey 's end . They can not always go about together , for a man not much beyond the summit does not choose to lay aside business and professional obligations V too soon . Blessed is Saint Martin 's summer . The husband claims these golden hours of his wife 's society , but the father 's fondness for the children makes him reluctant to deny her to her children . If the children had only settled down around the old homestead , all would have been simple enough . But Gertrude went to Kalamazoo and Edward , if you please , had nothing better to do than to settle in San Francisco . There comes a day when Edward and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continent , fold their wings a little while under the paternal roof . Nothing will do but that mother must go back with them all the way to the Golden Gate , and the opportunity to see the great land that lies hard by the Pacific , and to make acquaintance with another set of grandchildren , is too good to be lost . So away goes mother to California . When she comes back from that visit , Harriet in Pennsylvania is very sure that it is her turn next , and mother in common justice can not deny Harriet what she has granted to Edward and Gertrude . Very pleasant are the years when the mother , having her own home as her throne and resting-place , is passed around among her children . Each of her trips is like that of a dowager empress who goes from court to court , conferring a favor wherever she sets her foot . The scene wholly changes its aspect if the mother be widowed , and the home desolate , God having taken from her the strong staff and the beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the young // wife from whom , after a few months or brief years , a husband is taken away . Yet a deeper anguish of loss , a far more sweeping bereavement is hers who is left alone after many years of perfect marriage . It is as if her life were torn up by the roots , and she can not soon or lightly fit herself to the strange situation . If she possess sufficient means to live in comfort , she is wise to remain at home , although the home is silent and lonely . She must be lonely anywhere , and , on the whole , she will be less so in the place to which she is accustomed than in another household . Her things are all about her , and a woman loves her things ? her furniture and chairs and tables ? with a peculiar and clinging affection . In her own home , she is undisputed sovereign , as she can not be in the home of son or daughter . A widow left in poverty , if her health is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and take up what work she can , rather - than make for herself a new abode in any other home . Children very naturally do // not see it in this light . Their very tenderness leads them to try to save the mother every care , and they use strong inducements to persuade her to give up her home , and enter theirs . If she does so , she may count on being homesick , and wishing herself back where she belongs . One thing that children never understand is that a mother does not feel so old as she looks . One must be near the meridian herself to have any comprehension of the way it feels to be there . The lofty patronage of youth to age would be inexcusable were it not evident that one period does not keep in touch with another . Hence , the impatience with which older people resign their accustomed duties , and the irritation they often show when obliged to accept offers of assistance which they instinctively resent . With the best intentions young people may make the mother who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a bygone age , and that she is a little out of it , when the gay whirl of their life goes rushing on . The loneliest room in the house is often the beautiful , commo256 RADIANT MOTHERHOOD dious and luxuriously furnished one in which the old mother is installed . She has endless leisure , she who has always been active . She has no authority , she who has always been dominant . She is expected to sit still , dress in her best and occupy herself with some dainty knitting or needlework , she who has been accustomed to carry on the affairs of a family . Sitting in her room , she hears the brisk cheerful note of the household activity , but she is not in it , and should she try to take a hand where she is not needed , she would be superfluous and might regret that she had interfered . For a hundred reasons , not all definable , the woman who has had her own home should stay in it , going as a visitor , but not as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them rather come to her for anniversaries and visits , and for whatever pleasures a grandmother 's house may yield . Every rule has its exceptions . No doubt there are beloved mothers who go from one home to another , and from place to place , // among their children , everywhere being welcomed with enthusiasm . This is peculiarly so when the mother has an only son or an only daughter , or when the youngest born claims the privilege of having her roof shelter the dearest and best of mothers . Absence from old friends and the breaking of old ties are hard upon those who approach threescore and ten . A woman who has lived for years in one place , having her church life there , the familiar round of people on whom she calls , and the lines of love and interest thrown out on every side , suffers a great deal when transplanted . It is too late for her to strike down and take deep root , and she droops and rapidly ages . The Reverend Doctor W. Robertson Nicoll , writing about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full sense of the word , is one of the most terrible things that can befall man . " Equally it is one of the most heartrending things that can befall a woman . The ' same acute thinker and observer has said that " the dreary passionless lassitude . // which settles down upon those who have nothing to do and are without resources , is apt to end in despair and madness and suicide . " I saw a verification of this one summer when visiting in a little mountain village . A narrow stream , shallow by reason of a drought , intersected the hamlet , and early one morning word was brought to our cheery breakfast-table of a tragedy that had taken place in the night . An old woman had risen from her bed , walked out between the flower-borders of the garden , opened a gate , crossed two fields and gone down a hill , and , laying herself face downward in the brook , had been drowned . She was an aged mother , lonely in a home far from the one where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do , her mind had become unbalanced , and at last she threw off her burdens in this maddened way . In the midst of affairs with plenty to do . friends and interests on every side , we do not understand the dreary loneliness that may come upon the old . They will feel it // much less if they remain in the place to which they are accustomed , and refuse to relinquish any of their rights and privileges . They are still wiser , if they do not drop a single activity until they must . While I give this advice , I would qualify it by saying that it is a good thing for old people to travel if they can . A woman should never feel herself too old to visit other lands , and receive other ideas . So long as she has a home to return to when tired , it is well for her to go far afield , if she have the opportunity . A woman past seventy may , in these days , travel so comfortably that she will be little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreams of her youth , see Venice and Florence , Paris and Edinburgh , and take as great satisfaction in every new place as if she were a girl . It will be well for her to attach herself , now and then , to a group of grandchildren and their friends . The one thing the mother in her old age must fight , beyond all other foes , is a tendency to be exacting , faultfinding and difficult . // She will best overcome this disposition which assails people late in life by retaining sympathy with the young , and being vividly interested in what they do . Mrs. A. D. T. Whitney , commenting on the lions in wait for old women as compared with those that trouble and threaten old men , has said : " But just take a man , ? Shut him up for a day ; Get his hat and his cane , ? Put them snugly away ; Give him stockings to mend , And three sumptuous meals ; ? And then ask him , at night , If you dare , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stick to his stocking , While you read the news , And do n't care about talking ' ? " " To those who have no resources in themselves for living well and happily , every age is burdensome. " // Those who are young should do their best not to lay heavy loads or clasp fetters upon any who happen to live with them or near them . Try to understand that no age has a monopoly of beauty . A beautiful woman who wears the crown of white hair is as attractive in her personality as her daughter in the fullness of her bloom . A dignified and stately old lady in sending an invitation to her historic home said , " Come and spend the week 's end with me . I will show you my Colonial treasures , and present to you my children 's children . My granddaughters are the prettiest girls in Massachusetts . " One did not doubt it , knowing that few old ladies in the Bay State surpassed the writer in charm and queenliness . " Stay , stay at home , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , For those that wander they know not where Are full of trouble and full of care ; ? To stay at home is best . ,
