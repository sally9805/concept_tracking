The officers telegraphed to the operator at Rockingham Junction , the next station for the express , asking that the men be detained . When the train reached the Junction at I 6 A. M. , Howard A. Reeves , the conductor , received the telegram , and had no difficulty in recognizing from the description what men were wanted . Accompanied by the baggage master . George T. Brackett , who is a special police officer , he went to the smoking car and informed the men that they would have to await the officers from Dover . The men said they were willing to wait , and stood up , apparently to put on their overcoats .
