RECENTLY , in a paragraph in a New York daily paper , which summarized the statistics of the New York Social Register , I saw some figures of large and interesting significance . The Social Register , it may be well to state , is a city directory , such as is known in London , Paris ; Berlin , etc , which gives the residence address of well-to-do people , and those claiming , or having , some " social position . " I am describing it as accurately and inoffensively as possible ; and do not undertake to determine its moral or social value . Of its convenience there can be no doubt ; for while that sarcastic description of a New York city directory which described it as a book which it " required a derrick to handle . " is open to the charge of exaggeration , it must be owned that the volume is not only inconveniently bulky . but also needlessly voluminous for one who desires only to rise it for " social " purposes . Of course . the Social Register @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good deal of guesswork ; and the satirist who would use its omissions as illustrations of its ignorance would have . a fine field . But all the sauce , it is. in certain very important and suggestive directions , of approximate accuracy and of informing value . The statistics to which I have referred affirmed , for example , that , of those recorded in the Social Register . somewhat less than one-half lived in houses of their own , or apart from other families ; about one-fourth in apartments , or " flats , " and rather more than one-fourth in rural or suburban homes . I give these proportions from memory , and do not claim that I am quoting precisely from the paragraph to which I have referred . It is enough if I indicate what I gathered to be its general drift , and this was that there is a distinct and growing tendency , on the part of young couples , to live out of town , or where they can . have space and air , and light , for themselves and their children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a source of profound thankfulness to everyone who wishes well of his countrymen and loves his fellows . City and country Let me make haste to say that in affirming this I do not mean to denounce or disparage cities . I own their perils , and acknowledge their vices ; but when one reads what some emotional admirers of rural life have written of the comparative virtues of bucolic environments , habits and homes , the least that one can say is that such a writer " duds not know what he is talking about . " Every now and then some seething mass of vice suddenly discloses itself iii a great city --  the " lid is off , " and cruelty , corruption , or domestic degradation reveal themselves in fortes which are at once horrible and loathsome . But , if we could uncover similar conditions , in sonic country village or rural farmhouse , we should find them , often , mire loathsome and more appalling ; and , in any case , we should discover what all sufficiently informed people very well know that cities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighborhoods are careful often to empty vices which , at home , are scrupulously draped and shrouded . But , when all this is said ? and there can be no honest discussion of the question which it concerns - until it is said ? there still remain certain conditions of life in cities which are full of menace and of peril to all that we ought to hold dear . In discussing them there has been the frequent mistake of ignoring some of the most potential conditions of modern life , especially as they are found in large communities , that go toward producing them . One of these , and it is especially a characteristic of the modern city , is the overcrowding of the residential centers of wage-earners . In the case of foreigners , or of people who , though they may be technically citizens of the United States , are unfamiliar with our language , and disinclined to adopt our customs , people will herd together , often under conditions which , to most of us , would be conditions of equal discomfort and privation , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birds , would herd together . Congenial companionship to them is worth all the discomfort that it involves ; and , moreover , their training and habits , in other lands , have  | not made necessary to their comfort much that , to a native-born American , would be indispensable . And , besides this , there is another consideration which , so far as the workingman is concerned , is often left out ; of sight , but which has , nevertheless , an influence in determining his choice of a home , which is entirely natural and intelligible . One finds a mechanic or workman by the day ? he may br a skilled artisan ? living in some narrow quarters , two or three rooms , let us say , in some narrow street , lined on both sides with sky-scraping tenements ; an I says to him , with a virtuous note reproach in his voice : " Why do you live here ! Why do you condemn your wife and children to these misenable surroundings ! Why do n't you remove to such and such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rent , or at worst only a little more than the rent you are paying here for two or three rooms ; and yet with air , and light , and space , such as these cramped quarters absolutely deny to you " Well , my suing brother . who art going to heal all the diseases of an overcrowded center in the tenement house life of a great city , have you ever really tried to understand why the wageearner who lives in an overcrowded city flat does n't To what you propose ! He likes to be near the corner saloon , you say ; his wife likes a chance to gossip with her sister in toil across the hall : the children can he put to work earlier and more easily , and so assist in lightening the burden resting upon the paternal shoulders . The whole household likes the bustle and fellowships of city life ; or , as that estimable Irish lady . formerly a valued domestic in an old New York family , put it when , having been found in a poor tenement on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pretty little cottage in the country , she promptly returned to the tenement as soon as her well-meaning friends had turned their backs ; and who , when discovered , after a while . living in congenial squalor in Baxter street . was asked for an explanation of her return , answered philosophically : " Paple is more company than stumps . " In a word , all the considerations which I have rehearsed may be urged by the pharisaical critic of the denizens in cheap and poor " flats , " but they do not really touch the nerve of the matter . The wage-earner who lives in such a home , and his wife , and his children , would often hail with delight the prospect of transplantation to the country . But , even were his family settled there , he himself must earn his bread in town . any use for the handicraft at which he toils , in the country . The factory that pays him his wages is in the city ? and every morning the must go there , and every evening he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost him five cents each way ? it is more likely to cost him ten ? but , this means , at the lowest estimate , sixty cents a week , or about two dollars and a half mouth , out of his wages , for transportatio. have we ever thought , now , of the conditions under which the wage-earner must make these journeys : He must be at his post at 7 a m ; and lie can not leave it until 6 p m . That means that , for a large part of the year he must travel both ways the dark . Have we ever tried getting to a train or trolley ear , in the country . on foot . in February , in the dark ' I confess I do not wonder at , and do not blame the wage-earner , if , under such conditions . he elects to live nearer to " his job , ' ' and to spare himself the hardships of rural life . Some day , let us hope , it will be easier for him to reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capitalist realize that , just at this point . his responsibility , as put in trust of means for bettering rural homes and facilitating access to them , begins ! " Workies , clerkies and shirkies " And this brim- me to the ease of those whose circumtances are less narrow and less straitened than the class which I have described . When I lived in Boston , my happy lot was to have a home in beautiful Longwood ; from which , over two railways . trains went in and out of the city . Every morning there went from the station which I ordinarily used , three trains to town , at hours convenient to those who used them . The first train , it was said , was for the " workies. " the second for the " clerkies. " and the third for the " shirkies . " Of the second named of these two classes there was always a large contingent ; for house rent was low in Longwood , and a home there was wholesome and attractive all the year round . Now , few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city ,  | including even New York , has within easy reach ? and , in the case of New York , within daily increasingly easy reach ? attractive suburbs , where a young man who is founding a home and a family can live , all the year round , under renditions alike agreeable and healthy . Is this one of the things that may bast be left to itself ; or is it a matter which , in its higher and wider interests , is of incalculable importance to the whole republic ? As to this question there can be , I think , little doubt . Of course , for its final settlement the question must be left to the individual . Ours is a constitutional , not a paternal form of government ; and the individual is left free , and we in America think . rightly left free , to , live where he pleases . But , none the less , there are apparent to-day , in connection with life in great cities , certain tendencies , the result of which it is idle to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the extinction of the home . If one lives , e.g , in New York to-day , he must , in order to live in his own house ? tulles ; he ' consents to live in more or less distant and unattraciive neighborhood be a person of considerable means . But the great majority of young married people are not persons of considerable means . They are clerks , artisans of the higher class , or salaried officials , and the like ; each filling e place for which there are always plenty of competent candidates . and which , if from sickness , or vice , one . drops out of it , will be quickly filled . They have small salaries , and must , if they are to make both ends meet . scrutinize every smallest outlay with jealous care . In an apartment house they can get four or five rooms , and it may be , board , for a definite sum ; and " they know where they , are . " But the " apartment " makes no allowance for children . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trifling with human speech to call such an " arrangement " a home . Of the notes that most ennoble a home it has none . Apartments and character And this brings the whole matter face to ( nice with the question : " What is the influence of such a mode of living upon character ? " I shall not attempt here to discuss the subject of motherhood , and the methods which are deliberately resorted to to evade it ; for it is a question of vast proportions and one which demands discussion by itself But it is well to recognize the fact that two young people , having begun married life on the basis of a deliberate antagonism to its ordinary meaning , are likely to drift into an ideal of life which is utterly and supremely selfish . A fashionable woman , having been asked what furniture she thought suitable for a spare room , exclaimed : " But why have a spare room ? At best , you can not hope to compete with a good hotel . Do n't attempt it ! " This charming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreamed that she was flinging out of the window one of the highest privileges of human life ! She never had discovered ? she never could discover ? that the only way to know much that is best and finest in really rare , and noble , and lovable people , is to have them under your own roof and at your own table . She had never come to realize that the sacrifices that one makes for an honored guest are among the chiefest joys of life . Above all , she had , apparently , never discovered that the best of us easily becomes " cushioned in the inglorious ease " of a selfishly-ordered home ; and that the best service of hospitality , often , is that which forces us out of it ! And this opens the way to a recognition of what is , after all , the supreme danger of much of our modern life . It is that it will become supremely selfish . As we go on , limiting our homes to " apartments , " and apartments to a number of rooms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we tend , steadily , toward that ideal of domestic life which eliminates from it all consideration for others . When one enters those huge caravansaries which are multiplying in our great , and also in our small cities , he recognizes , at once , an economy of service in the whole mechanism which has , undoubtedly , immense conveniences . The young married couple have au " apartment , " and go to the restaurant for their meals . Of housekeeping , therefore . in the old-fashioned sense there is practically nothing . The men servants and maid servants are those of the " establishment , " and not , in any sense , those of the people whom they serve . If , therefore , a young married woman who lives in three or four rooms finds them neglected or carelessly swept and  | dusted by the maid in whose " detail " they happen to be , she complains to the manager , and the manager has certain summary rules which make short work of an inefficient servant . Is it any wonder that the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which relieves them of the whole dreary business of hunting , or educating , " help " ? Is it any wonder that such an one hails with still greater delight a leisure which leaves her free to spend her mornings in the street or in department stores ? Nay , we might even go farther , and ask : Is it any wonder that a young married woman , released from domestic cares and duties , is tempted , sometimes , to substitute for them intimacies and recreations which are deteriorating , if not demoralizing ? That is a charming picture which is sometimes drawn for us of a civilization so advanced that the ancient handicrafts shall practically have disappeared . and men and women be endowed with that large leisure which shall leave them free for intellectual pursuits . But it forgets one condition of such a civilization , and that is that those who shall advance to it shall have the tastes and mental endowments which make intellectual pursuits either attractive or congenial . As a matter of fact , we know that this is not a characteristic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be ; and that the loss out of life of employments for the hands , especially for women , would be , in its consequences . one of the gravest losses that women could sustain . We have all had our jest about " the kind of pie that mother made ; " but there is no one who knows anything about the fine qualities of our American domestic life who does not know that some of its chiefest charms lay in those fireside arts which mixed with deft handling a fine insight and a subtle and individual genius . And so one may well hail a movement from the city " back to nature . " ahaving in it a high promise for the children of to-day who are to be the men and women of the future . We can not legislate the city out of existence if we would ; and , for one , I should be sorry to lose its noble opportunities for service and heroisms such as are not to be found elsewhere . But if any young man to whom these words may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do so , if he can , where there is some other " out of doors " than the front or back street . The opportunities for securing such a home are to-day fairly numerous , and a - wise civism may do few better things than fo make them more numerous and more easily available . Capital has already recognized here a profitable field : and no one who journeys a few miles out of New York can fail to have seen . on huge hoardings , the tempting offers of building lots and cottage sites to the youthful purchaser , conditioned on " time payments . " Some of these are so tempting as to seem quite irresistible . and they have undoubtedly entangled more than one young couple to their ultimate undoing . But the plan , whatever abuses may have discredited it , is a good one ; and it may well engage the attention of investors whose business ardor is tempered , at least occasionally . by conscientious scruples ! Nothing is more important to the future of this land than the dominance of a wisely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cities do not seem likely to furnish us . But at this point I am opening a door toward a discussion too large for these limits , and I will not attempt it . That " home ownership " is an ethical , as well as an economical , or social , or esthetic question , there can be no doubt , and the sooner we so recognize it the better it will be both for our municipal and our National future .  |
