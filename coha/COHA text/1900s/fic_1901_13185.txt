DAVY It is a man i ' the play  --  OWEN ' T is a new play ; I saw it yesterday . He sells his soul to the Devil . p. 7 NASHE ( hastening up ) For how much ? What did the Devil pay for him ? LODGE  --  What man ?

NASHE Who ' s Zodiac ? OWEN Well , let that be .... He signs away his soul Unto the Devil , and he signs with blood . GREENE Nay , in plain sight ? Enter Marlowe .  --  He is reading a ballad that he carries in his hand . He is unobserved by the Taverners , who are absorbed in this account of Faustus ; and the name catches his ear . He stands behind his friends and hears with repressed excitement . OWEN ( to the group ) Ay , you should see it , you ! ' T is marvellous high with every kind of words ; And beyond that , ' t is full of devilry , And divers charms of magic and hell-fire ; Until his hour is come that he must die ,  --  When clock strikes twelve . And by and by he says , O Faustus ,  --  Faustus ! Ye should hear him say  --  p. 8 GREENE ( ranting )  --  O Faustus , O ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pennies ?

He signs away his soul for twenty years OWEN ( vext ) Oh , say you so !

MARLOWE His nature , like his name , o'ergreens whate'er He looks on , with such pastoral invention As would enchant your wits and hold you bound With charms as innocent as ring-me-round !  --  His very name 's a lure to every rhyme . BAME ( to Marlowe ) By all you say , you are great folk to know . If I were trained a player , I could tell My worth as aptly . MARLOWE So ? Good Master Barnby , Here is a friend suspects you have forgot him . He says  --  he too has kin in Canterbury . Do you not know his face ? Bethink you , sir .

Here 's too much noise if that one be upon us . Devil ,  --  I well believe it ; as to Scholar I am not wise enough to spell out Scholar From Knave and Roisterer .

MARLOWE You ask me this ? LODGE I ask it . Modify thy royal kick , For sake of old acquaintance . MARLOWE Jest not , Tom . It is none else but  --  Helen , the world 's joy , The world 's triumphant torment . LODGE Ah , heigh-ho ! MARLOWE Hers is the Beauty that hath moved the world , Since the first woman . Beauty can not die . No worm may spoil it . Unto earth it goes , There to be cherished by the cautious spring , Close folded in a rose , until the time Some new imperial spirit comes to earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her robes of vermeil and of snow , Violet-veind ,  --  beautiful as wings , And so the Woman comes ! p. 33 LODGE Heigh-ho !  --  A dream . MARLOWE Immortal , then ! What have we but our dreams ? Why , to fetch wisdom out of the Holy Book , That hath a saying or two ,  --  ' t is such as dreams Alone , that moths corrupt not . Actions , deeds ,  --  Realities you call them ,  --  all are sham . Tangible dust , true death , most real decay ! The worm can prove them real ,  --  by eating them ! And then where , where ? Touching his own breast . Is this Kit Marlowe , think you ? Bah ! I am what I say and what I dream , Ay , what I dream and dream !  --  this fellow , here , Is none of me .

Thou art far-sighted ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away with longing for The one lost Pleiad ! In the sad meanwhile Thou wilt not see what 's nearest to thy nose . Take it : ' t is wisdom . So some Helen smiles On you ? MARLOWE To-day ! For all things smile to-day . I know , I know , fortune may cloud again . But now the Sun will have his sovereign whim . One triumph brings another by the hand , And all the rest come crowding . p. 34 LODGE  --  For a day ! And she would crown you with a laurel wreath , In secret ? MARLOWE Think ! For her to seek me out , A goddess to a beggar ! Why , my lair Is more uncertain than a tiger 's rest ; And yet she did not summon me to Court . LODGE No . ( Apart . ) And I wonder why ! MARLOWE She speaks with me Here in the Borough ; sometimes at this place Whither I come , thou knowest , when I have more Than a bad penny !  --  I would not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Such as poor Robin haunts . LODGE But  --  MARLOWE You will ask Why , then , to-day is more than other days ? Because to-day , ' t is true , ' t is true ,  --  I won ! Faustus  --  is Fame . The people and the Court Were all one voice . Ned Alleyn had his laurels ; And I win mine and wear them . Oh , I knew Her , through her mask ,  --  and those applauding hands ! ' T is come at last . Even the mongrel ballad I found this morning , tells me welcomely , I have attained .  --  Oh , she shall not confer All , all , forever . I 'll be glorious ,  --  No beggar poet ! She is Helena . Was it a little gift , think you , to say Such things of woman ? p. 35 LODGE So . Was this the face  --  MARLOWE Was this the Face that launched a thousand ships And burned the topless towers of Ilium ! LODGE Sun yourself while ye may , Kit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a glorious madman , Born to consume thyself anon , in ashes , And rise again to immortality . MARLOWE The only immortality , of Fame ,  --  Glory on glory ; of unflinching gaze , A pride that shall outstare the northern lights . And when I die ?  --  An arrow from the Sun ! Oh , if she cease to smile , as thy looks say , What if ? I shall have drained my splendor down , To the last flaming drop !  --  Then take me , darkness , And mirk and mire and black oblivion : Despairs that raven where no camp-fire is , Like the wild beasts . I shall be even blessed , To be so damned . LODGE I can not follow you . You would be arrogant , boy , you know , in hell , And keep the lowest circle to yourself ! So mad are you ?  --  And yet I could have sworn Your eyes took interest in the little saint We saw to-day . p. 36 MARLOWE The little country shrine ? Why so they did . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she will look with pitying gaze On me in gorgeous torment . Snowflake pity , Destined to melt and lose itself in fire , Or ever it can cool my tongue ! Ay , Tom . I owe the Faith more tribute than I pay , For its apt figures . Con thy Bible , Tom . I 'm glad they chanced here . I shall think , sometimes , Just of her face : the little Quietude , Standing in shelter , quite immovable ,  --  And reach my hand up for a tear , a drop Of holy water from those hands of hers . She fills the only need was left to me ; And sooth to say , I never thought of it Before I saw her . Renter Alison LODGE Look you , there she is . MARLOWE Ah , cousin Alison ! ALISON ( on the steps ) Good-even , sir ,  --  Sirs . But I am not Cousin Alison . MARLOWE Forgive . I have a longing to make sure Of anchorage somewhere . You did not see The play this afternoon ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not . He should be here by now . He went to see If he could find our cousin , over Bridge . I am to stay with her till market 's over ; And if she wish , until Midsummer-Day . Lodge retires up and tickles the Boy , who is dozing , with a rush . MARLOWE What can I do to hasten this bare hour , Or sweeten it for you ? ALISON If you would sing  --  The song you promised ... MARLOWE She remembers that ? ( To Lodge . ) Come here , you Second Son , and piy your art . Boy , where 's the lute ? Boy starts up , takes lute down from the wall and gives it to Lodge . Lodge comes down and they seat themselves near the table , Lodge and Marlowe opposite Alison . Renter Benet to listen , at back , with drowsy satisfaction . I showed thee of this air , Did I not , Tom ? Now set me off my verse . T is called The Passionate Shepherd to His Love , And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lodge plays ; Alison watches Marlowe artlessly . Song Come live with me , and be my Love , And we will all the pleasures prove That hills and valleys , dales and fields , Woods or steepy mountains , yields . And we will sit upon the rocks Seeing the shepherds  --  Enter Barnby p. 38 BARNBY Well done , well done now ! How is this my girl ? Too weary  --  wert thou ? Coming down , followed by Benet . But thy cousin 's house Would better feed this cheek with red again . Am I to know thee for my Alison ? Tired of London ? So ? Exit Lodge , yawning . MARLOWE ( aside to Benet ) Oh , take him hence . I shall be going soon . But till I 'm gone  --  Gives her a coin . BENET Now , Master Barnby , will you see the Inn And have your comfort ? MARLOWE ( to Barnby ) Only let her stay A moment more , until I end the song . Goes up to the street door . BARNBY What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Be cheery , wench , and pipe up for thyself And show them how we sing in Canterbury . Ay , so ! Well done . Exit , left , preceded by Benet with a candle-dip . Marlowe opens door , centre , and looks up and down . The Bellman 's voice passes chanting . p. 39 BELLMAN Hang  --  out  --  your lights !  --  Marlowe lets the door fall shut and comes down abstractedly towards the lute which Lodge has left on the table . He sits and takes it up . Alison sits , dreamily , on the other side of the table , and listens spell-bound , while Marlowe watches her face . BELLMAN ( passing without ) . Past  --  nine  --  o'clock and a  --  starlight  --  night . MARLOWE ( sings ) Come live with me , and be my Love , And we will all the pleasures prove That hills and valleys , dales and fields , Woods or steepy mountains , yields . And we will sit upon the rocks Seeing the shepherds feed their flocks By shallow rivers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will make thee beds of roses And a thousand fragrant posies , A cap of flowers , and a kirtle Embroider 'd all with leaves of myrtle : A gown made of the finest wool Which from our pretty lambs we pull , Fair-lind slippers for the cold , With buckles of the purest gold . The shepherd swains shall dance and sing For thy delight each May morning . If these delights thy mind may move , Then live with me and be my Love ! At the end of the song , she does not move , but sits looking straight before her , held by his eyes , as if she were charmed . He reaches his hand across the table towards her . She does not move . p. 40 MARLOWE Why , this it is to listen !  --  Art thou dreaming ? ALISON ( like a child ) I do not know . MARLOWE And will you not say Thanks ? ALISON Oh , Master Christopher  --  MARLOWE The song went ill ? ALISON Thou knowest that it did not . MARLOWE ( laughing ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thy praise ! And yet this song is often paid in honey . ALISON It is most wonderful . MARLOWE Then why so still ? ALISON Oh , everything is changed . MARLOWE Why ? Tell me why ALISON Indeed , I do not know  --  I do not know . I never heard these things .  --  Thou art a poet . I never saw a poet  --  and I wish  --  I could know more . p. 41 MARLOWE ( laughing aloud ) You do ? And so you shall . Look , Eve new come to Eden ! Well , of all New things , thou art the newest new-comer ! Was it the song ? ALISON The song  --  ay , that , and thee : And everything . MARLOWE The song and everything  --  Within the song ! And what is there , stray child , What strangeness ?  --  What but love , as I am blest ,  --  Love  --  love ! ( with great enjoyment ) . She rises , startled . Where are you going , Alison ? What would you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boon of such a listening ear , Eager and charmed to listen , such a soul , Wide as the first , first morning !  --  Alison , Poets have need sometimes : I would be thanked As only you can thank me . For the Song , I 'll give it to you  --  ( rising ) ALISON Wilt thou ? MARLOWE And for that , Give me a kiss ... She looks at him with candid amazement . Sure , that 's a little thing . Our English maids Give kisses where they will . Do you not so ? p. 42 ALISON Yes ... MARLOWE Why , then , give it me.  --  You do not know , But yet I have a fancy that from you Some charm must come with it , some blessedness , Such as I have no name for .  --  Alison . She moves towards him unconsciously , ever delaying . Are you so frugal ? There 's the way of maids . The smallest boon they will deny ; but ask With arrogance , and have what is to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it dear . Stepping farther away and holding his arms towards her , where she poises , regarding him . What are you ? Faith , no woman , and no child : A little Dream that pities not a prayer ,  --  Will come no nearer tho ' the dreamer starve , For fear a kiss might bind you !  --  Faith , I know You will not stay , Bird-shadow ! You will fade , At the first omen of  --  Enter Jermyn , from the street JERMYN  --  Her Ladyship . Exit Jermyn , leaving the door wide . Enter Her Ladyship . Marlowe 's arms drop ; he turns , brilliant and bewildered , towards the door as Her Ladyship , the upper part of her face masked , advances .  --  Alison shrinks away , puzzled , regarding them . p. 43 HER LADYSHIP Well , Faustus , do you know me ? MARLOWE Helena ! HER LADYSHIP I was in doubt lest I should find you here , Beset with mad companions , noisy wits , Such as I saw resorting to thy side Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like thee !  --  Come , let me hear yet more ; But no , it must run dry . MARLOWE No , never , never ! Will you have more ? HER LADYSHIP Yes , more of it , more , more ! This is new wine you pour me . I am fired To know how much your tongue may dare . You climb Such dread audacious height . I watch , in terror To see you fall and dash this god to clay . More of my music !  --  I am thirsty now , I , who have had such words as not the Queen Ever commanded yet , and knew them mine . I was thy Helena ? Thou swearest it ?  --  Nay , by the rood ? Alison slips out , left , into the garden . MARLOWE Thou knowest thou art she . p. 44 HER LADYSHIP ( holding off her mask exultantly ) Was this the face that launched a thousand ships ! More , more !  --  You 're swift to promise , but , my Faustus , You can no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world to world and whither none can follow . ' T is you discover to my insatiate mind Seas , countries , spheres I never dreamed before ; All longing , and the imperious will to be A glory that shall hold your looks , I swear , As the Sun compels his flower to turn to him . Yes , you shall listen !  --  Yes , you shall drink down Imperial draughts of honey , fire , and dew ; And if you will , my last pale , savage pearl , To make more precious with unpitied death , That fearful wine ! HER LADYSHIP Are you then so much mine ? MARLOWE Thine and the Sun 's ! Light draws me , and I follow . Drink my song . Grow fair , you sovran flower , with earth and air ; Sip from the last year 's leaves their memories Of April , May , and June , their summer joy , Their lure for every nightingale , their longing ; Fill you with rain and sunset ; live and thrill , Whose master-work is only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And bind the service of all elements , As they were serving-maidens : eyes and mouth , You give back to the silence of the Earth Whose treasury you beggar , only silence . p. 45 HER LADYSHIP  --  And this . She kisses him . Renter Alison from the garden , unnoticed . Her Ladyship and Marlowe go towards the doorway . Outside appear two link-boys with torches . @x Scene : Garden of The Bee-Hive three weeks later .  --  At back a high wall , with a posterngate , centre , showing a distance with house-tops and trees .  --  Right , an entrance to the Inn , with steps . Another door below the steps , leading to a cellarage . Left , wall covered with vines . A little to right of centre , in front , a large vine-covered arbor , open , front and back ; the sides trellised . Within , a rude table with two benches , another seat outside ; upon it a trencher with beans and carrots . Between the arbor and the garden-wall , left , a row of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A bench behind the hop-vines . Summer afternoon . Discovered at rise , Gabriel Andrew , standing moodily in the entrance of the arbor , as if waiting for some one . Enter , hurriedly , from the Inn , Bame . GABRIEL Well , what 's to say ? BAME You know as well as I. ' T is all of Alison . GABRIEL I had rather think Of Alison to myself than talk with any . BAME But will you reason ? p. 47 GABRIEL Deeply , if I can . BAME You know our talk . You saw as well as I , How that quill-spoiler cozened you and her , And had her eyes and hearing so none else In all the town made any sound to her ! Not you yourself , although you had the right , Knowing them well at home ; while I was strange . And strange I 'm like to stay ! And yet I paid Some little service ; met them on the way And showed them to The Bee-Hive . I can name My kin among the towns-folk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  GABRIEL To wait  --  to wait . BAME Ay , then , to wait ! But wherefore , ask thyself . Do you not see we are waiting for this Marlowe To have her up and off and out of reach Before our eyes ? GABRIEL That maid is not the maid To shake from any bough . BAME But do you see How she is altered ever since that day , And day by day , of late , with watching for him ? GABRIEL So you have seen her , day by day , of late . p. 48 BAME As well as you . GABRIEL Marry , as well as I ! H 'm , with two daily suitors the poor maid Should feel her hearing worn . I can not marvel That she is pale . BAME Ay , she is pale enough . Yet still she visits with her cousin there , Week in , week out . GABRIEL ( troubled ) I do not grudge her London . A maid should see the sights . BAME And she sees none . I have entreated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chepe , to hear the singing-boys ; And she will stay indoor as if she feared To lose some jewel , an she left her house . GABRIEL Ay , doth she so ? BAME Thou wilt not boast to me It was thy face . GABRIEL ( whimsically ) No , no , faith , if I could I would ; but have thy slender satisfaction . Eke it out with a carrot !  --  Well , you say She will not go with you ? Nor yet with me. p. 49 BAME Until to-day . To-day !  --  Ah , listen now !  --  I 'm on my way to bring her to the Gardens Yonder , to see the shows. GABRIEL You shall be proud . BAME To see the shows , forsooth ! But until now , I had begged her to come with me anywhere Save hither to the Borough . GABRIEL Well , poor maid , Must all her joy be bounded north by west ? BAME Thou hast my meaning . When I spoke of this , She gave me such a smile as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come ; Begged me to bring her to see Benet here , That same old hostess that was kind to her. I go to meet her at the waterside , Since this is all of London she would see !  --  ' T is Marlowe  --  Marlowe  --  and thou knowest well The maid is pining for him . Ay , by heaven , Waiting to catch a grain of news , as pigeons Flutter and flock to peck a lentil up . She treasures every word that folk let fall About these players ,  --  covering her ears To words that mar as true word only can ; Denying all with shudders ; and sometimes ,  --  The music that he taught her  --  p. 50 GABRIEL Music ? what ? BAME Oh , I was not far off . GABRIEL I warrant you I was ; or had I caught you listening , I would have  --  BAME Save abuses . You shall use them To better purpose yet . I say the man Made merry for an hour with charming her , A hunter , weary of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She dare not breathe till he shall come to say Breathe so , or so . She lives not in to-day . I tell you more . He shall not have the girl An if he wanted her . And yet if not , I hate him more , that he can spoil the day So lightly .  --  And the more for it was he Made me a butt before you all  --  GABRIEL A jest ! No more . What grievance ? People of this part Are used to rougher jesting . BAME You conceal What you are building . GABRIEL Under simple thatch ! BAME Come , you are fair . p. 51 GABRIEL Well , then I will speak out . This is my first thought . My maid is not one Whose whims or fancies are to be set down By russet folk . She may think as she will : I do receive it . I could no more dream Of climbing up a wall to peer and pry Into the garden of her mind , than steal The blossoms from her father 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , And I 'll go mine .  --  ' T is all with you , to-day . Enter from the lower door of the inn , Dame Benet . Bame goes to inn-steps and turns . BAME Take thought once more . GABRIEL I will take thought once more : And if need be , why once more after that ! Exit Bame , right . Benet recovers her carrots and beans , from the bench ; sits down , and prepares them . Gabriel stands against the arbor-trellis beside her , abstracted and gloomy . BENET This were a pretty tale now , Master Andrew ! What would The Bee-Hive do without you then ? GABRIEL Why , when , dame ? p. 52 BENET Lack ! So far away , are ye ? Why , when you take to farming once again , In Canterbury . GABRIEL Oh , ' t is years away  --  If I should do so ever . I was dreaming . ' T was hearing of  --  old Barnby  --  set my wits Veering to homeward like a weather-cock . Tell me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over , who can tell ? There is no dial for these player-folk And poets . ' T is all Swallow-while-you-may ! When they are paid , why so am I , betimes . Then to The Bee-Hive , oh , I warrant ye  --  They swarm to me ; for there is no such ale Brewed nor cakes baken , here in all the Borough ; And that they know . But when the times will change , And they split quills with writing of bad plays And get scant payment as all such deserve ,  --  Then to The Merry Friar ; to The Owl !  --  Until your Owl will none of them ,  --  so down , To some I never name . GABRIEL The tide will turn . BENET And peacock moult . ' Ods life ! Such velvet clothes , And footmen bringing messages all day From Lady Here and There . And yet tomorrow , Gone , like last Mayday , where ? Your peacock hides Throughout a moulting season . p. 53 GABRIEL But this Marlowe , He is the best of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What is best ? This Faustus paid his score . I doubt not ' t was a play  --  but there be plays Of far more noise than that . He will make free , As if he built The Bee-Hive ! Now he ' ll pay , And now he ' ll owe . He is not given to talk With me.  --  I do hear tales of him . They say He is a fearsome Atheistical . GABRIEL Do they say that ? Bah , dame ! What right have men To spread abroad this pestilent They-Say , And take us with infection ere we know ? I care not for this Marlowe , good or ill ; But yet I have a left-hand , country-bred , Shuffling affection to a slandered devil ;  --  Comes of a zeal for driving my own kick Where my own wit shall aim . BENET Ay , ay , now there ; This is discourse . The Boy appears at the lower door . BOY Have ye the lentils ready ? GABRIEL Say , now , is Marlowe like to be about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment or next year . BOY ( entering ) She 's calling for the lentils . Takes trencher . BENET Here , you boy !  --  It shall not leave my sight . BOY ( going ) Come after , then ! Exit Boy by the lower door , followed by Dame Benet in haste . Gabriel , after a pause , turns decisively and exit by the postern-gate . Immediately after , renter Bame from the Inn . He pauses on the lowest step , speaking back . Alison appears in the doorway . BAME ( lagging ) Nay , if I must go back  --  But blame not me , If the day goes awry . I did not think You set such store by our Dame Benet here , To send me to the stairs again to find A paltry hood . It was not in my thought , And so I left it with the waterman ;  --  But if you made it , ' t is another thing . I will go back . Alison comes down the steps . p. 55 ALISON And I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Will you so ? I did not know you were So fond on Benet ... ALISON She did much befriend me The day we came to London . Young as I , She saith she doth not see us often here ; And so I made that keepsake with all care , To show her I remembered . Master Bame , Why will you be so dark with me ? BAME I 'll go And find the bargeman . Shall I find you here , When I come back ? ' T is cooler than indoor . ALISON Sure I will wait . He watches her come down , then exit Bame hurriedly by way of the Inn . Ah me , but I will wait ! How long , how long , with nothing else to do ? But I am here again .  --  It can not seem The way I saw the threshold that first day , Before the world began . Why , it was he Told me I looked a very new-comer , And laughed , and guessed a little of the truth , How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Beside the arbor . ) O little vine , I wonder if the first Long draught of rain when you are budding first , May be like that ?  --  The first high noon ? I love you ,  --  I know not why ; I love you . Dear you were And pleasant to me , ever ; but I think I never saw before . He called me Eve . I took it for a jest , but now indeed I think I never lived at all before . God made me only now ! ... Oh , here again ,  --  Again where he is  --  Noise in the street of laughter and men 's voices . Alison looks from the postern-gate to the Inn , between fear and delight , shrinking behind the shrubs and hop-vines . Marlowe 's voice is heard from the unseen group in the street . Oh , not now  --  not yet ! ... Yes , listen , listen , listen !  --  Mother of God ! My prayer is answered , and I can not stay ,  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaking back . He shuts the gate . p. 56 MARLOWE No , no I tell you , no . This is my hour .  --  No , no , another time ! Leave me alone . He stretches his arms and comes down indolently . He has a book in his hand . He enters the arbor , and sits ; opens the book , pulls a leaf or two from the vine , reads a bit , leaning his arms on the table before him ; then shuts his eyes and after a heavy sigh or two , falls asleep .  --  Alison , listening in an agony of suspense , peers through the vine-covered lattice , left . She shakes the vine softly and he does not stir . She speaks in a very low voice , with rapturous wistfulness . ALISON Do you not hear ? Praise God , he is asleep . But I have seen him .  --  Ah , so you can tire , Yes , even you . Oh , this is more than I Could dare to pray for ,  --  that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is grown more patient , This Alison . Ah , if I only knew  --  But I do know : I ' m walking in a dream . I saw  --  I heard . Did I not hear enough ? I ' m nothing : only eyes to watch for you . I ' m nothing , only silence . Sobbing into the vine . If I dared To wake you and to ask you what it meant : Oh , if I only dared to give you  --  now  --  He stirs , turning his face towards her . She is motionless for a second . But he sleeps . Why am I such a nothing , with no gift ? I who would keep you guarded if I might , From all things ill . Oh , if I were the Moon , How I would shine upon you , brow so dear , How white your dreams would be  --  Oh , guard him well , For me  --  for me . Enter from the Inn , Gabriel Andrew . p. 57 GABRIEL Is Master Marlowe there ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( apart ) What , Gabriel ? Oh , how shall I begone ? GABRIEL ( coming down ) Heigh-ho ! I ' ve spoiled a dream for you , I see . MARLOWE ( waking ) Yes , true enough . Nay , sit . ' T is not my garden , Although I lord it , of an afternoon , In dreams and out of them . A patch of green Must serve us for an Eden . GABRIEL Ay , sometimes . And yet when I do plant my garden-plot Of Eden , I would have it further off From here . MARLOWE Oho , in Canterbury ! GABRIEL ( reluctantly ) Ay . Does your mind go there ? ALISON ( apart , rapturously ) He remembers all ! Enter quickly from the Inn , Bame . He comes down to the arbor and sees only Marlowe and Gabriel talking . Alison is hidden . He casts a suspicious glance about . p. 58 GABRIEL Well , Master Richard Bame ? BAME Give you good-day . MARLOWE What do you lack ? BAME Something I lost but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ALISON ( apart ) Alas , poor man , I meant to keep my word , Indeed . MARLOWE It is the most aggrievd devil ! I can not walk out , of a holiday , But I must run against his raven-beak Croaking above some harvest . Hath a grudge Against me ,  --  what , I know not . Well , your worm Must needs be here to make it Holy Eden . GABRIEL You spoke of home . I wonder now  --  Wouldst ever , If the way came , think to go back again To live ? MARLOWE My kindred do not yearn for me . GABRIEL Nay , but perchance if you do yearn to have The downs again , and the comely ways You spoke of ; and the cherry orchards too , As poets may , tho ' I know nothing of it !  --  That song of shepherds you were bound to sing , It will have been a song now , as I guess , Only for singing ; but you cherished it . p. 59 MARLOWE What song ? Come live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you good old homebodies have ears Of kindlier welcome to a madrigal Than I dreamed , ever . I remember now . The little Quietude was full of wonder Her tongue refused to tell , at that same song . GABRIEL The little Quietude ?  --  MARLOWE Your Kentish maid , The Eva of this Eden , to whom I sang . She had great eyes  --  Alison rapt . GABRIEL ( heavily )  --  The little Quietude . MARLOWE And silken hair . She was all made of stuff Too fine for country wear . I marvel Nature Who plans such ruddy milk-maids , should have set A hand to make that lonely masterpiece Among the hop-fields . Why , she was a maid Of crystalline ! If you looked near enough , You ' d see the wonder changing in her eyes Like parti-colored marvels in a brook , Bright through the clearness ! GABRIEL  --  Ay , ' t is Alison ; As like as if you saw her , to read off What ' s in her face . Now I could never say . p. 60 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( dully ) She hath a cousin Over in Cherry Lane  --  and  --  ALISON ( apart , hidden in the shrubs ) Gabriel dear ! MARLOWE Oh , ' t is the cousin , then ! Ay , trust a man Bred in the fields to lose his wit in London , And take up with some painted city-madam Would give her hope of a celestial throne For that swan-quiet , and the morning gaze ! Heigh-ho , you farmers , living face to face With the untarnished loveliness of Earth And with no eyes to see it ! Sullen red Of sunset and dove-plumage of the dawn Are weather , weather , weather !  --  and the Wind That bloweth where it listeth  --  ha , brave Wind ! Muzzle it , would you ?  --  lest it should make free With the young orchards ! Why , for this same maid , Her name might be  --  She listens rapturously , nearer and nearer . GABRIEL  --  The little Quietude . But you should see her sometimes when she laughs . ' T is like  --  I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mind , and more , belike. p. 61 MARLOWE I could do honor to Her Quietude Till song run dry ! GABRIEL  --  So then . You love her ? Alison stands with her eyes shut . MARLOWE Love ? GABRIEL MARLOWE Do I love her ? GABRIEL Is it Yea or Nay ? Marlowe laughs long . MARLOWE Come , tell me ; do you love the Evening Star ? But that ' s a riddle , man .  --  I know to thee It is a timely taper , lighted high Before the curfew bell ! GABRIEL ( fighting off his relief ) You love her not ? Well , then . I know not why I talk so long Of all these things apart . I was but thinking ; You spoke of home , and you can see her face And talk of it such wise , I thought  --  may-hap ,  --  They being my neighbors there at home , I thought  --  If ' t were your mind to take up life again And have our maid to share it  --  if it were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word , Seeing I know her . p. 62 ALISON ( apart )  --  Gabriel ! GABRIEL And as you mind , at home your quality Are held in less esteem than  --  Marlowe still laughs . ALISON ( apart ) Gabriel !  --  MARLOWE Come , is it I ?  --  Good sooth ! I tell thee , man , I like thee ; come ! GABRIEL ( rising ) What laughter is in this ? MARLOWE None , none , but all in me ! Nay , come sit down . He leaves the arbor , and goes to the steps of the Inn to call . Hey , there ,  --  bring out a tankard . Returns , and continues to move up and down , talking animatedly , while Alison is driven back to her hiding-place . It is now sunset . Come , give ear , And I will teach thee a philosophy Shall save thee many a making of thy mind , To ravel out thereafter . I ' ll be plain . I asked thee , would one love the Evening Star ? To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What is all Love but I-Will-Have , Will-Have ! What I must have ,  --  I love . And I will have it . But for the Evening Star , I have it , there . Pointing to the sky . I would not have it nearer . Is that Love , As thou dost understand ?  --  Yes is it mine As I would have it : to look down on me , Not loving and not cruel ; to be bright , Out of my reach ; to lighten me the dark When I lift eyes to see , and in the day To be forgotten .  --  But of all things , far ! Far-off , beyond me , else it were no star . p. 63 GABRIEL Ay , that ' s a star . A woman , then  --  MARLOWE A woman ? A woman must be near , to be a Woman ! Dreams change their color as they leave the stars For this engrossing air folds the world . The birds fly lower , lower , to a nest ; The small uncounted brightnesses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Settle into a kindly earth again ,  --  The dust that men are made of ! Glory close , Love near at hand ?  --  Must-Have , Will-Have , indeed ! World beauty not to dream of but to hold ,  --  Woman ! What else ? GABRIEL And wilt thou love no woman ? They say not so of thee . MARLOWE Oh , leave They Say ! I serve a lady so imperial fair , June paled when she was born . Indeed no star , No dream , no distance , but a very woman Wise with the argent wisdom of the Snake ; Fair nurtured with that old forbidden fruit That thou hast heard of . It was made for her , Oh , and she eats thereof and lives forever ! And what she is and breathes , that Will I Have ; Yes ,  --  though the fruit were twenty times forbidden , Yes , by a God who should walk here and now ,  --  Here in the garden in the cool of the day , Yes !  --  I would eat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . My kingdom of the air , I have it : spaces where no thought may rest , Unfooted heaven lighted by lone stars , And gulf on gulf of dark . But here is Earth ; And Earth I will have too , and we will leave The garden - place together , under the Frown !  --  And smiling back upon the flaming sword , Out of the closure .  --  Love !  --  Stir in the Inn , and voices . Gabriel ready to leave the arbor . Alison behind the vines , exhausted . p. 64 ALISON Ah , God forgive this pitiful eaves-dropper !  --  I am so much the wiser . Let me go , Home . Enter from the Inn , the playwrights , Nashe and Lodge , followed by the Boy with a tankard , and Peele carrying the cups . GABRIEL ( ) Well , I will bid you  --  NASHE ( meeting him ) Whither away so fast ? Who pays the score ? LODGE Come , come , our old friend Andrew ! The two conduct Gabriel back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and returns to her hiding-place . Boy sets down tankard and exit . NASHE Face it out with us ! If we go alone , Kit , here , will pelt us with his dithyrambs . Know you these dithyrambs ? ' T is a green plum Sweet in the mouth , but in the belly bitter , Like the little book within the little Book Our pious Kit doth swear by . LODGE You shall drink God-speed to me ! I go upon a voyage . p. 65 PEELE Alas , dear Tom , now after all this going  --  NASHE At last he goes . And we , a year in wait Drinking Farewell and Yet-again-good-bye ! And more Godspeed , and so Your-safe-return !  --  But now it seems he ' s going . MARLOWE Where is Robin ? A cuckoo-call from the street . LODGE Ask not , Discretion . Nay , it can not be . O hardy Robin , even under ban ! Greene climbs over the postern-gate and comes down cautiously . GREENE Is my sweet Hostess there ? Or doth she dream Within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is she ? I ' m a new man . Go tell her with my scorns , I ' m at The Mermaid . NASHE Liest ,  --  Robin Redhead ! ' T is a good twelve-month since The Mermaid saw thee . GREENE Tell her The Mermaid hath such company , I never show my head there , when my wits Are rusty . Then I burrow in The Bee-Hive , A dull , safe place !

Marlowe appears outside the window , walking slowly . He is greatly altered , haggard , pale , somewhat shabby . The Host lingers , curiously . Enter Marlowe . With the same unseeing abstraction , he passes Lodge , goes to the chair by the casement , sits down , and looks out as if watching for something . p. 76 LODGE Kit !  --  Art asleep , man ?  --  Hast no word for me ?

The open door lets in some noise of roistering.  --  A jangle of horses ' bells is heard approaching . Marlowe points to the bench outside the window . Exeunt Marlowe with Lodge , centre . They are seen to pass the window and to sit talking without , as the inn-yard noises increase . Renter from tap-room Host , and exit , centre . After him Bame in haste . Enter from street , old Barnby , dusting off his frock. p. 79 BARNBY Well , Master Richard , I was nigh to miss you ! I 'm homeward bound .  --  Ay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?

BAME ( fiercely ) Why , the wheel turns , and it shall grind thee too !  --  Thou wilt not have her . Marlowe looks at Lodge . LODGE Peace . The fellow 's mad . Bad news has turned his brain . BAME Stand off from him . No feigning now !  --  ye heard it all . She 's wed To Gabriel Andrew  --  wed to him  --  at last , Through thee , through thee . MARLOWE What is all this to me ? BAME It shall be something yet . I saw thee first , Ay , from the first day when you cheated them With tales of old acquaintance , and made fond , And charmed the eyes of her , and took her heart , But for a whim .  --  Oh , I was not far off !

Laugh , laugh ! Whatever ' t was , ' t is all gone by , Never to laugh at more . But I can tell you , Oh , I can tell you , now it is too late , That she was pining for you .  --  Now she 's wed . Alison ' s gone ! You will not have her now . Ah , now you are no more to her than I ! Murmuring . The spell is broken . She would see you now But what you are  --  a strolling devilry , A knave and a blasphemer , Atheist ! p. 82 MARLOWE The fellow 's mad . But mad-men should be bound . Call me what names your rage will foam in , fool , But never cut me with that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much to thy discredit . Be thy poor venom , venom . Hate and hate !  --  Seek not to find a reason . Bame staggers to the door of the tap-room and exit .  --  Atheist While such do name me so , I wear the name As proudly as an honor .  --  Atheist. LODGE Ah , Kit , too many hands have got this lash Against thee . Here it is , to bear me out . The common voice is risen . Thou canst hear In that man-hunting tumult , every threat , From the indignant cry of simple folk Stung by thy jesting , even to the hiss Of a trodden worm . But now , forbidden ,  --  barred From the Queen 's Players !  --  MARLOWE So I am turned out . LODGE Out of the Court , thou seest , with all disfavor . How did it go so far ? Marlowe shrugs his shoulders , looking out of the window . I beg thee , listen . What now ? More dust ? p. 83 MARLOWE Ay , dust turned into woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  My Lady Hush.  --  Go not . It is soon over . Lodge falls back . Marlowe comes down , step by step , half turning his face to the door as if he were drawing some one after him . Her Ladyship appears in the doorway with a falcon on her wrist , and a riding-mask in the other hand . On the instant Lodge slips out of the casement , right , into the court , and disappears . Marlowe faces the doorway squarely .  --  Enter Her Ladyship : she blows a little silver whistle . Enter Jermyn . Her Ladyship ( to Jermyn , holding forth the falcon ) Take her ; and see thou make the jess secure . ' T was basely mended . Bring it to me here , And speedily . Exit Jermyn , left . Her Ladyship comes down a step or two towards Marlowe . I would not have you think that I am come In answer to a summons . MARLOWE No indeed ! HER LADYSHIP I have been slow to teach you as I should ; Trying the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most tedious ! But I would not understand . HER LADYSHIP And since your importunity would still Beat at the gate , nor take no word from reason , Last , I have come as you demanded of me . Demanded , sooth !  --  MARLOWE Forgive the violence Of a charlatan who doubts his art at length , Reluctant Helena ! HER LADYSHIP No more of this . Your fantasy outwears the day of welcome ; And you are grown too arrogant . You own No height above your own vain-glorious spirit That threatens everything . It is too plain ,  --  Your climbing blasphemy . MARLOWE Ay , let me hear . Is this the charge against me from your lips ?  --  Why I am barred ?  --  And I have wounded you This long time with my godless pride of thought !  --  I am thus slow to take it for my eyes Detected not your suffering loyalty To the true Faith . HER LADYSHIP Be bitter , if you must . I would have warned you , but ' t is late to warn . Take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your reasonings are known there ; they are known  --  p. 85 MARLOWE To the Queen 's Players . She starts . So : keep from the Court . My reasonings are known .  --  I am in danger . You come to warn me of it ? HER LADYSHIP You have heard . MARLOWE Why do you fear me ? HER LADYSHIP Nay , I fear you not . MARLOWE Why do you fear the world ? HER LADYSHIP I fear it not . MARLOWE No , no ? The world nor me ? Then why no : say , ' T is all because you love me not ?  --  Because Now you would have me hence ?  --  O Helena , How cheaply at the last you sell your God ! Thirty pieces of silver , I had sworn Would be too little ! Ah , but not for you . Not even with a kiss , but with a lie , You shew me how you rate Him ,  --  all of you ! I waited for the reason . There had been A chance to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at unaccustomed gold : A brave I love you not ,  --  I wish you gone !  --  Such valor of the devil as he respects ! But this poor coinage of an outcast metal , Stamped with God 's image ! Ha , deny Him , I ? What have I seen of Him that I should know Where He is or is not ? I have searched the mire And found Him not , indeed ; and for such temples As Holy Writ would have it that He dwells in , Look you , how cold and empty !  --  Cold , not pure . No flame of heaven or hell ,  --  no fire at all . She shrinks backward . He follows step by step . Deny Him , I ? And thou , dost thou affirm ?  --  Living denial !  --  Gentle blasphemy ! She lifts her riding-mask to her face : he catches it from her and holds it aloft . Will you begone ? Nay , hear my parting word . Unmask you , Helen .  --  Truly you must go The way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no , I think not , no indeed , not you ! The fire burns out and leaves the ashes there , The cock crows and the spirits must begone . I took you for a Woman , thing of dust ,  --  I  --  I who showed you first what you might be ! But see now , you were hollow all the time , A piece of magic . Now the air blows in , And you are gone in ashes . Well , begone ! Ashes to ashes , dust to dust !  --  Nay , go . He flings the mask across the room . Her Ladyship before the threshold watches him a second , then blows the little silver whistle . Renter Jermyn with the falcon . They look at each other p. 86 JERMYN I have the jesses mended . HER LADYSHIP ( suavely ) ... And the Writ ? Exeunt Her Ladyship and Jermyn . Lodge reappears at casement , peers after them , then enters by the window and hastens toward Marlowe . Seeing the mask , he picks it up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after her ? MARLOWE There 's nothing to go after . ' T is a mask ; All that is left of something that did seem A most rare woman .  --  Remnant of black art , O riddle of the world ! ( Taking the mask . ) Behold her here . Behold , the place for eyes to beckon through ; Here the red mouth that spoke reproaches to me , Yes , in behalf of God !  --  Consider , look ; ' T was this that would convert me . Small and black ; The headsman wears another . Flings it away . LODGE ' T is over , then ? Thou dost not love her ? MARLOWE No. p. 87 LODGE Nor for this long time ? MARLOWE No . LODGE Nor ever ? MARLOWE  --  No ! LODGE Then break my soul if I may understand !  --  Art thou the man to fall into despair Over some lie , some game of hide-and-seek This Madam plays ? Nay , tell me ; there is more . MARLOWE More , is there ? What ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harvest , or a heavy rain , Dismay thee , arrogant devil of us all ! But here I find thee , Kit , inscrutable In thy torn splendors . MARLOWE H 'm ! Torn splendors , are they ? Torn splendors ,  --  ' t is a phrase ; and gorgeous threadbare ; Fine ruin . Well ? LODGE Speak out . There is yet more . Never tell me a woman 's falsity Comes like a thunder-clap at this late day . p. 88 MARLOWE It was not the one woman . It was all . She meant the world ,  --  the world . LODGE ( eagerly ) Well , there 's the sky ! Whip up the horses of the Sun ; be bold . There 's thy dominion . What hast thou to do With tangibles ?  --  I quote thee to thyself . Whatever is or is not on the ground , Make to thyself some image of the air . Thou art a master-architect . Come , come !  --  Thou , who couldst speak for Faustus , in the play , Such longings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were homesick after God ! MARLOWE  --  As if !  --  LODGE I say , what matters it to thee ? Thine own philosophy , thy fame  --  MARLOWE Fame , fame ? Forbidden the Queen 's Players ?  --  Hounded out By a Court scandal ? Nay , hands off the sun ! Drone holy , poet , drone or hold thy tongue ; Will it not lie ?  --  Be off then , atheist ! LODGE This is not like thee . p. 89 MARLOWE ( restlessly )  --  Bah , the plague 's about ! Here you may see Belshazzar at his feast . With a grand gesture indicating the tavern . Nor do we lack our writing on the wall , Traced in a fiery hand . He picks up a piece of chalk from a gaming-table and scrawls some figures on the wainscot . So , Mene  --  Mene  --  Tekel  --  Upharsin.  --  Being interpreted , Nine pounds , three shillings , tuppence on the score ! He comes down , abstractedly tossing the piece of chalk . What is there left ? Give the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sodom . LODGE ( laughing ) Not for this ! Man , man , what is it now that thou Must-Have , Having had all ?  --  I tell thee thou art sour 'd To hear the little country-maid is wed , As the poor devil clamored in thine ears ! MARLOWE So she is wed . LODGE And therefore safe and precious . Come , think upon a far removd fairness That is not thine ; and bring dead beauty back . p. 90 MARLOWE Dead beauty . Nay , the plague hath everything . LODGE The plague hath thee ! I swear thou shalt not spread Infection so : come here and take thy mark . He catches the bit of chalk , then scores a cross heavily on Marlowe 's breast , laughing . Here is a warning for good honest folk .  --  The man is stricken .  --  Lord Have Mercy Upon Us ! Nay ... Marlowe moves away from him , staring fiercely . MARLOWE ( in a low voice )  --  Wilt thou open that raw curse ?  --  Hands off ! LODGE What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  MARLOWE Hands off , I say ! Rubbing the mark . It will not out  --  it will not out ? So , so . Stay then , and every devil may come to hear , And heaven may have its laugh !  --  I ever speak As if there were a Something there to listen : The shadow of the little mind , grotesque , Confident , helpless , thrown upon the clouds To serve him for a god . And I have sworn There is no God .  --  Ah , but there should be one ! There should be one . And there 's the bitterness Of this unending torture-place for men ; For the proud soul who craves a Perfectness That might out-wear the rotting of all things Rooted in earth , that bloom so piercing fair A little while , a little while ,  --  O God , The little while ! ... No , something , something perfect , man or beast ! What is it all , without ?  --  And what 's a man ? To go a blind way seeking here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On shams and shows , and clay that worms devour ; Banquet of famine , till all 's gone , all 's gone ; And he is fain to fill that tortured craving With husks the swine do eat .  --  Almighty Void ! And there is nothing there for me to curse , In this despair . I tell thee , I have come Unto a horror no man dreams upon . Nothing is left and nothing is , to curse . For you may hear the crying of the wind , Crying despair and darkness round the earth , Without a hope of rest . But who has caught That torturer by the gray , ancient locks , Or who can stab the wind ? Hast ever thought Of the thirst of hatred with no thing to hate ? Here , here behold me with my enemy !  --  The Void . p. 91 LODGE ( sadly ) I have no answer for you . MARLOWE No . None ; there is none . Renter Bame from the tap-room , in a daze .

He thinks to go to Canterbury now , Now that it is too late . The shrine , saith he ! Oh , that would be a jest ; but I will warn them ... Pilgrimage , pilgrimage ! Eh , denier of God ? Thou shalt not go . MARLOWE What 's this I shall not do ? p. 92 BAME Thou shalt not find her . Exit . MARLOWE Shall I not , in faith ! Mad-men have wit .  --  There 's one thing left to see ,  --  The little Shrine .

Give up your dark dreams , all , unto their grave . Look not upon them now ; but tell yourself You hail the summons of Bring-out-your-dead , And leave a piteous burthen.  --  Pluck up heart ! Here 's the free air , and sunset and the May : Fill you with freshness .  --  Why , the summer 's here . MARLOWE Wait ; I will see . Dost thou remember her ? A little figure , standing white and shy , Like those above the Portal there at home , On the Cathedral . And by now  --  by now  --  ( harshly ) What wilt thou wager ? She is worn with rain And sodden leaves . There 's nothing lovely left . The storms have hurt her fairness ,  --  and perhaps Her hands are broken . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come upon her .

On the last step , she lifts the candle so that the light falls upon his face , and looks at him steadily for a second ; then grasps the post of the stair , with a shock of grief and amazement .  --  ' T is thou ! Christopher Marlowe . MARLOWE ( watching her ) Alison . ALISON ' T is thou ! MARLOWE So I am changed , then . ALISON Nay , I can not see . The fire is dying . She goes to the fire-place . MARLOWE Come and look at me . The fire is dead .  --  Light up the candles here , If thou art feared of shadows ! p. 101 ALISON Nay , I am not .

ALISON No , no ; indeed it is not true . MARLOWE What irks you then ? That I am something pale ? Older ?  --  By more , indeed , than these three years . For so youth wears  --  and damask may grow dull  --  In sodden weather . Well . But you , you keep The face of Maytime . Let me see it . ALISON ( with an outburst of compassion ) Ah , Thou art all wearied out ! MARLOWE . . . Set down the light . It dazzles.  --  No . I prithee , pardon me . Yes , I am weary . I have frighted you ? You were alone ? ALISON Ay , they are gone awhile . MARLOWE No neighbor near ? Nay , Bride ! And you alone ! Why are you left alone ? ( winningly ) p. 102 ALISON ' T is Whitsun-eve .

But it is.  --  I set it down for you In a fair copy ; and it is not here . Where should I lose it ?  --  At the inn , belike , Where I did spend some moment but to ask  --  The road .  --  I am more a beggar than I dreamed . You should have had the song . p. 103 ALISON Ah , vex you not . Indeed , I have it . Smiling . MARLOWE Where ? ALISON ( simply , touching her heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was true , then .  --  You , you do not mean  --  You do not mean that you remember all , With the one hearing . ALISON Nay , not all , not all . MARLOWE With the one hearing ! Will you tell me this ? ALISON With the one hearing ? Ah , friend Christopher , You sang it to me once ; but I could hear Over and over , many , many days , As if you sang . MARLOWE ( watching her ) You were a dreamer , then . I took you for a little country child , That sleeps without a dream . ALISON Oh , children dream . p. 104 MARLOWE And are you happy ?  --  Bride ? For as to me , You see that I am altered ; you will say , With dreams and waking : dreams of powers and thrones And principalities , as the Book will have it ,  --  And waking in the mire . You do not know The sense of waking down among the dead , Hard by some lazar-house . ALISON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know The sense of death . And then to rise again , And feel thyself bewildered , like a spirit Out of the grave-clothes and the fragrant strewings ; Early and tranquil ,  --  happy ;  --  and yet thin , Thin for the dawn to shine through as a shell , And some way older grown . MARLOWE ( behind her ) Thou sayest this ? ALISON Ah , I am older . MARLOWE Where didst thou learn this ? She is silent , looking at the fire with endurance . Where didst thou learn ? Of what extremity ? Long ,  --  unto death ?  --  It was a sorrow then ? Some grief that wore thee so  --  p. 105 ALISON It was a grief . MARLOWE ( ironically ) A bitter grief ? ALISON Ay , it was bitter then . MARLOWE Tell me of it . There is no grief for thee By right ; it can not be . There was no grief , Sure , but a dream . Tell me the dream . ALISON No .

Another , He takes another and she stands tremulously quiet while he faces her , watching her always . Another then  --  so , prithee . Thou hast heard Of Light that shined in darkness , hast thou not ? And darkness comprehended not the Light ? So . But I tell thee why . It was because The Dark , a sleeping brute , was blinded first , Bewildered at a thing it did not know . Nay , think , to have seen it never , never yet ! Have pity on the Dark , I tell you , Bride . For after all is said , there is no thing So hails the Light as that same blackness there , O'er which it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know at last ?  --  it will not know ? She slowly turns towards the fire again , and listens , as he sets down the candle with a shaking hand . What of the darkness ? Will you ever try To fathom that ? Nay , nay , why should you so , You or another ? Yet I tell you this : There is one side of the earth that even now Groans in the darkness , covered up with gloom And the low tide and dregs of sodden wreck , Waiting and waiting , lightless . Even now , While you can bless the Moon that blesses you , And here the wildest valley and the down , Oblivious of all shadow ,  --  silver brimmed , Turn to her whiteness , like a dreaming face Unto the eyes that love ; a wistful cheek , A heart of earth , for her all white , all white . Thou dost not know . p. 106 ALISON I hear . MARLOWE ( behind her ) But yet not all . I will not tell thee all . Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know of me To my dishonor . There are thousand more Their own dishonor blackens me withal : Lies , slanders , fear !  --  My sins they have by rote , And never miss one ; no ! no miser of them Who , prying in the mire with hands of greed , After a missing groat , could let that go ,  --  But not a jest of mine !  --  My blackest depth They know ; and more than I they know of it , Who live and hunt me there , yes , only there , Avid of foulness , so they hound me out , Away  --  away  --  from any chance of grace ,  --  Away from blessing that they prate about , But never saw and never dreamed upon ,  --  And know not how to long for with desire ! The Dark , yes , yes . But stranger times than all , The few , few times that I have looked at sin , Facing it , longing ,  --  passed it ,  --  ( why , indeed ? ) They know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I put from me  --  I strove to put from me  --  My Heart 's Desire , none knoweth , no , not one , And none will ever know . p. 107 ALISON ( turning suddenly ) But I will keep Thy word , with mine eyes dark . MARLOWE Thou dost not know ! ALISON But I will keep it . Leave it here with me , Thy heaviness ,  --  thy grief . MARLOWE Believest thou ? ALISON Ay , as God liveth ! MARLOWE  --  Dost thou think on Him ?  --  Well , I have seen thee ; thou art here , at least . ALISON ( gently ) Art thou an unbeliever ? MARLOWE I believe In thee . She looks towards him wistfully . He hesitates . Then , as she sits in the corner of the settle by the fire , suddenly he crosses and flings himself passionately on his knees beside her , burying his face against her gown . . . .

MARLOWE How camest thou so wise ?  --  And I have naught to give thee .  --  It is gone . Strange , that I can not think . Ah well , what need ?  --  What need of songs for you ?

No lights within the tavern .  --  Outside , a red afterglow.  --  A solitary figure blots the light from the window , right ; it is Marlowe sitting in his accustomed place , his cup before him . Without , at a little distance , the Bellman 's voice is heard in a sing-song call . Marlowe lifts his head and listens . BELLMAN PAST  --  seven  --  o'clock  --  and a sultry evening .
