txt Although it is highly desirable that the militant Anarchist should receive as little as possible of the notoriety which is one of the main motives to his murderous actions , nobody can regret the publicity which has been given to the facts of the life and death of MORALES , who plotted murder without heeding that it might result in massacre , and who achieved massacre but not murder . That is to say , the persons whom he particularly meant to murder escaped quite unscathed . He himself committed suicide lest a worse thing than swift and painless death should happen to him , as it would probably have dons . On the face of it , this is not such a success as should encourage anybody to emulate lioR.A.T.ms . The biographical facts about him which have been colleqted show that he was one of the regular Anarchistic breed , a human mad dog like the late jOIEDI MOST and the rest , without aspiration , without sympathy , without benevolence , actuated by mere hatred of his kind . His father , though he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause of the rupture , pretty plainly because he would not unnecessarily defame a wretch who , after all , was his son . His brother attributes his atrocious deed , doubtless with justice , to " his morose disposition . " That is the explanation of the whole wretched tribe . They are " enemies of the human race . " That phrase in the old law had a specific meaning , and was nearly synonymous with the term " outlaw " of the old English law . It meant and means a man who so hated his kind and desired to do them harm that , when a decree of outlawry had once been passed against a man , everybody who met him was at liberty to slay him , with no more regard for process of law than he himself used in the commission of his crimes . Of course , such summary . procedures on the part of society , even against its avowed enemies , are now out of date . Nobody would seriously propose to revive them even against a branded and placarded Anarchist . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can do to repress Anarchism and prevent the crimes of Anarchists there is now a practical consent among them all that they ought to do . The States of this Union have , in their domestic legislation , passed very drastic laws against the public profession of Anarchism , rather against their traditional position that speech and writing should be free so long as they do not actually issue in criminal acts . But it seems there is need of some international action against Anarchism and Anarchists . whereby a person once fairly convicted in any country of being an Anarchist should be denied an asylum in any other . Evidently the subject is one of much difficulty , because the ordinary safeguards of civil liberty have to be reconciled with the summary suppression of avowed " enemies of the human race . " It might very well ' be a question for the next conference of The Hague what could be done to make the world too hot to hold these wretches without resorting to methods which would bring legal methods too near to the methods of Anarchism itself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
