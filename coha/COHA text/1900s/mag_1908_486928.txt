My Dear Mr. North : I am unable to go to Washington and have no one to look out for my interests there but yourself , and I depend upon you . Of course , Messrs . Aldrich and Dingley will do all they can , but I depend upon your letting them know what I need . I depend upon you . Dress goods , yarns , and tops . Yours very truly , WILLIAM WHITMAN . This is one of those interesting letters between Mr. Whitman , president of the Arlington Mills at Lawrence , Mass. , and S. N. D North  --  then secretary of the National Association of Wool Manufacturers , now Director of the Census  --  showing by what tricks a tariff bill is framed . The correspondence was presented at the hearings of the Committee on Ways and Means . Mr. Whitman is an old hand at lobbying . When cross-examined on this subject during the trial of a case in Boston in 1902 he admitted that he had been at Washington more or less looking after tariff legislation . Atfirst he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but later he explained : Why , much to my surprise , there was somewhere about 1883 , I think it was in 1883 , a few gentlemen got together and made up a small purse to help me , and gave it to me . But Mr. Whitman found a better way when the Dingley bill was being concocted in 1897 . Senator Aldrich kindly invited Mr. North to serve as one of-the clerks of the Finance Committee , while in the pay of the Association of Wool Manufacturers . " I am the only person whom the committee allows at its meetings , " wrote Mr. North in a letter to Mr. Whitman April 4 . Mr. North felt that these " confidential relations " would not allow him to keep Mr. ' Whitman so fully posted as he might like , but he added : If I find that it is desirable that you should come on here , I will telegraph you that the situation requires attention , and You will doubtless have no trouble in finding out what is the matter . For all practical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direct information , and nothing in Mr. North 's labored and wholly ineffectual letter of explanation alters the fact that he was present at the sessions of the committee as a sort of secret agent or spy , and that the wool manufacturers thus enjoyed an important advantage , both potential and actual , over other persons who might ' be interested in these schedules . Mr. North , of course , did nothing illegal . And he was properly rewarded ; for , as he himself puts it , the officers of the Association , in " recognition of the arduous and responsible work " which he had performed for the committee , " apart from " his " duties as secretary of the association , " presented him with the sum of $5,000 . We wish each of our readers might get hold of the pamphlet in which the letters between Mr. Whitman and Mr. North are published . There could be no plainer exhibition of that greed which makes and is made by a protective tariff . We quote a few passages : Boston , April 6 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my interest in this regard . You know how important it is , not only to me , but to the whole worsted industry of the United States . . . . If there is the slightest danger of any change , I must see these gentlemen before it is too late . . . . Wm . WHITMAN . Boston , June 2 , 1897 . We all depend upon you to watch closely our interests , to see that nothing is overlooked or neglected by our friends on the committee . I have no doubt they will do all they do , but with so many interests to look after , our special representative must see to it that our interest receives proper attention . . . . WM . WHITMAN . Boston , June 9 , 1897 . Bear in mind that I am depending upon you wholly to look after my interests . . . . - WM . WHITMAN . Washington , D. C. , June 10 , 1897 . I will do the best I can with Mr. Allison when the time comes , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the worsted yarn schedule . . . . S. N. D. NORTH . Washington , June 20 , 1897 . It is lucky I was here , and just in the position I am . It has given me a whole day to work on the matter and get it right , and with Aldrich away , there is no one on the committee who knows anything about it . But Allison and Platt trust me , and I expect they will both agree to what I have asked . I went all over the matter with them last evening . S. N. D. NORTH . Our readers will agree that if Mr. North was willing to do this kind of thing , $5,000 was small enough pay for it . But we are less concerned with this particular piece of infamy than with the view it gives of a tariff bill in the making . The wool manufacturers landed the superserviceable North in a clerkship ; but other interests were , as Mr. Whitman observed , well looked after . One owned a Senator , another a Representative , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committee hearings last week , Andrew J. Solis , a Boston dealer in wool , declared that the " top-malters " ? Mr. Whitman is one of them ? procured a protection of 150 per cent. ; but other parties were grabbing for their share , and got it . Representative Boutell of Illinois expressed considerable surprise and horror at these revelations of intrigue , and professed a desire to go to the bottom of the matter and get all the facts . We should advise him , however , to stay hiS hand . Were the drag-net cast in earnest , bigger fish than the unhappy North would be caught . In a thoroughgoing investigation we should learn what manufacturers subscribed to the Republican campaign fund of- 1896 , and who solicited the funds ; what were the secret understandings with the leaders , and with less important individuals in the Grand Old Party ; who looked after the steel schedules , who after the oil , and all the rest ; what Cannon 's special duties were ? Aldrich 's seem fairly well known  --  what Dalzell 's and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ; exactly what they did and why they did it . Then we should uncover a scandal compared with which the looting of the insurance companies , the Credit Mobilier affair , and the operations of the Whiskey Ring were nothing . Then Mr. Roosevelt might discover that there is a moral question in the tariff issue . Then every man who had eyes to see or ears to hear would know that our tariff laws are shapen in iniquity and conceived in sinTHE NEW CIVIL-SERVICE ORDER . Mr. Roosevelt has imitated previous Presidents in extending the provisions of the Civil Service Law just prior to his retirement from office , but none of his predecessors ever took a more important step than Mr. Roosevelt 's of last week , and none was entitled to warmer thanks from the country . Under this new order , every fourth-class post office east of the Mississippi and north of the Ohio is brought under the civil-service rules . The present incumbents will , of course , be undisturbed ; but as they die or resign or are removed , their places will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No less than 15,488 of the 55,318 f ourth-elass postmasterships are affected , and it is probable that as soon as these have been classified the number will be increased . This epoch-making reform has a double significance . It is not only that the Executive is thus deprived of a large amount of patronage , and that the assault has begun upon one of the last strongholds of the spoilsman , but that the 15,488 postmasters thus included in the rules will have to give up , once ' and for all , any partisan political activity . There is little doubt that , except in some few cases , the classified Federal employees were not permitted to take an active part in the campaign just closed . The fourth-class postmasters were , however , as heretofore , the special agents of the party machine . The role played by the Southern postmasters in nominating Mr Taft under Mr. Hitch-cock 's skilful guidance everybody remembers . From time immemorial the village postmaster has been the chief local dependence of the party in power . Often the only Federal employee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the full In district , county , and State conventions he has been very prominent , and as a delegate has made it easy for a man like Senator Platt to retain his grip on the machine . Henceforth , if other Executives are as earnest in keeping Federal employees of the classified service out of active politics as Mr. Roosevelt has been , the political effect of his last order will be far-reaching There will still be too many unclassified Federal office-holders in politics for safety , but the gain when all the fourth-class postmasters are excluded will be enormous Undoubtedly , the geographical lines drawn by the President will lay him open to the charge that he was careful to overlook the Southern postmasters for use in future conventions . This criticism we believe to be unjust . It must be remembered that the first step of the reform of the civil service came along curious geographical lines , and apparently discriminated in favor of certain departments . To have included all the fourth-class postmasters at once would have been a tremendous undertaking . It will be no easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of holding examinations in the vast rural stretches of the West and South must be borne in mind . Again , in. the South the ever-present race problem must be considered . While it is highly desirable that the bogus Republican organisations in the Soutlisshould be deprived of their postmaster props as speedily as possible , we believe the President did well to go slowly . - That the competitive classified service has made vast strides under Mr. Roosevelt admits of no Question . ' When he became President in 1901 , 108,967 out of 235,766 civil employees were within the rules , a growth from 14,000 in the eighteen years following the passage of the Pendleton law in 1883 . On June 30 of this year , out of a total of 352,104 , there were within the - classified portion 206,637 , exclusive of 5,500 laborers who are under the rules though not subject to examination . With the President 's new order , there will be altogether 227,625 practically protected from removal during good behavior . This is an increase from 46 per cent . of the whole service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great enlargement of the total number of employees . To Mr. Roosevelt belongs also the credit of bringing under the rules the rural free-delivery carriers , 40,000 strong ; the Forestry service ; part of the Isthmian Canal force ; deputy collectors , deputy naval officers , and cashiers ; the finance clerks and cashiers in post offices ; and the field clerical service of the War Department ( withdrawn by Mr. McKinley ) . The labor service in Washington and the principal cities , while not subject to examination , may properly be put in the same list . Moreover , Mr. Roosevelt has introduced the system of examination and limited competition in the consular service . As our readers know , he has from time to time made very bad individual appointments . That is his unfortunate method of being " practical " ? doing wrong at times in order to accomplish what he thinks good . But on the credit side must be placed the fact that by including deputy collectors of customs , he has placed higher officials under the rules than any other President ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inall cases laid before him He is thus entitled to the hearty praise of every advocate of civil service reform . Should he desire to go still further before leaving Washington , he could classify the employees of non-free-delivery post offices , the 4,500 pension-examining surgeons , and the assistant postmasters Yet he may wish to leave something for . his successor to do . Mr Taft it is a satisfaction to know , is ful ly as ardent an advocate of a protected civil service . For years he was president of the Cincinnati Civil Service Re . form League , and he introduced the reform idea into the Philippines as soon as he reached there . - SCIENCE CORRECTING SCIENCE . Frenchmen are making preparations to erect- a statue to Homer . Only a few years ago the idea would have- met with the sharp objection that Homer never lived , or , if he did , that we know nothing about him . But even a few years ago it would have been possible to retort that the Athenians did not hesitate to erect an altar to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unknown poet who is revealed to us in his works To-day , however , we can assume an even stronger position . Homer is being rescued from the limbo to which Wolff and Lachmann consigned him , and is being set upon his feet again as a real , if somewhat indefinite , personality . This procedure has stirred a French man of letters , Andre Beaunier , to a imam of rejoicing in a recent number of La Revue de Paris . M. Beaumer , while still a child , had met Homer . The poet was in a dust-covered picture ? an old man in a long robe , carrying a lyre on his back , his right arm raised to heaven , his left leaning , on the shoulder of a boy who was his guide ; for the singer was blind . Young Beaunier 's tather told him that the man was Homer , a great poet of olden days , and the son of the river Meles and the nymph Critheis How long did the child 's belief last ? Till he began his first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not only a real person whose parents were the river Meles and the nymph Critheis , but he was the creator of a world of realities . Briseis , on whose account Achilles mingled his- bitter tears with the loud-sounding sEgean , and Nausicaa playing ball with her hand-maidens on the Phmacian beach , were as real as his own girl cousins , only much more lovable . But the first week at high-school brought ruin into the boy 's world . The professor of philosophy assured him that the visible universe did not really exist , that it was all a mere subjective image or " idea " ; and the pros fessor of ancient languages was sure that Homer never lived , that the poet was only a collection of folk-songs . The destruction of the visible universe the boy could have borne with equanimity , but the disappearance of Homer shook the foundations of his being Wolff , Lachmann , Schlegel , and Jacob Grimm were so many anarchs to him . Hence we can appreciate how M. Beaunier found joy in their overthrow in turn and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose father was the river Meles and whose mother was the nymph Critheis . Something of the same joy enters into most of us when some pet " triumph " of science receives what the man in the street calls a black " eye It is not so much the joy of getting back an ancient belief which Science has superciliously waved away ? " Myth ! " " Legend ! " " Superstition ! " ? as to have science convicted of falsely professing omniscience . Philologian and biologist have sinned alike in destroying without reason , and , worse still , in building without adequate foundation . It may be that Agassiz could , from a thigh-bone , reconstruct an entire brontosaurus . But , after all , that is no more than the an-cleats could do when they reconstructed Hercules from his foot . What is not to be denied is that more than one scientist has from a thigh-bone built an animal the like of which was never seen on land or sea , and for which he has had to invent a Greek name ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bricks and upon that frail basis erected a complete extinct civilization that never flourished . To believe in Homer and Moses because a vast literature and tradition centre about them is superstition . To refuse to believe that Pharaoh was the Egyptian Knuft-Ra , who lived either 2500 B. C. or 6700 B. C. , it is not quite certain which , is equally superstitious . Jacob never served fourteen years for the sake of Rachel . Rachel was only a lamb and the totem of a Bedouin tribe At present we are swinging away from a science that seems almost as apt to go to extremes as mediaeval scholasticism was . The tyranny of the scientist and the scholar is so heavy upon us that when scientists fall out the ordinary man is shocked to observe the limitations of their knowledge . It is painful , for instance , to be told that recent archeological discoveries in Turkestan may necessitate the reconstruction of the theories of Indo-Ger manic philology . Now , Indo-Germanic philology , to those of us who have heard of it , is as firmly established as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Have not the histories of great nations been written in accordance with what Indo-Germanic philology had to teach ? Have not tremendous theories of race supremacy , of Aryan versus non-Aryan , been founded upon the philologian 's discoveries ? Have not political parties , anti-Semites , Pan-Germanists , Pan-Slavists , and what not , been based in turn upon such theories of race supremacy ? And have not Dreyfus campaigns , and Kishenev massacres been brought about in turn by such racial parties ? Their champions have not hesitated to call the teachings of Indo-Germanic . philology to their aid . Yet an expedition goes out to Turkestan and the root principles of Indo-Germanic philology may have to be seriously modified . Arguing against science at the present day would be acting like the farmer who saw an elephant for the first time and declared that he did n't believe there was such a beast , But to protest against the exaggerated claims of the scientists is not only legitimate , but useful . For it is certain that reaction will otherwise carry us to the opposite extreme of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electrons and ions will make an opening for the discovery of " psychomeres " or soul-atoms . Evolution itself is grow mg more modest , as it should . Twenty years ago the extreme Darwinians could easily have told us why women have long hair . Primitive marriage was always marriage by capture . The longhaired women could be easily seized and dragged away in the forest . The short-haired women failed to get husbands , and in the course of time died out . But nowadays we should look twice at . such an explanation . SOME SWEDISH BOOKS OF THE YEAR . To see themselves as others see them has always been the peculiar privilege of Americans . Charity workers and University professors , politicians , and tourists from all countries of Europe pay longer or shorter visits to this country , and publish more or less comprehensive reports . Two such accounts have been printed in Sweden within the present . year . Prof. Rudolf Kjelien of the - University of Gothenburg accompanied the Swedish student singers on their American trip in 1904 . The letters which he sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been issued in book form under the title " Salsgare-och turistfarder " ( Stockholm : H. Geber ) . The thirty-four days which the author spent in Pullman cars , hotels , and concert halls naturally did not suffice for a close study ; but as long as he is concerned with the mere surface of things he is a keen enough observer . Very amusing , for instance , is his description of the American woman as he saw her on the streets of New York and Chicago ? " a dazzling revelation . . . like a sailing ship , half swan and half chicken ; . . . under the most extravagant of hats the hair bulges out over the forehead in a tremendous crown , and under it gleams a bird face on the most glorious pedestal . " The entrance from the sea to New York Professor Kjelldn thinks can be well compared with that to Stockholm and to Constantinople An observer of different kind , with a definite purpose , is Harald Salomon , who in his " Om barndomstolar " ( Stockholm : P. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a journey of several months from the Atlantic to the Pacific . He attended juvenile courts , accompanied probation officers on their visits , and talked with judges and officers in New York , Washington , Chicago , Denver , Salt Lake City , San Francisco , Los Angeles , Indianapolis , Pittsburgh , and Philadelphia . He brings home to his readers a clear idea of one of the greatest forces for good in this country . A summary view of the systems of treating juvenile delinquents in other countries follows , and then a critical study of the Swedish plan . " Natur och arbetsliv " ( Stockholm : Norstedt ) is a book descriptive of Sweden , by Anna Sandstrem The first volume , now before us , deals with the southern part of the country . Though principally intended for young people , it is far from being a juvenile in the hackneyed sense ; it presents in an interesting manner the natural features of the land and the occupations of its people in field , mine , and factory . The illustrations are excellent . Among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bringing out for the Academy of Science in Stockholm two deserve special mention : " Svenska kalendern , " a " book of reference for everybody , " containing all sorts of statistical and other information , - mainly relating to Sweden ; and " Svenska resekalenderm " , of which the first volume , which appeared this year , contains descriptions and plans of every city and borough in the country , together with other matter of especial interest to tourists .
