txt This afternoon the last " 5 o'clock tea " will be held at the Fine Arts Building , 215 West Fifty-seventh Street , when Mrs. John Jacob Astir and other ladies will preside at the tables . To-morrow afternoon will see the end of an exhibition of native and foreign tonal landscapes and figure paintings which will be difficult to duplicate in future , even with the powers of persuasion shown by the committee of the Society Or Art Collectors . The cause of charity is potent , and the Eye and Ear Dispensary IS a most worthy charity , but a good many collectors  --  perhaps more especially their housewives  --  are not easily induced to denude the walls of their drawing and dining rooms for a month at the call of the zealous promoters of a. charity . It is a pity that the approaching exhibition of the National Academy of Design should bar another week of the Comparative Exhibition of Native and Foreign Art . Only during the past fortnight has New York seemed to awake to the beauty and importance of this show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lack in New York of large fireproof galleries in places easy of access , where valuable works of art can be shown for a round term of weeks . The galleries in the Fine Arts are very well so far as they go , but during the season they are constantly in demand , and because the Academy has no galleries of its own , there is just so much less of the season when the Fine Arts building can be had for other organizations . It would have been highly interesting if this Comparative could have been followed by another Comparative in which foreign and American figure work would have bad a larger share . There are Italian , Spanish , German , and British artists little known on this side whose works would form a very instructive parallel with those of Americans . It is too soon to learn how successful the Comparative has been financially , but the signs are that the Eye and Ear Dispensary will receive a substantial sum to carry on its good work .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
