AMONG the Nubian tribes of North Africa the Hadendoas hear a bad name for treachery , and on one i.casion while on a hunting expedition . had a proof not only of this , but of the enmity that appears to be ingrained in their nature towards the white man . I was staying at a Beni Amer camp , when news was brought in one morning that a herd of elephants had been drinking at the village wells . This was too good a chance of sport to be lost , and taking three men with me , I set off in pursuit . Towards noon we reached that part of the jungle in which the animals were grazing , becoming aware of the fact before seeing them from the sound of cracking branches which resounded on every side . Carefully crawling under the thorny branches of the " kittar " ? a species of aeacia ? I soon came across a fine tusker , and aiming behind the shoulder , fired and wounded him , but not fatally . A tremendous commotion immediately ensued , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away in the opposite direction . We tracked the wounded animal until it was too dark to see , when my men advised that we should return to the camp , the elephant having doubtless gone off to the langgeb hills , some twenty miles away , and as we were then on Hadendoa ground , remaining where we were was anything but safe . I , however , being very anxious to take up the trail with the first ray of daylight , overruled their objections , proposing that we should keep watch by turns during the night . Choosing a well-sheltered hollow in which we thought . we should be out of sight of the inimical tribe , we lighted a fire ; and after a frugal meal ? as , having brought provisions for only one day 's march , I knew that our resources must be husbanded ? I determined to take the last watch ; for , being less used to fatigue than the natives , I felt that it was imperativefor me to secure an unbroken rest for some hours . I slept soundly till @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take my turn . The stillness was supreme . All nature slept ; and , alas ! even on my watch I myself felt drowsiness overtaking me . To keep myself on the alert I rose and made up the fire , which was dying out , set the kettle on the embers , and boiled some coffee . After this slight refreshment I spread my sheepskin rug a couple of yards off , and turning my back to the fire , kept a lookout in front , as , owing to the precipitous stony cliff that rose on three sides of our camping-ground , I found it was next to impossible for any one to enter except in that direction . Suddenly a log which had been charred quite through fell asunder , throwing out a large shower of sparks , while a bright flame shot upwards . To my surprise I beheld before me an extraordinary sight which held my attention fixed , though for a moment I did not realize what I saw . Immediately before my eyes was the diminutive figure of a native , evidently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ilaclendoa tribe , but only about two inches in height , spear in hand , which he was quivering up and down as if on the very verge of striking a blow , a fiendish grin distorting his countenance . My astonishment lasted but an instant . I quickly perceived that this was the reflection in my spectacles of all enemy behind me , who must have slipped in while I was dozing , and that . I was the object of the aim which in another second would have proved fatal . There was not time either to rise or turn , but flinging myself backwards I seized the savage by his foot , and pulling him forward , happily upset him on his back and closed with him . The excitement and breathlessness of the struggle prevented me from calling out , especially as I had at first great difficulty in retaining my hold of my foe , owing to the slipperiness of his greasy skin , but the sand which stuck to him as we rolled over and over together soon enabled me to obtain a better grip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of my hunters , who , although sound asleep till that instant , was on his feet in a twinkling , and quickly settled the matter by slipping a cord round the elbows and legs of the man , who was thus secured . Too exhausted at first to speak , I could only make signs to my men not to kill him , they being at once about to drive their spears into his body in the same manner that he had wished to run his own weapon into mine . They questioned him as to his name , where he had come from , and why he had wished to kill me , but to no inquiry would he answer a single word , retaining the most dogged silence and an imperturbable countenance . Dawn soon broke , and keeping his arms still tightly bound , we took him with us many miles in the opposite direction to that from which he had come , and carrying off his spear , we then let him go . My escape had been marvellous , and was due not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but also to the fact of his having gloated lingeringly over his unsuspecting prey ; had he at once struck a decisive blow , my fate would have been sealed . To my great regret we soon discovered that it was impossible to track the " tusk- er " any farther . Owing to the rocky nature of the country the spoor was entirely lost , we had not sufficient food for a protracted march , and the proximity of the Haden-doss rendered it unsafe for us , being so few in number , to remain any longer in that part of the country . lAre therefore retraced our steps to the Beni Amer camp , which we reached before sundown , after a forced march , so to speak , of thirty - odd miles in less than eight hours , over some of the most difficult ground I ever crossed , and in a temperature of 150 degrees in the sun . A subsequent encounter with another elephant , in which I fortunately came off victorious after a of vicissitude never to he forgotten , occurred when I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thursday evening my hunters as usual came to make their salaam and request leave of absence for the morrow , Friday being their Sabbath , or rest day . This I was nothing loath to grant . The fatigues of the week had been great , and keen as my love of sport was , twenty-four hours of rest end leisure was a pleasant prospect . The result was , however , strangely different from the anticipation . Soon after daybreak on Friday a cowherd came to my cook and desired him to tell the " khawajah " ? i. e. , " master " ? that elephants had recently been drinking at the village wells and could not be far off . He also said that from the spoor and stride one of them was evidently a very large one . I sprang up , but replied that I had given my hunters leave of absence for the day , and as they had told me they would he off overnight to a neighboring camp , there was no one to accompany me . The cowherd at once offered his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hasty breakfast , was ready to start . I took two rifles with mea heavy double barrel , which I gave to the cowherd to carry , and a lighter single barrel , which I carried myself . We went straight to the wells and examined the spoor . Never had T seen so large a footprint . It measured twenty inches in diameter , showing at a rough calculation that the elephant stood over ten feet in height . The magnificent beast had evidently knelt while drinking , to draw the water , which was low , it being the dry season , from the well with his trunk , and after assuaging his thirst there was no doubt that he had bathed after the manner of elephants , drawing up the water and flinging it all over and round him , for the ground to a distance of several yards was still wet . He had thrust his tusks , while kneeling , into the damp ground , and the long deep holes that they had made were still intact . I took the man 's spear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found to my amazement that it measured close upon three feet in depth . Knowing that an equal length of tusk to that which is visible is always embedded in the head of an elephant , this measurement showed that in this instance the tusks would be at least six feet long . Losing not a moment , we made our way across the desert in the direction of a dense jungle some five miles off . On reaching it , in a space of time which would sound incredible to my readers , T found that , amidst a vast area of brushwood and almost impenetrable vegetation which was interspersed with huge tamarind-trees and dour palms , there wore , strangely enough , lung irregular glades of barren paths , from six to twenty feet wide , almost entirely devoid of undergrowth , though the monster trees that towered on either side spread their great branches overhead and formed avenues of deep refreshing shade . Proceeding as noiselessly and yet as swiftly as might be , my guide and I were at last arrested by the unmistakable cracking of branches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ search of , Suddenly a magnificent tusker , no doubt the animal that had drunk at the wells , emerged from the jungle , and catching sight of us , stood for an instant stock-still , not above sixty yards distant . For only a moment , however , did our foe seem to hesitate as to the course be would pursue . Throwing up his trunk in a straight line above his head and spreading his colossal ears at right angles to his body to intensify the senses of hearing and smelling , he trumpeted forth a roar of defiance , and came running towards us at a brisk trot . 741y rifle was instantly at my shoulder , and knowing that it was impossible to penetrate the vast mass of muscular tissue situated at the base of the trunk with a bullet , I aimed at the temple and pulled the trigger , but to may dismay and horror the cartridge missed fire . The click of the falling hammer , however , arrested the beast for a moment , and with the unerring sagacity of his kind he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its erect position , he coiled it tightly up below his tusks and came swiftly on . Now was my opportunity ; the vital spot between and slightly below the eyes , - which when penetrated by the smallest bullet would prove fatal , was clearly before me , and a steady aim was all that was needed to secure the prize . Dropping my lighter rifle , I stretched out may hand behind me for the heavy double barrel which my guide was carrying , but to my surprise received nothing ! I swiftly turned my head to ascertain the reason , and beheld my man , rifle in hand , running with all his might in the opposite direction down the glade . I instantly saw that no choice was left me if I would save my own life but to rim too ! Heath was imminent ; escape lay only in flight . Not even casting a glance at my weapon en the ground , I turned and fled , running on and on as bard as I could go , hearing the dull thud of the enormous pads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hot breath of the infuriated animal actually un my neck . T know not how far I had gone when I found myself on the edge of a bank down which elephants had made a path , a descent of twenty feet or more , to the " khor " or dry bed of the watercourse which lay below . Harting down this path without a moment 's hesitation and going I knew not whither , I readied the khor and ran blindly on , sinking into the sand at every step . Suddenly my foot caught in something that lay half buried in the ground , and I fell headlong , measuring my length on the sand . A liana , of about twenty years ' growth , the size of a ship 's cable , some three inches in diameter , had tripped me up , but by the greatest good luck had thrown me close to an enormous tree round which it had clung , but which now lay at full length crosswise in the khor . This tree , at least seven feet in diameter and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a flood and had fallen from the edge of the bank where it had stood into the watercourse . The huge roots encrusted with monld and sand raised that part of the trunk nearest to them to a height of about five feet as it lay , while the remainder of it sloped gradually down till the top rested on the ground at the farther side of the " khor . " I at once saw the advantage this tree would give me . Creeping under the trunk , I flung myself on the ground on the farther side and listened . But one thought filled my mind ? had my enemy lost sight of me ; or was he still in pursuit ? I was not left a moment in doubt ; his eagle eye had evidently been upon me all the time , for his heavy , footsteps slithered almost immediately down the hank , and with an angry bang he pushed his great chest against the tree and snorted out a threat . But for the moment he was baffled . Rage and disappointment filled his soul when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was far too small for him to pass through ; neither could he climb over . From the ground to the top of the fallen trunk at that end of it measured at least eleven feet , and this was a height he could not surmount . It then occurred to him that he might seize me with his trunk ; stretching it towards me in a straight line from his forehead , he tried to grasp me , but I was beyond his reach . This effort was repeated several times , and so aggravating did it become that , feeling secure in my retreat , T could not at last refrain from putting out my hand and giving the trunk a smart blow . No sooner had I done so , however , than I regretted the action , for I not only hurt my own hand by its rapid contact with the tense muscular tissue , but my impetuous action unfortunately caused the animal to change his tactics . Apparently reflecting for a moment as to his next move , he suddenly made a rush for the roots and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of getting me , but I quickly scrambled back again wider the tree to the side he had left , and once more he was floored . He immediately turned and ran back to get me on the side I had come to . but as before I crept back under the trunk into safety , and he was again baffled . Our mutual manoeuvres would have been amusing to a bystander , but to myself they wore a serious aspect , for this little game of hide-and-seek actually went on between us four or five times , the monster running round and round the roots , and I creeping backwards and forwards each time , exhausted as I was , under the fallen trunk . I watched every movement of my enemy , with satisfaction so far , and yet with apprehension , for I knew that the sagacity of the elephant is almost boundless , and each moment I feared he would attempt to reach me by some means for which I was not pinarecl . I soon found that . I was not mistaken . He stood quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with himself , evidently determined not to be beaten , and then he made off at a brisk pace down the length of the tree , till he came to the spot where it began to taper towards the top ; there he halted , and at a point where it lay only about three feet from the ground LIFE AND SPORT IN NITBIA. ns he commenced to climb over it . While he was struggling through the withered branches , which just at that point were fortunately dense and probably hid me from his sight , I determined , having regained my breath , to seize this opportunity of making a rush for the bank and try a chance of escape once more in the forest , where I should be better able to run then in the sand of the watercourse . I did this with all possible speed , turning only for a second at the top of the hank to see if my manoeuvre had been observed . Alas ! it had . My enemy was again in full pursuit of me . As before , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part I then entered it was happily rather open , and I remembered that the natives had often told me that in flying from an elephant a great advantage could be gained by taking a zigzag course . I therefore turned abruptly to my right , putting on my best pace for fifty yards , then sharply to my left for another fifty , and so on , going right and left some half-dozen times , until I had gained the denser forest , where under a huge tamarind-tree I flung myself on the ground as before and kept a sharp lookout to see if the monster was still following me . To my consternation I perceived that in spite of my stratagem he was again in my wake . Ile had traced my first course , but to my great satisfaction I saw that he had not noticed my divergence from it , and that owing to his headlong pace he had overshot the point at which I had turned and gone beyond it a good sixty yards . Finding his mistake , he doubled back to pick up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often the case in similar circumstances , he had been thrown nil the track each time I had zigzagged. the impetuosity of his pursuit increasing his difficulty in finding me . From where I lay , scarcely daring to breathe , I could hear him snaking , most fortunately for me , hasty but fruitless rushes , first in one direction , then in another ; but presently he gave it up , having evidently lost my onward course , and took up my original trail on my way to the bank at the top of the " khor " in my first flight from him . Thus he had lost me , and had probably returned to the fallen tree . When the immediate sense of danger was past it was succeeded by one of intense VOL . CXTIT ? Nn. 675. - 68 fatigue , and , utterly disinclined to move , I lay perfectly still where I was . What length of time thus expired while I was resting I can not tell , but I was suddenly aroused by hearing a cry resembling that of a wild pigeon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after which silence ensued . A few minutes later this sound was repeated behind me , and , strangely enough , after another short interval this " coo coo " came from about twenty yards to my left . The repetition of this cry from different directions at the hottest part of the day , when all birds are silent , at length aroused my suspicions that it did not proceed at all from a bird , but that it was emitted by a human throat , and I then apprehended that my guilty gun-bearer , having seen from some hiding-place that the danger was pest , had returned to look for inc . I therefore replied to the signal , if such it was , by imitating the same note . On this the cowherd , for in truth it was he , slowly and sheepishly emerged from the brushwood and came towards me . At once I commenced rating him soundly for having deserted me in the time of peril , but I had scarcely uttered a word when he stopped me by excitedly whispering , " Iskut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , extending his hand with energetic pantomime in the direction taken by the elephant . The rascal would not speak , and it was very evident that he did not wish me to do so either , though I could not at the moment determine whether his desire for silence arose from the probable proximity of our foe or from fear of the abuse I was ready to shower upon him . His subsequent gesticulations clearly indicated that he was inquiring whether I wished to follow up the game or to return to the vamp . In reply I signalled inquiry as to the whereabouts of the rifle I had thrown down when the cartridge missed fire . He turned at once , and beckoning me to follow , led me in almost a straight line to the glade where it lay . He picked it up in silence and handed it to me . I withdrew the cartridge , and replacing it with a fresh one , signed to him to track the elephant . Without hesitation he set off through the forest until we arrived at the path leading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointed out on the smooth white sand below the three tracks that the animal had left ? those in his first pursuit of me , those following me bock to the forest , and those when having lost me he had returned to see if I had again taken refuge beneath the fallen tree . Arrived at the tree , we distinctly saw his freshest tracks going up the khor along the foot of the bank . This we followed for nearly half a mile , when , passing under some dense foliage which reached from the top of the bank almost to the sand of the khor , my guide stopped and picked up a branch that had evidently been only recently torn down and dropped by our foe ? the end where it had been bitten off being still moist , which showed that only a few seconds before it must have fallen from his mouth . By this sign we became aware that we were in his immediate vicinity . Giving my man the light rifle , I took the heavy double barrel from him , determined this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right hammer , stealthily followed the tracks , going in front of the native . I had not proceeded more than twenty yards when a shout from behind made me turn , and there was the elephant sliding down the bank , again in pursuit of us . As I threw up my rifle he turned and came on as before in a direct line towards me , with his trunk well coiled up between his huge tusks . Aiming at the vulnerable spot in the middle of his forehead , I fired . The bullet penetrated his brain , and the magnificent beast sank slowly to his knees , dying without a struggle . There lay my mighty foe , silent and immovable . An instance of the great sagacity of the elephant in preserving itself from the attacks of man , although almost incredible , was related to me by an old hunter on whom I could thoroughly rely . He told me that some years before there had been a well-known old bull elephant with a pair of magnificent tusks which had been long and earnestly coveted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Their wise old owner , however , knew that he was hunted , and had hitherto frustrated all effnrts to rapture him . With a view to his safety he made it a rule never to wander from the rest of the herd , hut , on the contrary , always keep as much as possible in the midst of them , and ithad been ascertained that he never slept without having posted sentries all around him . On the occasion of which the hunter was then telling me he said that . be had climbed up into a tree , a dam-palm , to view the herd from a safe position , hoping to find the bull by chance unguarded . It was noontide , and the veteran required his nap . The scene that followed was unique . The old tusker went quietly round from one to another of his followers and drove them out into the places they were to occupy , making them stand in a large circle , several yards from each other , with their heads outwards , so that they would be sure to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were evidently well tutored to their work , and understanding what they bad to do , quietly obeyed , and took up the posts assigned them. ; but one young male turned refractory and ran off . The old tusker ran after him , and heading him , pushed him hack , lashing him with his trunk till lie had got him into position again . No sooner , however , was he placed than he broke loose a second time , and was again pursued , but this time the punishment was increased by a sound prodding . After screaming with pain and trumpeting with rage , the unruly one was brought to obedience , and then a pretty scene took place . Two full-grown females ? we may suppose the mother and aunt or two sisters of the rebel ? went up to console and comfort Linn . They stroked him gently with their trunks , rubbed their heads against him , and evidently advised him to be a good boy and remain where he was . The veteran being confident that at last all was satisfactory , placed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circle , and standing , as elephants invariably do while sleeping , took his midday rest , and the hunter saw that any attempt to get at him on that occasion was , as usual , hopeless . This sagacious old animal managed to preserve his life to a very advanced age , but when infirm and feeble he was expelled by a young rival from the herd , and wandered off to Abyssinia , where was ultimately shot , Had the Nubians. possessed firearms at the period when he was in his prime , this would doubtless have been his fate many years previously .
