txt As our own richly endowed theatre on Central Park West nears completion , London theatrical enthusiasts are felicitating themselves on the clear prospect of a national theatre in the British capital . This has grown slowly , and not without opposition , some of it quite reasonable , out of the proposition to celebrate the three hundredth anniversary of SHAKESPEARE 'S death , In 1916 , by the erection , of a fitting memorial . After much heated disCussion , the original plan of a sculptured memorial at the head of Portland Place , Regent 's Park , has been abandoned , and an endowed playhouse settled upon . Its estimated first cost will be $2,500,000 , including $500,000 for the site , $500,000 foi the building , $250,000 for the stage and its equipment , and $1,250,000 for the endowment . It will be called the National Shakespeare Theatre , and be governed , probably under a royal charter , by five Governors appOinted by the Crown , six by universities , one by the Royal Academy , ? and one by the British Academy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Incredible as it may seem , one of the ex-officio Governors will be the- United States Ambassador . How such a body is to govern a playhouse , who can guess ? Under them will be a Director , Treasurer , and " Literary Manager , " and un , der'them , of course , the men who must do most of the arduous work of manag-. ** to , transform sqvs ' . ears three changes of bills every week , a.ticl a play by SHAKESPEARE must be performed at least once a week , and not fewer than twenty-five plays must be performed in a year . The problem such an institution must solve is how to get new plays in competition with the commercial theatre , which has made the possible profits of playwrights so enormous , and how to get and keep the services of good actors . The Comedie Francais &; and the endowed German theatres find this problem more serious year by year . One danger of a theatre endowed and governed as this new London institution will be is that the controlling powers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ educational . After all , the theatre IS a place of entertainment . Histrionism , too , rather than literature , must be its mainstay . The need of large , well-drilled , permanent companies of competent actors is admitted by all persons who still believe in the potency and artistic worth of the theatre . But good actors in these days are in great demand . One makes a company , a play , and a fortune for himself and histmanager . Still , the new London institution , like our own New Theatre , will command respectful attention , and its development will be watched with eager and sympathetic interest .
