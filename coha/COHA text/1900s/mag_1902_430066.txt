 | The subject of this sketch was an American : so is the writer , dwelling in the " land of the free " ? a land so free that we are not even burdened with the custom of cherishing the records of our ancestors , as are our cousins over the sea . When called upon to write of some person who flourished in the Colonial period or at the time of the Revolution , the American girl does not appear to advantage unless her subject is an eminent one . Yet many excuses may she rightly claim ; for , though people have now awakened to an appreciation of our noble Revolutionary history , and we are striving to collect and preserve the same , in many cases we are helpless . The following is some account of an early pioneer who lived not many miles from the present capital of North Carolina . Colonel John Hinton , of the parish of St. Margaret , county of Wake , province of North Carolina , was a Revolutionary soldier and statesman , whose military career began in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years of his life were devoted to the service of his country and State . Frequently his name appears in the public archives and high praise is there accorded him . He was the son of John Hinton , of Chowan precinct , who died about the year 1732 . The part of Chowan in which he lived is now Gates county . Tradition claims that John Hinton , the younger , was born in London , though it is now believed that he was a native of Chowan precinct , born at the Hinton homestead . It is generally accepted that the Hinton family came from London , though genealogists have not traced it further back than the settler in Chowan . There was a John Hinton who came to Jamestown in 1623 ; while a descendant of Sir Thomas Hinton , of Chilton Foliot , England , married into the Greaves family of Virginia . Between these , however , and the North Carolina Hintons there is no known connection . In Burke 's General Armory of Great Britain are described the coats-of-arms of no less than twelve families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In a work by Lawrence Archer , entitled Monumental Inscriptions of the British West Indies , is an illustration of the arms on the tomb of a member of the Hinton family of London , from which the North Carolina family is descended , and these arms exactly correspond with what are said to be those borne by the founder of the family in Chowan precinct . John Hinton , the elder , of Chowan , had four sons and seven daughters , as follows : John , Hardy , William , Malachi , Rachel , Mary , Sarah , Nancy , Charity , Rose , and Judith . About 1750 , John Hinton , the younger , removed to what was then Johnston county . Later , when Wake was erected , his lands fell within the boundaries of the new county . In 1768 , when Governor Tryon held a consultation at Hillsborough to consider what steps should be taken to circumvent the movements of the Regulators , John Hinton , then a Major of provincial troops in the county of Johnston , was one of the gentlemen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by act of assembly in 1770 ( act not to take effect till 1771 ) , Major Hinton became colonel of the colonial forces in the new county . When Governor Tryon raised the forces of the province in 1771 to march against the Regulators , there was much disaffection in Colonel Hinton 's county , yet the Colonel himself was a firm friend of the government and finally succeeded in raising his quota . Tryon 's military journal shows that Colonel Hinton and his men participated in all of the duties incident to the campaign , the colonel on one or more occasion acting as president of courts martial for the trial of delinquent soldiers in the army of which his detachment formed a part . He personally participated in the battle of Alamance , May 16 , 1771 , and his bravery on the occasion was afterwards referred to by Governor Caswell in a message to the legislature during the Revolution . Colonel Hinton selected as a site for his new home in the wilderness a piece of land six miles east of the present town of Raleigh . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built a log cabin . The entrance was in the upper portion of the dwelling , and was reached by means of a ladder , as was the case in many of the habitations of the early settlers . He had Indians for neighbors and wild beasts for nocturnal visitors . Of robust constitution , and possessing great bravery , he was capable of wielding the axe  | and paving the way for the more timid and indolent . Stories of his encounters with ferocious animals are still related . Upon one occasion , he sauntered forth with his gun and two dogs for a hunt . Weary and footsore , he sat down by a tree to rest and soon fell asleep . In the meanwhile his dogs had a desperate struggle for their lives , and for the protection of their master , with a panther . He was awakened by the fray and escaped uninjured . On another occasion he discovered a panther 's lair among some large rocks . Two cunning little cubs were snoozing peacefully away , ignorant of the close proximity of an intruder Struck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for domestication . Taking both in his arms , he had proceeded but a short distance when their mother , finding her babies gone , started after him with great fury . Seeing her in pursuit , Hinton put down one of the cubs , which she carried back to its den and then returned to renew the chase . Just as the hunter gained the top of his ladder the mother of his captive again came in sight , but too late . She was shot , and the cub he succeeded in taming . Colonel Hinton took up many thousands of acres of land by grant from Earl Granville . Grants were given for various tracts at different times . They followed the course of Neuse river , beginning some distance above Milburnie and extending far into Johnston county , a distance of many miles . In some places the property ran four miles both to the east and west of the river . One tract which is known as " The River Plantation , " taken in grant by him , is yet owned by a descendant of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this piece of land , the direct line of inheritance being sufficient . The Hintons , Hunters , and Lanes originally owned most of the county of Wake . The two families last named were allied with the Hintons by marriage . As civilization advanced , Colonel Hinton erected a residence , considered handsome in those primitive days ? a type of colonial architecture ? near his old log cabin . It was a frame building , and the bricks used in the foundation and chimneys were of a curious design ? perfectly square . This house long since ? " Has gone to decay , And a quiet now reigns all around . " Only a heap of brick remains to mark the spot where it stood . Many old homes built by Colonel Hinton 's sons and their children  | in Wake county are still in a fairly good state of preservation . Conspicuous among these are " The Oaks " and " Clay-Hill-on-theNeuse . " The latter , the home of Major John Hinton , Jr. , ( son of Colonel Hinton ) , was broken into both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the War between the States . A secret drawer in a desk was found and robbed of its treasure in each case . Colonel Hinton was among the first to offer his services to his country when the British yoke could no longer be borne . He was a delegate from Wake county when the Provincial Congress of North Carolina met at Hillsborough in August , 1775 . There preparations began for the conflict which was brewing . On the 9th of September , the assembly appointed officers for the minute men in the various counties . For Wake county the following officers were selected : John Hinton , colonel ; Theophilus Hunter , lieutenant-colonel ; John Hinton , Jr. , first major ; Thomas Hines , second major . Colonel Hinton also represented Wake county in the Provincial Congress at Halifax in April , 1776 , and was elected a member of the Committee of Safety for the Hillsborough district , of which Wake county was a part . On the 27th of February , 1776 , was fought the Battle of Moore 's Creek Bridge , after a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight saved the Southern colonies . Some two or three thousand loyalists , under the experienced leadership of General McDonald , were that day completely defeated , and many taken prisoners , on their way to join the British fleet at the mouth of the Cape Fear river . Colonel Hinton took an active part in this engagement ; and his body-servant , old Uncle Brisco , accompanied him through the campaign . This ancient family favorite lived as late as the middle of the nineteenth century . Nothing pleased the old darkey so much as for others to listen to his stories of the time when " me and marster was in de war . " His description of this particular battle was both graphic and amusing . After Colonel Hinton 's death , this old servant came into the possession of his youngest son , David Hinton . He had the honor of driving the first carriage ever brought into Wake county , as well as of hitching a horse to the last " gig " driven within its boundaries . The first time he drove his carriage to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stately dame , was greatly shocked to  | find the interior of the vehicle filled with fodder ! " Where do you expect me to sit , Brisco ? " she exclaimed . " Up here wid me , mistis , " was the confident reply . Colonel Hinton lived but a short while to enjoy the liberty he had fought for and aided in winning for the States . He passed away in the spring of 1784 . His remains were interred near his home in the family burying-ground . He married Grizelle Kim brough , who was born about 1720 . Eight children survived him , viz. : 1 . John Hinton , Jr. , a major in the Revolution and a representative from Wake county in the legislature both during and after the war . He married Ferebee Smith , daughter of the founder of Smithfield in Johnston county , and lived at " Clay-Hill-on-theNeuse . " Some of his descendants , bearing the name , removed to Georgia . Both Major Hinton and his wife are buried at " Clay Hill . " 2 . James Hinton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married Delilah Hunter , daughter of Colonel Theophilus Hunter , of " Hunter 's Lodge , " in Wake county . 3 . Sarah Hinton , who married Needham Bryan , Jr. , of Johnston county . 4 . Mary Hinton , who married Colonel Joel Lane , of " Bloomsbury , " in Wake county , on whose old plantation stands the present city of Raleigh . 5 . Alice Hinton , who married Captain John James , an officer in the North Carolina Continental Line . One of the children of this marriage was Hinton James , the first graduate of the University of North Carolina . 6 . Elizabeth Hinton , who married Thomas James . 7 . Kimbrough Hinton , who was married , but the name of whose wife is not known . His home was called " The Red House . " Most of his descendants removed west . 8 . David Hinton , of " The Oaks , " who married Jane Lewis , daughter of Major Howell Lewis , of " Elmwood , " in Granville county . The only son of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State Treasurer of North Carolina . All of the above children are mentioned in Colonel Hinton 's will , though his two youngest sons were minors at the time he made it . From this large family have sprung many descendants , but few of whom bear the surname of their brave ancestor .  | Though a striking figure in Wake county 's early history , and the commander of her military forces in the first part of the War for Independence , little is known of Colonel Hinton at the present time among the generality of people , even in the section which he aided in building up . To preserve , in some measure , the record of his services is the object of this sketch ; for , as has been said by a worthy North Carolinian : " If history immortalizes those who , with the cannon and the bayonet , through blood and carnage , establish a dynasty or found a state , surely something more than mere oblivion is due those who , forsaking all that is attractive to the civilized mind , lead a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , amid the dangers of the wilderness and under the war-whoop of the savage .
