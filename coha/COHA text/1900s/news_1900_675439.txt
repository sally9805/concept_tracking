txt " The Moses of America " is the title which many of his coreligionists had applied to Isaac Mayer Wise . For well nigh half a century he had been regarded as the leader of progressive Judaism in this country  --  a leader who , while fighting for what he conceived to be right with utter fearlessness and marvelous energy , yet worked also for unity and harmony . As one of his pupils said of him , " All that we now Lave of united Judaism in America is his . " Dr. Wise was born April 3 , 1819 , at Steingrub , a hamlet at the foot of the mountains of Bohemia , not far from the frontier of Saxony . He was the son of a teacher , and would sometimes , in after life , recount to his friends here the struggles which he went through in order to fit himself for his chosen career .

He also passed through the Jewish Theological Seminary at Prague . and soon after his graduation , in 1843 , became the rabbi of the small congregation at Radnitz , Bohemia . At that place he married Theresa Bloch of Granfenreid . While yet a student , Dr. Wise became imbued with the conviction that in order to put new life into Judaism , reform was necessary . On receiving his first charge he at once made his opinions known , and his teaching was regarded at the time as revolutionary , not only with regard to religious , but also political affairs . He seems , even before he began his pastoral work , to have formed a definite intention of making this country his future home .

The intention to emigrate to America became realized in 1846. on July 26 of which year he arrived in New York . His departure from Bohemia had been hastened by the effect of a sermon which he preached one Sabbath day . He took for his text the words , " Abraham bowed to the people of the land , " and slid in his address that not the will of . ) ne man , but of the people , should be the law . This sermon was heard by one of the secret service spies who were then numerous in Austrian territory , and on leaving the synagoe , Ake Rabbi Wise was placed under arrest . He was only detained for an hour , but he came to the conclusion that he would leave such a " land of bondage. " and seek a home and a field for work in the land of freedom . In those days all Europe was in a state of turmoil . and there seemed to be no future for a young man ? especially a young .

Dr. Max Lilienthal appointed the young rabbi as his representative at the dedication of synagogues at New Haven and Syracuse . While on his way to Syracuse Dr. Wise stopped at Albany to officiate there , and he made such ark impression that he was chosen as rabbi of the Beth-El Congregation . At that time Judaism in America was in a chaotic state . There were many congregations scattered over the land . Most of them were ultra orthodox . but some of the Jews were beginning to tire of the strict laws of the Talmud . Reform congregations had been formed in New York , italtimore. and Chicago , while a few rabbis were doing good work in educational matters . but were nut ye , prepared for radical reforms .

At Charleston he took part in a public debate between an orthodox and reform rabbi . On being tasked by the former whether he believed in the coming of a Messiah and the resurrection of the body , Dr. Wise ** answered : " No- the Talmud is no authority for me in the matter of doctrine " A ' report of this debate was published . and - Dr. - Wise was denounced as a heretic . - Onehis return to Albany a scene occurred which led to hie retirement from the pulpit of Beth-El Synagogue .

They also contributed:1n other ways to help him until the Anshe Emeth Congregation had become large enough to pay their rabbi a sufficient salary . Dr. Wise also began to write for publication , and contributed a number of articles to a Jewish newspaper . In 1S:33 Dr. Wise received a call from Bene Yeshurun Congregation , at Cincinnati .

When the storm of criticism broke over the head of the author he offered to release the Cincinnati congregation from its contract . The offer was , however , not accepted , and Dr. Wise was urged to go to Cincinnati as soon as possible . He arrived there on April 26. 1854 and had retained his position as rabbi of the Bene Yeshurun Congregation ever since . Dr. Wise made of Cincinnati the centre of the Jewish reform movement in this continent As soon as he took up his ministry there he began to realize the ideas conceived in Bohemia a. dozen years before . arts first important work was the foundation of a periodical , which should communicate those ideas far and wide , and in July , the first number of The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The American Israelite , ) was issued- The motto of this weekly paper was , and is .

This was Die Deborah , in German , with the motto . " Forward . My Soul . with Strength . " Both these publications soon attained large circulation , and the seeds of the reform movement were sown by them throughout the North American Continent . But Dr. Wise did not rest with expressing his opinions in print . He visited all the chief cities of the United States , from San Francisco to New York . advocating his views . His own congregation at Cincinnati encouraged him in every way to extend his influence .

At the present time over sixty rabbis have been graduated from this institution . The East , which was the seat of bitterest opposition to Dr. Wise and his plane , is the field of usefulness of many of them . ESTABLISHES A SYNOD .

He did the work of three ordinary men in spite of his great age . " Dr. Grcsstnan said that in his opinion Dr. Wise came as nest as any human being could to being a saint . He had all the love of a father for " his boys , " as he called the students at the college . " He was goodness personified to them . " said Dr. Grossman , and all that he did was done with the most exquisite tact . " I remember that one day an old Irishman came to the college and asked Dr. Wise if he had a worn-out coat to spare . Dr. Wise sent me up stairs for the overcoat that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then sent me out to get another for himself . " It was not men that he ever fought ; it was causes . He was uncompromising in his attitudes , but divine in his charity . With it all , he was not a rabid reformer . For instance , he fought Sunday services ; he did n't want to wipe out what was distinctively Jewish . He was imbued with American ideas . but he still remained a Jew . " No man can say that Dr. Wise ever took the slightest personal advantage of any one . His entire career was straight as an arrow . It has been said , and certain People have blamed him for it , that he used to influence the students at the college so that they adopted his opinions and did not think for themselves . " Nothing could be further from the truth . I can not remember a siagle instance of his atteeppting to influence us unduly . He told us. what his opinions were and what his attitude was with regard to any important question . Then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Rev.

He had all the energy and push that young communities require for the building up of institutions and the shaping of public opinion . While he was not , perhaps , a scholar in the highest sense of the word , his peculiar gifts made him one of the greatest powers . If not the greatest power , in American Judaism . " He worked for the union of congregations and the union of progressive rabbis , and especially he built for himself an enduring monument in the Hebrew Union College . He was a man who championed a cause with all the zeal and enthusiasm that makes for success . He naturally created enemies by his aggressiveness , but that very aggressiveness was the cause of his triumphs . He was a power in the pulpit .

He was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he used with sledge-hammer force , always with the view to carrying out his ideas . " The Rev. Dr. Gustav Gottheil , Rabbi Emeritus of Temple Emanu-El. said that the subject of Dr. Wise 's career and Influence was of such ' great importance that he could not do justice to it in an inter view . " I fully recognize , " said Dr. Gottheil. " the great importance of the leadership of Dr. Wise , and his immense service to the cause of progressive Judaism . I shall take an early occasion to write something upon the subject . "
