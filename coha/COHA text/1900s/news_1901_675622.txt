txt The following official announcement regarding the Queen 's health has been made : " The Queen has not lately been in her usual health , and is unable for the present to take her customary drives . " The Queen . during the past year , . has had a great strain upon her powers , which has rather told upon her nervous system . It has ' therefore been thought advisable by her Majesty 's physicians that her Majesty should be kept perfectly quiet in the house , and should abstain for the present from transacting business . " LONDON , Jan. ** Francis H. Laking , M. D. , Surgeon to Queen Victoria , has been called to Osborne to consult with Sir James Reid . her Majesty 's resident physI ! clan . Although it is fully understood that there ' is n ' , cause for alarm beyond what would naturally be felt at the indisposition of any one of the Queen 's age , the official announcement issued last evening has caused a shock to the country the effect of which it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedom from illness during the longest reign in English history has led her people to regard her almost as more than mortal . and the mere novelty of ' having to face the possibility of a regency alone suffices to create apprehension . It is necessary to go back to a date prior to 1820 for a similar situation . Since that time there has never been an interruption to the smooth working of the constitutional machine . No one , not even the Prince of Wales , can act for the Queen without the authority of Parliament ; and , as no steps have been taken to summon Parliament , it may be taken for granted that her Majesty 's physicians have only adopted measures of precaution , and that she Is still able to sign any absolutely* imperative documents , though relieved of the worries of routine affairs . The illness of Dowager Empress Frederick of Germany , the sudden death of her Majesty 's old friend . Lady Churchill , together with the deaths of the Duke of Saxe-Coburg last Summer and of Prince Christian Victor subsequently , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been great trials to the Queen , but , even within a week , she has received Lord Roberts and sent a message of condolence to the widow of Dr. Creighton , the Bishop of London . . It lit'uhdeistOod that the arrangements for the Queen 's visit to the South of Prance are proceeding on the lines originally laid down-4 " - , . and , . itAsAuitet likely. , **25;185;TOOLONG from work wilt enable her to undertake the journey earlier than was originally intended . All the morning papers comment upon the unlooked-for possibilities of the situation , but they do not regard it as alarming . The Daily News says : " We fear it can not be doubted that her Majest ? ' s health is precarious , but it seems impossible to believe that she should be ill . We must hope and trust that a short period of repose will restore her strength of body and mind . The fact that the Prince of Wales attended the banquet to Lord Roberts , given by the United Service Club , may serve to dispel an alarming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make any Illness the cause of anxiety ; but , among the penalties of a scrupulous adhesion to duty , is that of an exaggerated alarm at any intermission . ' The Daily Graphic , commenting upon the Queen 's " untiring self-sacrifice . says : We hope it is only a passing warning to her to spare herself in the future . " The Times , which takes a similar view , remarks that it ' is only since Tuesday that the Queen has not taken her drives , and points out - that to-day she attains an age one day greater than that of George 111. , thus having not only reigned , but also lived longer than any other British sovereign . Proceeding to dilate upon the immense changes and progress during the Queen 's reign , and upon the " unexampled Manner in which she has won her way into the affections of her people , " The Times says : " There ? can not be any doubt whatever that the oldest British sovereign is also the best beloved . " The Daily Telegraph , which comments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very solicitude of her people for the Queen 's welfare . " says : ' This gave a character to the news which we are glad to say the news does not bear and drew inferences not involved in the real facts of the case . " It is specially noteworthy , as The Times points out , that until Tuesday the Queen went out driving daily . Up to midnight no change had been made in any of the plans of the royal family . The chaplain of the Archbishop of Canterbury said the movements of the primate had not been affected by the state . of health of the Queen .
