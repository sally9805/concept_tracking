 | in establishing a scale of even a hundred dollars a day it would still be bound by its principles to spurn the relaxing comforts of prosperity and to nerve itself to a continuation of the struggle . Edward Boyce , as President of the Federation , addressed its annual Convention in 1902 as follows : There are only two classes of people in the world . One is composed of the men and women who produce all . The other is composed of men and women who produce nothing , but live in luxury upon the wealth produced by others . As we have no animosity toward any human being on earth , but earnestly desire the elevation of all to a higher standard of living , I beseech you to leave nothing undone to educate the members of this organization so that they can proceed upon intelligent lines to better their conditions of life and thus set an example to others . The time has arrived when this organization should array itself upon the side of the producers and should advise its members to take political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are destined to free the people from the grasp of the privileged classes . Every individual who labors , be that labor what it may , is entitled to the product of his labor , and it is your duty , if you are true to those you represent , to advise them to join hands with the thousands of intelligent men and women throughout the world who are battling for the abolition of the wage system and the emancipation of the wage-worker from the grasp of corporate oppression for the co operative brotherhood of man . After listening to this speech , the Convention made the following declara-tion We , the tenth annual Convention of the Western Federation of Miners , do declare for a policy of independent political action , and do advise and recommend the adoption of the platform of the Socialist Party of America by the locals of the Federation in conjunction with a vigorous policy of education along the lines of political economy . Thus , in the heart of the Rocky Mountains , in a region which had known but one generation of the modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a philosophy wrung by Karl Marx from the accumulated oppressions of centuries of European life . Thus did the American frontiersman develop in forty years into a cosmopolitan proletarian . There is usually one of two reasons for the presence of a large number of Socialists in any trade union . One is the influence of Europeans the other is a particularly spectacular triumph of the machine over the man , and a particularly cruel displacement of human beings by superhuman tools . The first of these reasons , the influence of Europeans , is illustrated in many cities by the brewery workers and by the bakers . The other , the encroachment of the machine , is illustrated by certain locals of cigar-makers and of machinists . The Western Federation of Miners , however , has not been devoured by the machine , and it does not contain more than a small percentage of Europeans . Whatever of lawlessness there has been in the history of the Western Federation has been American lawlessness . Whatever of radicalism there has been in that history has been radicalism cherished and propagated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " can not be loaded with the sins of the Western Federation and driven out into the desert of contemptuous indifference . The explanation of the Socialism of the Federation may possibly be that certain men of a socialistic temperament just happened to be prominent in the organizaticirf , and that they converted the other prominent members . So modest an explanation , however , does not comport with the dignity of the modern scientific sociology which can distinguish the chemical ingredients of all human actions , and therefore it becomes necessary to suggest another explanation which is of a bolder kind , and which really contains a great deal of truth . The Western mines are full of longlimbed , frank-eyed men who have adventured themselves far and wide upon the face of the earth . There are Eastern miners who were blacklisted after leading unsuccessful strikes . There are cowboys who tired of the trail . There are farmers who preferred prospecting to plowing . There are city men who burst the bars of their cages to breathe the open air of the West . These adventurous characters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the virgin , everlasting hills , where it would seem that at last all men would stand on the  | page deleted  | the coal mined by scab labor from the mines of Colorado and moved the trains which deported hundreds of striking miners from their homes and loved ones and deserted them on the plains of New Mexico ? Mr. Gompers says that when a wage reduction is proposed , it is better to resist and lose than not to resist at all . If Mr. Goinpers advocated the resistance of all organized labor , I would agree with him ; but when he advises the resistance of a part of organized labor while another part , by continuing their employment , furnish the employer with the weapon to defeat those who are engaged in the battle , then I claim that such a policy is not only inadequate , but that it is an injustice to those who are asked to take part in the conflict . Alienated from the American Federation of Labor , representatives of the Western Federation of Miners attended a convention in Chicago last year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor body called the Industrial Workers of the World . There are at least a billion industrial workers in the world to-day , if we allow five hundred million representatives to the " parasitic classes . " Of this billion the Industrial Workers of the World now has about one hundred thousand . The Western Federation of Miners furnishes two-fifths of the one hundred thousand . The rest is dispersed in small locals all over the country . There was something grotesquely grandiose , but also something profoundly stimulating to the imagination , in the plans laid at that first convention of the Industrial Workers of the World in a musty hall over a saloon on North Clark Street in Chicago . According to their constitution , the Industrial Workers of the World are divided into thirteen international departments ? the Department of Farming Industry , the Department of Foodstuffs Industry , the Department of Mining Industry ; etc . A large wheel , with divisions marked by spokes , shows the exact location of each human being . In each international department there are local unions . In case any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs support , the executive board of the department is authorized to call out all the other local unions . Similarly , in case any international department goes out on strike and needs support , the executive board of the whole organization may call out all the other international departments . Obviously , this is a provision by means of which the executive board of the whole organization may call a general and universal strike of all the Industrial Workers of the World . The American Federation of Labor brandishes no such weapon . The psychology of the Industrial Workers of the World is the psychology of the Western Federation of Miners . It is a psychology which leads to the adoption of the universal strike as the means of an industrial and political revolution . The internal policy of the Western Federation of Miners is consistent with its published principles . The most important part of this policy is an aversion to the signing of contracts with employers . A contract is regarded as a manacle . It binds one union when another union might need its help . Presumably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class of the United States with the whole employing class for the term of a year at a fixed scale of wages , the Western Federation of Miners would not seriously object . But in the absence of such a possibility it seems to the Federation that contracts interfere with the mobility and flexibility of the working class . In other words , the hostility of the Federation to the idea of a contract is in one aspect merely the reverse side of its attachment to the idea of the sympathetic strike . In consequence of not demanding a contract the Federation naturally does not demand a closed shop . As it does not ask the employer to bind himself by a contract to anything , it does not ask him to bind himself to the exclusive employment of union men . In three other respects besides its failure to demand a closed shop the Western Federation of Miners follows a policy which has often been admired by enemies of trade unions . The Western Federation has no apprentice system . It does not restrict output . And it discountenances jurisdictional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system ,  | page deleted  | tation on the nature of the " scab " was posted in the Cripple Creek district : WHAT IS A SCAB ? A scab is to his trade what a traitor is to his country , and though both may be useful in troublesome times , they are detested by all when peace returns . A scab is the last to contribute assistance when help is needed , and the first to grasp benefits he never labored to procure . He cares only for himself . He sees not beyond the extent of a day . For a monetary consideration he would betray his friends , family , and country . In short , he is a traitor on a small scale who first sells the workingman , and is himself afterwards sold in his turn by his employer , until at last he is despised by both and detested by all . The literary effect of this little tribute to the " hero " of the industrial struggle was heightened by the appended portraits of thirty different scabs , with the two postscripts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and , " Second edition . More coming . " On other occasions the verbal persuasion of non-union miners has been even more direct . For instance : TO ALL NON-UNION MINERS OF THE CRIPPLE CREEK DISTRICT You have no doubt read and thought about our circular which was posted throughout this district pretty thoroughly about five weeks ago . This notice is issued for the purpose of reminding you that the 15th of September is near at hand , that the time of grace has about expired . You have had two pay-days in which to decide whether you are for us or against us . There is no middle ground . If you are working in or around the mines , this means you . Now do not throw this to one side and say , " Only another bluff . " If you are from Missouri , come into some of the unions of the Western Federation and we will show you that we are trying to help you as well as ourselves , and as the 15th is only about six days away , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EXECUTIVE BOARD WESTERN FEDERATION . In addition to the coercion of individual non-unionists , there have been a few occasions on which armed bodies of union men have stormed mining property and captured it . One such occasion was in 1899 in the Coeur d'Alenes . Another was in 1901 in Telluride . These transactions did not take place , however , in Suffolk , England . They took place in the Rocky Mountain district of the United States . They took place in a region in which even in the complete absence of trade union disputes the law has sometimes seemed to be mainly an incidental argument which a man might use in a personal denunciation of his antagonists . The readers of The Outlook are familiar with the quarrels between the sheepmen and the cattlemen on the ranges of the Western country . Those quarrels have had nothing to do with trade unionism . They have been purely a matter of business . Yet they have resulted in many murders ; and thugs have been hired by one side of the dispute to assassinate employees of the other side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass an eight-hour law after being ordered to do so by an amendment to the State Constitution was one of the most scandalous triumphs ever won by a lobby . And even now , when the law has at last been placed on the statute-books after a series of bloody strikes , a Labor Commissioner appointed by a mine-owning Governor has been obliged to admit that it is effective only in those places where union labor is strong enough to enforce its operation . Look on two pictures : First . The 1894 Cripple Creek strike is over . Adjutant-General Tarsney is attorney for some of the miners . He is staying at a hotel in Colorado Springs , which is the city of the millionaires of the mountains . At midnight fifteen masked men enter the hotel . They lay hands upon Tarsney . They take him to a desolate spot five miles from the city . There they strip him , tar him , feather him , and leave him . He gropes his tortured way through a dark and rough country till he finds a farm-house . Second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Western Federation of Miners has opened a co-operative store . This store is to supply the necessities of the members of the union . On the 20th of August a mob collects . There are five hundred men in it . Many of these men are industrious , thrifty , well-known citizens . They gather in front of the miners ' store . They smash the windows . ' They break down the front door . They enter the interior . They destroy the merchandise on the  | page deleted  | of the Federation constitute an inner circle " devoted to outrage and assassination and responsible for such spectacular and horrible acts of violence as the attempt at train-wrecking on the Florence and Cripple Creek Railroad , the fatal explosion in the Vindicator mine , the fatal accident in the Independence mine , the fatal explosion in the Independence railroad station , and the assassination of former Governor Steunenberg , of Idaho . These acts are on an entirely different plane from ordinary acts of violence , and they should be considered separately . No one can prove that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one so far has been able to prove that it did . The judicial machinery of the State of Colorado has been in the hands of the enemies of the Federation . Many " confessions " have been secured . Many announcements have been made to the effect that the leaders of the Federation would soon be hanged . Yet not a single conviction has been recorded . In fact , no approach has been made to a conviction . In every case the prosecution has collapsed so instantaneously and so ignominiously that the trial has seemed to be instituted more for the purpose of humiliating the defendants than of convicting them . The news of an indictment makes the front page of the newspapers . The news of an acquittal makes the seventh . Each of the outrages above mentioned was repudiated vehemently by the Federation . In most cases , if not in all , it offered a large reward for the apprehension of the guilty parties . The least farcical of all the trials in connection with these outrages was that which followed the attempt at trainwrecking on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " confession " by a man named McKinney . McKinney said he had committed the deed in company with certain unionists . On cross-examination he was forced to admit that he was a detective in the employ of agents of the MineOwners ' Association . This does not mean that the mine-owners themselves were cognizant of his employment . On further cross-examination McKinney was forced further to admit that he had been ordered to secure the wrecking of a train for the purpose of discrediting the Federation . The cases against the men accused by McKinney were at once dismissed . But McKinney himself was never tried . S. D. Crump , attorney for the Mine-Owners ' Association , went on his bond . McKinney was the kind of man who came to the front very frequently during the Colorado troubles . Many such ruffians joined the militia in hope of adventure and of loot . Many of them have since been sent to jail on charges rang- ' ing from larceny to murder . The responsibility for some of the outrages under consideration may rest upon the shoulders of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no responsibility at all . The horrible massacre in the Independence mine had every appearance of an accident . Many such accidents have happened in the mines of the West . In this particular case the mine was closely guarded , day and night , to prevent the approach of union men , and a report made by a commission appointed by the State Superintendent of Mines showed that the machinery which gave way was in an extremely defective condition : At the same time it would be absurd to say that there is not a possibility that in certain cases the responsibility may rest upon profligate and abandoned members of the Western Federation . There are such men in the mines of the West , and they are accustomed to deeds of violence in personal disputes , in business disputes , and in trade union disputes . All that can be said with certainty is that there as as yet been no proof . To summarize : The Western Federation of Miners gets its tone from adventurous nativeborn Americans suddenly thrown from the position of frontiersmen into the position of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members of the Western Federation , have used their guns in trade union controversies is indubitable . That the Western Federation , however , is an organized criminal clique , and that it accentuates and stimulates the gun-playing proclivities  | page deleted
