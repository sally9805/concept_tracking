I HAVE often been asked , Was it not wonderful to you when you first saw the lofty edifices of great cities , the locomotive , the steam-engine , and the like ? Yes , it was en , in a way . Yet it is not mere immensity of structure which appears almost supernatural to the savage and overwhelms him . One reason for this may be that the natural features of our country , the gigantic granite cliffs and mountains , the wonderful walls and towers of the Bad Lands , are much grander to our minds , coupled with the idea of the Great Mystery behind them all . Then , also , there are many painstaking animals which build so wonderfully well and artistically ! Some of them are much smaller than man ; for instance , the ant , the spider , the swallow , the beaver , muskrat , and others . Some dam and bridge large streams , and others suspend their homes in the air . To our simple minds the ability shown by these little creatures appears even more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In matters of observation I was as keen SIC a Rocky Mountain sheep , and my mind was as sensitive to impressions as the film of the camera . I had an enthusiastic love for scenic beauty . I still care little about written poetry , but the poet could scarcely enjoy more than I have always done the poetry of nature . So far as the natural philosophy of the red man is concerned , 1 was well trained from childhood . But I was bewildered by the scientific , economic , social , and political systems of civilization and their practical application ? the sanitation and government of great cities , their food-supply , the utilization of time and space , monetary or financial systems , and , above all of these , the phase of civilization which at first overwhelmed me most was the commerce of the paleface . To the wild Indian , his worldly occupation is a sort of play . The thing which above all else occupies his mind is the Great Mystery . Him he never forgets . In civilization , as it appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Can I make anything on it ? " seemed to be the " Great Mystery " of the white people . When I first saw the inside of a house , it set me thinking : " Who made this house ? Was it the Great Mystery ? " ( for my mind was trained in that manner of thinking ) . A powerful curiosity stirred in me ? an almost irresistible desire to know just how it was done . When my father brought Inc home to Dakota Territory from the wilds of Manitoba , where I had been for ten years living in exile , I was about fifteen years old , and in my own estimation already a warrior . He began to explain to me the " white man 's way , " and found me at first reluctant to listen . " You must not fear to work with your hands , " said my father , " but if you are able to think strongly and well , that will be a quiver full of arrows for you , my son . That is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to school . Those who study best and longest need not work with their hands after that , for they can work with their minds . " I had never yet shrunk from any undertaking , for that was one of the things that I was warned against by my good grandmother as early as I could remember . " Never give up a chase , " she would say to me ; " never retreat from any good cause on account of danger or hardship . " Already my long glossy hair had fallen under the big scissors , and my head felt cold and unprotected . I was very much in the position of the boy who is coaxed to deep water and let loose . I had to swim , and that was the end of it . I tried it , and all has turned out well , although there have been some strong currents to carry me down the stream , and at times it has taxed all my moral and physical muscle to keep afloat . " You may plough the five acres next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I want to see if you can make a straight furrow as well as a straight shot with the bow and arrow . " I am sorry to admit that it was poorly done . My father decided that I had no aptitude for following this particular trail . " You must go away to school , " he advised me . " You will learn a great deal in two or three years . Zitkadawashta , or Good Bird ( Dr. Alfred L. Riggs ) , has a good school , where he gathers many young men to teach them in their own tongue and in the English . Above all , he tries to establish them in a true and godly life . " I had already attended for a few months the mission day-school near our home , which was taught by Mr. Philander A. Van Nice , brother-in-law to Dr. Williamson . The latter was our missionary , through whose faithful Christian work my father had become a Christian , and whose admonishment in regard to my future possibilities assisted me throughout my student life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the absurdity of having to repeat apparently meaningless words and syllables , but at last I concluded that it must have some use which I had not discovered . I learned to read a little in Dakota and English , but I absorbed very little of the " white mar 's way . " It may have appeared to my father that I was not receiving his advice very cordially , for he now changed his mode of argument and appealed to the strongest . impulses aroused by my earlier training . " I have no doubt , " he began , " that my brother , your uncle , has brought you up with the knowledge and traditions of our tribe , especially those of our immediate band , There is no better hand of the Sioux nation in bravery and self-control . Our young men are wont to dare anything . When you leave my log cabin to go away to school , you may consider , yourself on the war-path . You will be seeking eagle feathers , my son . If you should not return , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started in here with some of my people to become farmers and citizens like the white men . This is our : chool ? ours , the old men 's ! I shall stick to it . I shall not go back to the reservation . I want all my sons to follow the trail which I am trying to make for you , " In a few days a neighbor of ours was on the way to Santee agency , the site of Dr. Riggs 's school , and my father engaged a ride for me in his wagon . But when we got to Sioux Fails , which was then only two stores , Peter found many tracks of otter , beaver , and mink up and down the Big Sioux river . This was a temptation no Indian trapper could resist . " T am sorry , " he said to me , " but I must stop here . " 1 thought the matter over carefully , and finally said to him : " Tell my father that I shall not return until I finish my war-path @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I took my blue blanket and extra pair of moccasins and started the next morning early from Sioux Falls . As I ascended the brow of the hill where the main part of the city is now , the sounds of the waterfall seemed to me like human cheers and war-whoops for my lonely warpath on that September morning over the sea of prairie-land . As I crossed the loop of the Big Sioux , a powerful temptation seized me to flee back at once to Canada , there to regain my freedom and wild life . But I had sent word to my father that this war-path must be completed , and I also remembered how he had said that if I did not return he would shed proud tears . I walked the remaining 110 miles to Santee in three days . On the last day I met Dr. Riggs , whom I did not then know . I spent two years with this remarkable and godly man . Next to my own father , who in his peculiar philosophy gave me good guidance , this man has done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to grasp the principles of true civilization . T-Te also strengthened and developed in me that native strong ambition to win out by sticking to what I might undertake . Associated with him was another man who also influenced me powerfully toward honesty and right living . This was the Rev. Dr. John P. Williamson , the veteran and pioneer missionary among the Sioux . To my mind , as soon as I began to think of these matters , there seemed to be much inconsistency in the dealings of the government with the Indians , and I could not comprehend how a great government should be dishonest , when its religion was so strongly against deceit and selfishness . It also occurred to me that the people who are favored most in this world 's goods are the most ungodly kind . All these matters were confusing to me at that time . Yet I still maintained that I must finish my war-path . My father wrote to me in the Dakota language for my encouragement . Zitkadawashta had told him that I was not afraid of books or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " My son , " he wrote , " I believe that an Indian can learn all that is in the books of the white man , so that he may be equal to them in the ways of the mind . " My father was very advanced in his views for a full-blooded Indian of that day , and had set the example to his fellow tribesmen in taking a homestead under the United States homestead laws . Finally Zitkadawashta selected two of the boys to send away to higher schools among the white people . Smith Robinson and myself were the ones chosen . On the eve of my departure I received word from Flandreau that my father was dead , after only two days ' illness . he was still in the prime of life and tireless in all his work . It was a severe shock to me , but I felt that I must carry out his wishes . It was clear that he who had sought me out among the wild tribes of the Northwest and set my feet in the white man 's road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home , but in September , 1876 , I started from Santee for Beloit College , Wisconsin , where I was to begin my serious studies . At Yankton city I entered the cars for the first time in my life . I remember I made a careful inspection of the locomotive , and my interest in its mechanism was greatly intensified when the whole thing was in motion . Every hour brought me new thoughts and new discoveries . I never have passed such a day , before or since . Visions came and went like the telegraphpoles as we sped by . More and more we were moving upon regions apparently too small for the inhabitants . Towns and villages grew larger and nearer together , and at last we reached a city of some little size . The streets were crowded . Everybody seemed to me to be in the greatest possible hurry . I was struck with the splendor of the shops and the brilliant show-windows , but the alacrity with which everything was done impressed me most . As I approached the door of the college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A gray-haired and serious-looking gentleman appeared at the door . This was President Chapin , who received me kindly . He spoke to me freely , but I was scarcely able to answer him , owing to my diffidence and imperfect knowledge of English . I was now a stranger in a strange country , and deep in a strange life from which I could not retreat . I was like a deaf-mute , with eyes continually on the alert for the expression of faces , and to find them in general friendly toward me was somewhat reassuring . Yet when I was alone in ray room at last and all was still , I fancy that no prisoner in the penitentiary can have known a more nerve-trying moment . The scenes of my deliciously free and happy life in a vast wild region unfolded before my eyes , contrasted with the thought that I was now to live within limits and under rules absolutely foreign to me . More than this , I was still in the dark as to the outcome of it all . I soon recovered my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every possible way . The more I got , the larger my capacity grew , and my appetite increased in proportion . I discovered that my anticipations of this new life were nearly all wrong . I was suddenly confronted with matters entirely foreign to my experience , which I must develop and solve by mental gymnastics . If a man had come and told me to swim a lake , or run with a message through an unknown country , I should have had some idea of the task . But this new conception of each word as having an office and a place and a specific name , and standing in relation to other words like the bricks and mortar in a house , was almost beyond my grasp . As for history and geography , they were legends and traditions to me , and I was soon able to appreciate the pure logic of mathematics . I found my greatest difficulty at this period in the study of words . At Beloit I spent three years of student life . At the end of this time I fully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view of the future of our race ? that we must adopt the ways of the white man . In some matters I was the infant of the college , but in athletics I did my full share . Other Sioux Indians were sent to Beloit Preparatory School , and as I thought it best , in order to perfect myself in English , not to hear my own tongue at all , I preferred to go where there were none to speak it . I was accordingly sent by Dr. Riggs to Knox College , Illinois , from which he himself had graduated . Knox College is a coeducational institution . It was here that I first had to do with the paleface maidens . I must candidly confess that while I owe much to college boys in my association with them as fellow students , I owe infinitely more to the college girls . It was here that I first began to look forward intelligently , and finally settled in my own mind that I must become a physician some day . I had seen more than six years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before I turned my footsteps toward New England . During all this time my ambitions rose higher and higher . On one of my vacations at home in Dakota I received a letter from Dr. Riggs , who had been thus far my best friend , suggesting that I should take advantage of the Indian scholarship at Dartmouth College ? a scholarship established when the college was founded as a school for Indians . This was in line with my highest aspirations , and yet I hesitated . I dreaded to cut myself off from my people , and in my heart I knew that if I did go , I should not return until I had accomplished my purpose . It was a critical moment in my life , but the decision could be only one way . I taught the little day-school at my home through the fall term , and in : renuary , 1882 , T started for Boston and Dartmouth . Up to this time I had very little practical knowledge of the world , and in my inexperience I was still susceptible to the adventurous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meanings . Therefore , while I was somewhat prepared , I was not yet conscious of the seriousness and terrific force of modern civilization . It was a crisp winter morning when the train nulled into Chicago . I had in mind the Fort Dearborn incident , and the struggles of the great Black Hawk upon that very ground . It seemed to me as if we were being drawn into the deep gulches of the Bad Lands as we entered the city . I realized vividly at that moment that the day of the Indian had passed forever . I was met at the station by friends , who took me to walk upon some of the main streets . I saw a perfect stream of humanity rushing madly along . I was surprised to notice that the faces of the people were not happy at all . They wore an intensely serious look that to me was appalling . I was cautioned against trusting everybody , and told that I must look out for pickpockets . Evidently there were some disadvantages connected with this mighty civilization , for we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It seemed to me that the most dignified men on the streets were the policemen , in their long blue coats with brass buttons . They were such a remarkable set of men physically that this of itself was enough to catch my eye . When we left Albany I found that we were in country the like of which , I thought , I would have given much to hunt over before it was stripped of its primeval forests and while deer and bears roamed over it undisturbed . I looked with delight upon mountains and valleys , and even the hamlets perched upon the shelves of the high hills . The sight of these scattered farms and little villages assured me of the presence of an earnest and persistent people . Even the half-deserted New England village , the ruined mill , had an air of saying : " I have done what I could for the progress of civilization . Now I can rest . " And all the mountains seemed to say , Amen . deleted material firmed when , that same evening , after supper , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and as I was not familiar with all the men , I held up the Professor of Philosophy , taking him for one of the Sophomores ! This of course gave opportunity to the reporters for the Boston dailies to enlarge upon the incident . I was a sort of prodigal son of old Dartmouth , and nothing could have exceeded the heartiness of my welcome . The New England Indian for whom it was founded had departed well-nigh a century earlier ; and now a full-blooded Sioux , like a wild fox , had found his way into this splendid seat of learning ! After the first excitement and novelty had worn away , I began to take , as it were , a sort of inventory of the opportunities which my wanderings had thus far brought me . By the president and faculty I was treated with the greatest kindness , and often encouraged to ask questions and express my own ideas . My uncle 's observations in natural history ? for which he had a positive genius , ? the Indian standpoint in sociology and political economy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class - room . This became so well understood by my classmates that some who had failed to prepare their recitations would induce me to take up the time by advancing some native theory or first-hand observation upon the subject in hand . When I had sufficiently mastered the English language , I became intensely interested in literature . Here it was that civilization began to loom up before me colossal in its greatness , when the truth first dawned upon me that nations , tongues , and civilizations , as well as individuals , have lived and died . There were two men of the past who impressed me very much ? my countryman who matriculated there a century before me , and the great Daniel Webster , who came to Dartmouth as impecunious as T was . The Indians have gone forever ? no memorial of them left except the Old Pine-Tree , where it was supposed that they met for the last time to smoke the pipe of peace . The college was kind enough to keep the old tree as a relic up to my day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pipe . During my vacations I went to Boston sometimes , sometimes to the mountains and the seashore . My visits to Boston were always made worth while by some new discovery ? some art or science of civilization brought freshly to my notice . Aside from the unique charm of old Boston , the park system , the public flower-gardens , the arboretum , the reservoirs , ? each of these was a school in itself to me . Afy first glimpse of the ocean was an event . I looked in amazement upon the vast assemblage of vessels of all sorts and sizes . I had never even imagined the like , and it now appeared that the white man moved with as much freedom upon the water as upon dry land . The commerce of the ocean struck me as one of the most remarkable features of civilization . I shall never forget my first night at the theatre . I was amazed by the seriousness of the actors , whose personality appeared to be entirely swallowed up in their parts , and the behavior of the audience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those whom I had met in the churches . Here the people seemed to roe to take delight in tragedy and even in crime , indifferent to the moral significance of the imaginary events which took such strong hold upon their emotions . At the seaside hotels I met society people ? people of an entirely different sort from those whom I had hitherto taken as American types . I was particularly struck with the audacity and forwardness of the women . At the summer resorts the women seemed to lead their husbands or to he independent of them . Among our people the man always leads . I graduated at Dartmouth with the class of ' S7 , and immediately afterward spent three years at Boston University . where I took the degree of Doctor of Medicine . Having passed in all nine years in New England , I believe I really understand and appreciate in some measure the solidity and manliness of the New England character . I have never hesitated to compare and criticise , but there has been no question in my mind for many years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantages of a civilized life over our earlier and primitive existence .
