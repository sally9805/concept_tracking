txt A Work for Young Women . St Michael 's Home at Mamaroneck , in Westchester County , is a most valuable work for girls and young women , under the charge of the Sisters of St. John the Baptist . Dependent upon voluntary contributions almost entirely , the Sisters have felt , as many others have , the effect of present conditions in financial matters . The home has under training and care some sixty girls constantly . Just now aid is specially needed , and this appeal is to ask for it , to meet the cost of the coal supply for the current year . Something over $1,000 is needed . Will those who take interest in a work that fits girls and young women for honorable and useful lives find here an opportunity to give expression to their interest by sending a contribution , large or small , to the Sister Superior , St. Michael 's Home , Mamaroneck , N. Y. ? The Sisters will acknowledge all such subscriptions thankfully .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
