txt IO SMALL CULTURE . further improvement in the rank and file of some of the breeds , if indeed not in all of them . Pig breeding will pay any time , if care and skill are employed in mating and selection . In most localities good boars are available , and , if not , good ones can be bought at prices which need not be called unreasonable , and it is easy to grade up the quality by using only the best of both sexes for breeding purposes . This in fact has been so generally done in a greater or less degree , that good sorts are to be found in every parish . The man who breeds pigs is well advised to discard inferior specimens , and he who fattens them to do the same . Judgment will commonly include all the difference that lies between success and failure , between profit and loss , either in breeding or fattening , and judgment is a quality of the mind which , unlike general information as to management , can not well be supplied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there is now less trouble on this score than there formerly was , simply because good pigs are to be found almost everywhere , or not far away , and almost every man in the country has , to say the least , a fairly good eye for a pig ; and , on the score of experience ( if he has had any worth the name in the management of swine ) , he knows well enough that well-bred animals make a better return than ill-bred ones on the outlay in food . MEANS OF RAISING THE NECESSARY CAPITAL . In a period when pigs are cheap and likely to remain so the necessary capital is within the capacity of all steady and thrifty working men . To save up the price of a store pig in pennies and sixpences is a process of briefer duration than it used to be , for two among other reasons , viz. , the working classes can live cheaper now than ever before , and pigs cost less money than they formerly did . There is , in fact , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost every working man who has a garden in PIG-KEEPING . P which he can grow different sorts of pig food ? potatoes , cabbages , and so on ? should not , if he wishes it , be able to supply himself with a young pig , to grow first and fatten afterwards . It may be observed that a silver lining to the prevailing cloud of agricultural depression is to be found in the fact that the workman 's position now , whatever may be that of the farmer or the landowner , compares favourably with that of his forefathers for many generations , and he has less difficulty than they had in raising the necessary capital for pig farming on a small scale , or for anything else . We are bound to declare our conviction that his inability to raise the price of a pig in these times must be looked for in some fault of conduct belonging to himself , or in some member or members of his family . The widespread demand which exists for allotments of land presupposes a widespread ability to raise a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instances are to be found throughout the country in which working men have been able to secure and utilise allotments of land for gardening purposes , and not a few in which the . proverbial " three acres and a cow " have been obtained . To every other man who stands in need of these supplementary means of income and of living , it is pertinent to say : " Go thou and do likewise . " . And by way of incitement it may be remarked that " where there 's a will there 's a way ! In some districts are to be found " pig clubs , " by means of which the necessary capital has been accumulated in small and regular payments which have entailed no sacrifice worth speaking of , and which have brought their own reward ere long . Men of means and standing ? clergymen and others ? in many country parishes , have interested themselves and taken a leading part in this sort of thing , thereby encouraging care and thrift , and inducing the parishioners to become " clubable " ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men should save . SMALL CULTURE . rather than borrow , the money to buy a pig with , is a most desirable course to pursue . The threepences and sixpences that are spent so freely on pints and quarts of ale in village inns would , if saved instead , pay for a pig in a time , the brevity of which , if pointed out , would surprise the men who spent them . The best way , then , of raising the capital is to save it ? in a club , or a savings ' bank , or in an old stocking , or in anything else ? but in any case to save it . EDITORIAL NOTES . THE small holder will regard the pig from several points of view . The man with only a cottage and small garden stands in a different position from one who has an acre allotment or perhaps a larger holding . The former has comparatively little offal to use up , and the garden gives only a moderate- supply of green food , for the garden ground is best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ease a considerable " portion of the food has to be bought . It is generally more profitable for him to keep one or two pigs to fatten . They need not necessarily be of the same age , but a younger one may be kept to take the place of the older when that is killed . If he can obtain offal from other houses near , such as waste from gardens or hotels which he can fetch in a hand barrow , he can keep a larger number , or will have to buy a smaller quantity of other foods . FOR LARGER HOLDERS . The holder of a larger extent of land can take up pig keeping more extensively , and may breed or feed as he finds it most profitable . Should he have land enough to produce a considerable quantity of green food he may find breeding pay him best , and he need not fatten at all . Green food // and coarse offals are best suited to breeding and the production of store pigs . In this case comparatively little expensive corn or meal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the produce of the land . The young pigs may generally be sold at prices which give a substantial profit . This system answers well where the sow has a good run , as was advised in the earlier pages . Sows require exercise , and " green meat " suits the animal , which , in a state of nature , subsists mainly on a vegetable diet . GREEN CROPS FOR FODDER . Far too little use is made of green crops in pig-keeping in Britain . Clover is never more profitably consumed than by pigs . It is customary to give it mainly to other farm animals , but it is well suited to be grazed by-pigs . A small piece sown clown in a crop in the previous year will produce rich succulent food from May until October . The pigs may be penned on it , giving them fresh portions occasionally , during which the land will be richly manured , and well dunged for a vegetable crop such as potatoes : there is in fact no better preparation for such crops . Tares are also very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be cleared off in time to get in a crop of winter grass . A grass paddock or orchard is a constant source of food , and the manuring is beneficial to fruit trees : the trees affording agreeable shade for the pigs in hot weather . Cabbages are excellent food for pigs , and drumheads supply a great bulk of valuable food , which is particularly useful during the autumn months up to Christmas . After Christmas drumhead savoys are very useful . In seasons when vegetables are in short supply , savoys often fetch high prices , when they would be more profitable if sold ; but they are well worth growing for pigs alone . The fact that they are grown as vegetables does not necessarily imply that they are expensive to produce . In fact . they are not // expensive . The plants may be raised at trivial cost in a small seed bed , when there is no need to purchase young plants . A lucerne plot may be kept down for years , and gives the biggest return of any crop . ROOT CROPS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ February to May , when grass and clover will again be available . Mangels are not really ripened until spring , and when unripe are somewhat liable to upset pigs , and at no time is it desirable to give too many . Other succulent food may be given as freely as the pigs will eat it . Carrots and parsnips are good food through autumn and winter . Potatoes have a high feeding value , but as they consist mainly of starch they should be given in conjunction with less starchy foods such as bran , skim milk , or a very little bean meal . Any of the vegetables mentioned produce a considerable amount of waste which is not suitable for culinary purposes , so this can be utilised by pigs , where it would otherwise be wasted . CONCENTRATED FOODS . Barley meal is the typical food for fattening pigs , and is especially valuable in conjunction with milk . It is better for being soaked for some time before feeding . Lawes found that 5-lb. of good barley meal , fed under favourable conditions , gave 1-lb. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best food for very young pigs , especially for a short time before weaning , and also for a time after when they receive skim milk . Bran is more suitable for sows , as it is particularly helpful in the production of milk . Many young pigs are injured by giving them too strong food from five to ten weeks old . Pig keepers do not sufficiently recognise this . This rarely occurs unless pigs are receiving milk . When they are suckling they should have no additional milk unless the other food given them // is starchy , such as barley meal . If they are given bran or pollards whilst suckling , and receive skim milk also , the blood gets too strong , causing a form of apoplexy , or paralysis , from which they rapidly die . The pigs become listless , lie quietly in the sty , and slumber into death . When one pig in a litter is taken this way the milk should be stopped , the pigs be bled , or a mild aperient , such as a tea-spoonful of Epsom Salts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but their blood becomes so unhealthy from over-feeding that they are rendered highly susceptible to colds , pneumonia , or rheumatism . Very often they get skin eruptions , or they become pot-bellied . Whatever form the ailment shows itself in , the pigs become stunted , and the profit of keeping them is lost . Never buy pot-bellied pigs , or those which have skin eruptions . Castrate the pigs at from six to eight weeks . They will do best if cut a week or so before they are weaned . The warning given against skim milk must only be regarded in cases where the other food is of too nitrogenous nature , and to very young pigs . The best pork is obtained from a dietary in which milk forms a portion ; mixed with barley meal it is the cheapest and best food . Whey , which contains little nitrogenous matter , is more suitable than skim milk for little pigs . Maize is a cheap food and suitable to be fed with milk , or to older pigs receiving clover , grass , lucerne , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AND DUNG . Cleanliness is one of the chief considerations in pigkeeping , especially so with young pigs . A dry sty , with warm lair , freedom from draught , but with proper ventilation , has been recommended . The possibility of keeping pigs without litter has also been explained . The small holder may , however , desire to regard his pig as the source of manure for his land . Provided litter can be cheaply // obtained , there is no more economical method of securing the manure . When there is no litter the bulk of manure made is very small : of course it is concentrated , but bulk is often desirable as it tends to improve the working of the land . Many pie keepers are in the position to secure at small cost a considerable quantity of leaves in autumn , of bracken , heather , rushes , peat , ditch trimmings or other material suitable for litter and useful as manure , even though they may not have much straw at command . The additional warmth and comfort thus secured is of value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In using litter , however , care should be taken so that it is employed in a manner that will secure a clean bed for the little pigs . It is probable that the mis-use of litter , with consequent foulness , is one of the chief reasons why many have favoured the non-litter system : for they have kept their pigs in a healthier condition than when they used litter . Damp beds are as prejudicial to little pigs as to human beings , while filth adds to the injury . If the pig gets a fair chance to lie clean and dry it is sure to avail itself of it . In cramped styes they have no option and are bound to be dirty if the owner has not the perseverance to keep them constantly cleaned out . Wood ashes , cinders or coal , or failing these , an occasional spadeful of soil should be given to the pigs , particularly when they are kept in enclosed quarters . Without these the pigs suffer from undue acidity in the stomach , and do not thrive as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually poisonous to pigs , and should never be given . SMALL CULTURE SINGLE COW-KEEPING &; HIRING . By JAMES LONG . THE subject of this article is one of material interest to those who possess , or can obtain , facilities for keeping a cow . It is possible for a cow to return in less than two years as much as in many cases a labourer receives in the form of wages in a year , and it is invariably true that where a cow is kept , under normal conditions , her value in assist-ing to feed a family is very great indeed . Her produce may be sold , it is true , either in the form of milk , cream , butter , or cheese , or as a live calf fed upon the milk she yields ? or partly in one direction and partly in another ; but all things considered it would be difficult to show that a working man 's family , obtaining little meat , is benefited to a greater extent where a cow is kept and the new milk sold , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ re-tained and consumed . In many cases the largest pecuniary return is obtainable by the sale of the new milk , and it will be held by some philanthropic persons that where a labour-ing man can sell milk at threepence or fourpence a quart , he will be wise to do so , and to purchase with the money realised such foods and other requisites as he most needs . But it would be found , on examination , that the money was not , under these conditions , usually laid out to the best advantage , and that one of the chief objects of keeping a cow ? the supply of a liberal quantity of a perfect form of food to the family ? was altogether ignored . // KEEPING A SINGLE COW . Let us first see how far a labourer , or small rural householder , can benefit by keeping a cow , which we must assume that he has been able to obtain and for which he is able to provide . There are , however , cows of vastly different values , as there is land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an average shorthorn dairy cow , worth Zi8 in the market , and milking under fair conditions at the rate of 550 gallons per annum . She might yield more by high feeding and abundant pasture , but her owner has not the means to give her all that might be provided . She calves , like the majority of other cows , in the early spring , and her calf is sold at a fortnight old at about thirty shillings . We must next assume that she is kept on two-and-a-half acres of land . In some cases three or even three-and-a-half acres would he necessary , but on the other hand one-and-a-half to two acres would suffice on rich land cultivated as a skilful farmer with ample means at his command can cultivate . One acre is grazed , another is set apart for mowing , and the odd half-acre is dug and planted for succulent crops , such as mangels , cabbage and swedes , for which the land is liberally manured , the crops being gardened as far as the occupier can carry out the requirements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much to expect that a man who knows how to grow these crops should obtain sufficient to enable him to provide his cow with half-a-hundredweight per day during a long winter , and even then find something remaining to help his cow in the heat of summer , or his pig in winter . A labouring man , if his soil suits the mangel crop , should , without difficulty , obtain fifteen tons upon half-an-acre , or 300 cwts. , which would provide a ration for two cows during the seven winter feeding months , leaving over sufficient for some other purpose . It therefore follows that he might // provide all the mangels his cow requires on a quarter of an acre , and devote the remaining quarter to cabbages or vetches , and a small plot of potatoes for his own table . By this system of cultivation considerable spade labour is indeed demanded , and there is no tangible success in this walk of life without labour ; but it is the one form of culture that enables an industrious and thrifty man to eventually become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AND MEANS . If the land to which we have referred were obtained , rates free , at 30/- an acre , we should find the first charge against the cow would be 3 15s . To this a sum of 4 should be added to cover the cost of artificial manure ; of horse and cart hire ; of carting dung , road scrapings , hay , &c.; of seed ; of grains , meal or cake ; and we then get a total charge of Z7 r5s. against the produce of the cow The value of that produce may be put as follows : If any portion of the skim milk were consumed by swine the returns wculd not be so large , inasmuch as the money // value of the produce in live pig practically never exceeds three halfpence per gallon . There are no doubt few in-stances in which an owner of a single cow is in a position to sell milk by retail , but where there is a large population within easy reach the thing can be done , and , of course , done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other hand there are few men who would permit the whole of the skim milk produced by an average cow to be consumed by their families ? they have considerable faith in its value as a producer of bacon , and that faith is well founded ; at the same time it is very questionable whether the produce of the pig from the milk would exceed the extra cost of food which a family deprived of the milk would re-quire , quite apart from the superior value of the milk as a food for children . On this point , however , we will not cavil with the man who wisely keeps a pig as well as a cow , for the simple reason that a pig well managed is an absolute savings bank , although the interest it pays is often small . CO-OPERATION ? HIRING . We have next to enquire how a cow may be obtained by those who have no means of effecting a purchase out of their own resources , although they may be in a position to acquire the land which is necessary . Cows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no easy matter for a labourer to save sufficient money to enable him to effect purchase outright . There are , however , three methods of obtaining a cow , one of which necessitates some patience ; I refer to the pur-chase of a weaned calf . Many men who have set their hearts on a cow have commenced to provide for it by hatching a few chickens , which they have sold to the best advantage , applying the money to the purchase of a newly weaned sow pig . This , in course of time , produces a litter of young , which again are sold well , and a young heifer purchased with the money realised . The first method then , COW-KEEPING AND $1K1NG. 2I whether a calf or a heifer is installed as the future cow , demands forethought and patience . Next comes the system of co-operating for purchase of which working men might avail themselves much more freely than they do . It needs , however , like all similar movements , something at the hands of those who hold a superior social position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is indispensable . Some years ago I drew up a plan of co-operation of this kind , with a code of rules , the object being to provide labourers and others with a medium through which they could in turn obtain what they required . In a cow club it would be necessary for a given number of men to subscribe a given sum weekly until the total reached the amount necessary to buy a cow . A ballot would then take place , and the fortunate man would be provided with the object of his ambition , according to the rules , which would be necessarily explicit and carefully drawn . He would immediately commence making his repayments , which he could then well afford upon a higher scale , from the produce of the cow , and in due course , by the aid of the subscriptions of the members , a second ballot would take place . This method has the advantage of simplicity ; it encourages habits of thrift and prudence ; although it may ? nay it must ? require some of those who are anxious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would assuredly have to do if they were left to their own resources . It is , of course , obvious that the committee appointed by such a society should be trusted men and that they should hold a lien upon every cow purchased until it has been absolutely paid for . Arising out of this plan there should be a side scheme for ensuring against the loss of a cow . A poor man may lose his all at a single blow ? hence the importance of his paying to a fund from which new cows can be provided . Lastly , there is the system of hiring which has not been patronised as it might be by farmers and labourers , between // whom there is long standing confidence and respect . It has been suggested that while a farmer may confer benefit of a very material character upon his men , he may reap that reward which a business man has a right to expect when he lays out his capital . Upon this phase of the subiect there are two points which may be questioned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them as by feeding and milking them on his own farm ? Can he , as an occupier of an arable farm in a district badly adapted to dairying on a large scale , breed and let cows to working men with advantage ? There is no doubt that farm labourers are much aided in bringing up their families by the possession of a cow , and that they are more contented in consequence . A contented workman is a more satisfactory workman ; hence the economical value of the hiring system as between farmers and labourers . We have , however , to consider the question in its more concrete form . It may pay a farmer good interest to let a cow worth , ' 16 for Z4 per annum , but yet he would much prefer to feed and milk her himself if he is a dairy farmer or possesses the means of carrying on this business . The reason is twofold . He reaps a profit both from the cow and the crops on which she feeds . Stock is essential to the farm ; and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Similarly the labour entailed on the farm is very little increased , speaking relatively , by the addition of a dairy herd . It would seem then that a farmer would not be well advised to let out cows on hire instead of keeping his own herd . There is , however , the possibility that he may do both . In times which have passed when money was more plentiful , the hiring system might have been more generally adopted , but to-day farmers need all their capital in their own business ; hence , where working men can obtain the land upon which to feed a cow , we are of opinion that they will look with greater success to co-operative efforts . // RULES FOR COW HIRING . In connection with the previously discussed question of " Single Cow Keeping , Hiring , &c."?much; detailed information and advice may be gleaned from the appended set of Model Rules for the letting and hiring of single cows to labourers , wage-earners , and those , more particularly , who practise some phases of Small Culture , or are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This system may be said to have been invented by Mr. Robert E. Turnbull , and the accompanying form of agreement shows how thoroughly the plan has been thought out . COW-HIRING AGREEMENT . ( Stamp ) Agreement between Robert E. Turnbull , hereinafter called the " owner , " of the one part , and A. B. , hereinafter called the " hirer , " of the other part ? whereby the said owner agrees to let , and the said hirer agrees to hire , from the 1st day of May , 190 , from year to year , a three-yearold Irish heifer , colour red and white , weighing fifty imperial stones , value 10 ( being 4s. per stone ) , the property of the said owner , at the yearly hire , and subject to the conditions hereinafter mentioned , that is to say r .

The cow shall at all times be properly fed and carefully attended to by the hirer , who shall provide pasture for summer , and not less than 250 stones ( being five times the cow 's weight ) of good hay for its winter maintenance ; and , in addition to hay and grass , the hirer shall provide fifty stones ( the cow 's weight ) of cake , meal , and bran , to be given during the year . // 3 . The cow to be sent to a yearling bull the second time it comes in service after calving , and to be " dried " six weeks before it is due to calve , and whilst dry to be allowed 2-lbs. per day of linseed cake , in addition to hay or grass . 4 .

Dated this first day of - lay , rqo , Witness ( Signed ) ROBERT E. TURNBULL . ( Signed ) A. li . APPENDIX I. We believe the hiring system has been satisfactorily worked in certain districts , but in these days , when the race for existence has been so greatly accelerated , it is found desirable to keep our individual interests as distinct and independent as possible . The sanitary requirements of modern times doubtless discourage the erection of cow sheds as well as pig styes ; but , if sufficient ground is available for the erection of a cow shed within a reasonable distance of the cottage , and suitable grazing within easy access , a man of small means could not only rear a cow , but look forward to such an increase of stock as would enable him to become a small farmer by the time that he reached middle life . We have known labourers buy a heifer calf , say about December or January when sucklers are cheap , then buy a few gallons of milk to start the hand-feeding , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expenditure of say 40s. for meal-cake and a little hay enabled them to bring their calf to grass at May Ist , when is. per week would be a fair allowance for the first year 's grass . At October rst she would again have to be housed , at least dining the // night , and provided with rough hay or straw and a few roots if winter sets in . The young heifer could be mated about April or May at sixteen months old , and the cost of keep should not exceed 2s. or 2s. 3d. per week between one and two years old . Then , a month or so before calving , the cost of keep would increase to about 5s. per week , and while in full milk would likely exceed that during the winter months , but good grazing ought to be had at 2s. 6d. or 3s. per week . An arrangement for a cow 's keep on these lines often proves an advantage ? both to the farmer and labourer ? while the economic use of milk in his own family and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the district , also the favourable opportunity of keeping a pig ? the butter milk and surplus skim milk going a good way towards feeding a young pig ? would enable a frugal labourer 's wife to put something in the stocking every Saturday night . An additional calf or two could now be reared with advantage , and the stocking of a small tarm would in course of time become practicable . Illustrations of progress on these lines are not difficult to find in the Northern Counties of Scotland , and the crofters ' children , whose staple food has been oatmeal , milk and potatoes , are found to have developed a good physique and to be able to hold their own in the battle of life wherever they may migrate in after life , and doubtless if milk became more generally an article of diet amongst the families of the industrial classes in the Southern Counties , not only would cow keeping become a financial help to them but also promote the development of healthier men and women . APPENDIX BY EDITOR . A small holding does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cow byre may be built mainly of old railway sleepers , let a little way into the ground , and cross-braced , forming the walls , with a roof of corrugated iron . Or the roof may be composed of a wooden framework laid on the top , this being covered by well-dried hedge and ditch trimmings thatched with straw . There is more air space with the corrugated iron , but it preserves a less even temperature than the built up roof . Avery neat and use-ful cow byre can be built on the lines shown in the illustra-tions given here . The animals can be fed either from the inside or outside . The filling of the manger is clone from the outside , by means of a chute arrangement , with lid to keep out cold air . It would be difficult to find a cheaper form of cote byre of so substantial a nature , and it is suitable to be put even where appearances have to be studied . As shown in Fig. a , the building is simple and cheaply constructed ; it is covered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ timber-sheeted framing , and the floor is either paved with bricks or rough concrete . The total width inside ( as shown in Fig. z ) is 14-ft. , and is made up as follows : ? z-ft . Width of manger ; 6-ft. 6-in. standing space for cattle ; r-ft. gutter , and 4-ft. 6-in. pathway , which affords room for cleaning out the manure , &c.; A double row of cattle can be accommodated under a comparatively cheap roof in a house a , - ft. 6-in. tvicle inside . In such case the pathway would be in the centre , and there would be a second gutter , standing space , and rote of mangers . The mangers are 2-ft. 6-in. from floor , and the sloped backs A are con-tinned , as shown in Fig. t , through the side of the building the full length between the timber uprights B. The shoot thus formed is covered by a hinged lid C , which can be raised for passing food into the manger . Hay is passed in through sliding doors D from the outside into the rack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and is supported in front by occasional iron bars E , which are secured to the top of the mangers . Ventilation is provided for in the space F , between these sliding doors and the roof . POULTRY KEEPING . By EDWARD Brown , F.L.S. Part I. ? How To BEGIN . SOME time ago I was invited to visit a place where a progressive landowner had laid out a number of poultry allotments for the labourers on the estate . Nearly everything had been done in the best manner . " There was only one mistake made , but that a vital one . My observa-tion was " Why did not you ask me to come and see the place before you laid it out instead of after ? " To which no reply could be given . Nor is this an isolated instance . Initial blunders are hardest to repair , and in every pursuit it is specially desirable that these be avoided , as far as possible . Difficulties are certain to arise , but they will be greatly minimised if the lines laid down for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conceded that those who live in the rural districts , and are either farmers or fruit growers , have the greatest chances of success as poultry-keepers . Ent this must not be taken to mean that urban and sub-urban residents can not make their poultry pay , for there are multitudes of instances to the contrary which could be cited . // in mind is the undesirability of poultry-keeping being regarded as a separate pursuit , and I very strongly urge those who think that they have only to take a few acres of land , lay it out in poultry runs , stock it , and they will make a good living , to understand that such a system is bound to end in failure . If we could keep our fowls in covered sheds or yards like cattle , removing the manure every day , it might be possible . But everyone knows that when stock are kept on any kind of soil , they must be changed from time to time , and the land sweetened by either allowing it to lie fallow , or growing some form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to poultry , and until this is recognised as a rigid law , many failures will strew the path . In the case of farmers there need be no danger on this score , if they will but take the trouble to give their birds fresh ground . That it will pay them to do so is unquestionable , because the manure thus obtained will enrich the land , and their crops will be heavier in consequence . RUNS . If the amount of space available for the poultry is sufficient the most preferable plan would be to utilise portable houses , which can be moved about from time to time , thus giving the fowls fresh ground , and at the same time securing the benefit of their manure for growing crops . But on limited runs this system can not be followed , and it is then necessary to devise some other plan . Supposing an acre of ground , or half an acre , is at the disposal of the poultrykeeper , the most suitable culture to link with poultrykeeping in many districts is fruit growing , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon open ground without any danger of taint in the soil , as the trees will dr iw from the soil the ammonia given in the manure . But to do this successfully the trees should not be thickly planted , otherwise the ground will be damp in the autumn // and winter . Under these circumstances permanent houses will be better , and they should be fitted with a large roomy shed , to shelter the birds during unfavourable weather . Whatever the form of house , it should be well built of good timber , not less than seven-eighths of an inch in thickness , and if an inch all the better . In many places fruit growing can not be attempted , either by reason of unsuitability , or because a short tenure makes the investment of money in this way inadvisable . When that is the case , it will be better to make two runs to each house , only using one at a time , and upon the other growing vegetables or roots , or , in fact anything that will command a market , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who have adopted this plan have expressed their surprise at the size and quality of the vegetables thus obtained , and this is worthy of consideration , whilst we have the great advantage of avoiding by this means tainted soil ? a sure cause of disease , and the reason why so many poultry-keepers fail . Nothing is better than potatoes for work of this kind , and if planted in the early autumn , after the stock has been reduced by the sale of surplus chickens end older hens , when less room is required , the land will be in a good condition for use again in the spring . BUYING EGGS v. STOCK BIRDS . The question is often asked as to whether it is best to make a start by buying eggs for hatching , or stock birds . I am all in favour of the latter , and it will be found cheapest in the long run . When eggs are purchased we have to wait some months for the results , and birds thus obtained ought not to be bred from until a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if stock birds are bought we can have returns in as many weeks . It is some-times convenient when we have a stock of good birds on hand , and simply desire a change of blood to secure this // by the purchase of eggs , but at the first it is much better to buy breeding stock . It is necessary to note that in buying stock the male and female should not be related , and for this reason it is often better to obtain the sexes respectively from different places . And at the outset I should be indined to prefer having two-year old hens rather than pullets , as the progeny will be hardier , but they can be mated with a year old male bird . In the autumn , hens eighteen months old can frequently be bought at a reasonable price , but they must not be older than that . They should be secured in good time , some weeks before hatching is desired to commence . Probably some readers may think , when reading the above , that they will have to purchase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so . If it were we should find a difficulty in securing a sufficient number of birds of the right kind . I hope that in a few years we shall find country markets and sales , as in the case of sheep , but we have not arrived at that stage yet . Whether the poultrykeeper is commencing entirely , or has in view the improvement of his present stock of fowls , he will not need to buy more than one or two pens , by which is meant one or two lots of a cock and eight hens each . These should be placed in houses such as have already been referred to , apart from all other fowls , and then they can be bred from at the proper time . At the expenditure of , say , Z3 for stock , or Z4 at most , it should be possible to obtain a pen of birds which should give two hundred chickens by the first of June , and the cost of eggs to produce that number would amount to more than the sum named , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the plan of buying stock birds safest , but in point of time it is much preferable to purchasing eggs . I know that the latter trade is a large one , but it is none the less unsatisfactory on that account . // REARING EARLY CHICKENS . There is only one more point to be mentioned in connection with the material side of things in commencing poultry keeping , namely , some means of rearing early chickens . In too many districts the hatching is far too late . The reason for this is that poultry keepers are content to depend entirely upon the hens , which , late hatched themselves , are late in commencing to lay and , consequently , to sit . Whether for egg production or securing the best markets for table chickens , it is essential that the birds shall be out early . The present method has to recommend it only the fact that less trouble is involved , but the profit is correspondingly small . When chickens are to be reared either in the late winter or early spring , they nurst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chicken house of some kind is requisite , unless brooders are employed , when they will suffice . A dui ken house should face south , have plenty of windows so as to be light , be large enough to accommodate several coops , and be well ventilated . The provision of such a structure need not involve a heavy outlay , and many existing buildings can be adapted to the purpose . It is better as near home as possible , so as to facilitate the work of attention , a most important consideration especially in unfavourable weather . There should be a good run attached to it , it possible in grass , so that the inmates can go outside when ever the day is suitable for their doing so . I have not found it difficult to rear chickens in winter , so long as they have a dry , comfortable shed where they can shelter wino ever disposed to take advantage of it . The determination as to which breed or breeds should he selected deserves very careful consideration on the part of every poultry-keeper , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious . To do this it is essential to under // stand the distinctive qualities of the different races of fowls . There is an even greater difference between the breeds m poultry than in the case of cattle or sheep , because there are more from which selection can be made . Some are better as layers than for any other purpose ; others are poor as layers , but carry a large quantity of flesh , and consequently should only be chosen when the production of chickens is the primary object ; a third class is a combination of the two , not quite as good as layers or on the table , as the breeds specially strong in either of these directions , but much better in the opposite quality , and , as a rule , these are by natural tendency the best winter layers we have . The purely fancy fowls should be severely let alone by the practical poultry keeper , for , however handsome they may be , their economic merits are in the inverse ratio , or they have some weakness which militates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a word with regard to the contention so often put forth that our pure-bred varieties of poultry are being spoiled by breeding for external points . That harm has been done by fanciers no one who has given any study to the subject of poultry-keeping , can deny , but the extent has been greatly exaggerated . Nor need there be any injury at all if the standard of points is made to run on all fours with the economic qualities . There is no reason why a brilliant-plumaged fowl should not be as good a layer as one which is dull in hue . The mischief arises when everything is sacrificed to this one thing , and birds are selected for breeding regardless of productiveness . Unfortunately this is only too often done , and we must urge upon breeders that fecundity or table qualities shall be regarded as of equal importance with colour and type . On such lines will the best birds be obtained , best both for appearance and usefulness . Buyers of stock birds will be well advised if they purchase only from those who can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ develope their natural // vigour , for health means eggs , and stamina good quality of flesh . We must not forget , however , that more of the undoubted improvement in respect to early breeding and rapid growth is due to those who sought to have birds ready for the early shows , than to the ordinary poultrykeeper . This fact is generally forgotten by those who condemn our show system . PAYING POULTRY . The following races of poultry embrace those which can be classed as possessing desirable features : Laying , or Non-sitting Varieties : Leghorns , Anconas , Minorcas , Andalusians , Houdans , Hamburghs , Campines , and Redcaps . I have not put them in the order of merit , but if asked to make a selection should place the White Leghorn first , because it is not only a good layer , but it is also naturally precocious and vigorous , able to stand cold , and thriving well under almost all conditions , a splendid forager ; it is , however , a very poor table fowl . The second place I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favoured districts , as it is by no means a hardy fowl . The Houdan would be one of the best birds we have , were it not for the fact that it is liable to cold , through carrying a large crest or " top-knot . " The others are all good , but these three stand pre-eminent . Table Varieties : Dorkings , Indian Game , Old English Game , La Bresse , La Fleche , Crevecceur , Faverolle and Coucou de Malines . Of these the Dorking is easily first , but it is unfortunately tender , and should never be kept on damp soils , or in a low lying position . The dark Dorkings are the largest , but it is very generally admitted that the Silver Greys are the finest in quality of flesh . The Indian Game and Old English Game are splendid table fowls , but the flesh is too hard for ordinary market demands . All the three French breeds are good , but two at least have uroved // rather tender in this country , namely , the La Fleche and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and from present appearances it seems destined to take a leading position , as it is very hardy and carries a large amount of flesh , whilst it is also said to be a good layer . Several lots have been imported , and so far they have answered very well indeed in this country . The Coucou de Malines is the table fowl of Belgium , and it has the same qualities as the Faverolle , being a meaty bird , and a quick grower . For the best table poultry trade I should recommend the Indian Game and , Dorking cross , the progeny being large , fleshy specimens , of the very best quality ; but for a market where the highest prices can not be realised the next choice should be between the Coucou de Malines and the Faverolle . GENERAL PURPOSE VARIETIES . General Purpose Varieties : Langshans , Orpingtons , Wyandottes , Plymouth Rocks , and Brahmas . At one time I should have been disposed to place the Langshan first of all , by reason of the fact that it is an excellent winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a recommendation at that season of the year , and it makes a nice table fowl , but the breeders for some years have allowed their birds to become stilted on the leg , and this is having an adverse effect upon the breed . The fowl which must now be given the first place is the White Wyandotte , a vigorous , good-laying fowl , and carrying a considerable quantity of meat . The one weakness of this breed is that the eggs are rather small as compared with the size of the bird , but I am assured that by selection this point has been greatly improved in America , and that White 1Vyandottes are there to be met with in large numbers which give much larger eggs than those with which we are acquainted . If our home breeders will give attention to the same point the // improvement will easily place it in the first position . Second , we must place the Plymouth Rock , a good useful , hardy breed , which has been known sufficiently long to make its good qualities understood . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be guided largely by the market demands in his district . There are places where eggs can always be sold at a fair price , except , perhaps , during the late spring and early summer , and table poultry is at a discount , or the returns would be comparatively small . I believe that much can be done to stimulate an inquiry for good table fowls , but this is a work of time , and needs both patience and money . It would be better to take advantage of the present condition of things , and go in for those breeds which will give the greatest return in eggs , more especially in winter . On the other hand , where the demand for table poultry is a good one , then there is no more profitable section of poultry-keeping . In not a few places there is a good demand for eggs , and also for medium-priced table fowls , and as it would be useless to produce the very best , I am inclined to suggest that the General Purpose fowls will meet the need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be mentioned . Where there is sufficient space it is an excellent plan to keep two kinds , say , White Leghorns for supplying eggs during the greater part of the year , and White Wyandottes for winter laying and table fowls . Every breeder should set himself to get as many eggs as possible whilst they are scarce , but as to this mention will be made in Part II . of this article . // ARTIFICIAL INCUBATION AND REARING . Many readers will well remember the incredulity expressed at the Dairy Show in 1887 , when a " Hydro Incubator " was exhibited for the first time . However , events were marching fast , and the Public International Incubator Contest of Hemel Hempstead , in 1878 and 1879 , soon compelled belief in the principles of Hydro-Incubation , or artificial hatching by heat supplied from hot-water tanks . At the present day there are a great number of incubators and artificial foster-mothers or rearers in the market , in which hot air or hot water is used , heated by oil lamps , or by gas . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , owing to the impossibility of the lamp fumes weakening the eggs or chickens , which is the general fault of the Hot-air Machines . The advantages in artificial hatching or rearing , are : ( I ) An incubator or rearer hatching or rearing loo chicks , only takes as much attention as a hen hatching or rearing 12 chicks . The chicks so reared are healthier , and make bigger and stronger birds ; chiefly owing to the fact that they are entirely free from vermin from the first . Non-broody breeds of fowls can be kept , the result being a great increase in egg production . COOP FOR HATCHING CHICKEN . The illustrations on the opposite page show , ( Fig . I ) , front and side elevations of Hatching Coop ; also , ( Fig. 2 ) , plan on somewhat larger scale , showing door at back , to be hinged , and fitted with button fastener , so that the sitting hen may be shut up out of sight of the other birds .

Part II. - TI1E PRODUCTION OF EGGS AND MEAT . THE profit or otherwise of every hen must depend upon the quantity of eggs she produces . As in all other pursuits , there is a basal cost which must be met in the first instance , before we can hope for a margin of profit . It is the extent of this margin which determines whether our balance sheet shall be favourable or not . Multitudes of hens do no more than pay for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this state of things there can be no improve-ment whatever . It costs very little more , and in some instances actually less , to feed a hen which produces a hundred-and-fifty eggs in twelve months , than one laying half that number , and it may fairly be said that every egg above eighty laid by a hen , is profit , that number being required to pay for her food and maintenance . It will be seen , therefore , how essential it is that we should con-stantly be striving to increase the output , not merely by keeping a larger number of hens , but by developing the individual prolificacy . In this connection it is desirable to point out that the tendency is always towards decrease rather than increase . Hens naturally , if left to themselves , would not advance in this respect , with occasional exceptions , but the reverse . For a hen to lay more than about three dozen eggs in a year is a purely artificial state of things , and like every artificial condition this is only to be maintained by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as external characters the law of reversion is a very potent factor , and its effects can only be obviated by careful selection and skilful breeding . Neglect will soon bring its own punishment . One great advantage of breeding from pure bred stock is that this law of reversion does not act so quickly as with mongrels . Thus it will be seen that to maintain the present qualities or to improve them , we must recognise the facts here set forth . But the plasticity of the domestic fowl gives the breeder an opportunity for improve ment which will well repay his efforts . CAREFUL SELECTION OF HENS . The question of the various races of poultry has already been dealt with , but there is much difference in families or the same breed , so far as egg production is concerned . Some writers have gone so far as to say that fecundity is more a matter of family than of breed . This contains a germ of truth , though put in an extreme manner . It is essential , therefore , that there shall be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been decided upon , and to this end observations should he made by every poultry-keeper , so that he may know which birds are the earliest or best layers . To do this is scarcely possible if all the birds are allowed to run together indiscriminately . Breeding on these lines is a haphazard business , and the chances are all against improvement . The only sensible plan is to select stock birds from the general flock , choosing those which are known for their good qualities , and , mating them with a male bird from a family which shows the same tendencies , breed only from these . The plan here laid down is what has proved successful with larger stock , and it is equally necessary for poultry . We can easily see that if // a hen has shown that she is a good layer it is most desirable that she should be used for breeding , and her good quality passed on . Moreover when fowls are kept in large flocks it is hardly possible for any one to differentiate between them , but this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means of the small houses already recommended . Without proper observation and selection , improvement is scarcely possible , and this observation is one of those matters which can not be too strongly urged upon every poultry-keeper . Not a few of our races of poultry could be lifted on to a higher plane in a very few years , if individual breeders would make careful selection for stock purposes , in the way here indicated . EGGS FOR THE SCARCE SEASON . There are several questions which it is necessary to consider in respect to egg production . First is the time of year when pullets are bred . We all know how easy it is to obtain eggs during the spring and summer months of the year , but then the prices rule low , and it should be the object of all practical poultry breeders to transfer some , at least , of the eggs then laid to a season when they will bring greater returns . That this is capable of accomplishment is undoubted , but only by sustained and regular effort . To this end good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufficient in themselves . If we examine the market reports we find that the prices of eggs range highest from the end of August to March . This is due to the fact that in the late summer the older hens begin to fall into moult , when they cease laying , and the diminished supply enhances prices . As a rule very few of the young pullets are anything like laying by that time . It should be the object of every young poultry keeper to arrange his breeding so that his first batch will be ready to begin laying about the time the older birds commence to moult , but to do this // they must be out in February or early in March . Earlier than that is not desirable for layers , otherwise they will begin to lay in June , and perhaps fall into a moult about October . Where , however , the work is systematised the first lots of eggs should be down by February 1st , and succeeded by others until the beginning of April , by which time all likely to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of incubation . May and June hatched chickens can not be expected to lay before December or January . I know it is often said that neither eggs nor broody hens can be obtained as early as February , but this is not so . A further benefit resultant from early breeding is that eggs will be available much sooner , and the hens will become broody before they could otherwise be expected , so that the method here recommended has a double advantage . At the same time , it is possible that eggs may be plentiful and yet broody hens scarce . Under such conditions the only alternative is to adopt artificial incubation , so as to remedy the deficiencies of hens . Early hatching means also that the hens will moult sooner , and thus may be expected to begin laying again before the cold weather is upon us . There can be no question that many fowls are kept far too long , and at the risk of being charged with reiterating an oft repeated recommendation , it must be pointed out that half the stock should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birds iii the first and second year than afterwards , and every hen should be killed by the time she is twenty-seven months old . Some Americar. breeders advocate renewing the stock every year , disposing of all the hens when eighteen or nineteen months old , but I do not think that this is necessary , and for breeding purposes we get the more vigorous chickens from birds in their second year , whilst the reduction in number of eggs produced is comuensated for by the greater size of the egg . // HOUSING AND FOOD . Whilst it is true that early hatched pullets will lay better in winter , even when not well housed , than those better protected but not making their appearance until a later period , yet , in order to obtain the best results , the birds must he kept comfortable . Hence the importance of good housing ? warm , dry , and free from draughts . Birds can withstand cold , and thrive under these conditions , but they do not lay , and hence fail in their great objective . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ milch cattle , and the same influences are at work in connection with poultry . I am not sure that ( luring the colder months of the year fowls are not more in profit in semi-confinement than when at full liberty , provided they have a large roomy shed to shelter them during wet or cold weather . But this is a point which can only be determined after careful experiments and is a matter worthy of further enquiry . // To secure eggs in the scarce season we must feed properly . This is a question upon which we have yet a great deal to learn . The tendency has been to feed upon foods which contain too much fat , and we are inclined to think that a greater amount of vegetable matter and lean meat , and less grain might be better for our poultry . But fat meat would bring in its train evils which we are most anxious to avoid . To secure eggs our birds must be in rather lean condition , or they must be hard in muscle , so that there will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand over-stimulation leads to diseases which every poultry keeper should seek to avoid . It must always be borne in mind that fowls in a natural state live almost entirely upon green stuff , worms , &c.,; and whilst it would be inadvisable to limit them to the same food when in restriction , at the same time we have gone to the other extreme . PRODUCTION OF TABLE POULTRY . So far as the production of table poultry is concerned we have here to approach the subject from an altogether different standpoint . Of course the egg producer will have every year a number of fowls to sell , such as the cockerels and old hens , but he will only regard them as an incident , not as the main object of his operations , and will be content to take the best price obtainable , whatever it may be . If he keeps only non-sitters this price will be a small one , as these birds carry so little flesh , but if he has any of the General Purpose breeds they should market better , as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary that we should say any more in this direction . The production of first-rate table poultry has been pressed forward much of late years , and the standard of quality is steadily rising in many sections of the country , though it is still by no means what it should be . Part of // this is due to the fact that the most suitable kinds are not kept , for only comparatively few breeds carry flesh in the right place or are of first-class quality , and it must be recognised that in this respect specialisation is necessary for the best returns to be secured . A further reason is that the chickens sold are usually sent to market without any feeding off , and are consequently in the same condition as would be store cattle . With the springing up of fattening establishments in different parts of the country , and a more general realisation of the importance of adopting this system , to which is due the splendid fowls produced in the south-east of England , in France and Belgium , we may hope that there will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poultry . One influence of these establishments will be , and it can not be too strongly insisted upon , that breeders will find a more ready outlet for their specimens and at much higher rates . Consumers are learning , that it is more profitable , apart from the consideration of better quality , to buy well-fleshed birds than the scraggy chickens so often seen . Fatteners can fi Id a better market for their products , and consequently can pay higher prices to the breeders , so that the benefit is an all-round one . THE POULTRY FATTENERS ' BAROMETER . Examining again the market reports , which must always be our barometer in practical poultry-keeping , it will be found that the high water mark for table poultry is from November to July , the highest prices being from February to June . From August to October , that is during the game season , returns are small , yet it is surprising to find that except in what may be termed the poultry districts , the bulk of the fowls marketed make their appearance after the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no attempt is made to meet the market demands , but producers are content to take the chickens when they come , // and do not lay themselves out for the earlier birds . It is not on these easy-going lines that a success is to be made of any enterprise , and certainly not in poultry-keeping . For a table poultry trade , hatching should begin before Christmas , if possible , but certainly as soon after as can be . To do this , however , needs forethought and time , for it can not be done in a day , and of course the youngsters when hatched require care and attention . That it pays to give them this can be proved by the amount of money earned by those who set themselves to this end . To secure eggs as soon as this requires early hatched pullets , which must be mated in October or November . Frequently during the summer those who keep sitting varieties of fowls , are troubled by the birds becoming broody . It is an excellent plan to allow them to obey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and very often expedites the moult , so that they recommence laying earlier than would otherwise be the case . And , at the same time , the chickens so produced will meet the first market demands about Christmas , when the returns will quite compensate for any additional trouble involved in attending to birds during the autumn . The chickens so brought out will not grow quite as rapidly as those hatched during the spring , but this is no great disadvantage . The process of fattening , described in another section , gives that final touch to the birds which makes the difference between meaty and lean birds . Almost any fowl can be improved by fattening , but there are some which lend themselves to the system more readily than do others . SMALILt CUlTURE . THE SUSSEX POULTRY REARING AND CRAMMING SYSTEM . POULTRY keeping on the farm until recent years was almost exclusively confined to the running of a number of fowls , or other yard birds , about the homestead . These were confined in a poultry house on the confines of the yard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the vicinity of the homestead . In this way they picked up a large amount of food in the yards and about the stackyards . The flail left good pickings in the straw which the modern threshing machine thoroughly threshes out while the binder ties the corn into neat sheaves , the butts of which are built at the outside of the stacks , so that the chickens get very few kernels . Now the farm homestead , in fact , supplies very little chance food to the fowls . While farmers in other districts were finding that by keeping their poultry about the premises they required nearly all their food taken to them , there was being established in Sussex an out-field system which , during the last few years , has been largely copied throughout the country . In association with this system in Sussex , however , there has developed a method of fattening fowls , which , although it has been taken up in a few instances outside the county , is almost exclusively confined to East Sussex . The area in which poultry feeding is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between Uckfield and Heathfield ; and , as VOL . I.ISO. 5. // showing the magnitude of the business done in fattening fowls , over twenty tons of fattened chicken leave Uckfield Station every week throughout the year . It may be mentioned in passing , that in Sussex the old English plural , the affix " en " is always employed to denote a number of young fowls ; the double plural , by adding s , is never used . ADAPTABILITY TO SMALL HOLDINGS . The Sussex poultry system is particularly well suited to small holdings . The large dimensions which the business has assumed in the county forms a great factor in the agriculture of the districts affected . Without the poultry a very considerable quantity of land would practically be out of cultivation , a large portion of it being let in small holdings on which poultry raising is systematically carried out . It may be said with very close approximation to truth that every one goes in for poultry raising who has a few acres of land on which to do it , while those with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to raise as many as circumstances admit . " OUT FOLD " SYSTEM . By keeping the fowls in the open fields they pick up a considerable portion of their food in the form of insects and grass . Moreover they are much more healthy , being more vigorous for the exercise they get , and they are less subject to disease . Wherever fowls are kept confined in large quantities they make the land stale , and it becomes a nursery of infectious diseases , and harbourage for a host of insect parasites which prey upon them . Hen-cholera and many otheF fatal diseases soon take away all chance of profit on foul ground , and it is only by allowing fowls to range over fresh land that they are kept reasonably free from these diseases . Few recognise how seriously internal and external parasites affect fowls when kept in enclosed // places unless special pains are taken to rid them of their pests . Where they roam at will they are far less troubled by them , and moreover , they have the opportunity to use nature 's methods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out-field system has been so great that the practice is rapidly extending , and before many years have elapsed there is little doubt that it will be universal throughout the country . Portable roosting houses for running chicken , 4-ft. 7-in , long , 2-ft . Io-in. wide , 3-ft. ro-in. high , on legs , with barred bottom , sliding door and ventilator , weather proof , with handles complete , cost 18/- . Hen coops of substantial build , with iron barred fronts , moveable board bottoms and front shutters for night use , making them vermin proof , well painted , cost 42/- per dozen . CRAMMING . The chicken reared on the farms and small holdings are occasionally fattened by the rearers , but more generally by those who mainly devote themselves to cramming . There are those who fatten as many as 50,000 birds a year , nearly all of which have been reared by others , the majority locally , but in spring no small number come from Ireland , as at that season it is difficult to obtain local birds in sufficient quantity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country for a considerable radius , the birds being packed in shallow crates . The collectors are known as hzi filers . Collecting crates to hold twenty-four birds cost io/- , and are substantially made . A very large proportion of the chicken are fattened in the open air . Ranges of fattening pens are generally set up behind a thick , high hedge , and parallel to this a sheltering fence of hazel wands , furze or other brush-wood is set up . Within this avenue two lines of pens are set up about five feet from row to row . These avenues are some52 SMALL CULTURE . times ioo yards in length . In other places where there are suitable buildings , or hovels , the birds are kept under cover . When kept under cover the tops of the pens are not made weather-proof , as is necessary where they are placed in the open . The cost of a fattening pen for outdoor use is 7/- , for indoor 6/- . Each pen is 7-ft. long , with three compartments , holding eighteen fowls , and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birds are being prepared for the crammer . The pens used are almost all of the same type , and the dimensions are 7-ft. in length , r8-in. deep , r4-in. high at the back , and I7-in. high in front . The fattening pens are supported at either end on two stakes , held together by a cross-piece . The stakes ? usually portions of hop poles ? , are driven about a foot or sixteen inches into the ground , and stand about 4-ft. above ground level . This is a convenient height at which to handle the chicken , and places them well above their droppings . The bottom staves are cut like furnace bars , wider at the top than the bottom , so that no clung adheres to them . ( See page 54 . ) The illustrations on page 53 will give an idea of the construction of the fattening pen . A fairly strong framework for front , ends , and back should be made first , after which the " top bar " may be placed in position , in order to raise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back ; a weather-proof roof is added , and the back boarded up . The bottom , or flooring staves , cut as described above , are placed a little distance apart , broad side up . ( See Fig. 3 , page 54 . ) The front and sides are composed of bars set vertically , with sufficient space between to allow the fowls to feed from a trough placed outside . The bars are made by cutting a half-inch board into half-inch strips , and fixing them diamond-wise . ( See Fig. 4 , page J4. ) // THE SUSSEX FOWL . The Sussex Barn-door fowl , a cross between the Dorking and the Bramah , is most popular . It has white legs , which according to London market fancy , are preferred to dark ones . It attains great weight at an early age ; is hardy and fattens quickly . Occasionally other crosses are used , and the bird is a mongrel , but for all that a well bred mongrel . The frequent visits of the higgler keep breeders on the alert to maintain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to the season , for birds that suit them , and unless the birds answer their requirements they do not take them away , but wait until they have grown sufficiently . If they find the stock deteriorating they quickly point it out , and new and better cockerels are purchased , the niggler often selecting suitable birds on his rounds , and taking them where he thinks they are needed . This pre-vents too close in-breeding , and is in all ways beneficial . The Sussex fowl is killed by the time it is four months old . When fed under the Sussex system it weighs from live to seven pounds , at from three-and-a-half to four months . No pure breed is so suitable for the special form // of feeding , although there are breeds and crosses which may attain greater weight ultimately . The process o f cramming , together with the highly concentrated food given during fattening , entails substantial expense , and it is important to have a type of chicken which will respond to it quickly . The flesh of an older chicken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; consequently early maturity is one of the most necessary features of a bird to be crammed . It is a significant feature in the Sussex poultry rearing that the artificial incubator is scarcely ever used . A parallel case is met with in the Aylesbury ducking districts , where the duckers will give considerable prices for sitting hens to place on ducks ' eggs in December and January rather than make use of the incubator ; moreover , the duckers rarely allow the hens to broodle the young ducks after they are old enough to leave the nest . In both districts it is believed that stronger and Inure healthy young birds are raised under the natural than the artificial mother . The chicken require more attention when they have not the mother with them , and success does not wholly depend upon the hatching . PRICE OF CHICKEN . When it is remembered , however , that in April as much as 3/6 is given for chicken three months old , while at other seasons they fetch down to 1/9 , it seems as though there must be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the highest prices , even though there may be a somewhat higher percentage of losses . There is one important point which the Niggler observes , and that is only to buy healthy birds for cram tiling , as otherwise they will not pay . The Niggler will collect as many as thirty dozen , which is a good horse load . Occasionally as much as 3/6 is given for chicken at the end of April and beginning of May , and in some seasons // 3/3 has been maintained for as long as six weeks . After that they fall 3d. per fortnight until 1/9 is reached , at which they stand through summer , getting back to z/- about Christmas time , and then rising as game goes out of season . Three shillings and sixpence seems to be a great price for a chicken at three months old when it has to undergo fattening for three or four weeks before it is ready for market . It would seem impossible to those in other parts of the country that the birds would increase sufficiently in value to pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not often realised for fattened fowls ; yet these Sussex ( called on the market Surrey ) fowls are sold at from 5/- to 7/6 each . There is a good demand for them in London at these prices ; but in other parts of the country , even in the largest towns , these high prices are not obtainable . The hotel keepers have to be trained to appreciate the advantage of these tender fleshed birds . In London hotels , clubs , and the best private houses they are regarded as absolutely necessary . FEEDING . Chicken which have been fed on oatmeal are preferred by the higglers to those which have been fed on wheat , maize , or other hard corn ; for hard corn tends to keep the crop small , and one of the first objects of the feeder is to increase the size of the crop . When the birds are first placed in the fattening coops it is customary to feed them on a fairly stiff paste of ground oats and milk , the object being to distend the crop , as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are fed from the trough depends on the nature of the food they have received , and it is further determined by the time when they seem to have begun to tire of the diet . As soon as they show signs of dainty feeding they are fed on the crammer . It is of course less trouble to feed them in the trough , so they // are allowed on it as long as they feed from it profitably ; this will usually be from nine to twelve days . Food from the trough should be supplied from 6 to 7 a.m. , noon , and 4 to 5 p.m . At the commencement small quantities should be given , gradually increasing , but never giving more than the birds will clear up . The trough is placed outside the front of the pen , the bars of the pen being set wide enough for the fowls to get their heads through to it . Occasionally when the crops have been well distended by oat-meal , trough feeding is dispensed with . THE CRAMMER . The next stage is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machines , but among the Sussex feeders that made by Messrs . Neve of Heathfield is greatly preferred . It consists of a skeleton barrow frame , carrying a cylinder fitted with a plunger actuated by a foot lever the cylinder is surmounted by a circular hopper in which is placed the food . At the open end of the cylinder is a tube through which the food is passed to the bird 's crop . The plunger is constructed so that on the piston being pushed back by the upward stroke of the lever a charge of the thin paste falls into it , and by the forward stroke is expelled . It is important to mix the paste of such consistency that it will run freely into the cylinder ; but it must be thick enough not to run back from the crop when once deposited there . If too thick there is danger of air being pumped // into the crop , rendering it liable to burst ; while the presence of air may give the impression that the crop has been filled with food , when practically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fowl by the legs , then tucks them under his left arm so as to hold them tightly against his body ; the body of the fowl rests on his left fore-arm , and his left hand directs the head of the fowl on to the tube ; the right hand helps to get the bird 's mouth on to the tube , and from the outside traces the tube to the crop , guiding it slightly so that the throat is not in any way ruptured ; the right hand is held under the crop while the food is being passed in , to ascertain when the crop is full . The tube must be made to enter the crop or the food will remain in the throat and choke the bird . Care must be taken that the tube is not placed under the tongue , or the tongue may be torn out . The tube being in the crop , the feeder gives a downward stroke with the foot lever , and places the necessary amount of food into the crop . The bird should not be taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the food will be left in the throat . Skilled operators can cram three fowls in a minute , observing all the points necessary to secure good and safe work . FOOD . When fowls are put on the crammer New Zealand Mutton fit , or some other refined fat , free from tissue , is used with the oatmeal and milk . The proportion of each of these should be approximately z of skim milk , i of ground oats , and z ' ? of fat . The birds should be fed at 6 toy a.m. and at 3 to 4 p.m . Two crammings a day are all that is necessary . The cramming is continued until the birds begin to smell faintly , and they become weak . No grit should be given . All the food is in a freely divided condition and requires no grinding in the gizzard . The meal ' must be specially finely ground , or it will clog in the // crop . Water is not usually put before the birds unless there is a slight stoppage in the crop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gently worked by the hand , and a little oil poured in . In extreme cases the crop has to be slit open , the contents taken out , and the incision stitched up again , carefully . A small quantity of barley , about a peck to a sack , is ground with the oats . The skim milk may be sour , in fact is generally preferred so . The fat requires to be melted , or it will not mix uniformly . To avoid the necessity for melting daily , it is customary to melt a large quantity and when melted to mix with sufficient oatmeal to make a stiff paste : this paste will mix conveniently with a larger bulk when required . A water lacked vessel should be used for melting the fat . Skim milk is regarded as a necessity by most feeders , but when this can not be obtained a thin gruel made by thoroughly soaking linseed cake makes a fair substitute . KILLING AND MARKETING . The chicken should not be fed over-night , previously to being killed ; and if food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken out , as it prevents their keeping sweet as long as they should . The coops should be lime-washed before fresh batches of birds are put into them , and the birds should be dressed with flowers of sulphur about the breast and under the wings , to keep away lice . All droppings should be cleared away once a week at least , and fresh lime thrown down where they have been . The best plan of killing is to wring the fowls ' necks . Bleeding is painful , and they do not pack so sweetly when bled . The neck should be well pulled out as soon as it is broken , so that space may be left for the blood to drain into . When handling the birds the head should always be kept hanging down . Immediately the neck is broken the birds lose the sensation of pain , and picking should be 6o SMALL CULTURE . proceeded with at once . Some expert pickers will pull out the feathers by the time the bird has ceased struggling . The fowls require stubbing after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they should be placed on setting boards specially constructed to give them a suitable shape . The legs should be bent up so that the bird sets on its breast : the breast should be broken in by pressing down both sides until cracking is felt . The heads should be allowed to hang down . It is far preferable not to draw and truss the birds . Poulterers prefer the birds untrussed , and they can then truss them in the manner that best suits their particular trade . Moreover , if they are trussed they are much less well suited for packing : the liver and giblets are inconvenient for packing . Consequently the birds are sent away in strong pods specially made for the purpose to hold r , 2 , 3 , or 4 dozen birds . A little straw is put into the bottom , and a little on the top . In Sussex carters collect these birds from any point , and see them on the rail at rd per head ; commission to the salesman runs to about id . The price realised should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the higgler ; and , as a rule , skilled feeders , who have skilled pickers , obtain a clear profit of 3d. per head . SMALL CULTURE . DUCKS , GEESE , and TURKEYS . BY W. COOK . MUCH of the success attending the keeping of poultry of all kinds depends upon the selection of the right birds . By this we do not mean the particular breeds , but just the branches which will fit in with the individual circumstances of the person keeping them . On farms , for instance , there are frequently to be found fields which are of very little value to the farmer for crops , but which could be turned to good account for keeping ducks , geese , or turkeys on . It is a mistake to attempt to keep fowls with either of the above . They do very much better if they are not allowed to run together . DUCKS . There are at the present time large numbers of ducks bred and reared , but there is much more to be done in this branch than has yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ducklings for table purposes this branch should be taken up , as if they are properly managed they are a source of profit on account of being so quickly out of hand . Early ducklings should all be killed by the time they are eleven or twelve weeks old , as up to that age they grow well , and put on flesh rapidly . After that they moult and go back in condition , and if weighed when nineteen or twenty weeks old will be found to be less in weight than at // twelve weeks . In order to be really successful in rearing young ducklings one must breed them from healthy un related parents . Size of frame should be sought after when selecting stock ducks in preference to weight which is frequently gained by feeding on food of too fattening a kind . A great mistake is made by many people when selecting their stock for breeding , both with fowls and the classes of poultry we are now considering . They know that they want to get size in their young ones , and consequently select @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eggs to set in order to increase their stock they find they have done wrong . Size of frame and moderate plumpness is necessary , but birds which are over-fed should be carefully avoided as they are most unsatisfactory to breed from . We know some farmers and cottagers who rear large numbers of ducklings for the market , and do not keep any stock birds themselves , preferring to buy the eggs . This is not always possible , however , and to those living outside the duck-rearing districts we believe it to be more profitable to keep their own stock ducks . Those who live on wooded land can do this to great advantage , as a plentiful supply of insect food can readily be obtained , and this is the very best food for stock ducks . REARING DUCKLINGS FOR TABLE . We will suppose that one is starting to keep ducks with the object of rearing ducklings for table . He will carefully select a flock of early hatched ducks and mate them with drakes procured from an entirely different strain , getting them settled down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get the ducks before they are fully matured rather than to leave it until they are on the point of laying , as moving throws them back considerably . Allow one drake to each four ducks . The question of the most suitable breed will naturally // occur to one at this point . We are greatly in favour of a cross-bred duck to get quick growers , as the entirely fresh blood thus obtained tends to success with the young ones . For marketing the white ducks are preferable , as their flesh is rather lighter in colour , and in the duck rearing districts we find that the people who have been at it all their lives go in for the white birds as they find that they get a better price for them . For rearing for market we can strongly re commend Aylesbury-Pekins . For local sale we do not find any better cross than the Rouen-Aylesbury , which grow very quickly and make extremely fine ducklings . London sales-men always give more for white ducklings ? a fact to bear in mind . Stock clucks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on nourishing but not fattening food . For breakfast , a mixture of middlings , ground oats and bran is to be recommended . In some districts a quantity of scraps of lean meat are to be had from the butchers for a d. per pound ; but where these are not to be obtained paunches or lights should be bought , and boiled for the ducks . The water should be used for mix-ing the morning meal ; and this should be given to them hot as soon as they leave their house in the morning . They do not require anything further until about four o'clock , when they should have a liberal feed of corn . In order to provide a change we recommend that the corn should be boiled three evenings a week , and be given whole the other four . Just before they go into their houses for the night give them as much boiled paunch or lights as they can eat . EARLY DUCKLINGS . The extra outlay for this meat is well repaid by the return in eggs ; stocks ducks thus fed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valuable , whereas those ducks which are fed on corn only or without the hot meal // for breakfast and meat for supper will frequently not commence until March and April . The highest prices are realised for the early ducklings : therefore it should be the aim of those who go in for profit to get the young ones out as early as possible . At eleven weeks old they should weigh over 5-lbs. each . Barley meal , crushed oats , maize meal and locust meal make a good mixture for feeding growing ducklings for table on . Some fatteners use greaves largely , but we much prefer paunches and lights boiled and cut up . Those who have very little space at their disposal , can rear a large number of ducklings easily , and where there is a ready sale for them nothing pays better . We have frequently seen from seven hundred to a thousand ducklings fed for market in a small garden with a couple of sheds . GEESE AND TURKEYS . It is not possible to rear turkeys under similar conditions , as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Those farmers and farmers ' wives who are most successful with their young turkeys give them fresh ground every year , as they do much better thus than when the young ones are allowed to run on the same ground year after year . We always consider that duck rearing can be done as well by cottagers as by farmers , but that geese and turkey rearing on a large scale is only possible when one has plenty of ground at command . Geese are very easy to rear but they are great eaters of grass . Those who are fortunate enough to live near a common or who have grass land can rear geese with success as they are very little trouble . The breeds generally kept are Toulouse and Embden , the former being grey in colour and the latter white . They are equally easy to rear , and a first cross between the two breeds makes very fine goslings. // For the first week the young ones require scalded biscuit meal and split groats soaked in milk , and after this they should have a liberal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chopped , and barley meal and ground oats mixed with milk ( if obtainable ) and boiled barley and maize at nights . This makes them grow very quickly , and if they can get as much grass as they like they will grow into very fine birds . There is at the present time a great demand for Chinese geese , which are excellent layers and quick growers , and altogether a different kind of table bird from the heavier breeds , as they carry but little offal and their flesh is of very good flavour . At Michaelmas there is a good demand for goslings , and as they are very little trouble to rear , and find a great part of their food if allowed to have their liberty , UJ SMALL CULTURE . they make an acceptable addition to a farmer 's income . A gander may run with six geese , and one gander will last for many years . The question of TURKEY REARING is one which has received a good deal of attention during the last few years . The prices realised last year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largest birds fetch a much higher price in proportion , and there is no difficulty experienced in disposing of any number of really fine birds . Those who rear a number of turkeys do well to run the smaller birds on until after Christmas as they fetch a better price in January , and if the weather happens to be mild in Christmas week the small birds sell at very low prices . In selecting stock , size of frame and depth of breast should be considered in preference to heavy weights . To breed satisfactorily , turkeys should be in hard condition , not fattened up in any way . Those young ones which are intended for stock birds should be separated from those which are to be fed up for Christmas sale ? about the end of October . The Cambridge Bronze turkey is the best of our English varieties , but these have been greatly improved by the introduction of a good deal of American Mammoth Bronze blood into them . This has increased the size of the progeny and the brilliancy of their plumage . We are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been imported by all the leading English breeders . A turkey cock will fertilise the eggs of twentyfive hens if he is put in the run with the hens just when required . In some villages one good turkey cock will serve the hens belonging to all the cottagers around , and we have often thought that an influential man might materially help his poorer neighbours by purchasing a really good male turkey and allowing the cottagers to bring their hens once during the season to be served by him . DUCKS , GEESE , AND TURKEYS. 6 j A turkey cock two years old is just in his prime . When using a cock which is over two years old one should be careful to notice that the bird is not too heavy for the hens , so as to prevent any injury being done to them . When a male bird is running with the hens all the time eight or ten birds should be allowed him , if the young ones from this number can be disposed of . As a rule the eggs from really good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essential , if success is to be obtained , to select hens which are quite unrelated to the cock they are mated with . IN-BREEDING IN TURKEYS is disastrous , as the stock produced are most difficult to rear ; many of them die at that most critical time when they get their red faces , and those which are reared do not put on weight as they should . fib SMALL CULTURE . In selecting stock turkeys in January , a suitable cockerel to mate with hens ( two or three years old ) will weigh from twenty-two to twenty-seven pounds , and the hens from sixteen to eighteen pounds . Early hatched pullets weighing from fourteen to sixteen pounds should be mated with a cockerel or cock of the age of two years . The latter should not weigh over twenty-eight pounds . It is a waste of time to allow the hen turkeys to set on their eggs , which should be put under reliable sitting hens which will hatch and rear the young turkeys better than the turkey hens . Undoubtedly the rearing of the young turkeys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goslings , as they must not be allowed out in the long wet grass at all , and if a shower comes on the young birds must be fetched in at once . We know several farmers ' wives who rear a good number of turkeys each year and keep a boy to bring the turkeys in when it rains and attend to the cleaning out of all houses and coops . If this is done we consider that farmers ' and cottagers ' wives can rear them more successfully than a man can , as the small details on which so much depends receive more careful attention from a woman than a man . In conclusion we would like to add that we have found , after many years ' experience , that if one wants to be successful in breeding fowls , ducks , turkeys , or geese , one must be careful to avoid in-breeding , over-feeding on maize , must supply both old and young birds with plenty of sharp flint grit to aid the digestion of their food , and must see that the sleeping houses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
