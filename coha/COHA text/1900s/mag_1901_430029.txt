 | I survive , To mock the expectation of the world : To frustrate prophecies , and to raze out Rotten opinion , who hath writ me down After my seeming . The tide of blood in me Hath proudly flowed in vanity till now , Now doth it turn . . . . . . . Presume not that I am the thing I was , For heaven doth know so shall the world perceive , That I have turned away my former self , So will I those that kept me company . ? HENRY IV. , Act 5 . I have a horror of gambling , and should always do my utmost to discourage others who have an inclination for it , as I consider that gambling , like intemperance , is one of the greatest curses which the country could be afflicted with. ? Letter from the Prince to the late Archbishop Benson , August 13 , 1891 . " PRINCE HAL is dead , and no mistake ! was the exclamation which burst from the lips of one who knew the Prince of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appearance at St. James ' Palace on the day after his mother 's death . " It was amazing , " said a member of the Privy Council , who was present on that occasion , " the change which we all noticed in the King . The Prince whom we knew so well seemed to have disappeared . In his place there stood a new being , between whom and ourselves there had suddenly sprung up an invisible but potent barrier . There was a dignity which we had never seen before , and we felt ourselves in the presence of a king . " The speaker was not a nobleman given to hysterics , and the impression made upon him was very deep . With his accession to the throne , Albert Edward seemed to have disappeared . In his place there stood Edward VII. , not weighed down , but rather inspired and lifted up , by a consciousness of his sovereignty . I. ? FROM PRINCE TO KING . The unthinking may deride the possibility of such a sudden transformation , and may ridicule the idea that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an old lady could have changed the outward appearance and infused a new spirit into the body of her son . But those who remember the immense tradition which surrounds and to some extent glorifies the English throne will see nothing improbable or unnatural in the effect which this event produced upon the latest of our sovereigns . Shakespeare in a famous scene has described a more miraculous transformation , which was effected when the death of Henry IV . made Madcap Hal one of the soberest and most resolute of English monarchs . The consciousness of his inheritance , the subtle but potent influence of his monarchical succession , compared with which the influence of apostolical succession upon the clergy is but a trifle light as air , would suffice to explain the change . Twenty-four hours before , the Prince had been a cipher in the state . He was heir-apparent , no doubt , but he was outside the machine , a master of ceremonies , a leader of society . The consecrating touch of supreme responsibility had never been laid upon his head . When the Queen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to quote the old phrase ? made him actual sovereign of the world-wide empire of Britain . He stepped in one moment from the outer court of the tabernacle to the very arcanum of the constitution . To others it may seem a mere figure of speech to speak of the army and the navy as becoming his army and his navy ; but to the Prince it is a very real thing . THE STEADYING INFLUENCE OF RESPONSIBILITY . It was impossible for the son of Victoria not to take his sovereignty seriously . It is the fashion , or rather it was the fashion , in some quarters to treat the position of the sovereign in a constitutional state as being little more than that of a mere figurehead of the civil state . The Queen , however , never for a moment entertained such a conception of her royal duties ; and her successor , from the very fact that he had been so long jealously excluded from all share in the discharge of the duties of the crown , might naturally regard them even more seriously than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and it is no paradox to say that during all the sixty years of his life the Prince has had nothing but a very distant view of the actual exercise of sovereign power . Wisely or unwisely , Queen Victoria was of an excessively jealous disposition in all that related to the crown . So far from making the Prince an understudy and preparing him to take her place whenever she might be invalided or indisposed , she rigorously restricted him to the performance of ceremonial  | functions . He was never her confidential adviser on affairs of state . His one duty , front a political point of view , in the eyes of his august mother , was to efface himself , to abstain religiously from the expression of any opinion upon public affairs . The Prince was not merely a loyal subject of the Queen ; lie was brought up to honor and obey his mother , and his filial affection was never devoid of a certain element of fear . But on that day when he was proclaimed King , he suddenly found himself invested in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and undefinable , of the attributes of sovereignty , from which he had all his life been so rigorously shut out . It is not much wonder that the effect of so instantaneous a change made itself visible even to every observer . KING AT LAST . He looked a king ? yes , every inch a king ; and to-day his subjects are looking forward with expectant hope to see him display on the great field on which he has a right to preeminent domain . Many of the associates of the Prince of Wales will laugh to scorn the idea that their old companion of the former days should be capable of blossoming out in one year into a serious sovereign . Those who writ him down after his seeming questioned whether he were capable of the high mission of playing the great rOle in the governance of his realm which had been so long filled by his mother . Those , however , who enjoyed his intimacy maintained that there is nothing that he would like better than to essay his powers in this new field . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by others who long before they attained their sixtieth year were vested with all the panoply of sovereignty . Many years ago the Prince commented somewhat plaintively upon the difference between him and his nephew , the Kaiser . " Look at my nephew , " he said . " He is but a youth ; he is the center of everything , he orders everything , directs everything , is everything ; whereas I am not allowed to do anything at all . " THE EXAMPLE OF THE KAISER . Some have even gone further than this , and maintained that he has even cherished the ambition of being as influential in the British empire as the Kaiser is in Germany . Ten years ago a writer in Lippincott 's Magazine , of the name of Frank A. Burr , made a statement as to the Prince 's view of time role of monarch in the British Constitution which will be read to-day with some misgivings in many quarters . Mr. Burr declared that the Prince and the German Emperor saw eye to eye upon this question , and added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Albert Edward to assume the reins of government he will hold them with even a firmer hand than does his mother . While it would be impossible for him to dominate England as the Emperor does Germany , on account of the different conditions of the two nations , still he would impart a new vigor to government such as Great Britain has not known for many years . " In Mr. Burr 's opinion , such a change would not be unwelcome by his subjects . He adds that Mr. Chauncey Depew was of opinion that the Prince of Wales was one of the strongest men he had ever met , one so full of practical resources that he had a right to be regarded as a somewhat remarkable man . Most Englishmen will , however , be disposed to agree with Mr. Justin McCarthy , when he said But whatever may happen in Germany , it is certain that we could not have the King of England uprearing his crest in this ostentatiously heroic fashion . The Prince of Wales has shown of late years , at all events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . and the limitations of his functions as heir to the throne . He will , I have no doubt , show , when he comes to the throne , that he understands his part in that more responsible position just as well . But admitting that Mr. McCarthy is right , no one can follow the course of recent events , or have any acquaintance with the inner history of the court , without recognizing that our constitution affords ample field and scope enough to satisfy the most exalted ambition which Edward VII . is likely to entertain . THE KING 'S OWN IDEA OF KINGSHIP . As to the King 's own ideas upon the proper role of a constitutional sovereign , we are not left in the dark . Four years ago I published my ' ' Studies of the Sovereign and the Reign , " in which I set forth what in some Radical quarters was regarded as a very extreme doctrine as to the active influence continuously exerted by the sovereign in the direction of the policy of the empire . I had the honor to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exposition as far the most accurate statement of the actual workings of the modern monarchy in a democratic state which he had ever read . This entirely coincides with the tenor of his conversation with Gambetta in 1878 , when Gambetta met the Prince in Paris , and lunched with him at the Hotel Bristol . HIS CONVERSATION WITH M. GAMBETTA . In the course of the conversation the Prince let fall a remark which is well worth recalling to-day . Speaking about the monarchy , especially  | in its relation to the inner history of the foreign policy of the Queen 's reign , he told Gambetta that he would do well to read Baron Stockmar 's Memoirs , which Gambetta had never seen . The Prince promised to send Gambetta a copy of the book , which he did shortly afterward . We may take it , therefore , that Edward VII . accepts a theory of the duties and responsibilities of the crown which was expounded by Stockmar , and which I described in actual working in the history of the late reign . It is interesting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ republican statesman . ' ' The Prince , " said Gambetta , " shows a decided taste for foreign politics . He knows a great deal about them , but I should say that a life free from strain of every sort can not be a favorable condition for their study . He is well informed and shrewd , but he has not a keen or a subtle mind , and I imagine that he would be no match for sharp Americans or for wily Russians . " In discussing the prime ministers of the Queen , the Prince gave the highest place to Sir Robert Feel , which somewhat surprised Gambetta , who had never appreciated the statesman who abolished the Corn Laws , regarding him as a minor light compared with Cobden . The Prince recommended him to read Sir Robert Peel 's speeches . He took the advice of the Prince , but was not impressed . He thought Peel 's speeches lacked the mouvement oratoire , and could not for a moment be compared with the exquisite spoken essays of Lord Salisbury , or the strong , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Prince spoke with strong appreciation of the high personal character of all his mother 's prime ministers , and from this encomium he did not exempt , somewhat to Gambetta 's surprise , Lord Beaconsfield . He praised Gladstone also , but without enthusiasm , which was not surprising , considering that'the meeting took place in 1878 , at the moment when Lord Beaconsfield 's star was in the ascendant , and Mr. Gladstone was nder a cloud at court owing to the vehemence of his anti-Turkish enthusiasm . Of Lord Salisbury , who had not yet been prime minister , the Prince spoke with much appreciation . He said be was a highly accomplished and very clever man , whose speeches , from a literary point of view , were much superior to those of Mr. Gladone . ' ' Salisbury , " said the Prince , " never forgot that he was the descendant of Cecil , the eat minister of Queen Elizabeth , and studied his methods . " The Queen liked him because he was not Utopian ; he had no objection to republicanism as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitution of Great Britain , believresidents on business matters . He seemed to hear all that was going on , too often in an upside-down fashion , and all the news and gossip into the bargain ; but I have often heard it regretted that it was impossible to tell the Prince how things really stood . Kings may love those who speak the truth , but I suspect they very seldom have that felicity . I tried once or twice to put in a little wedge of business when honored with the opportunity of conversing with his royal highness , but he was quite unapproachable upon estate matters ; and as " manners are manners , " I could not , when invited to his house , or when the royalties came to Appleton , intrude subjects upon him that he did not choose to hear . On the other hand , it is easy to understand that this complaint on the part of a tenant who wished to air her grievances to her landlord does not amount to much . HIS QUICKNESS OF APPREHENSION , An anonymous writer in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popular impression that the Prince lacked both the intelligence and the interest to take an active part in public affairs , recalls an incident that took place apparently in connection with the anti-Jewish agitation which raged some years ago in Russia . He says : Here is an instance that came within my personal knowledge . A few years ago an attempt was ' made by certain philanthropists to influence the sovereign of a Continental nation in favor of a certain class of his people who were suffering from ill treatment , which was not known ? so it was believed ? to the sovereign in question . Circumstances so complicated the matter that the mere study of the facts , so as to grasp the situation , was no mean test of any man 's abilities . The Prince sent for the person concerned in the negotiations , and listened attentively ? but without taking a note ? to a long statement bristling with technicalities and side issues . Shortly afterward his royal highness again sent for his informant , and read to him a lengthy letter , of at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wales , who happened at the time to be staying at a court where the sovereign concerned was also a guest . This letter was a masterly description of the whole situation , without omitting one essential point or including an irrelevancy , and was , in short , a document that indicated an endowment of memory and intellect given to few professional lawyers or statesmen . When the special request involved was granted , no one knew that to the Prince of Wales was due the gratitude of those he had secretly helped . It may be added that this episode took place at Homburg , where the Prince is not generally believed to devote himself to secret and laborious philanthropy . The incident is only one of a number . HIS DESULTORY MIND . It must be admitted that in conversation the Prince , who is now the King , did not impress the company with the sense of sustained and concentrated attention . His conversation is essentially desultory . After talking apparently  | with deep interest upon a subject for a few minutes , he will fly off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some strange association of ideas with that in hand ; and his listeners , perforce , are compelled to follow him . This gives an impression of superficiality and lack of concentration , which may be got over when the King comes to deal with the graver affairs of state . It is the fault of the outsider , of the man who sits in the royal box , watching a performance in which he takes no part . His mind glances rapidly from one subject to another , and seldom seems to dwell long enough upon any point to make it thoroughly his own . On the other hand , when once he gets into a rut , he sticks to it . HIS CAPACITY FOR WORK . He works steadily at the Imperial Institute and at the Royal College of Music , to mention only two among the many subjects into which he puts his whole heart . When the was serving on the Royal Commission for the Housing of the Poor , no commissioner was more painstaking and industrious . He also sat on the Commission for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did not fail in his attendance , or in the attention which he paid to the subject under discussion . So far from being bored by these two commissions , it was a great disappointment to him when Lord Salisbury refused to place him upon the Labor Commission . It is probable that what the King would say , if he were talking frankly about his apparent shortcoming , is that he deserves to be pitied rather than to be blamed . He certainly pitied himself . He considered that he was continually trying to do things , and then being pulled up short just as he thought he saw a chance of making a hit . He would also say , and say truly , that it was no use grinding up political questions , seeing that he could take no part in them ; that Church questions did not interest him , but that no one could possibly be a greater expert in the one subject in which he was allowed more or less of a free hand . A SOCIAL UMPIRE . In all matters of society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom I have frequently quoted , says : The Prince of Wales is understood to be a great stickler for court etiquette . No one knows better the exact way in which every band and order and medal should be worn . He is very particular about good manners in princes and princesses , and I have heard that there is a near connection of his by marriage who is often lectured severely on the impropriety of losing his temper when giving directions to servants . The Prince is a social umpire of the utmost authority , and no end of personal disputes are settled satisfactorily by a reference to his good-natured and genial , but firm , counsel . It may seem a small thing to know how orders should be worn , and how delicate questions of precedence should be settled ; but it is not so in reality . When talking to an eminent French diplomatist about the comparative difficulty of different kinds of disputes , I remarked that small domestic disputes were often quite as difficult to arrange as great affairs of state . " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do not agree with you . They are much more difficult . Most diplomatic questions are child 's play compared with the differences which arise in one 's own household . " " If , therefore , " the King may fairly say , I have in dealing with these more difficult and delicate but less apparently important questions displayed a tact which all admire and a judgment to which all men bow , and have discharged those functions for twenty years without making one serious fault , may I not fairly hope that when I come to deal as King with questions of state , I shall prove not less success-ful ? " It may be so , we all hope that it will be so . One thing at least is certain ? the King will have much less leisure than the Prince , and the force of circumstances will necessarily and inevitably relegate into the background the recreative part of his existence . IN CONCLUSION . I conclude this sketch by quoting one of the few contributions which the King has ever made to the autobiographical literature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dislikes , " the following entry , says the Gem , appears in the Duchess of Fife 's album over the signature of the Prince of Wales : I am happiest when I have no public engagement to fulfill ; when I can forget that I am " Your Royal Highness ; " when I can smoke a really good cigar and read ( must I confess it ? ) a good novel on the quiet ; when I can , like plain Mr. Jones , go to a race meeting without it being chronicled in the papers next day that " His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales has taken to gambling very seriously , and yesterday lost more money than ever he can afford to pay ; " when I can shake hands with and talk to Sir Edward Clarke without it being rumored that " The Prince of Wales is violently opposed to the present war ; " when I can spend a quiet evening at home with the Princess and my family . I am unhappiest when I have a raging toothache and have to attend some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I never had a pain in my life . brought them to their bearings , and they had to go with as good a grace as could be assumed , relieving their minds of a few mutterings and wonderments at the royalties " making themselves so common , and that the line should be drawn somewhere . " The Sandringham festivities were so arranged that all classes could share in then ; and what with county farmers ' hand-servants ' balls , laborers ' dinners , visits to country-houses , meets of the hounds , and other sociabilities , everybody from far and near had the opportunity of making acquaintance with their royal highnesses . " Bustle about , " said Lord Beaconsfield to a young man who asked his opinion upon the best way of getting on in life . " Bustle about , get hold of the press , and shake hands with everybody " might have been the advice of that astute connoisseur of human nature to the heir to the throne , in whose case policy and pleasure are happily combined , he so thoroughly enjoys going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ houses , and inquiring how they live and what they do . Headaches and nerves must bean unknown quantity to him . He loves a mob , a noise , and a crowd , is always on the stir about something , and would find repose and quiet the most grievous infliction . I believe all England would be invited to Sandringham , if they could be crammed in , and every one from the highest to the lowest treated with hospitality and made to feel welcome and at home . HIS PHYSICAL ENERGY . The third point upon which her evidence is most valuable relates to a faculty which the King is not usually credited with possessing . I refer to that of sheer physical energy . An impression prevails that the King , who has attained his sixtieth year , has more or less burned up , his vital energy in a rapid life of forty years . He never was a man keenly devoted to exhausting physical exercise . No one has ever pictured him as an athlete , although he has gone deer . stalking . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impression has gained ground that he is somewhat -- if not exactly languid yet ? of a tepid temperament , In other words , the impression is general that his initial stock of energy has been so heavily drawn upon that there is not much left . This , to a certain extent , is true . He has not got the demonic force of Mr. Gladstone or of the German Emperor . But those who know him best maintain that he has a far greater store of physical vitality than is generally believed . " You are quite wrong , " said a friend to me the other day , " in thinking that he has no energy . He has plenty of energy . You wait and see if he does not exert it . " The following quotation bears on this point . Mrs. Cresswell , speaking of the servants ' parties at the Hall , says : The house-party , equerries , ladies-in-waiting , and all invited from the neighborhood , were ordered to join in , no shirking or sitting out allowed , and when the sides p 300 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their partners , round and round , down the middle and up again , and so on to the end , the Prince the jolliest of the jolly and the life of the party , as he is wherever he goes . I never saw such amazing vitality . His own master of the ceremonies , signaling and sending messages to the band , arranging every dance , and when to begin and when to leave off , noticing the smallest mistake in the figures , and putting the people in their places . In the " Triumph , " which is such an exhausting dance , he looked as if he could have gone on all night and into the middle of next week without stopping , and I really believe he could . He is an antidote to every text and sermon that ever was preached upon the pleasures of the world palling upon the wearied spirit . They never pall upon his , and year after year he comes up " to time " with renewed capacity for revelry and junketings . Almost before one dance was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pipers would screech out and the Prince would fold his arms and fling himself into a Highland fling , and so on fast and furious until far into the small hours of the morning . This book was written twenty years ago , and it is hardly fair to expect a man of sixty to be the man that he was at forty ; but the King is much better preserved than his subjects generally believe , and in the picture of the Prince in the Sandringham ballroom we may see an image of the King that is to be . What the Prince was in the midst of his guests , so the King would like to be in the midst of his court . A governing directing mind , with an eye that sees everything , with a tact which foresees everything , the whole man thoroughly alert , instinct with kindly feeling , and anxious above all things to avoid any contretemps , and to make things go well , ? that is the King that Edward VIl. will be if the promises of his reign at Sandringham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is all very well , some will say . He may be a very good king of a court ; but that is very different from being Supreme Lord of the British Empire , to say nothing of the Transvaal . But let us go one step at a time . The court is nearer to the King than the empire , and his rule in the court is more absolute than in the administration of imperial affairs . It is in the court that the King 's personal influence may be most directly felt , and from the court that influence is diffused throughout all the various strata of society , down to the very lowest . Those who remember how even costermonger girls emulated the Alexandra limp when our present Queen suffered from an illness which temporarily crippled her will not question the far-pervading influence of the circle which centers round the King . The influence of the Queen on the court in the early years of her reign was admittedly immense ; and many are the lugubrious forebodings as to the effect of the change of sovereign . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less in retreat . She was an august figure , but a kind of Veiled Prophet of Khorassan , formidable and feared , but not the living and restraining influence which she was in her early days . There has been practically no court for years . A levee or a drawing-room does not constitute a court . It is not so much a new court as a resurrected court which we have to anticipate , and the influence of that court is not likely to be the same as that of the early Victorian era . If we may judge from the example of Sandringham , the resurrected court will be much more free and easy than that over which the Queen presided . The King may have become a new man , but it is improbable that he has entirely lost his liking for being amused . As Mr. Justin McCarthy says : I have no doubt that many of the indiscretions of his younger and wilder days came from his delight in the companionship of those who amused him and helped him to make life pass pleasantly for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actors and singers and the tellers of good stories and the makers of good jokes , and he delights in the theaters , is made gladsome by the burlesque , scorns not the ballet , has no conscientious objection to short skirts . The same instinct will probably lead him to welcome to his court many persons who would not have been received by the Queen . Those who think that Queen Alexandra will put any serious check upon this tendency will find little to justify them in the Sandringham precedent . The Princess received at Sandringham all those whom the Prince cared to invite ; nor does she seem to have placed any restrictions even upon the most objectionable incursion of wealthy nobodies who descended upon Sandringham at the time of the annual horse sales , and paid for the hospitality by liberal purchases of the Prince 's blood stock . Of course , this complaisance may have been compelled by the exigencies of finance . Needs must when the devil drives , as the old proverb says ; and it is not well to look a gift horse in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who bring lavish gifts in the shape of fancy prices for yearlings . At the same time , it is hard to feel that there may not be some truth when Mrs. Cresswell says : Without wishing the Princess of Wales to become strong-minded or lose her unique identity , an occasional stand against some of the most notorious characters , instead of ignoring , condoning , and receiving all alike , might be desirable in the interest of morality ; and though the Princess suits the nation so well , the Duchess of Edinburgh would perhaps make a better leader of society . That tres grande dame , with her Romanoff temper and determination , would soon make a clean sweep within the precincts of the court , which ,  | as the court reigns supreme in all social matters , might lead to better things . FALSTAFF , PISTOL &; CO . The money necessity , however , no longer exists . The King has a civil list adequate to the discharge of the duties of his high position , and the Jew money-lender or vulgar plutocrat will no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presence . There are some who hope that the Prince will address his former boon companions who have betted with him on the turf , or shared with him the fascination of " bridge , " as Henry V. addressed Sir John Falstaff and his friends . He provided them with a maintenance , but forbade them to come within ten miles of his presence . The edict would be rather mournful reading for some persons , but if it were published in the Gazette the majority of the subjects who read it would rejoice to know that the Prince meant business , and had definitely turned over a new leaf . Without indulging in any expectations of so drastic a measure as the banishment of the Prince 's smart set beyond the ten-mile radius of the royal person , there is reason to hope that the Prince will replace them gradually by more serious persons , who have a real interest in the affairs of the empire , and in the improvement of the condition of the people . A DEMOCRATIC COURT . Is it possible , I wonder , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court in the midst of a democratic people ? At present our monarch has always been the sovereign of the well-to-do . So far as social intercourse is concerned , the court exists for the upper ten thousand . The forty millions are left outside . This may be desirable from the point of view both of the blueblooded patrician and the austere republican . The former objects to see royalty making itself cheap . The latter objects to the corruption of the masses of the people by extending to them the blandishments of a court . But the King might do worse for his throne and for his realm than eagerly to seize every opportunity of rnaking the picked leaders of the working class , the representatives of the toiling multitude , whose labor is the basis of the social pyramid , feel that they were as welcome guests in the palace as any peer or potentate in the land . THE FATHER OF HIS PEOPLE . Who can estimate how much might be done by well-considered action in this direction ? What an incentive to individual exertions , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into many a dingy workshop if it came to be CHARACTER SKETCH . 301 the rule that any handicraftsman eminent among his fellows for skill , any humble inventor who , had improved the tools which are the weapons of civilization , or any man of the humble artists , engineers , or artificers upon whose deftness of hand and sureness of touch depend the stability of our industrial preeminence , would be sought out and invited to the presence of the King , not at formal levees of courtly popinjays , but in those familiar assemblies in which the opportunity was afforded , without ostentation , pomp , or expenditure , to come into personal contact with the sovereign , and to feel the keen and kindly interest with which they were regarded by the sovereign who was the father of his people . It is all nonsense saying that it would bore the King to meet a dozen workingmen , each king of his own craft . It would be indeed a welcome change from the humdrum monotony of London society . " THE FOUNT " OF HONOR FOR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development . All those who distinguish themselves by special merit in any department ? the sailor who risks his life to save the drowning comrade , the engine-driver who by Ins magnificent courage snatches a whole train from imminent destruction , the nurse who glorifies her divine calling by some signal instance of heroism and self-sacrifice , ? all distinguished types of human service , all eminent examples of human heroism , especially in humble life , might be sought out and welcomed . To be received at court , instead of being regarded as a mere item in the routine of the plutocrat or the peer , would come to be the recognized guerdon of merit , the stamp affixed by royalty on all those who have truly served the state in public or private life , in low as well as in high positions . That this would be entirely in accordance with the mind of the King , with his keen popular instinct , and with his shrewd common sense , I have no doubt . It will require some nerve and resolution to take the initiative , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not sometimes dare ? III. ? THE KING AT WORK AND AT PLAY . There is no royal road to success , in kingship or in any other department of public service , that is not based upon hard work . If Queen Victoria distinguished herself as a sovereign , it was because she ground up her facts , interviewed everybody , and stuck to her business . Will the King prove to be a good worker ? The answer to that is whether or not he has been trained to industry .  | There is no doubt that in his youth his parents made him work with a vengeance . They probably overdid it , for those who knew him in his teens were rather impressed with the fact that he seemed both cowed and sad . HIS EARLY TRAINING . When thirteen years old he was described by his governess as ' ; extremely shy and timid , with very good principles , and particularly an exact observer of truth . " When he was seventeen , Prince Metternich noticed that he had " an embarrassed and sad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first visit to Paris , and enjoyed himself extremely . He begged the Empress Eugenie to get leave from his mother for the Princess Royal to stay a little longer . " Oh , " said the Empress , " I am sure the Queen and the Prince Consort will never be able to do without you . " " Not do without us ! " cried the boy . " Do n't fancy that , for there are six more of us at home , and they do not want us . " The Queen , however , was obdurate . The Queen and the Prince Consort spared no pains to give the future King of England the best possible education that could be procured . Perhaps they rather overdid it . At any rate , such was the opinion of Punch , who , under the title of " A Prince at High Pressure , " described the process of cram to which he was subjected in kindly but doggerel verse , a copy of a stanza of which may be quoted as a sample : To the south @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Where at hands Presbyterian pure science is quaffed , The Prince , in a trice , is whipped to the Isis , Where Oxford keeps springs medieval on draught . Dipped in gray Oxford mixture ( lest that prove a fixture ) , The poor lad 's to be plunged in less orthodox Cam , where dynamics and statics , and pure mathematics , Will be piled on his brain 's awful cargo of cram . THE PRINCE S'AMUSE . It was perhaps not altogether unnatural that when the Prince came to man 's estate , and he was free to unstring the bow which had been so tightly strung , there should have been considerable reaction in the other direction . The Prince flung himself with such zest into the business of amusing himself that many people imagined it was his only object in life . What he did he did heartily , and displayed a certain boyish exuberance of high spirits which led him to play many practical jokes . In his early married days the guests at Sandringham used to be the victims of practical jokes which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schoolboy than that of the heir-apparent to the English throne . To make up an apple-pie bed , to roll a guest in the snow , or to stuff up his dress-coat pockets with sticky sweets are among some of the pranks which he played on those whom the knew could be used as butts for this roystering humor . In after years , when he sobered down somewhat , he still spent much of his time in recreation , although this was tempered by a considerable allowance of what may be called the ceremonial sentry-go of his position . On this subject a good deal has been written . A SNEER AND AN APOLOGY , An American writing some years ago on the way in which the Prince of Wales spent his time waxed sarcastic in speaking of the severe labors of the heir-apparent . He said that he had before him a list of the Prince 's engagements compiled from the papers from January 1 to September 30 , 1890 . It is for the most part a list of the engagements of a man of pleasure . Every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admirable manner in which he fills his position . He is deservedly popular with the racing community . Twenty-eight race meetings were honored with his royal highness ' presence . Thirty times he went to the theater . Forty-three times he went to dinner-parties , banquets , balls , garden-parties , and concerts . Eleven attendances at the House of Lords ; and the official and charitable engagements , together amounting to forty-five occasions , practically complete the record of the public life of the Prince of Wales while in London during the year 1890 . Facts came to the writer 's knowledge which convinced him that injustice had been done to the Prince ; that the latter not only knows a great deal more of how the poorer classes live than many of those who cry him down ; but that his royal highness is deeply and sincerely penetrated with earnest desire to help them , and is constantly engaged in doing so . Upon this the writer publicly withdrew what he had written , and wrote to the Prince 's secretary to say what he had done . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I venture to record one passage from the letter received in reply : He ( the Prince of Wales ) can not help feeling that you are a little hard and unjust upon him in your book ; he says unjust , because you evidently wrote about him without knowing his real character . There are many things which he is obliged to do which the outside world would call pleasures and amusements . They are , however , often anything but a source of amusement to him , though his position demands that he should every year go through a certain round of social duties which constantly bore him to death . But while duly recording those social " pleasures , " you pass over very lightly all the more serious occupations of his life ; and I may mention , as a proof of what he does , that during the last week of ? he opened , or laid the first stone of , three polytechnics , and opened the ? at ? . I much doubt whether many of the Social Republicans who are so fond of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE RING AND THE TURF , In racing circles and with sportsmen the King is a popular favorite :  | The Prince 's racing colors consist of a purple satin body , faced with gold braid ; the sleeves are scarlet , and the cap black velvet , with gold fringe . On a race-course they first made their appearance on April 15 , 1880 , in a military steeplechase at Aldershot . The royal colors were registered as far back as 1875 , but it was not until June 4 , 1886 , that they were sported on the flat . Up to and including the Sandown Eclipse Stakes , won by Diamond Jubilee , the Prince of Wales since starting flat racing in 1886 had won seventy races , worth ? 92,014 . In 1896 he won a dozen races , worth ? 26,819 ; yet , with the St. Leger , Diamond Jubilee in value may surpass his own brother 's record . The winning of Derbies and the excitement of the turf naturally loom much more before the public eye than the collar-work of royalty , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a good memory . When he attended public functions , he could deliver a speech which had been prepared for him as faultlessly as if he had made it himself on the spur of the moment . He is no orator , but he has developed a style of speaking ? afterdinner speaking especially ? which has considerable merits . An Irish observer , not too favorably disposed , says of him : He speaks directly and to the point . He never obtrudes himself between the audience and the business of the occasion . He never uses the wrong word , and he never says a word too much . He puts as little of himself as possible into his speeches ; and while there is always a firm and manful tone about him , there is never any indication whatever of a desire to impose himself and his position on his audience . A GOOD COMMITTEE MAN . As a chairman of a committee every one agrees that he is admirable , and few better tests of business capacity can be imagined . Uniformly suave , courteous , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point , and gets things put through in a way that does him credit . His attendance at committees over which he does not preside is exemplary for punctuality and attention to the business in hand . In such institutions as the Royal Agricultural Society , of which he is a member , he has set an example to Other members for the painstaking care with which He attends their meetings and participates in their Discussions . His estates at Sandringham are said to be admirably managed , although authorities differ as to the extent to which he personally takes part in the business . A MAN OF BUSINESS . Mrs. Cresswell , whom I have quoted already , says : During my long residence on his property , I never heard of the Prince receiving or listening to any of the ing that nothing so good could be obtained if it was cast away . THE CROWN IN THE CONSTITUTION . " In my judgment , " said Mr. Balfour , in moving the vote of condolence in the House of Commons , " the importance of the crown in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is increasing and must increase . " Mr. Balfour may be right , but even if the influence of the crown on the constitution does not increase and merely remains at the high-water mark to which it was advanced by the Queen , it is high time we recognized the immense importance of the monarch in the councils of the empire . The sovereign has been described as the permanent under-secretary of the prime minister , but I prefer my own definition , which is that the Queen made herself the permanent editor of the realm . While she never dictated , she influenced , and although she never arrogated to herself a prerogative of command , she exercised constantly the far more subtle and influential power of expostulation and argument . It is , of course , impossible for Edward VII . to succeed to the immense inheritance of experience and personal prestige which made the Queen , according to the testimony of all her ministers , so potent in foreign and imperial affairs . THE TESTIMONY OF MINISTERS . Lord Salisbury said : She showed a wonderful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action of her ministers , and in the course of legislation and reform , which no one could mistake . She always maintained and represented a regular supervision over public affairs , giving to her ministers her frank advice , and warning them of danger when she saw there was danger ahead . No minister in her long reign ever disregarded her advice , or pressed her to disregard it , without afterward feeling that he had incurred a dangerous responsibility . " Lord Kimberley , speaking as representative of the Liberal cabinet , quoted a saying of Lord Clarendon , when they were discussing some measure of public policy : " Let us have the Queen 's opinion . The Queen 's opinion is always worth hearing . " Lord Kimberley added that on one occasion on which he had urged his own views strongly upon the Queen , she ultimately gave way , warning him that the time would come when he would regret his attitude . " I well remember , " said Lord Kimberley , " afterward when I met her I frankly and properly owned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than mine . ' "  | THE SECRET OF THE QUEEN 'S ASCENDENCY In those cases , however , it was the extraordinary and profound knowledge which she possessed of public affairs and the clearness of her judgment which gave her that remarkable ascendency that she wielded for so many years . These qualities are not inherent in every occupant of the throne . The Prince may inherit the crown and grasp the scepter of his mother , but her wisdom , her memory , her intuitive insight , are qualities that can not be transmitted from mother to son . Nevertheless , the fact that she had those qualities , and exercised them with such unexampled success , gives to her successor a vantage-ground which only unexpected ineptitude or a headstrong obstinacy could ever prevent him from using . That he will endeavor to take advantage of his high position , and discharge his duties according to his lights , may be taken for granted . ADVANTAGES OF THE ENGLISH MONARCHY . Whatever republicans may think of the abstract superiority of that form of government , no one can deny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embodied in a person who has been carefully trained for that position from the cradle , and who in attaining it has not been compelled to make intense political enemies of one-half of the nation . To have created a center of equilibrium in the midst of all the forces which surge and sway hither and thither in the turmoil and strain of modern life , to have made this center a source of all information and a symbol of all dominion , to have secured it at once from the strife of tongues and the conflicts of parties , without at the same time endangering the liberties of the subject or the supremacy of law , ? this , indeed , has been one of the most signal achievements of the Englishspeaking race . II. ? A SANDRINGHAMIZED COURT . What kind of a king will he be , this Edward VII. , who was last month proclaimed King of Great Britain and Ireland and Emperor of Hindustan ? The man he was , we all know ; the king he will be , who can say ? And yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will act now that he has been raised to the throne , for while in London at Marlborough House , at Windsor , at Osborne , at Balmoral , he has only been the Prince , there was one place in the world in which he reigned as undisputed king . In all other parts of the empire he was only heir apparent , but Sandringham , in the county of Norfolk , was a kind of little kingdom in which he has for many years exercised almost all the royal prerogatives . On Sandringham the shadow of the Victorian throne never fell . In Norfolk , his will there was none to dispute . Elsewhere the Prince was trammeled by endless limitations , and cabined , cribbed , and confined by innumerable restrictions upon his freedom of action . At Sandringham he was a law unto himself . There he held a kind of royal court , and lived and moved among devoted subjects to whom his slightest wish was law . Of course , it would be somewhat precipitate to argue that the Prince will transfer to Buckingham Palace and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but we may fairly argue that the distinctive characteristics which displayed themselves at Sandringham will make themselves visible when the lord of Sandringham is elevated to a higher sphere . This is indeed a thing of good augury , for if the past of Sandringham enables us to interpret the future of Buckingham Palace , then the omens are favorable , for at Sandringham the Prince realized to an extent hitherto almost incredible the conception of a democratic prince . Whether the democratic prince of Sandringham will be a democratic monarch , no one can say ; he may change in that as in other things . But the instinct of the man would tell in that direction . His life at Sandringham has been described ad nauseam by a thousand pens , mostly wielded by men who had every motive , professional and personal , for painting everything coulcer de rose . AN UNIMPEACHABLE WITNESS . As their narrative must be discounted , I prefer to quote the description of a former tenant on the Sandringham estate , who believed that she had the strongest personal and financial reasons for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little book " Eighteen Years on the Sandringham Estate " farmed several hundred acres of land in the immediate proximity of the royal residence . She had differences with her landlord , or rather with his agent , on various questions in which that of game figured rather conspicuously ; but she ultimately gave up her holding . Instead of being compensated for the capital she had sunk in her farm , she was , according to her own account , a loser by several thousands of pounds ? a fact which apparently impelled her to write the little book as a kind of getting even with the Prince . An aggrieved tenant who considers that her landlord has caused her to lose several thousand pounds , it must be admitted , is not a witness likely to be prejudiced in favor of that landlord , and anything that she may say to his credit may be regarded as matter beyond dispute . Hence the importance of the following extracts , which  | bring into clear relief three prominent characteristics of the Prince , one of which every one knew , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the third was by no means matter of common knowledge . HIS PASSION FOR PLEASING . My first extract relates to what NIT .. Smalley once described as the Prince 's pleasure in being pleasant , . and the pains which he will take to please other people . That is itself a good quality for any man to have , and an admirable disposition on the part of a sovereign . Mrs. Cresswell says : Whenever I went ( to Sandringham ) I never failed to spend a pleasant evening , and received more courtesy from my illustrious host and hostess than from any house I ever was in . The Prince is noted for his powers of entertainment and exertion to make every one enjoy themselves . When a " house-party " is expected , he superintends the arrangements and remembers their particular tastes and pursuits . A gouty squire who ice grumbled at having to go was completely mollified at finding a room prepared for him on the ground floor , the Prince thinking he would prefer it . The effect of a visit to Sandringham upon a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatest deference , is perfectly astounding . It acts as a patent conjuring machine ? a republican stuffed in at one end , a courtier squeezed out at the other . This , it may be said , is matter of universal knowledge . Every one knows that the Prince has a kindly disposition , and that he likes to make people feel at ease . An American who had been presented to the Prince of Wales at Homburg once told me that he must be a good fellow , because he had talked to him " just like any common gentleman . " HIS CONTEMPT FOR SOCIAL " SIDE . " But the second characteristic on which I quote Mrs. Cresswell 's testimony is not quite so well known ? namely , the extent to which the Prince went at Sandringham , and offended the exclusive ideas of the county families of Norfolk by the generous range of his hospitality . On this point Mrs. Cresswell says : Being wounded in the tenderest point , the squiresses attempted a slight rebellion . They considered , and with some reason , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own class , or perhaps to a few outsiders , duly introduced and patronized by themselves . In former days they were fairly " select , " but of late years had been turned into an omnium gatherum ; had degenerated into a crush , for almost any one can get an invitation , so the glory and honor has departed . They began to make excuse and stay away , in some instances glad to escape the expense of new dresses ? a serious consideration in times of agricultural depression and reduced rentals . His royal highness very speedily noticed the omission , read the riot act , and
