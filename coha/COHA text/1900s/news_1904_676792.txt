txt Ex-Senator Henry G. Davis of West Vir- ' ginia , the Democratic Vice Presidential canarrived at the Fifth Ayenue Hotel early last evening from Philadelphia , having stopped off there for a short time en route from Baltimore . The ex-Senator walked with a springy step , not a bit like a man of eighty-three , as his tall form appeared in the lobby . He carried in one hand a grip of antique architecture , and under the other arm a parcel wrapped in a newspaper . When pressed for details he admitted that it contained a nightshirt . " I have come over to discus 's " campaign matters , to meet the party managers again , and to see how things look , " said Mr. Davis in reply to questions . " What are your plans , Senator " " Do n't know yet . You know all us party men have bosses , and , / have not yet seen my bosses . " " Senator , how about the report published here this afternoon that the Standard Oil Company has decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men to Pennsylvania and Ohio ? " " First time I ever heard of such a thing . " It was explained that the statement , apparently coming from Standard Oil sources , was to the effect that the move was taken to aid the Democrats , the argument being that the employes of the Standard Oil Company were Republicans and were being sent into Republican States . Mr. Davis was told that Senator Scott of West Virginia , one of the Republican campaign managers , was much disturbed over the report . " Well , Scott need not be disturbed , " said he . " I take exception to the statement that all of the Standard Oil employes in I West Virginia are Republicans . al know many of them are Democrats , and r should feel as sorry as Senator Scott if anything should happen to take them away from the State at this time . I hope the report is not true . " " Would the total number of these employes reach 10,000 , as has been stated ? " " Yes ; I should say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20,000 . " Pretty soon Mr. Davis emerged from thehotel wearing a dress suit , and was joined by Chairman Taggart . Both got in a carriage and the ex-Senator said they were going to the theatre . When asked what he expected to do after the theatre , he replied : " You ought not to ask a young bachelor like me what he expects to do after midnight . I hear that you have some very fine automobiles in New York and I may take a spin in one of them . " Senator Davis said he did not expect to see any of the campaign managers until , Monday . . ? There was astork going the rounds last night in ? regarct-to the probable campaign contribution of the Vice Presidential candidate . It was said that Chairman Taggart had suggested that he should be assessed *2,000 for each year of - his life . " Well , Torn , ' the candidate is reported to have replied , " you have been going around saying that I looked and acted like a man of forty-five instead of eighty-three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Senator Davis returned to the hotel shortly after 11 o'clock . He said that he did not go to the theatre , as he had intended , but spent the evening with Mr. Taggart and others at the Waldorf . He added that he thought Mr. Taggart was an extremely able campaign manager . There was a rumor that Judge Parker was to be in " New York on Monday , so Mr. Davis said that he would not go to Esopus until he had heard more definitely concerning the plans of the Presidential candidate . Mr. Davis then offered to play whist with any of the reporters who cared to try a rubber with him , but no one accepted the challenge . One of the= oZfered to play poker , but Senator Davis said that he had never learned to play the great Amaaican game . SHEPARD NAMES CONDITIONS . Would n't Accept ' Unless Party 's Action . Was Unanimous , He Writes . In a letter sent from his Summer home at Lake George to Herman A. Meta , President of the Brooklyn Democratic Club @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regard to the talk of his nomination for Governor . The letter was written as a result of the attempt of the club at a meeting on Thursday night to put Mr. Shepard in the field . While the letter has not been made public it is said that Mr. Shepard deplored the " premature " action of the club members and settled the rumor that the delegates from the five anti-McCarren districts in Brooklyn would put him forward . Mr. Shepard , it is said , declared he would not allow his name used for factional purposes and would not be made an instrument of division in the Kings County organization . He is said to have stated frankly that if the party , with substantial unanimity nominated him to head the State ticket he would accept , but that he would not figure as the choice of a mere faction . The names of Mr. Shepard and William Travers Jerome were practically the only ones mentioned among Democratic ' politicians yesterday as probabilities for the Governorship nomination , with a strong drift toward Shepard . There is a hesitancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Jerome boom , owing to the fact that Tammany has indicated through quiet enannels that as an organization it would oppose him , but would not oppose Mr. Shepard . At both National and State headquarters yesterday the leaders declared frankly that from the present indications they expected Mr. Shepard would be named at the Saratoga Convention . William F. Sheehan , Chairman of the National Executive Committee , went to Esopus yesterday to confer with Judge Parker , and when he returns to-morrow it is expected some announcement will be made concerning Judge Parker 's proposed speaking tour .
