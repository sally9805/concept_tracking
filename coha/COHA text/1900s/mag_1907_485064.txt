If Gov Cummins of Iowa is correct , the Presidential campaign next year is to be a battle of metaphysicians This - would follow from his definition of the issues There is to he , first , the Democratic idea of tariff revision in a deadly struggle with the Republican idea of tariff revision . The one would be absolutely fatal to the country , the other is necessary to its salvation , yet which is which , and how one is distinguished from the other , it would take a prince of the scholastics to decide Hence we say that the outlook is good for philosophers on the stump next year , able to divide a hair ' twist north and northwest side Their services will also be in demand if Gov Cummins 's other issue is to be understanded of the people This is the Democratic plan of regulating corpoi ations , in conflict with the Republican plan of doing the same thing Of course , we should scarcely survive if the former were foolishly adopted , while we shall die prematurely if the latter is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peas Some miraculously intelligent voters may he able to make the proper choice , but the run of them , we are sure , will need the aid of men skilled in pointing out the difference between tweedle-dum and tweedle-dee Although the new rules of the Republican party reduce by a total of eight votes in the convention the potency of those political divisions which either cast no electoral votes at all , or will certainly give theirs to the Democrats , these continue popular subjects of speculation The Territories , which had a total of 42 delegates in 1904 , including those from Porto Rico and the Philippines , will this year have but 14 , which would be negligible in any but a very close contest For Southern Republicans , however , the Naticiial Convention provides one ci owcled hour of glorious life The six States of Alabama , South Carolina , Texas , Georgia , Mississippi , and Arkansas can in the convention outvote by 14 the combined delegations of California , Nebraska , Massachusetts , New Jersey , Kansas , and Connecticut In the last Presidential electron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latter 1,168,752 Thus , if we take these two groups as typical , one Southern delegate represents 1,073 individual Republican voters , while a Northern delegate represents 9,276 It is logically nine times as much honor for a candidate to win a delegate from a Northern State , but , on the other hand , his work counts for nine times as much if it is expended in that sunny region where the air tingles now with rumors of plot and counterplot A political writer recently expressed the desire to see a direct contest between the " new Federalists " and the " new anti-Federalists " If all the Democrats and all the Republicans who believe in confining governmental functions within the narrowest practicable limits should get together on one side , while all the Democrats and all the Republicans who believe in a considerable extension of governmental functions lined up on the other , the next election might demonstrate the true feeling of the American people about a question which underlies most of the particular issues of the day As matters stand now , Democrats have lent a hand in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which the most prominent critic at the moment happens to be Senator Foraker , a Republican But the citizens interested in this question are not the only ones to talk about new alignments We are told that if all the ' friends of labor " would only vote the same way , they could overcome anybody and everybody This view was rather discredited by last year 's elections Tariff reformers who know how serious is the Republican discontent with the stand-pat policy , wish de ? outly that ther e could be a fresh alignment on the tariff issue , and would willingly let the Democratic protectionists join with Cannon and Payne and the others Despite these wishes , however , any genei al re-alignment in 1908 is unlikely Not long after Roosevelt 's reelection , many prophets were ready to predict a break-up of the old political parties Some foretold a long era of good-feeling tinder a semi-paternal government , while others saw the immediate joining of battle between the corporations and the common people Both agreed that neither the Democratic party nor the Republican  --  apart from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth saving But all the political reporters are now pre-dieting the liveliest convention the Republicans have held since 1892 And the Opposition is not to be a new or nondesci ipt aggregation , proletariat or corporate , but the same old Democratic party There will be no new alignment except in the wholesome sense that unattached voters will change their minds and shift according to their new convictions They will , as usual , hold the balance of power between the immobile and disciplined bodies of straight party men . Not even Roosevelt with all his muckrakers , on the one hand , or Harriman with all his conspirators , on the other , has been able to do more than ripple the deep current of our system of two-party government In Attorney-General Bonaparte 's adds ess at Chicago last Saturday , he was filled with the idea of enforcing the law without fear or favor He spoke , however , as if there were almost a general conspiracy to prevent the Administration from executing the laws , or to bring it into discredit if it did The D - partment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being accused of undermining prosperity ; against land monopolists , without being charged with persecuting " prominent and useful citizens " , against peonage , without being blamed for hostility to an entire section of the country Freely admitting , as we do , the importance of many of the Administration 's attempts to apply the law  --  as in the Northern Securities case  --  no one who scans the record will concede that the statutes have been invariably executed In the Paul Morton case , the specially designated assistants of the Attorney-General urged a certain course as the only way in which to establish the ciimmality of a fr:end of Mr Roosevelt 's , but the owner of the brothelless spear refused to let the law take its course . Moreover , the National Bank At m o-ides that " every person , film , association , other than national bank associations , and every corporation shall pay a tax of ten per centum on the amount of their own notes used for circulation and paid out by them " That is perfectly explicit It makes no allowance for times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subordinates in Texas proposed last month to collect this tax , as it might have been collected in many parts of the country But Washington did not move Th s particular law was , for the time being , made a dead letter by the Department of Justice We do not say that this should not have been done If the 10 per cent tax had been rigidly levied upon all the scrip and corporation checks afloat as currency , there would have been an indignant outcry , and monetary recovery would have been retarded But this very fact shows that law enforcement is not so simple a thing as is sometimes alleged An executive can not do his whole duty by merely looking into the statute-hook , and decreeing that every law found there shall be always and everywhere enforced to the very letter Capriciousness , or personal favoritism , in one set for the execution of the laws , is , of course , intolerable , but he is bound to use a certain amount of prudence even in law enforcement This is recog-nized by Attorney-General Bonaparte , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , of course , people must not " demand impossibilities The Governor of Nevada presents himself in no enviable light He called upon the President for aid , apparently when in a state of terror at the prospect of a revolution So Mr Roosevelt properly and promptly responded by hurrying troops to the scene of impending war , only to find that everything was quiet Naturally , Mr Roosevelt feels indignant , particularly as Gov Sparks is not only calmly ignoring the President 's telegrams , but has declared in writing to the commission appointed by Mr Roosevelt that he will not convene the Legislature to consider the situation in Goldfield , or the raising of a proper State military force to police that place if it really needs policing Gov . Sparks has only himself to blame if the world at large believes that he has been playing fast and loose with the Federal authorities and suspects that the call for troops was but an effort of the mine owners to utilize them in their own interest , as against that of the striking miners The refusal of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ participate in next year 's coast-defence manoeuvres is of particular interest at this time , when every effort is being made to bind the National Guard and the regular army closer together In this State we have one coast artillery militia regiment , and its enrolment , larger than that of any other in the State , is pointed to by those who assert that an alliance between State and Federal troops means renewed interest in the former Indeed , it is currently reported that there will shortly be a move to change two more infantry regiments into coast artillery . To us this undertaking seems of little value Good militia regiments of infantry and cavalry can be made , but not good technical troops The adjutants-general of Washington and California are quite right in saying that , if the Federal government needs a reserve of this kind , it had better create one itself The idea that troops could drill in an armory for six months in the year and in a fort for one week and then be of value in time of war is untenable And where could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ballistics , in submarine mines , in gunnery , in all the intricate details of modern coast defence , be found to command such regiments ? Protests by the Italian government against the destruction by Kentucky " night-riders " of some tobacco owned by the Italian government tobacco mo nopoly , and against ill-treatment of Italian laborers in Louisiana , Florida , and Mississippi , bear out what we have said in regard to the necessity of a change of front in the South , if it would really attract foreign immigration . This the Charleston Xeirs and Courier admits in a recent editorial The killing of two Macedonian laborers near Chathamsville , La , can , of course , be paralle'ed by the attacks on Chinese in the West , yet that in no way mitigates the horror of the crime , nor the shame it brings upon Louisiana and the whole country There must be law and order if these States are to be fit habitations for natives as well as foreigners , and are to progress industrially But when the Italian government officially declares ti- at it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse than slavery , " the South must not be surprised if Europe looks upon it as decades behind the times If the South is compelled by this attitude of the outside world to set its house in order , the colored man , too , may be relieved from those oppressive laws which , as Assistant Attorney-General Russell has officially repotted , are drawn as though with the purpose of making a peon of him . Prohibition in this country means to day a system of regulating the liquor traffic whereby whiskey may be obtained legally from the drug-store on a physician 's prescription , and from the express office without any such prescription The express companies , we believe , never maintain bars of their own , or permit drinking on the premises Thus they offer the same discouragements to public drunkenness as did the now defunct South Carolina dispensary . But , good or bad , this traffic in original packages of intoxicants from other States is not authorized by the " dry " States . There is no partisan division on the question whether the Federal government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than hinder the States in carrying out their own policies Last week it was Tillman , a Democrat , who brought up the issue in the Senate A couple of years ago it was Dolliver , a Republican The question is one about which license communities have always been indifferent , but every growth of no-license sentiment increases its practical importance The year which has seen the removal of the motto " In God We Trust " from our coins , sees also the first official recognition of Santa Claus by the Federal government Those thousands of childish letters , droll , quaint , or pathetic , addressed to the fabulous old gentleman at the North Pole , or Fairyland , or  --  as a good proportion are reported to be marked this year ? " care of Theodore Roosevelt , Washington , D C , " are to reach some one who may really give them attention Hitherto , a soulless bureaucracy has stamped them " party unknown " and dumped them by bushels into the hoppers of the dead-letter office , but now unofficial organizations " of standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drums and guns , Teddy bears , and stick candy It is said that the letters will even be answered Mr Pinchot , the Chief Forester , has also ' scouted the current belief that Christmas-tree cutting is a serious waste of our forests So the trees may be enjoyed without the guilty feeling that it is at the expense of the future timber supply and the regular flow of the rivers .. Acts like these show that the season of good will can make even a severe government relax The active bidding for hearth-fronts and columns of heavy stone at the auction of Stanford White 's collections showed that then e is a demand for sculpture , in connection with architecture , which the sculptors here do not satisfy That we have capable sculptors is known to every one who has seen the exhibitions of the National Sculpture Society and such smaller exhibits of sculpture as appear in connection with other ' shows Nevertheless , the attention of the public has been concentrated for a long time on painting , and glass windows and mosaics , and , as regards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet we have never had so many excellent workmen in the field of small statuary as to-day , and architects are doing their share to encourage sculpture on the exterior of city buildings , and also something toward a wider taste for sculptured hearths in country houses One great difficulty which our sculptors encounter is that New York does not contain a suitable Place for exhibition of the art . The winter show of statuary which was planned by the National Sculpture Society is going to Baltimore , where the armory of the Fifth Regiment , a fireproof building , will be used We , too , have armories which would perfectly meet the requirements of a combined exhibit of architecture , sculpture , and flowers , but the right to use them for such purposes has been withdrawn . An increase of 29 per cent . in population in eight years should be a fair , though not indubitable , proof of a country 's material well-being . That increase is what the just completed Cuban census shows From 1,572,845 in 1899 the number of inhabitants has risen to 2,025,282 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is only 400,000 less than Denmark 's population , 200,000 less than Norway 's , and over one-half of that of all Central America The increase , moreover , has shown no tendency to concentration , but has been marked in the entire island The province of Havana , as a matter of fact , shows the smallest ratio of growth , 22 per cent It is still the leading province , with a population of 517,524 , but it is closely pressed by Santa Clara , with 457,897 , and an increase of 29 per cent , and Oriente ( formerly Santiago de Cuba ) , with 453,732 , and an increase of 38 per cent The highest rate of growth was in Matanzas , which now has 289 , - 866 , an increase of 43 per cent . Pinar del Rio 's growth to 240,781 has been at the rate of 39 per cent , and Camaguey to 117,432 at the rate of 23 per cent . To these results immigration has , ' of course , largely contributed Of the four new cardinals created in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Rheims and Marseilles  --  and a third , to judge from his name , De Lai , is probably of the same nationality A sudden increase in the number of French cardinals from five to eight is not without significance at a time when the question of the final disposition of church property resulting from the Separation Law is being taken up by the French Chamber . Of a repeal of the Separation Law there can be , of course , little hope The problem that confronts the Church in France is one of organization for carrying on work under new conditions That the head of the Catholic Church is in close sympathy with the faithful in face of their afflictions and the great task now before them , the increase in the number of French cardinals is probably one method of testifying . The devolution of church property is comparatively an unimportant matter in the eyes of the militant Catholic leaders , at most , it would be a question of saving a little more or less out of a general shipwreck Organization for the future is the watchword @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We find such a fighting platform put forth , for instance , by the Bishop of Beauvais , some time ago According to his statement , Catholics must ' organize , in the first place , to procure for the clergy the actual means of subsistence , as well as for the " reconquest " of religious liberty , for the defence of society against dissolution through the decline of morality , and for the protection of the young " And the best mode of defence is to attack , so as to forestall further assaults Napoleon was defeated only when he had ceased to attack " The Revue de Paris publishes a translation of one of Mrs. Edith Wharton 's novels , tinder the title , " Chez les heureux du monde , " which , an inspired reader might guess , is French for " The House of Mirth " Translations from the English are enjoying increasing popularity in Continental periodicals , and especially as fetialetons in the daily press In the case of such serious journals as the Paris Temps or the Groriiale irltalla of Rome , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Great Britain , and . to a less extent , America , is naturally adaptable That the Paris Figaro should announce a translation of one of Robert Hichens 's stories , may be explained by the element of the exotic which characterizes the Englishman 's tales of North Africa  --  a field , by the way , in which French romancers have themselves done excellent work It is notable that the favorites for feuzlleton consumption are not the Hardys and the Merediths , but Kipling and Conan Doyle . Bourgeois as a term of reproach has entered into the thought and speech of at least two generations It rivals Philistine as a convenient epithet for what we do not like In literature , in art , most of all in morals , to be a bourgeois is to be something indefinably but unspeakably awful . Careful parents and anxious teachers warn the young against incurring this taint . The malediction came to us from France , and there are those who maintain that we give it a more malign significance than it has in its country of origin Prof Barrett Wendell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the French universities are bourgeois So are the leading professional men , they derive from middle-class families in the provinces Such is notoriously the case with public men in France When the Socialist orator Jaur  --  s flung the taunt of bourgeois at the Ministry , Clemenceau eagerly accepted it as if it were a badge of honor As well reproach a Tammany statesman for being " close to the people " ! These confusions have lately been the subject of analysis by a Frenchman , M. Aynard , Deputy from Lyons In a speech before a commercial club , he took up the question of " the war of classes " It is , of course , " guerre a. la bourgeoisie " that the Socialists declare , but M Aynard defied them to say exactly what they mean With as much truth as wit , he contended that " the term bourgeois is something much easier to resent than to define . " There is no sure outward sign , nor infallible inner trait , by which one may detect the bourgeois To be sure , there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But even in the class there is no fixity . M. Aynard had made a little investigation of a thousand of the most flourishing commercial houses of Lyons Nine-tenths of them had been founded by men who were actual workmen or employees shortly before , and who with their families could not even be called bourgeois to-day , so rapid has been their rise , owing to their own initiative and torte , with the free opportunity offered by the laws There is , admittedly , in France as in this country , a kingdom of the bourgeois , but its boundaries are vague and shifting Within it are the classes which represent stability , with lather banal ideas , no doubt , but which also represent energy , aspiration , and the spirit of progress Hence , no sooner have the superior beings outside got their lorgnettes superciliously levelled at the bourgeois , than he suddenly makes his way up to where they stand , and pushes them aside And presently he . in his turn , becomes very contemptuous of all that is bourgeois ! The career of Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes to capable and aspiring natures . There is the element of intense mental satisfaction To be grappling with the problems that underlie all human problems must yield its daily thrill But this higher type of scientist never loses himself in unrealities . His sense of the actual is too strong for that Hence he is always eager to show the bearing of his most refined speculations upon the thoughts and lives of men and the march of progress And if , as an aside from his more arduous labors of the intellect , he is ( able to devise or perfect some process or tool to bring the triumphs of science home to the hearts of men , he has the contentment which comes from feeling his feet upon the earth and doing service to its denizens His example shows what is really meant when we speak of the romance of science . De Maistre has a striking passage on the contrast between the scientific spirit of the present and the conception of science in primitive times Then there was something almost supernatural in the idea of science , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sky , and with a foot disdainfully touching the earth only to quit it " To-day , on the contrary , science is pictured as loaded down with books and instruments , " pale with vigils and labors , and pressing forward panting on the path towards the truth , with eyes fixed ever on the ground " Yet the two conceptions are not wholly irreconcilable In Lord Kelvin they were blended , and our point is that something of the old awe felt for the Magi reasserts itself in the case of such a scientist as he . He was seen to be one " commercing with the skies " Yet he would emerge from his closet , and display a kind of magic control over the forces of nature . Thus both reverence and gratitude attended him . The peculiar impress he made upon his time , such satisfactions of attainment as were his , could scarcely be paralleled in any other calling .
