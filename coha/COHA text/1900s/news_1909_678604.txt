txt Policemen and Fruit Vendors . Allow me to enter a vtgprous protest against the attitude of the police toward the struggling fruit vendors in the downtown business district . From time to time they swoop down on these Door dealers and drag them to court in hordes . It is incomprehensible to me why these men , after being obliged to procure a license at no little expense , are arrested from time to time for simply carrying on a busln tfotrhins  --  hlsch htohteythme must only n %us tt i permit . often we see these dealers , after being arraigned in court and fined , returning home with their carts , before full , now bare and empty . The carts are left in the station houses where some of the policemen are doing reserve duty . How does the fruit from these carts disappear ? Is it some invisible creature that carries it away ? This grave injustice should be brought to the attention of the Police Commissioner .                @ @ @ @ @
