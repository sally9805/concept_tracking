 | I was looking into the southwest . The sky there was quite as uncertain as prophecy ; the wind coming out from that direction was rapidly freshening into a gale . It was about four o'clock in the afternoon of the 26th of May , 1905 . Through our scouting squadron we were aware of the enemy 's movement , and His Majesty 's fleet , which was made up of almost every ship of consequence in the Nippon Navy , rode at anchor at the rendezvous . We knew that a great day was about to pass into history and the " Mikasa " once again was to have the distinction of flying upon her halyard the pennant of Admiral Togo . Out of the gray sky gradually the shades of evening fell upon us and it seemed very much as if a storm were to ride the Korean Straits all night long . A little before the East began to open its eyes on the following day ? at about half past five in the morning , to be precise ? the " Mikasa " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ships are sighted . " Brief , and indeed that was a message we had expected every moment . All the same , I doubt if the message of the sudden death of my mother falling out of the sky could cause so great an emotional storm as I felt at this announcement from our scout . And the " Mikasa " unfurled the battle flag . At the same time she signaled to the vessels of the fleet : " Wagakuni no som mo kono ikkyo ni ari ; sho shi sore doryuku seyo ! " ( The existence or death of our country hangs upon this action ; both officers and men , do your ut-most ! ) We were busy for about one hour following the signal . Our ships were about to start upon their red bridal ; we were about to play a game with no less a stake than the life of the lands of the gods and the honor of the Hinomaru flag . Although we had spent many months in preparation for the day which seemed to be upon us at last , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half past six , standing out to sea a little over five knots , the " Mikasa " signaled to the rest of the fleet , " Steam forth at half speed . " The " Shikishima " led the principal squadron , the " Fuji , " the " Asahi , " the " Nisshin " and the " Kasuga " following in the order mentioned . Heeling the main squadron , the " Izumo " led the second squadron , with the pennant of Vice-Admiral Kamamura floating upon her . The fourth squadron followed , with the " Naniwa " at the head . Both the destroyer and torpedo boat flotillas accompanied us . Another message came to us from our scouting squadron ; it read : " It seems that the enemy is making for the east channel . " It was about nine o'clock ; the " Mikasa " had joined the fleet and was leading the first squadron . The day was clearing but foggy , and the wind was stronger than ever , and more than once the waves washed the foredeck of the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . At times so great was the inrush of the sea that in a certain section of the ship there was more than a foot of water , through which men had to wade with shells before they could feed the guns . One sailor stumbled and fell in the water . " Are you hurt ? seriously ? " asked a lieutenant . " The shell is dry , sir , " was the answer of the sailor . And this aboard the " Mikasa , " which is , as you know , a ship of fifteen thousand tons . Far astern the cruiser squadron we saw from where we stood tor-  | pedo boat flotillas . One can imagine their plight . To us they appeared like a string of autumnal leaves flirting with something which seemed to be much more dangerous than fire ? the anger of the sea . " Only the mad would venture upon this sea on a torpedo boat , " I heard one of my comrades say . " We are capable of a greater madness even than that , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under some circumstances ? when the life and honor of the imperial land call us out to sea , for example . " We had no prophets aboard the " Mikasa , " and none of us knew what fate had in store for us on that her own parade day . We had with us a worker of miracles called Admiral Togo . And that made most of us quite content . We knew that only a rather unexpected good humor on the part of luck would afford us time for lunch , and in the service of His Majesty 's navy we were expected to learn a few things besides putting our entire trust on that happy god called chance . So- it came to pass that we found an unusual plenty of rice in our morning meal . All was ready ; the men were at their stations ; to them only a signal was wanting . We steamed leisurely in the direction of Okinoshima . Meanwhile permission was given to men to take their rest after their own fashion ? at their posts . And I look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made for the battle . In my round of inspection I had the pleasure of seeing those men ? they had worked hard since five that morning ? taking their ease according to their sweet pleasure . At every gun a few shells were gathered ready for an immediate call . And a number of our good sailors mistook the shells for pillows . The sight might have scandalized the arms factories all over the world , and if they could only listen to the " music of sleep " upon those shells , they would have been overwhelmed with compliments on their success in making soft pillows . As for me , who was not a manufacturer of ammunitions , the high snoring of our men had another message . In their sleep , profound as that of babes , I thought I heard a prophecy that was quite pleasing to us . Moving about amid the all-absorbing rest of our men , I felt sure that the day was to be ours . At any rate you know , quite as well as I , that nothing could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better than their childlike sleep within the hour or two of what they all knew to be the greatest naval battle since the birth of sober-minded history , and upon which hung the destiny of their beloved land . We steered east-southeast , then shifted to southwest . The fog began to kidnap the horizon . Very soon the Tsushima rose before us in her robe of silken fog , looking for all the world like a vision of the blessed Arabian memory . All this while our scouting squadron had kept in touch with the enemy , steaming , in fact , almost parallel to their course and always out of range of their guns and always trying their prettiest to keep out of their vision as well . And on the " Mikasa " we received from time to time messages of the enemy 's approach through the wireless telegraphy . The enemy could have disturbed and interrupted our communications , but they seemed quite indifferent . They must have despised our strength at the Tsushima Straits heartily , for on that ground alone can one explain their carelessness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they came , and it is impossible to restrain our admiration for this desperate courage of the Russian , for this lordly arrogance which seemed to say to us , " After all , you are Asiatics , are you not ? " It was about one in the afternoon that we were thrilled at the first sight of our long-expected guest . There was about thirteen or fourteen thousand meters between us , and the hostile ships penciled their silhouettes against the dream-like curtain of fogs like the skeletons of phantom ships . I made out four battleships and in addition to them cruisers , coast defense ships , to the number of twelve , and there seemed to be a number of other ships ? lighter cruisers and transports , perhaps ? trailing to the rear . They seemed to be heading northeast in double column line ahead , and steaming at the speed of about twelve knots . At the first sight of our main squadrons the enemy seemed to falter a little . Soon , however , I saw them head boldly toward  | us . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We saw Okinoshima to southeast ; we were about to enter into the effective range of fire . The wind , which was blowing fiercely out of the southwest , smote us full in the face , and naturally the same wind gave wings to the Russians , who were coming from almost opposite direction . Not wishing that the Russians have all the natural advantages on their side on the ground of our own choice , we ported the helm sharply . We were now steaming almost due west and our course made an acute angle with that of our enemy ; steadily , without saying a single word , with the even tread which cowards do not know in the hour of battle , we closed in . It was at this time that I noticed from the " Mikasa , " a change in the formation of the hostile ships . Their cruiser squadrons , which had been steaming to the port of the Russian battleship squadron as if to shield the heavier ships from our fire , standing as they did between our fleet and their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take their stations in a formation which was line ahead . And to the starboard shelter of this line of battle the Russian admiral wisely placed the still lighter ships of war and transports . We saw with no small delight that we commanded a decided advantage in speed , just as we had expected . We could therefore determine at what point we should fight and in what manner . At high speed the flagship led the fleet across the path of the Russians . And the two contending fleets described the letter T with a curved roof . It was about five minutes after two and the distance between the fleets was about thirteen or fourteen thousand meters . I saw a dainty ball of cotton belch from the barbette of the flagship of the enemy . Like the Chinese in the Battle of the Yellow Sea of ten years ago , the Russians opened the " ball . " We did not reply . The Russian shells fell far short . Always the " Mikasa " led the fleet athwart the path of the Russians . Our gunners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they were impatient . They knew that their officers knew better than they the time when to fire . Moreover , there were before the eyes of all of us objects which were very interesting and which had been carrying all the eyes of the world now for many months , and had brought and centered them to the Korean Straits over half the world . None might gainsay the splendor of that stately array of the Russians . Looking upon them , I for one could see very well how it was that Russia dreamed of a day when through them she should once again be the mistress of the Far Eastern waters . Then the fitting word was spoken ; our gunners received the order . In an instant a thousand thunders fell upon the pallor of the sea . Our superior speed carried us across the front of the advancing Russian line of battle , and as we steamed we concentrated our fire upon the Russian leader . As soon as we found ourselves across the front of the Russians and over to the starboard of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line in reverse order , and every ship turned sharply to port through 18o degrees , and so completely reversing the order of ships and the direction of the fleet . This brought the guns of our larboard broadside to the enemy . It was not altogether an unkindly turn , this maneuver . To our gunners in the starboard quarters who had kept open the floodgate of hell upon the devoted and heroic head of the Russians for some time it brought a few moments of grateful rest . And once again we rode back the way we came , across the path of Russian progress . The movement was repeated a number of times . At one time something made me turn my eyes to the ships of our fleet . They were keeping the stations beautifully . With their trains of smoke trailing far to the lee , curling here and there , and describing without a shadow of effort a thousand curves of grace and then finally vanishing away , they composed a picture at which I could not suppress the heavings of my breast . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in their hearts to deny them the merited title of the Mistress of the Three Seas . By three o'clock in the afternoon the battle was waxing to its climax ; our steel seed which we had sown with lavish generosity began to bring forth the fruits .  | It was just about this time that two squadrons of our fleet detached themselves from the main line and disappeared in the fog which was closing in . They were not lost from view very long . When they reappeared they were upon the rear of the hostile ships . The enemy was bagged ? bagged as a helpless rat in a trap . And looking back ? for although I have little of foresight , I am always proud of my hindsight ? I am inclined to think that fate , whom some of us in our black moments mistake for a football , and who is unquestionably wise , began to strike the hour which was to settle many things , among others the future of Asia , the doom of Russia 's sea power upon the Pacific and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The confusion among the Russian ships increased ; so also the rigor of the savage fire we maintained upon them . After three hours of fighting ? that is to say , a little past five o'clock in the evening ? I saw a Russian ship with one smokestack lose the freedom of motion and stagger drunkenly to the rear . She was vomiting a huge column of white smoke , evidently disabled . The constant pressure upon the head of the Russian line was telling upon the hostile ships and the enemy changed their course , heading west , leaving the unhappy ship to the mercy of our concentrated fire . One of the heavy shots struck her mast , and you will be surprised how light a heavy military mast is sometimes . Like a feather in a storm it flew into the sea . Soon the fire mantled her completely ; the sounds of many explosions reached us even above the din of our own guns . Gradually and finally wrapt in her funeral sheet of smoke and fire , the hapless ship began to list . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pitiful sight of her that brought the shout of Banzai which broke the human silence aboard the " Mikasa . " We left the duty of coup de grace to the " Chitose " and destroyers . About thirty minutes after that we saw the ship disappear with one final explosion . Even as the sea which floats the cross of St. George and the Sun-round flag with equal amiableness was adding another skeleton in her closet we saw drop to the rear two other Russian ships , both in a sad plight . And they found themselves within two thousand meters of the " Mikasa " as we steamed away from the last victim . And the prompt manner in which the heavy guns of our battleship squadron turned their fire upon the two ships made you think of a snow covered plain of the north and a pack of wolves on a horse which had lost his way . I noticed especially the fearful work which our twelve-inch guns and the ten-inch shells from the " Nisshin " wrought upon the two Russians . Within less than ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aft . Without even so much as a groan she took all we could give her , but not for very long . Like a man shot through the heart , I saw her pitch forward and dive rapidly , bow first . Very soon her stern was high out in the air . I shall never forget the ghastly pose it struck against the gray of the fog and the white of the angry sea , with her propeller marking a sort of funeral cross . Turning almost completely over , she went down . Once more we headed off the main squadron of Russia and once again we centered our fire upon the " Kniaz Suvaroff . " Fire broke out upon her ; white columns of smoke towered into the sky and I saw vivid tongues of fire stalking upon her upper decks . From the way her guns were served , and judging from the courage with which she fought , you would have said that the hail of shots in which she was wrapped and all the fires caused thereby were too trifling an incident for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were the courage of desperation , theirs was certainly splendid . The " Kniaz Suvaroff " and her comrades seemed to have centered their fire on the second ships in our squadrons even more than upon the flagships themselves . Not only with our first squadron , but the same was the case with the second squadron . It may be that the enemy thought the admirals were aboard the second ship in each squadron instead of upon the ships which carried their flags . The " Azuma " suffered a good deal from the concentration of hostile shots ; she was second in our armored cruiser squadron . One of the shots struck one of her guns and destroyed it completely . Another struck the casemate of a gun which was placed below  | her aft conning tower . The shell pierced it and on entering it exploded . The excessive violence of the explosion dismounted a twelve-pounder which was on the deck above and wounded Commander Togo , who at the time was in the conning tower . All through the action the fog prevented our seeing even with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six knots . In outmaneuvering the enemy we steamed out of their sight often . Five times we disappeared from the enemy 's sight and five times we returned into the effective range of fire . And each time we met we spent about thirty minutes in the actual exchange of fire . From a little after two , when the Russians wasted a couple of trial shots , to about seven , which saw the conclusion of the fleet action of the day , there were three solid hours of fighting . At about six o'clock , when the dusk was beginning to fall , we noticed a singular behavior on the part of the Russians . To our eyes they seemed to disperse . In their apparent disorder they had , nevertheless , one thing common to them all : All were trying to head northward . As we had done before , the main strength of our fleet threw itself across their path and brought the guns to bear upon the head of the Russian line . It was about 6.5o p. m. that a heavy shell shattered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was on fire . Like a strong man whom you see in tears , the last hour of a battleship touches you to the heart . Ten minutes later she turned turtle . Seven strokes from a clock tolled her knell ; lying on her side she went down . And the night , which had covered many a historic wreck of human strife , rung down the curtain once more upon the blood and fire of this perhaps the greatest naval action in history . Our principal squadrons drew away to the north ; it was the hour for the torpedo boats . It was about 7.20 that I saw through the twilight , which was darkening over the sea more and more , the flotillas steaming away from the protection of our heavier vessels , headed for the profiles of the Russian ships melting away into the night . The Russians were expecting them , and a sudden deluge of shots spoke their greeting to the frail craft , which seemed to live on that sea through a miracle . We covered the reckless advance of the torpedo flotillas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed into the darkness . At about eight o'clock we began to hear the tunes of the torpedoes which had gone home . A little later , out of the night and from the direction in which our torpedo flotillas had disappeared , a strange sound reached us . It was weird in the extreme ; shrieks of human voices they undoubtedly were ; nevertheless the distance had mellowed the sharper notes and translated them into a ghostly melody . You would have said that the restless and unhappy souls , escaped from the nirvana , storm tossed and heartbroken , with the black memories of the sins of yore , were calling out of an angry sea for a honey drop or two of sympathy from their brothers in the flesh . There seemed to us more than six hundred voices in the chorus . It was impossible to tell whether the shrieks were from our men or from the throats of the drowning enemies ? perhaps both . We shaped our course to the northwest ; we were certain that the Russians would make for Vladivostok . With the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the rendezvous north of the Liancourt Rocks . The communications among the vessels of the fleet were maintained throughout the night ? not without difficulty , however . The Russians , so indifferent at first about the communications among the vessels of our fleet through wireless telegraphy , were now very active in disturbing it . A little before the break of day , on the 28th of May , we received a message from our scout ; it confirmed our belief and read : " The remnant of the hostile fleet is making for Vladivostok . " About twelve miles to the east of Takebe Bay , a little before ten o'clock in the morning , we sighted five ships of the enemy ? the " Orel , " the " Emperator Nicholai I. " , the " Admiral Seniavin " and the " General Admiral Apraxine " and a cruiser . And the cruiser was the " Izumurud , " as we came to find out later . Almost as soon as we hove into view she detached herself from the squadron and , shaping her course straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We opened fire upon the four Russians ; at first they showed a half hearted sign of resistance . Presently their fire ceased . There was something abrupt and sudden in this silence of the hostile guns . Outwardly they did not seem as if their fighting power were gone . Naturally our glasses wandered over them in search after the reason . They rested for a moment upon the halyard of the " Orel . " Above the cross of St. George another color was flying . It was the Sun-flag of Nippon . The Capture of Vice-Admiral Ro-jestvensky By a Japanese Officer Aboard the " Sasanami . " In the night of the 27th of May , three Nippon destroyers found themselves together , the " Sasanami , " the " Usukumo " and the " Kasumi . " The hour was far gone ; the sea was black , smothered with fog , stormy . All of a sudden we bumped literally into a line of Russian cruisers . Upon the " Sasanami " we felt that the last hour for the ship and the men was upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time as we saw them , and they opened fire all the more terrific because the stormy night and the short distance emphasized the savageness of it all . The " Kasumi , " which was leading , ported the helm sharply and raced across the line of the Russian advance and both the " Sasanami " and " Usukumo " were forced to steam through the hostile line and escape to the rear of the cruisers . As we succeeded in steaming out of the danger zone we felt as a man who had just walked through a dream and a miracle . We were safe and sound ? without a scratch . Doubtless the reason was because we were too close for the enemy 's guns to do us harm . Soon after that , in the dense darkness of the night , the " Sasanami " lost the company of her sisters . On the morning of the following day , the 28th of May , at about ten o'clock , we saw from the " Sasanami " two columns of smoke floating above the horizon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slightest clue to determine . We were sent to hunt for the remnants of the Russian fleet and if possible to destroy or capture the vessels which had been crippled in the action of the 27th . We were therefore tempted to find out a little more of those telltale columns of smoke . At thirty knots an hour we steamed straight in the direction of the strangers . As we approached , two pairs of masts began to emerge above the horizon , supporting the two leisurely plumes of smoke . Very soon , through the glasses . we saw that they were two destroyers . They were flying the Russian flag We were now within range of guns and we lost no time in opening fire upon them . Almost with the first flash from our guns one of the Russian destroyers cut and ran . The other , however , to all appearances , looked as if nothing was happening ; she stood still , hardly less indifferent than one of the stray rocks in the Sea of Nippon . Moreover , we noted that she did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspended our fire and searched her with our glasses . Atop of her foremast a white flag was waving and instead of the cross of SL George the red cross flag was floating from her stern halyard . The " Sasanami " signaled her to explain herself . The Russian signaled back : " Our engine is damaged ; coal has given out and we are in need of water , " and the signal went on to say that there were two admirals aboard her . There was no frantic shouts of the banzai at this unexpected news aboard the " Sasanami " and the chief reason of our soberness was unquestionably because the news seemed to us altogether too good to be true . Moreover . did not we hear so much of the cleverness of the Russian at a ruse ? It is a simple paragraph of history , however , that we did not lose a single moment to board the Russian destroyer . The officers of the boarding party carried the Nippon swords and the men were armed with pistols . And we were quite ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Biedovy " ; she had a complement of eighty men and officers aboard her . Besides them we found aboard her Vice-Admiral Rojestvensky , the head of his staff and eight other officers under them . The day before , it seems , the flagship of the Russian admiral had been sunk and the admiral , severely wounded , had been transferred with some of his staff officers to the " Bie-  | dovy " upon which , as the strange entangling of human paths would have it , we fell so unwittingly . The capture of the commanding admiral of the Russian fleet is certainly the climax , and a rather dramatic one too , of the Battle of the Sea of Nippon ? that at least is what you would be likely to say and the rest of the world with you . All the same we were not in the least happy over the capture of the hapless admiral . Neither would you have been had you seen his sad condition ? bleeding there , in the narrow room of the destroyer . To us the surgical attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that famous trip of his and his fleet over half the globe ! One thing touched us all more than I could tell you . It was the respectful attitude of the officers and men under him toward their commander . And both officers and men of the " Biedovy " begged us to leave their admiral at peace there where he lay . We could not find it in our hearts to refuse this request , and as a matter of fact we did not insist on re moving the admiral to our ship . We escorted only nine officers of the " Biedovy " to the " Sasanami " and through them we accepted the surrender of their destroyer . All this took a great deal of time ? the detail of the surrender and the examination aboard the Russian ship and so on , and already the night was upon us . The " Biedovy " was disabled ; it was necessary to tow her . We made in the direction of the Liancourt Rocks ; we could only make ten knots . The night was black and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as indeed we did in the might before , upon the remnant of the Russian fleet , against whom we would rot like to pitch our frail strength . Ah , well , said we to ourselves , when it comes to that there is only one thing for us ? we shall find a common grave , both the Russians and ourselves , in the knightly Sea of Nippon . We were sure that on our journey through the shadow world we would not be without companions . It was a heavy load for the " Sasanami . " Knowing how quickly she can race when she is herself , she was impatient , creaked , groaned and swayed . Not so long after we started on perhaps the most historic journey that will likely be given in the life of the " Sasanami . " There was a sharp sound of something snapping . Our ship shot ahead like a bird out of a cage . It was the tow-rope that broke . Whether it were our impatience which lengthened the time I do not know . It seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rough sea which washed our deck all the while added not a little to our embarrassment . After having fastened the " Biedovy " on that dark night we are fairly qualified to attempt the work of threading a needle while you are jolting along a Korean road . Once upon a time there was a countryman of ours who jolted along the Korean road upon the springless cart of the native . For some reason he saw the necessity of threading a needle as he rode . When he came home to Nippon his friends did not recognize him ; in him they only saw a curio ? a nian with his temper completely wrecked . All that I have to say is that he ought to have worked upon the " Sasanami " on the night of the 29th ; we who have , can only find a light entertainment in his trials on a Korean road . The work done at last and we were about to heave a sigh of relief , when ? and no number of exclamations would do justice to our feeling of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Another eternity of trials in the dark ; and it is well that the - men of the Nippon Navy are permitted to shake hands with that refined state of mind called despair only on the pages of romance . When we made good the rope once again we had a distance to steam before we met the new day coming out of the eastern horizon . And it was in the virgin light of the 30th of May , 1905 , that we were permitted to behold the face of the Buddha in the distant form of our cruiser " Akashi , " which bore down upon us . Our troubles were over , and every one of us swore that we would not take ten lives in Paradise for the trials of the pitiless night in which we made the acquaintance of Vice-Admiral Rojestvenskv.
