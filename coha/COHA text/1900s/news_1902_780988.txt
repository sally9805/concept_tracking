txt The Right Hon. A. J. Balfour was yesterday formally greeted as Great Britain 's Premier , and the new regime began its work . The momentous change was marked by only one really dramatic incident  --  the resignation by Sir Michael Hicks-Beach of his pest of Chancellor of the Exchequer . Yet this lack of outward show and public prelude to a new chapter in English history by no means indicates that little disturbance has been created among the , undercurrents of political life . John E. Redmond , leader of the Irish Party in the House of Commons , said in an interview yesterday regarding the resignation of Sir Michael Hicks-Beach : " It will have a more immediate and material result than Lord Salisbury 's retirement . Hicks-Beach was an excellent check on Chamberlain , who is now practically all-powerful . ' ' ' The resignation of Sir Michael is regarded in some quarters as being directly due to the more important voice which Mr. Chamberlain will have in the new Cabinet . Sir Michael 's decision to retire from office , but not from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in deference to Mr. Balfour 's desire , his retirement may possibly be postponed until the end of the session . It is an open secret that the Chancellor of the Exchequer was only prevented by Lord Salisbury 's influence from long ago abandoning the struggle against the protective influences in the Cabinet represented by Mr. Chamberlain . Among the Liberals strong fears are expressed that the departure of Sir Michael Hicks-Beach will be the signal for the furtherance of the zollverein movement , Mr. Balfour being powerless to resist the Chan-berlainite tendencies . It is safe to say that Sir Michael is only the first of several whose names have figured largely before the public in the last half century who now will disappear from the political arena . Nothing definite is yet settled , but the Unionist Party expects . shortly to hear of the resignation of the Earl of Halsbury , ( Lord Chancellor , ) Lord James of Hereford , ( Chancellor- of the Duchy of Lancaster , ) and Earl Cadogan , ( Lord Lieutenant of Ireland . ) For Sir Michael Hicks-Beach 's place the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Board of Agriculture , is the favorite . In the pending Cabinet reconstruction , which may not be completed for sime time to come , Mr. Balfour , much to the delight of the Unionists , will remain the leader in the House of Commons and First Lord of the Treasury , with Mr. Chamberlain , still Colonial Secretary , as his first lieutenant . If Lord Halsbury , on account of his great age , fulfills predictions by retiring , Lord Alverstone will succeed to the woolsack . Sir Richard Henn Collins ( Master of the Rolls ) becoming Lord Chief Justice , and Sir R. B. Finlay being appointed Master of the Rolls . On one point the members of the House of Commons . who throughout yesterday animatedly discussed the new state of affairs , seemed practically unanimous , and that was that J. Austen Chamberlain ( Financial Secretary of the Treasury ) would be promoted , a majority mentioning him as likely to succeed Mr. Hanbury should the latter take the Chancellorship of the Exchequer . Friends of Mr. Balfour also said he was certain to require @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George Wyndham , now Chief Secretary for Ireland . There is no little gossip concerning some change in the position of Lord George Hamilton , Secretary of State for India , one well-known member of the House of Commons saying he had heard that Lord George was one of those who would throw up their portfolios . Lord George 's brother-in-law , the Marquis of Lansdowne , is regarded as certain to remain at the Foreign Office , where he is carrying out the policy laid down by Lord Salisbury . There is apparently no serious anticipation of a general election , though in some quarters it is thought that the desire attributed to the King to have a new Parliament after his coronation may cause air anneal to the country . However , the new Premier is not believed to see any necessity for such a step . The resignation of Lord Salisbury had no effect whatever on the Stock Exchange yesterday . King Edward received Mr. Balfour in audience yesterday at Buckingham Palace , and delivered to him the seals of his office and the privy seal .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
