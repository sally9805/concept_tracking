txt Seymour W. Tulloch , who is in New York , attending to business interests , sent word to Washington to-day over the telephone that he had I abundant documentary evidence to prove 1 1 his charges in connection with the Postoffice scandal . and would like nothing better than to produce it . He is ready at any time , he says , to appear before the proper authorities , show the documents , and give his testimony . This.new statement of Mr. Tulloch 's raises the question whether he will have a chance to produce this evidence . ' Postmaster General Payne said yesterday that if he did not prove his charges he should be branded as a liar , and he repeated the word several tomes . Mr. Payne also very plainly hinted that Tulloch was not likely to be called before the investigating authorities , and that his original statement making the charges would be made to stand side by side with the denials of the- four men to ' whom Mr. Payne wrote , Including ex-Postmaster General Smith . Questions were put to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " If the four men to whom you have written flatly deny Mr. Tulloch 's charges , what will happen next ? " " I suppose Mr. Tulloch will appear before  --  the public as a liar . " " But will you not send for Mr. Tulloch , and ask him to produce his evidence ? " " I have no authrority over Mr. Tulloch ; he is not in the department . " " But you , have no authority over Mr. Smith or Mr. Tracewell either . " " Some of the men to whom I have written are still in the department . You may say that If Mr. Tulloch does not make good his charges he will be branded as a calumniator , a slanderer , and a liar . ' " Will you give him an opportunity te make good his charges ? " " He has made his statement , he has had his hearing . " This and many more questions and answers established in the minds of Mr. Payne 's auditors the conviction that when he received the letters of Smith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider the incident closed . He intends to publish them ' as soon as they are received , or at least-i those of Tracewell , Bristow , and Merritt . Whether he will adhere to this view , lh view of Mr. Tulloch 's statement that he has plenty of evidence and is anxious for an opportunity to prove it , is a question yet to be answered . Postmaster General Payne is awaltinzwith interest replies to the letters Which he sent yesterday to ex-Postmaster General Smith , Assistant Postmaster General Bristow , and Postmaster Merritt of the Washington office . In his letters Mr. Payne called upon the gentlemen mentioned for answers to S. W. Tulloch 's charges that ' an investigation under the former administration of the department had been suppressed by " influence . " It is expected that most of the answers will deny Tulloch 's story . Mr. Tracewell probably will content himself with simply denying that personal and political pressure was brought to bear upon him to stop the investigation of Assistant Postmaster Gen ' eral Heath 's office . He freely admits that Heath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigation was . " offensive . " and that subsequently the man was reduced in rank and sent to another bureau . Two of Tulloch 's charges are thus confirmed . Mr. Payne has not given out his letters for publication . He has , however , read an of them except the one to Mr. Smith to certain newspaper men . In each letter he makes an extract from Tulloch 's statement and asks for information about its truth . Mr. Tracewell can , if he likes , simply deny the bringing of political pressure to bear upon him without going into the details or Mr. Heath 's remonstrance or the investigator 's removal . When Mr. Heath was in Washington a few months ago , at the time the present investigation was in contemplation . he is said to have assured the President and others that he had investigated the charges against the accused officials himself when in office , and that there was no need of going further . In view of the statements of Mr. Tracewell and Mr. Tulloch , it is now thought probable that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Mr. Tracewell at the time the " offensive " Treasury expert was employed on the- work . The investigation , apparently , was originally aimed at the office of Superintendent Beavers , which is attached to the First Assistant Postmaster General 's office , but subsequently it was attempted to broaden it into an investigation of Mr. Heath 's entire division . Tulloch says that Bristow demanded this , but that Mr. Smith refused it . When in office Mr. Smith took upon his own shoulders much of the burden which popular opinion was disposed to place upon Mr. Heath 's . At the time when the Cuban postal scandals came out the circumstances that so many of the accused men came from Indiana and even from . Mr. Heath 's town of Muncie , led to the conviction that they were Heath 's appointees . Mr. Smith at that time informed newspaper men that Heath had had nothing to do with the appointment of these men , and that he had selected them himself . . This was at the time regarded by many as an example of Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settling for all time the responsibility for the appointments . One of the officials under investigation . Superintendent Louis . of the Division of Supplies . has . brought suit for slander against Frank 0 . Mittag , placing the , damages at $20,000 . Mr. Louis charges that on March 10 last Mittag said in the presence of one John C. Kondrup and others : " If it had not been fox me Louie would be in the penitentiary. " 7 Louis says that these words of the defendants mean that the plaintiff had feloniously accepted money or other things of value to unlawfully influence him in the discharge of the duties of his office ; that he had thereby committed a felony of which the defendant had knowledge , and but foe the defendant withholding his said knowledge and information from the proper officials of the Post Office Department the plaintiff would have been tried and convicted of the aforesaid felony and sentenced to imprisonment and have been imprisoned in a penitentiary . The Postmaster General has turned over to the Treasurer of the United States for safekeeping the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the time of his arrest in connection with the Cuban postal frauds.
