 | IT has been the recent good fortune of the writer to visit two American localities in each of which at the time the current sensation was a homicide , and in one of those places to be a witness of the events immediately following the crime and almost of the crime itself . One was in New York City and the other in the mountains of Kentucky , two regions typical for their belated civilization , but presenting some interesting contrasts ; one or two of which presented themselves in connection with the incidents to which reference has been made . It was on the campus of Berea College on Commencement day that the first of these tragedies occurred . The campus was filled with people . Hundreds of horses were hitched to the trees ; thousands of people filed in and out of the tabernacle and visited in the shade . The day had been one of unbroken quiet . The deputy sheriffs and local police had been busy the evening before , gathering in those men who came to town drunk and " shooting up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night in the lock-up and would not be released until after Commencement day . A guard had been stationed a mile out of town on every road leading into town , and a quantity of moonshine whisky had been confiscated . So far as known none had made its way into town . The officers had done their duty well . There was no drunkenness or rowdyism , no sense of fear or anxiety . My friend , who edits a paper , and I came out of the Tabernacle rather late in the afternoon , and commented on the growth of good order year by year and spoke of the time when the great gathering had involved some hazard . Just then a pistol shot was heard , over toward a corner of the campus , and I proposed that we go that way . " Ca n't you get into trouble enough without going into it deliberately ? " asked the editor . But we both went . As we neared the spot the word flew back that one woman had shot another ; and when we arrived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small buildings and the other woman had been arrested and led away . On the steps of the building where the murdered woman lay stood a professor who called for a rope to hold the crowd back from the door and this was quickly done . My friend and I passed thru and stood beside him . Just outside the door stood an unkempt , barefoot boy , sobbing ; the woman who had been shot was his mother . But his sobbing was not with abandon : it was as if he felt he had no right to weep out all the bitterness of his grief . One of the professors led him away and cared for him , and he did not go inside . The dead woman lay inside alone . The officers who carried her in were out hunting a justice and summoning a jury for an inquest . One deputy guarded the door , and we stood with him . No man cared to be the first to go in . A woman pressed against the ropes and asked admission . She knew the dead woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was admitted and asked to remain and identify the body . She passed inside alone , and returning said there was no doubt of it . It was Susannah Black , who worked for her neighbor in a neighborhood some ten miles away . " Was the deceased a woman of good character ? " she was asked . " No , sir , I could n't say that . She was a-talkin ' to married men . " " Talkin ' to " is a technical phrase for love-making . The coroner was at the county seat ; and in his absence a justice was sent for . The justice arrived in all the dignity of his office . He wore a short coat with the collar turned up and a wide and  | weather-beaten straw hat , which he did not remove at any time during the trial . He had a three weeks ' growth of beard , and could not have been called a dandy . His first official act was to produce five cents and send to the store for a tablet of paper on which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an adequate penpicture of that inquest . Perhaps I can . It is a good illustration of the way they do things in Kentucky . We went inside , the justice , the six jurors , a few witnesses and not many more , twenty of us , perhaps , altogether . The justice proceeded to swear the jury , and the way he administered the oath was the same then and afterward . He lifted his own right hand timidly , and about to the level of his shoulder as he began to repeat the oath , and each time he took breath he gave it a little jerk upward till he got to the words " to the best of your knowledge and belief ; so help you God , " when one final elevation brought it as high as he could reach . In like manner his own confidence increased with the progress of the procedure . As he questioned the witnesses he wrote down their replies , or the gist of them , in very long hand , standing all the while , and walking back and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he asked the question , and back to the blackboard to record the answer . He did not sit , but wrote against the blackboard , turning his back on the room each time and sometimes - nearly stepping on the corpse . Yet there was about it all a certain rude dignity , a sense of official responsibility , a directness of inquiry , and something also of familiarity with the forms of court procedure which redeemed it in part from the grotesque . Indeed , there was about it all something bunglingly and incongruously appropriate ; a reminder that this court was of the people , even as to his old straw hat and desire for justice . The dead woman lay on the floor . Those who brought her in had folded her hands across the body and laid two pebbles on her eyes and tied up her chin with a handkerchief . Her dress had been opened and her breast was bare . The bullet , which had entered from the back , showed under the skin between the breasts , and slowly , slowly grew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stockings , and the shoes had gay buckles upon them . There are times when it would be a comfort not to believe in immortality . Who can sit and look at such a sight and not wonder where she is and how she fares and how her past life appears her in the surprise of the life beyond ? And yet who knows how much she sinned and how greatly she had bees sinned against ? The details of a country inquest make it impossible to think consecutively about the horror of the crime . One almost reproaches himself for his inevitable turning to irrelevant things . It becomes easy to see how a very little experience in such matters dulls the edge of sympathy and sets one to thinking of it in terms of utility and average . One witness only put anything of life ' and heart into her story . The rest simply saw the deed or knew one or both the parties . But this woman 's husband was a remote cousin of the husband of the defendant . They both bore the plebeian name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cousin , the defendant , when the woman now dead came by and asked for the husband , asking tauntingly. maliciously , and the wife answered : " You 'd orter know ; you 've seed more of him today than I have , " whereupon the had woman laughed and tripped away in her new shoes with the buckles . Then the witness continued : " And Nannie says to me : That woman better not pester me no more . She 's been a-worryin ' me now for a right smart spell . Ef she does that just oncet more she 'll git what she do n't want . ' An ' I says Nannie , do n't you do nothin ' rash ' ; and she says : I do n't keer what I do . I 'm that pestered I do n't keer whether I live or die . ' Bymeby the Black woman come by agin and ast agin where Joe was , an ' Nannie quarreled at her . An ' she just laughed and said to Nannie : You cai n't help . yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an ' I seen her turn to run , kind o ' scared like , and just then come the shoot , and she fell ? jest run two or three steps more and fell ; and I looked around at Nannie and she was a-holdin ' the pistol and hit a-smok-  | The justice was minded to close the inquest without bringing in the accused woman . " What 's the use ? " he asked . " She admits she done it ! " It seemed to him a new idea that tho she had freely admitted the deed out of court she might deny it in court ; but with a desire to have all proceedings regular he sent for her . The accused woman was brought in , with her husband and a little daughter of three . She was seated on the front seat , within a yard or two of the corpse ; and during the tedious and to her only half-intelligible proceedings that followed she had nothing to divert her attention from the one horrible object before her . There she lay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut the bullet with his pocket knife , the wound bleeding hardly a drop either in front or back ; so small a wound , so little loss of blood , such instant death ! There she lay , her taunts hardly cold on the mocking mouth now tied shut with the handkerchief ; the pebbles on her eyes , the new buckles shining on her new shoes ! And what was Nannie thinking of it all the time ? I sat within a yard of her and looked hard at her . Did she regret it ? If so she did not show it . Her face was pale , but firm . There was no hysteria , no weeping . What does a woman think when she has killed another , and has to sit for an hour and look at her dead body , first at the pebbles on her eyes and then at the buckles on her new shoes , and then at the place where the bullet lodged ? And what does the man think who sits between them , his living wife and his dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman and made another a murderess ? And what does a little girl think who sits in her father 's lap and turns wondering looks , first at him , then at mother , and then at the dead woman on the floor ? Terrible are the tragedies of childhood . I look at the little girl and think of the sobbing of the little boy outside . It is a study in psychology . Nannie is impassive ; her husband is stolid ; the little girl simply wonders . And I wonder . I wonder if Nannie would bring her dead rival back to life if she could . I think she was sorry in a way , but I do not think she would have brought her back to mock her again . And yet I only guess ; there is nothing to be learned from her face . There are two deputy sheriffs near Nannie and her husband , one on the seat beside them and one who has slipped in just behind . He is a young lawyer from the county seat , who , having no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an honest two dollars this day as deputy sheriff . To him the opportunity opens prosperously . Sitting behind he whispers to Nannie and her husband , advising them not to testify , and her not to repeat in court the confession she has made outside . They heed him , and accept his services with a mere nod or two . But that is enough . He who entered the room as a deputy sheriff is now transformed into attorney for the defendant ; it is a more profitable job , and , for that matter , leaves him still free to finish his clay 's work as deputy ! It is an ill wind that blows naebody guid . When the inquest is over he lights a cigar and struts away with undisguised satisfaction . Such an event may be the turning point in his career . He is already shaping the plea that he will make , appealing to the sympathy of the twelve good men and true not to condemn this woman who strove to protect the honor of her home . That plea will stand him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is not needed . All that is necessary here is to keep her silent , and this is not difficult . The verdict of the justice 's inquest is short and direct , finding that the woman came to her death as the result of a pistol shot fired by Nannie Nubbins , who is held to an examining trial two days later . So we went out , leaving the body in the hands of the village undertaker , to be buried by the town . Two days later I went down on the train with the husband of Nannie , a decent appearing fellow . I did not address hint , but I wondered much what he had been thinking in the intervening thirtysix hours . He showed nothing from which a judgment could be formed , and he walked to the court-house where Nannie awaited him . The examining trial was shorter than the inquest . The number of witnesses was fewer and the facts were elicited more promptly . The young lawyer made his brief and fervent plea , and the verdict  | followed quickly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verdict . Self-defense ; and the dead woman was unarmed and shot in the back ! But the theory of self-defense advanced by the young attorney was more flexible ; she was defending her home , her honor , the good name of her children . Yes , it was a clear case of self-defense , as adjudged in Kentucky . There were some reporters present at the Berea Commencement , and so the shooting became known to the world . That was an accident which can not well be helped , and is not to be attributed to the custom of the country . The theory there is that the thing is done , and the woman needed killing , and while the manner is to be deplored , the least said about it the better . Very soon after this event I visited New York City , which also , like the Kentucky mountains , is a place of belated civilization . There a shooting had occurred , somewhat similar . In that case there were two men and one woman , and so it was a man who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoes with buckles . Otherwise the cases were prac tically similar . And the city was preaching about it and talking about it and the newspapers had unearthed as many as forty pictures of the woman , and were blocking the streets with their cameras in efforts to obtain more , and were telling about the millions that would be spent on the trial , and were publishing the grewsome details , not merely of the crime , which would have been relatively wholesome , but of the sins that produced the crime . And I have been wondering which , after all , is the better way , the crude method of the Dark and Bloody Ground . or the alleged civilized method of darker New York . And in the long run , which is the more likely to discourage adultery , to promote the purity of the home and benefit the community ? And when the court meets in New York , with all its money and learning and array of legal talent , in which place is justice more likely to be done , there , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upturned collar and the stained straw hat ? Which is the better way , that of the mountains or that of the metropolis ?
