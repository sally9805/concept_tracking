 |p1105  WHY does hatred of the Jews persist ? Prejudice against him is a sort of chameleon ever crouching within his wake , changing color under the several circumstances under which it meets him . But it is more harmful and insidious than this reptile . In Germany it is called anti-Semitism ; an attempt is made to give it a scientific significance by designating Jews as Semites and pointing out that assimilation and amalgamation between Semitic and Aryan peoples is impossible . In parts of Eastern Europe it takes the form of the " Blood Accusation , " by which peasants are deluded into believing that Jews have kidnapped a missing child for the purpose of using its blood in the preparation of the Passover bread . In Russia there is opposition based on various motives . It has brought about more serious results than in any other country . There have been riot and bloodshed , numberless restrictions and persistent persecution , abet ted by the Government , so that hundreds of thousands of Jews have felt compelled to leave the country . In the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it is nevertheless keenly felt in greater or lesser degree by the Jewish population . It assumes the guise chiefly of social ostracism . This does not imply , however . that its origin may not be traced to the same religious antagonism which has been the historical reason for ill-treatment of the Jews thruout the ages . Prejudice against Jews may be religious , racial , or social , or all three of these ; that is to say , it may be caused by the sense of opposition of one Church against another , by the feeling of alienation between two races or peoples , or by class hatred and antagonism . Race prejudice has not shown itself in the same way in this country as in Europe . It is more prevalent toward recent immigrants among the Jews than  |p1106  toward native born and those of longer residence , itself an indication that it is not based entirely on real racial antipathy . the most offensive manifestation of class antagonism toward Jews in the United States is shown in the refusal of some hotels , especially at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Jews in social clubs and college fraternities , and in the barring out of Jewish children from some so-called exclusive private schools . On account of the prominence of the persons involved , the refusal of the Grand Union Hotel , at Saratoga , to receive Mr. Joseph Seligman still lingers in the memory of many people , altho it occurred over thirty years ago ? in June , 1877 . Mr. Seligman was informed that the proprietor , Judge Henry Hilton , had given instructions that no Israelites should be permitted to stop at the hotel . The ground of exclusion was that a certain class of Jews were obnoxious in manners and conduct . Henry Ward Beecher , in a sermon at the time , decried such action , and extolled the particular family for its culture and refinement . Since the incident , exclusion in the United States has continued on one pretext or another . The following phrases have appeared in connection with advertisements of summer resort hotels : " We prefer not to entertain Hebrews or persons suffering from pulmonary trouble . " " Patronage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " One of these appeared in a prominent periodical this year . Rev. Dr. Stephen S. Wise , rabbi of the Free Synagogue , protested to the publishers against its publication , and they replied that " Race prejudice is thoroly bad from every point of view , " but they did not see how they could decline to accept an advertisement if a place determined to announce that it would not deal with Hebrews . " We should feel compelled to accept a similar advertisement from a Hebrew who publicly announced that he would not deal with a Christian . " Dr. Wise 's answer indicates the only self-respecting attitude of the Jew : " It is a studied , public , cruel insult to a people . As far as it can , it indicts a whole people . Its direct and unmistakable implication is that all Jews are objectionable . " A lawyer representing a client who refused to allow a Jew to occupy an apartment in a New York hotel , last year , had the temerity to state in his brief : " The Court will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ element in the community there is a prejudice against living in community with Hebrews , and that in recognition of this prejudice owners of hotels and apartment houses thruout the country in many instances decline to extend their accommodations to persons of this race . Municipal Justice Lynn , however , said this statement was " obnoxious to law and contrary to fact . " " While the prejudice may exist among ignorant , illiterate and irreligious people , it certainly can not be said to exist among the genuine ' Christian element in the community , ' nor could it find lodgment in the mind of any selfrespecting American citizen . " According to this dictum there must be a number of American citizens who are regarded with respect by their neighbors , but who are not self-respecting . Nor is it true that only the " ignorant , illiterate and irreligious " are prejudiced . There are persons presumably educated , and others formally religious , who show the same antipathy . It is an inheritance of the attitude of the Church toward nonbelievers , and it has not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American Hebrew , April 4th , 1890 , on the subject , " Prejudice Against Jews , " participated in by a number of well-known individuals , not Jews , Margaret Deland said : " I am inclined to think that the teaching of the Church and Sunday school is largely responsible , but only among the uneducated classes . " Altho the majority of the contributors to the symposium , particularly the clergymen , denied this or were unwilling to admit it , I , too , am inclined to regard Christian Church and Sunday school teaching as measurably responsible . The story of two little playmates is apropos . Becky and Irene were friends . But one day Irene said to Becky , " I sha n't play with you any more . " In answer to Becky 's indignant rearrest for a reason , Irene answered , " Because you killed my Christ . " The prejudice against Jews is an unreasoning dislike , an opposition , an antipathy . the result of a number of points of difference between them and nonJews , and exercised against them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in close communion with other elements of the population . It is true that in some circles they are welcomed , but it is equally true that in some they are merely tolerated , and in others absolutely excluded . We find that the places of exclusion are summer resorts , clubs and fraternities , where an arbitrary social standard is erected with reference to the admission of members or guests . In more than one such place all Jews , without distinction , are put in the class excluded . The Jew can not be admitted on his individual qualities . le is peremptorily shut out because he is a Jew . It is not because of his residence , or his occupation , or his pedigree , but because he is a Jew . I recognize that class distinctions are sometimes made with reference to other elements of the community . They are frequently foolish and absurd ; they are objectionable . But the most damnable and inexcusable is that which stigmatizes a whole people , and that is done wherever the only basis is being a Jew . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not be admitted into certain places of honor , preferment or habitation simply because of his Jewish origin . In politics , especially in New York , where the Jews are an important factor numerically , consideration is given to Jewish candidates by the several political parties . In a number of scientific societies , where merit is the only requirement , Jews are absolutely on a footing of equality with others . But wherever latent prejudice gets the upper hand , in other fields of activity , the Jew finds himself barred . He is locked out or kept from advancement as a teacher in schools , colleges and universities . These institutions do not put out any signs , " The number of Jews is limited , " or " No Jews admitted , " but it is well recognized that a very small proportion of Jews can gain entrance to any of the faculties , and in many an instance they are not admitted at all . In business positions many a time a person is kept out because he is a Jew . There are ostensible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prejudice , which objects to the Jew because the objector has had a bringing up that can not regard him with the same consideration as the non-Jew . He is mentally blacklisted , and the result is an attitude which continually prevents an unbiased judgment . Other individuals may have distinctive traits , but if a Jew shows them , not only is he often out of the running , but all Jews as well . The uncultivated man who calls the Jew a " sheeny " is in the same class as the educated man who does n't want a Jew as a next-door neighbor or as a fellow worker . There is the excuse that one Jew brings many , but that again shows the general prejudice , for it assumes that even if there is an unobjectionable Jew , he will be responsible for others who are objectionable . Why should there be any fear of a number coming from one class called Jews unless it is assumed that the class is undesirable ? It comes back to the fundamental opposition , which segregates the Jew and applies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Jews to places in professions , the theory of possible overcrowding can not hold , because each one may be chosen on his individual merit . Summed up , the reasoning is thus : The Jews are a people . The habits and manners of some are objectionable . Therefore , all Jews are objectionable . The absurdity of this so-called reasoning is apparent . here are objectionable Americans , objectionable Irish . objectionable Catholics , objectionable Protestants , objectionable members of the " best " social sets . But they are not held up to ridicule and calumny by public advertisements , by public ostracism. by insulting epithets , by insinuating stigmatism , by a thousand and one open or covert efforts to discredit them . Summing up again , we " We do n't like Jews . " If an individual is disliked and excluded because of something offensive , that is a matter to be settled between the individual and his critics . But if the finger of scorn is pointed at him because he belongs to a certain class , then surely the class must take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hold the entire class responsible for the appearance , the conduct , and the opinions of all its individual members , the self-consciousness of the class is roused , and as it grows in power of expression and
