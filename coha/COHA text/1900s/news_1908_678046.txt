txt A Professional View of The Times . An editorial writer myself and long an admirer of THE TIMES , I want to express my appreciation of two articles in particular which you have given to the public this week . I refer to your masterly sermon upon the disgusting proceedings of the Cosmopolitan Club and your able expose of the remarkable and absurd " story " concerning the lancehead snake and its venom  --  remarkable because it was apparently authorized by men of science , who should realize that the American public of the twentieth century is rather more enlightened than the ignorant masses of the Dark Ages . It is pleasant to reflect that no other institution has tended more to the distribution of this enlightenment than the press , of which THE TIMES is so splendid an example , in grateful contrast to that portion which , ruled by the counting room , panders to the lovers of sensationalism , to the ignorant and credulous , to the superstitious and the fanatical , arraying class against class , poverty against wealth , labor against capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into one indestructible , undivided whole . All true Americans may well be proud of THE TIMES .
