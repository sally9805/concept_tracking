txt On the unofficial or builders ' trial trip to ; day , the United States armored cruiser Colorado achieved a maximum speed over a measured course of 22.31 knots an- hour , the average of two runs under forced draught being 22.10 knots an hour . This result is highly gratifying to the builders , as the requirements of the contract were exe6eded in every respect . Experts on board predicted after the run that the Colorado would- average not less than 221 , E knots on the official trial trip , and thus exceed the contract speed requirement by at least one-half knot . In accomplishing the great speed to-day the revolutions of the engines averaged 122 a minute , and the indicated horse power was 23,500 . In speaking of the result of the test the Vice President of the Cramp Shipbuilding Company , Edwin S. Cramp , said : " The performance of the machinery was perfect in every respect , the maximum speed being obtained without the heating of a single bearing . The Niclausse boiler , about which there has been so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admirably . The model of the ship is so excellent that at the top speed there was a remarkable absence of waves both at the bow and at the stern . " Another noticeable feature . of the trial was the entire absence of vibration at all speeds . When it is considered that the cruiser had never been tried before ; that she had been overboard one year since the lauching , and that consequently the bottom is necessarily foul ; that the coal was the ordinary run of the mine , and that the course was comparatively shallow , the results show the Colorado to be without a peer in the American Navy or any other navy . " ? The weather conditions were ideal , and everything favored great speed and good results generally . A number of naval experts were on board taking observations of the trial , and they were all enthusiastic regarding the great performance of the Colorado . The official trial will probably take place about the middle of September over the Waal course off the Massachusetts coast .
