 |p513  THE history of British relations with South Africa is one long series of mistakes , of buried reputations and broken hearts ; and yet the man who , after reading this history , takes the trouble to make himself personally acquainted with the country will not judge his own people too harshly . It is a difficult country ? physically and climatically ? and it is inhabited by a difficult race of people . Many of the greatest of Britain 's mistakes in dealing with it have been made ( as it is now possible to see in the perspective of time ) in the most earnest good faith by people who were acting on the highest moral principles . It was hoped by many that the war of 1899-1902 had finally obliterated traces of the many past mistakes , and that , whether justifiable or not , it was to serve as the sponge to clean the slate . A general tendency existed all over the country among British and Boers alike to regard the new epoch with hope , despite the terrible depression and dislocation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans , who have still a vivid memory for the reconstruction period in the Southern States after the surrender , will not need any description of this period . In the autumn and winter of 1904 and the spring of 1905 I revisited South Africa and traveled over both the old colonies ( the Cape and Natal ) and the new colonies ( the Transvaal and Orange River ) , as well as all the other territories . It was just two years after peace was signed at Voreeniging , and in those : two years the work of reconstruction had gone on with such rapidity that it was almost impossible to believe these countries to have been so recently the theater of war . Grass had grown over the graves , and the trenches were obliterated by aacldt ) wers . New buildings had sprung up in the towns , and some of the latter had already increased almost beyond recognition . Fresh railway lines were already opened , roads were made or repaired ( especially in the new colonies ) , and the whole country was opened up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revisited it for fourteen years . Notwithstanding all this , there was great depression in commercial life , especially in Cape Colony , which had been greatly overstocked in anticipation of a big boom after the war . The only industry which was really recovering at the time of my visit was that of gold-mining ; and here I may perhaps explain some salient features in South African mining which differentiate it from that of other countries . The distinguishing feature of the Rand formation is its consistency , but , contrary to general opinion , this formation ? the celebrated " banket " ? is not abnormally rich , but is , indeed , low-grade ore compared with many other fields , in the United States , Australia , and elsewhere . The gold is obtained by an elaborate system of crushing and washing , and the industry has been organized in a high degree and has engaged the abilities of the foremost mining engineers and chemists of the day , including many Americans . Gold-mining under these conditions has none of the adventurous and speculative elements elsewhere associated with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Another little-understood side of South African mining is its financial basis . It is usual for the critics of the mining industry in South Africa to point to a group of millionaires , many of them not of British origin , as drawing their wealth from the Transvaal soil , for which they do nothing in return . It must be clearly understood , however , that the wealth of these men is not entirely due to the out/ put of gold , but to their operations on the Stock Exchange , whereby they have exploited the potentialities of the Rand and ( not infrequently ) the over-trustfulness of the public . It is a fact that there are undeveloped properties on the Rand to-day which are held up by reason of their over-capitalization ; and the whole superstructure of finance which has risen on the foundations of the mining industry has , in fact , little relation to the value of the ore . The capital actually sunk in the Rand reaches an enormous total , and not all of it is getting interest . It is to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to those of the shareholders as to these of the mine-owners who desire to retain public confidence by the payment of dividends , to insure that the working of the industry is as economical as possible . It may surprise non-shareholders to learn that of the innumerable mines on the Rand only half a dozen are paying a dividend , and this number would be reduced by any increase in the expenditure . The interruption caused by the war naturally cost the mines a good deal . When they resumed work , it immediately became apparent that the native labor supply was insufficient . The immediate sufferers in such a crisis are not the millionaire mine-owners , but the shareholders in every part of the world . Moreover , Lord Milner , upon whom had fallen the herculean task of reorganizing the new colonies , found that his task was building upon sand unless the mining industry -- the sole industry of the Transvaal -- could be at once replaced in a prosperous condition . It must not be forgotten that the whole prosperity of the Transvaal under Kruger was built up on the profits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years before the Rand was opened ) the Transvaal was practically bankrupt . The Orange River Colony ? an agricultural community of thrifty farmers ? also owed its progress very largely to the mining industry , since the receipts from the railway which fed the mining district to the north constituted a major part of its revenue . Now , without revenue one can not have any of the essentials of progress . Education , for instance , needs to be supported by the State if it is to spread among agricultural districts , and one of the greatest difficulties of the Boer republics in their earlier days was the objection of the Boer to pay taxes . Therefore the creation among them of a revenue-producing element was a direct and immediate benefit , and , as such , was not despised even by the most Pharisaic old veldt Boer , who professed to regard the whole mining community as godless and depraved . It can not be too clearly understood that , as an agricultural or pastoral country alone , South Africa was never able to hold its own . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period in Cape Colony , and without mineral wealth not one of the colonies could ever be successfully developed . Wide as is this assertion , it is , I believe , justifiable by facts . South Africa is in parts excellent as a pastoral country . There are , all over the land , spots ( pockets they are termed ) of soil of peculiar richness , suitable for agriculture ; but the conditions of climate , the lack of natural communications , and the erratic conformation of the country make it impossible that these regions should develop as the Australian sheep and cattle " runs " have done , or like the wheat-fields of Northwest Canada or the Argentine . Irrigation on an extensive scale is necessary to carry agriculture beyond a primitive stage , and the expense and other drawbacks of irrigated produce which has to be conveyed by rail do not allow it to compete in the world 's markets with those of countries where nature does everything . The rise of great industries in such a country is essential to its development , and is recognized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regard agriculture and pastoral farming as the ultimate , permanent source of prosperity . The duration of the mines ? or rather of the banket formation , which is practically the only payable one in South Africa ? is variously estimated , but recent investigations seem to show definitely that , even at an increased rate of output , there is enough banket to last at least a hundred years . Those who care to look forward further may reasonably hope that in  |p515  that time the country will have reached a stage of development in which other industries will be able to take a prominent place , and , especially , that long before that time the lack of natural communications will be artificially supplied and the work of irrigation accomplished . Meanwhile one hears the constant complaint that the mines and mineowners do not do enough for the country , and that the drain on the resources of the country is not sufficiently compensated for by taxation . This accusation is especially brought against the diamond industry in Kimberley . The critics must , however , make allowance for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rand mines , taking out twenty millions sterling , are calculated to pay four and a half millions to the State , directly and indirectly , while the net cost of working is eleven millions , leaving four and a half millions available for shareholders . The Premier diamond mine , opened near Pretoria a few years back , pays a tax of sixty per cent. , and it is calculated that when in full working order this mine will yield a revenue of ? 1,200.000 per annum . That there are abuses in the mining laws no one will deny who has studied the matter , but many of these are due to the haphazard way in which the industry was built up and to the ignorance of the Boer Government . A great deal of the " anti-millionaire " feeling that one finds among the best South Africans is clue to the fact that the circumstances of South African mining lent themselves to the clever and unscrupulous type of financier and not to the individual miner . The plain man , who sees enormous fortunes acquired , not by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working " the market , " must be pardoned some prejudice , and it is to be regretted that the mine millionaires , who have in the process of time developed a really solid industry in South Africa , have also been in some cases associated with the wilder and less reputable forms of speculation . Very few of these men have , like Cecil Rhodes . become identified with South Africa . They have , as a rule , preferred to " work the oracle " in London or Paris , and it was no mere idle jest when Park Lane was called " a suburb of Johannesburg . " Thus the gulf deepened , and to-day it is hard to convince many impartial Africanders that the mining industry is a legitimate and essential feature in South African development . When Lord Milner began the task of reconstruction , he was faced by the non possum us of the mine-owners . Without an adequate labor supply they could not go on . It is frequently asked why the four and a half millions of South African natives could not supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this is a subject on which expert opinion is obtainable and does not admit of controversy . The Commission which was at work for two years ( in 1903-5 ) collecting information as to the natives , and which was composed of some of the best-known South Africans specially versed in native affairs , reported that , whereas the demand for native labor in South Africa totaled 782,000 , the actual number likely to be available for work at one time is only 474,000 . The natives are small cultivators on a large scale , and many do not go out to work at all ; but even those who are forced to earn wages will not work all the year round , and in a very little time can earn enough to pay taxes and live comfortably for the rest of the year . The shortage had been partially met by the importation of natives from Central and Portuguese East Africa , and in fact the latter were the only ones of any use in deep-level mining . It is possible that heavy recruiting in other parts of Africa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is an objectionable side to this constant drawing of halfsavage natives to one center , and the mine-owners certainly desired a more permanent and skilled class of laborers . The war dislocated this foreign supply and created a fresh difficulty in the home labor market , for many of the natives ( by transport riding and other means ) had acquired money enough to save them from the necessity of working for some years at least . The investment of the Bantu is usually in wives , and the exertions of these make him a gentleman of leisure . The farmers were all com/ plaining bitterly at the time of my visit to South Africa of the scarcity and dearness of native labor . To recruit heavily , by means of high wages , from the home labor market meant , therefore , to reduce the supply of workers available for the farmer ; and also , in the present stage of native evolution , this expedient would be self-destructive , since the more the native earned the less likely would he be to go on working . My own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of South Africa had led to a disorganization of the native labor market which could be restored to normal conditions only by being left alone for a time , so that the native , who has been in places demoralized by the attempts to secure him , should learn his own proper level in the industrial world , and should also , by the gradual process of civilization , be placed on a similar footing with his masters as regards the necessity for work . The present condition is that the white man must work , but the black one need not . Therefore the labor market needed to be recruited from outside ; and this being the case , and the employers having decided that to bring natives from other parts of Africa in sufficient numbers was not possible , even if desirable , the elimination of the Indian coolie ( owing to the opposition of the Indian Government ) left practically only the Chinese . The ordinance under which the Chinese were imported has been severely criticised by the present Government . ' There is no doubt that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Transvaal , though not ( in the minds of its framers ) with a view to their oppression , but to secure order while protecting them . It was and is a remarkable experiment to place this large body ( nearly 50,000 ) of alien men practically in one mass on the Rand , and it would not , in my opinion , have been possible to place them under the ordinary laws . Arrangements were somewhat hastily carried through , especially in the matter of recruiting , and a number of unruly characters came over with the first batches . The provisions for housing and feeding these coolies were superior to anything they could have been accustomed to . They were not " confined " in a " compound , " as the Kaffirs had been and still are , and their condition of " slavery " consisted only in the fact that they were bound for a certain number of years , were subject to restraints in their movements about the Rand , and were not in some respects amenable to the ordinary law of the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Rand , and as the great hope of the mine owners was that a number would sign on for an extra term , they were not likely to desire any unnecessary harshness in treating so costly a laborer . The flogging incidents of which so much has been made were the result of the difficulty found in maintaining discipline among the unruly elements of the earlier batches . An imperial official of experience in the Far East who speaks several Chinese dialects had been appointed to superintend the men . He wished to administer correction without the formalities of the magistrate 's court , believing prompt action in petty offenses to be the wisest course ; and in allowing him this discretion , Lord Milner actually infringed the ordinance and the law of the colony . Possibly the permission was abused by subordinate officials ; but though wild statements have been made to this effect , actually authenticated instances of flagrant abuse have yet to be made public . It is one of those cases when the man who takes the responsibility of going outside the letter of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disorders among the Chinese would have meant disaster ? and must yet stand his judgment at the hands of men who sit at home in a country where law and order are synonymous . Lord Milner avowed his mistake and took the entire responsibility for it , in the House of Lords , and on this avowal came the attack on him which might have ended in a vote of censure . The Government prevented this by moving an amendment in which Mr. Winston Churchill , Under-Secretary of the Colonies , changed the ground of attack and pronounced that it was not worth while for a great party to pursue an individual , especially when that individual  |p517  page deleted  |p518  in the future depends naturally very much on what is done to-day ; and if the pendulum is allowed to swing too far in the direction of restoring all political power to the Dutch , the twig will be bent by their influence and so the tree will grow . The attempts by both extreme sections to gerrymander the electorate of the Transvaal need to be carefully checked by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject ; but the gravest doubts are entertained whether the present Government is not too much influenced by the desire to develop for its own edification the principles of abstract justice to be attentive to the details of policy and expedience . In the midst of all this web of politics poor South Africa , a prey to that sort of uncertainty which saps public confidence , is suffering the severest depression . All over the world where South African shares are held disquietude prevails , and many small shareholders will be the victims . The Africander can not take the long view . He has his own present necessities to think of , and they are pressing , and the conviction grows and grows that with the interests of his country at the mercy of party politicians " at home " he is not a free man ? is not master of his fate . The most ardent Imperialist must sympathize with him , and must hope that , whatever the electoral basis of the new legislatures may be , their members will be inspired with a single desire to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinks it is to be the arbiter of the course by which that prosperity is to be reached , then good-by forever to the fond hope of a British South Africa .
