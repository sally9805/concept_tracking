SIR : In your issue of November 29. in speaking of Dr. Crapsey 's enforced retirement from the Episcopal Church , and of his advice to others holding views similar to his not to withdraw , but to remain in the Church , YOU say . This seems to us to be in the interest neither of ecclesiastical order nor of sound morals . . . The idea that the progress of truth or the reform of a creed can best be effected by remaining in a morally ambiguous position , is one to which we find it difficult to subscribe . Other statements of yours also in recent issues have seemed to give it as the opinion of the man in the street , and ti endorse that opinion , that Broad Churchmen are dishonest , as holding views which are not those of the Church to which they belong and yet retaining their positions in the Church for the sake  --  as it has been expressed  --  of " eating her bread . " This is a charge so serious that , if it is well-founded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asserting , the expulsion of all Broad Churchmen and their moral condemnation . None would demand this more insistently than the Broad Churchmen themselves . But to many this seems too easy an analysis of the situation . For , in the first place , the reoent decision of the ecclesiastical court of Western New York by which Dr. Crapsey was condemned has not in anyway affected the legal position of Broad Churchmen , at least of those outside that diocese . For the decisions of a diocesan court have only diocesan validity . To maintain that they constitute law for the whole Church is like asserting that if California excludes the Japanese from her schools , they must therefore be excluded from all schools throughout the United States . Nor does this diocesan decision have general validity given it through its recent affirmation by the Court of Review . For that court is expressly prohibited by its constitution from pronouncing upon matters of doctrine or upon the substance of cases brought before it , but must confine its consideration wholly to the legality of the lower court 's procedure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent decisions have not affected the position in the Church of any persons excepting Dr. Crapsey and possibly some in the Diocese of Western New York . But it would be abhorrent to any Christian minister to be even suspected of the methods of sharp and shady business  --  of taking advantage of a legal technicality to commit a grave moral wrong . Honesty is Just as essential in the ecclesiastical world as in the business world ; and to decide in a given case what honesty demands is often as complex a problem . The Broad Churchman maintains that he has a right in the Church morally and historically , that the position he holds is essential to the Church 's existence , and that its abandonment , if thorough , would result in her decay and death . For there have always been in the Christian Church since the days of St. James and St. Paul two differing types of mind  --  the one laying stress on institutionalism , on obedience to authority , and caring little to investigate the grounds of its belief ; and the other emphasizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conviction that honest and clear thought is not subversive of but essential in historic Christianity . Students of Church history do not need to be pointed to Clement of Alexandria and Athanasius , to Abelard and St. Francis and Wycliffe for instances of the latter type before the Reformation , while after the Reformation the tone of the Church in England was almost wholly of this type for nearly a century . For it was not until the beginning of the seventeenth century that the party represented by Bancroft and Laud gained a sufficient footing to be recognized and opposed . - It is the contention , then , of the Broad Churchman that he is conforming to the standards of his Church quite as truly as the High Churchman . For the most pertinent standard is that which is contained in the promise the priest makes at his ordination  --  that he will " minister the doctrine and sacraments and the discipline of Christ , as the Lord hath commanded , and as this Church bath received the same . " And when he asks where the official statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received by the Church , he is pointed not to constitution or canon or legal decision , for there are none containing the final utterance . But he is referred to the Prayer Book and to its services . What he seeks is to be found in these embedded . An official standard of interpretation of doctrine the Church has never established . In order to ascertain how the Church " hath receivedthe same , " it would be manifestly incompetent to turn and ask the man in the street ; for that which seems to him the " plain " or the " common-sense " or the " only " meaning of a theologic statement , is not unlikely to be wholly modern or local , or even individual . It is the consensus of opinion of the Church at large which must be taken as the ultimate standard . This may seem too vague to be of value . It furnishes , it is true , no rule of thumb for the ready settlement of disputes , and none such is possible . And here is a main ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to assert , " There must be such a rule , and the thumb must be mine . " But , instead of being so vague as to be unpractical , it is , on the other hand , the only practicable standard , for it consists not in rules , but in principles . It is the same as the standard of the law of the land . For this resides only secondarily in the ordinances of Legislatures and the decisions of courts . Primarily , it is in the justice , the intelligence , the moral sense of the people ; and this slowly but surely shapes legal precedents and police regulations . For certain practical emergencies the Church has established canons . She has also set forth creeds . But she has never attempted in this country to nail a given meaning to an article of belief , but has maintained that comprehensiveness in its interpretation , within the reasonable limits recognized by her whole history , is as important as exactness . Such comprehensiveness has long existed in case of every article of the Apostles ' Creed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of asserting that " I believe in God " or " in the resurrection of the body " has or must have the same shade of meaning to every one who uses the Creed . But the thought of the Church has been only recently awakened to the application of this principle to the two articles concerning the Virgin birth and the resurrection of Jesus . There are unquestionably in the New Testament two different traditions in regard to the manner of Jesus 's birth , and two different modes of viewing his resurrection . The Broad Churchman who is a priest promised at the ordination to instruct his people out of the Scriptures , and to " teach nothing as necessary to eternal salvation but that which you shall be persuaded may be concluded and proved by Scripture . " He has surely , therefore , strong ground in maintaining that views which are in the Scriptures are at least permissible in the Church . He also-maintains that whichever of the views above mentioned is held , belief in the divinity of Christ , and in his resurrection is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason that he repudiates the charge of dishonesty when he repeats the Creed , with its articles of the Virgin birth and the resurrection of the body , since he holds the identical truth these were designed to express . The language in which it was expressed was doubtless sufficient for its time , but to-day it needs sifting to reveal its message , just as hell-fire needs sifting in order to reveal beneath it the solid fact of eternal loss . The High Churchman declares , " One only of these views of the Creed is consistent with belief in the divinity of Christ , and legal in the Church . " The Broad Churchman replies , " Both are so consistent , and both are legal . " The attempt to narrow the terms of subscription to one rigidly defined type Is a late development in the history of doctrine , and one which has in every case been soon abandoned . This is made evident in Prof. A. V. G. Allen 's forthcoming book on the subject . The attempt , however , is the result of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As the spirit of scientific thought increases , many fields are brought within its range which previously had been left quiet in vague indeterminateness . But it is pseudo-scientific to insist on defining what can not be defined , and on interpreting poetry or theology in terms of legal contract . Whether the position of the Broad Churchman is legal in the Episcopal Church is a matter now in some quarters under discussion . The Crapsey case has given weight to the opinion that it is not . it has established no decision making it illegal . It was in view of this , I take it , as well as through his unshaken loyalty to the Church he has loved and served so nobly , that Dr. Crapsey expressed the hope that Broad Churchmen would not withdraw . Whether their views are approved or disapproved , such persons may not , I submit , be justly accused of dishonesty for holding a position which in the main has always been held in the Church , and of which even the details have not been condemned by the Church to-day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A QUESTION OF METRICS . To THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : SIR : Will you kindly make clear one or two points in the comment on Professor Lewis 's book , " The Principles of English Verse , " in your issue of November 15 . Two quotations are given , the first from Milton , and the second from Tennyson . Will you tell me why the first , " The world was all before them , " should be scanned v I I as trochaic , when it occurs in a blank-verse poem , the normal line of which would be iambic pentameter ? Moreover , this line completed with the additional words " where to choose " is a normal iambic pentameter line . Is it also a fair test of rhythm to give only a part of a line when the rhythmical character of a line is actually dependent to some extent upon the length of the line , as the reading of four and five stressed verse would prove ? The second example , " To bicker down a valley , " is taken from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naturally be scanned , I , . , , . It might also be scanned , I , but since the whole is iambic and not trochaic , the first is the correct form . How could it possibly be scanned I ? Both quotations seem clearly to fall into the form objected to , that is , ? ; and there is no rhythmical difference due to any difference in the recurrence of stressed and unstressed syllables . The real difference in the rhythmical character of the two is assignable to tone and quantity . Moreover , the main objection to Professor Lewis 's book , that he does not grant the organic value of the foot , is not clear . Is not the character of a line of verse fullyferring to some definite foot ? And the use of the foot for convenience , Professor Lewis not only grants , but adopts . If one throws away entirely the idea of the foot , there is still a " recurrence of similar phenomena at regular intervals of time , " or if preferred , " a regular arrangement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ device to indicate the division between time-intervals . ADA L. SNELL . Mount Holyoke College , South Hadley , Mass. , November 20 . The difficulty is that three things have been overlooked . First , the bar , as it is used in the review , like the bar in music , makes no break in the sound ; it merely indicates to the eye , on paper , that the recurring group of similar phenomena , by which the longer series is measured , is for convenience assumed to begin with the ictus or downbeat . In music , in ancient lyric , and in English verse that method of division best avoids confusion . The legal day begins at midnight , the astronomical day begins at noon ; does the method adopted affect in any way the phenomena themselves ? Of course , both lines are " iambic , " in the sense that each begins with the arsis . In the Miltonic phrase the syllabic relations are in no way changed by omitting the rest of the line . Second , the reader was expressly warned that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denote time-relations , not accents . Third , accented is not the same as Iong , unaccented is not the same as short . Tennyson used to complain that people confused accent and quantity . " They said the first syllable of ' sunny ' was long , whereas it evidently is short . " ( Memoir by his son , vol. ii. , pp. 12 and 400 . ) So in " bicker " and " valley , " the first syllable evidently is short . Nobody reads " To bicker down a valley " otherwise than as , , 1 j 2 ? ? , I These differences in quantity , e. e. , in time-intervals , are of the very essence of rhythm . The rhythmic character of a line is clearly not fully described by marking the accents only . Mr. Lewis 's defect is that he takes too little account of the arrangement of time-intervals between the beats  --  does not adequately analyze those groups of similar phenomena , the feet , whose regular recurrence makes rhythm . It is as if a musician should teach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between notes within the bar , merely saying vaguely that these notes differ variously , and sometimes even one note fills the whole bar , but you need n't bother to consider such trifles too curiously. ? THE REVIEWER . THE CASE OF THE TWENTY-FIFTH INFANTRY . To THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : SIR : I have followed with interest the controversy over the case of the Twenty-fifth Infantry . I have lived for many years in the neighborhood of various frontier posts , and can say , with authority , that the conduct of the colored troops compares very favorably with that of the white troops . The Third Battalion of the Twenty-fifth justice to a negro means in . Texas ? I am personally of the opinion that the entire Twenty-fifth Infantry would prefer " discharge without honor " to surrendering a comrade to a Texas lynching bee . It has required no little moral courage for the men of the Twenty-fifth Infantry to stand by their comrade , or comrades . Our President has himself the courage  --  and in his position it requires considerable courage  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regretted that he can not see the affairs of the Twenty-fifth Infantry in this light .
