Kate and I are leaving for Vassar tomorrow . p. 7 SALLY Then you must be Wanda . I am Kate 's room-mate Sally Webb , and this is Miss Conway . HELEN ( cross to WANDA R.

( enters door L. C. ) Nobody around and a great big automobile standing in front of our house . What will the neighbors say . I never can make up my mind that automobiles are quite respectable .

CARROLL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respectable ? WANDA Do n't be silly , mother . One of them is Sally Webb , Kate 's room-mate at Vassar. ( crosses L. , to mirror  --  arranges her hair ) MRS . CARROLL ( R. ) Mercy sakes , I will go to them at once . You fetch Kate . ( taking off her colored apron and putting on white one ) WANDA ( L. ) Where is she ? MRS . CARROLL Out walking with that John Willett . WANDA ( shows great anger ) What ! ( turning from mirror ) p. 9 MRS . CARROLL Yes , and I wish she would n't . Kate has got to make a good marriage and he has n't a red cent . I set my heart on her taking Amos North , but it looks as if she was more than half in love with this John Willett . ( She exits door R. ) WANDA Oh , if she dares . She knows that I always loved him .

I nebber did see sich a girl . ( he crosses down lane and out of sight ) JOHN It is too bad to lose any part of this perfect day , ( he rises ) but I must go back to the office . KATE ( arranging flowers ) You need not hurry  --  it is my last day you know . p. 11 JOHN I am not very likely to forget it . It is all right for you  --  you are going back to your college  --  but it is hard on those you leave behind you . KATE Oh , yes  --  mother  --  ( she crosses to desk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( follows her over R. , to desk ) Your mother is not the only one you leave behind who love  --  who is fond of you .

JOHN I  --  I can see your mother any day you know  --  after you have gone . KATE That is so sweet of you . Mother will be lonely without either of her daughters  --  but of course if you come here every day to see her  --  JOHN Eh  --  yes  --  yes  --  I  --  I expect I have been calling every day of late . KATE I am sure that mother has been very glad to see you . p. 12 JOHN Is that all ? ( he crosses close to her ) Has no one else been glad besides your mother ? KATE Oh , yes  --  ( he smiles ) My sister . JOHN ( disgusted ) Your sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been coming here to see  --  it is  --   --  ( MRS . C. enters . ) KATE Mother ! I know . Mother , Mr. Willett was just saying  --   --  JOHN That I must run back to the office . MRS . CARROLL Oh  --  that 's too bad ! KATE I told you she would be sorry . JOHN ( to KATE ) But  --  but if the message I am expecting is not there  --  may  --  may I come back . KATE Mother  --  Mr. Willett is asking you a question . MRS . CARROLL I think he was asking you , my dear . JOHN Yes  --  you . KATE Me ! Oh  --  yes  --  yes  --  come back  --  I am always glad to see you . JOHN ( tenderly to her  --  aside ) Is that all that you can say ? p. 13 KATE Oh , dear no  --  mother 's glad , too . JOHN I  --  I  --   --  KATE What is it , John ? JOHN I  --  I  --   --  MRS .

KATE So many people are saying lately , mother dear , that I am just like you  --  when you were a girl . MRS . CARROLL Ca n't you try to be serious for once . KATE I might try , but I am afraid it would be no use . MRS . CARROLL That young man has n't a dollar in the world . KATE Oh , yes he has , for he asked me to go to the Musical to-night  --  he must have at least two dollars , mother . MRS . CARROLL Have you promised to marry him ? KATE No . MRS . CARROLL I am so glad . p. 14 KATE I could n't promise him that . MRS . CARROLL Good . KATE Because he has never asked me . MRS . CARROLL I do n't want you to go to that concert with him  --  that 's the very chance he wants . You are going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be over . KATE He is very poor , is n't he ? MRS . CARROLL Yes . KATE If I should go without seeing him again , you would let him borrow a stamp , would n't you ? MRS . CARROLL Kate  --  Wanda has got money from her father . You 've hardly got enough to finish your year at Vassar . I do want you to marry well . Now there 's Amos North  --  he 's got more money than any young man in Great Falls . KATE He needs more . MRS . CARROLL He 's crazy in love with you . KATE I 've noticed the crazy part . MRS . CARROLL If you were his wife you could do as you pleased . KATE Then I should get a divorce . MRS . CARROLL I give you up , Kate Newton  --  I do n't believe you 've got good sense . p. 15 KATE You should n't say that , mother  --  when we are so much alike . MRS . CARROLL Oh , dear , I had almost forgotten some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they are sitting in the parlor . KATE Friends of mine ? Who ? MRS . CARROLL That Sally Webb you are always talking about is one of them . KATE Sally here , and you never told me. ( she runs to door R. ) Sally , Sally , where are you Sa  --  SALLY ( out R. ) Here . KATE Sally  --  ( SALLY enters and runs into KATE 'S arms ) You dear thing  --  it is so good to see you again . ( HELEN enters . ) SALLY After to-morrow we will see one another every day . This is Miss Conway , Kate , a freshman . KATE I am glad to know you , Miss Conway , if you are a friend of Sally 's . ( KATE grips HELEN 'S hand , causing her to scream . Auto horn outside ) MRS . CARROLL Kate Newton , I 'm ashamed of you . ( Exits door R. SHINY enters and stops at window. ) p. 16 SHINY I say , Miss , the gentleman in the automobile says that he do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? SHINY That 's all , just but  --  ( auto horn ) It looks to me though as if he 'd say worse if you kept him waiting much longer . SALLY My father . We 'll see you to-morrow , dear . Good-bye . HELEN ( crosses to KATE ) I 'm sure we will have lots of fun at Vassar . ( HELEN grips KATE 'S hand , causing KATE to scream ) KATE You 're all right for a freshman . SALLY Do n't forget those old clothes you promised me . Good-bye . ALL Good-bye . ( All the three girls start for door L. C. laughing and talking and trying to exit at once . SHINY is inside of door bowing and scraping to girls as they exit . Auto effect outside . KATE at gate calling good-bye until girls well off . ) SHINY My goodness , do n't they talk . They surely ai n't nothing can talk more than a woman , less it 's two women . ( KATE enters . ) KATE Oh , it is so good to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 17 SHINY Say , Miss Kate , you remember what you had promised me about getting me a job at Vassar College . KATE I only promised to try . SHINY That 's all I ask . If you all try it 's as good as did . Dey ca n't nobody refuse you nothing . Just tell ' em that I 'm a worker , a great worker when I likes my job . KATE All right , you shall have the work . SHINY I did n't say anything about work  --  I said a job . Work 's work , but a job 's a job  --  I wants a job . KATE If you are anxious to show me how well you can work , Shiny , just you run up in the attic and bring down that old trunk of my grandmother 's . ( SHINY crosses R. , starts for door ) Wait , the little black one with the brass nails . SHINY All right , Miss Kate . I 'll tote it down  --  but do n't you all forget about that job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got a job at Vassar College , I 'd be a regular Vassarlina . ( He exits door R. AMOS NORTH enters in lane , crosses through gate to door L. C. ) KATE He shall have this job if Miss Page can get it for him . It will be such fun to show him to the girls . ( AMOS NORTH , a young and rather over-dressed country youth , enters at door . He smiles rather foolishly. ) p. 18 AMOS Hello , Kate . KATE ( turns and sees him ) Why , Amos North ! I thought I told you I would be too busy to see anyone to-day . AMOS Did you  --  ah well  --  girls never know their own minds two days running . I got a new horse , Kate . KATE Is that so  --  why are n't you driving it ? AMOS Because I 'd rather take you out for a walk . KATE The idea  --  walk ! It 's too hot  --  besides I am too tired . AMOS You are always too tired to go to walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am so dreadfully busy . ( JOHN crosses at back and stands in door . ) JOHN Miss Newton  --  it 's all right , I can get away  --  wo n't you come for a little walk . KATE Oh , yes  --  I should love it . AMOS What  --  I thought it was too hot  --  and you were too tired . KATE The Lord has changed the weather , Mr. North  --  and I have changed my mind . ( She runs out door and down path and off with JOHN. ) p. 19 AMOS And that 's the best I get . She 's glad to go with him , but she 's too tired to go with me  --  I ca n't understand it . The girl must be a fool . ( WANDA enters . ) WANDA Why , Amos  --  I did n't know you were here . Where is Kate ? AMOS ( sulky ) Out  --  out to walk . WANDA Why did n't you go with her ? AMOS Ha  --  ha  --  ha  --  ( laughs a short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WANDA They ! AMOS John Willett came for her . WANDA Again . AMOS I 've got my opinion of a man that 's got nothing better to do than hang around  --  day times  --  with a girl . WANDA What do you do ? AMOS ( angry ) I hope you do n't compare me to John Willett . WANDA I should hope not ! He 's a real smart man . AMOS Architect he calls himself  --  and nobody in this town would trust him to build a hen-house . It 's only his cheek that keeps him going ; he never designed anything in his life but castles in the air . p. 20 WANDA ( angry ) Well he do n't drink too much wine  --  like some people I know . AMOS You bet he do n't . He could n't pay for wine enough to give a rabbit indigestion. ( she turns away angrily and crosses up to window . He follows her ) Look here , Wanda  --  I want Kate  --  she 's got to marry me . She 's the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . WANDA Do n't tell me your troubles . I ca n't be bothered with them . AMOS You ought to be  --  when they are your troubles too  --  ( WANDA surprised ) Oh , I know  --  you are in love with John Willett yourself . ( she starts to speak and he stops her by raising his hand ) Do n't bother to deny it  --  because I know better . Now it 's up to you , Wanda  --  if you and I are smart  --  we could keep those two apart . WANDA What ! Do you think that I would do anything that was not honorable ? AMOS Ha  --  ha  --  ha  --  ( he crosses to door ) WANDA ( follows ) Do you think I would take part in any trickery to separate two persons who  --  who care for one another ? p. 21 AMOS ( at door ) Tell those things to John . He has n't lived around here as long as I have . ( He exits and passes down the lane and out . ) WANDA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . Kate has only known John such a little while  --  if she had not come back this summer he would have cared for me  --  I  --  I would not do anything that was not right  --  but he would be glad some day if some real friend should keep him from marrying her . ( She exits . KATE and JOHN on at back and stop at gate . JOHN steps towards her as if to take her hand and she avoids him and crosses into house . He follows . ) KATE Well  --  I have already promised to go to the Musical with you to-night . What more do you want ? JOHN I would like to have you stop laughing at me . KATE I am so happy to-day that I think I could laugh at anything . JOHN Happy . ( he closes close up to her ) And to-morrow you will be gone . KATE Mother will be here . JOHN Kate ! ( he puts his hand on her arm ) You ca n't play with me . I am in earnest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his arms around KATE , who puts flowers into his hands ) p. 22 JOHN ( confused ) Thank you , I  --  I  --  KATE You like flowers , do n't you ? JOHN I like these flowers . KATE They are pretty . In all the world you 'll find no prettier flowers than the poppy and the pink . JOHN Kate , you must listen to me . KATE I will listen  --  if you will let me go . JOHN I do n't want to ever let you go ! KATE Well , let 's sit down . We ca n't stand this way forever . JOHN Kate  --  have you a heart ? KATE ( looks up at him , then softens ) Yes ,  --   --  John  --  ( tenderly , then lighter ) and  --  and it 's acting very queerly  --  just now . JOHN You know that I am poor  --  but I am doing good work . I have sent drawings to New York , that I know will give me my start . KATE Good . JOHN ( with great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KATE ( interrupts ) A church  --  this is growing interesting  --  until you spoke about a church I  --  I had begun to think this was a business discussion . p. 23 JOHN By the time your year at Vassar is over I will be in a position to  --  ( WADNA enters door R. , as he begins to speak and now steps forward showing by his manner that she has made up her mind to stop him . ) WANDA I am sure I beg your pardon . ( They separate , both are confused and angry ) Am I in the way ? KATE ( a little nasty ) No dear , you are never in the way . WANDA My books are not packed yet you know . ( she crosses up to shelf ) JOHN Kate  --  to-night . KATE Yes . JOHN You must give me a chance to speak to you  --  alone . KATE ( softly ) I will be waiting for you , John  --  to-night . JOHN Good-bye . ( he crosses up to door ) Good afternoon , Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driven you away ! JOHN ( laughs ) Not so far , but that I shall be back again . ( He exits out door and off. ) p. 24 WANDA I am sorry , Kate , that I interrupted you . KATE So am I. ( she crosses to table and hunts about ) Did you get the string ? WANDA I forgot it . KATE I ca n't pack without it . I will have to go to the store . ( she picks up her hat and crosses to door ) I 'll be back in five minutes . WANDA Kate ! ( KATE stops ) I have something to say to you . KATE Wo n't it keep until I get the string ? WANDA It  --  it is about Mr. Willett . Kate , he  --  he 's not just the man that I could advise you to trust . KATE I know , dear , but then I have n't asked your advice . WANDA He , he is very fickle , Kate  --  and  --  and he does not mean all he says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is not news to me . WANDA I know him better than you do . KATE ( very sweetly ) You do now , darling , ( exit through door ) but in the future , I shall know him very much better than you . ( at window exit R. ) p. 25 WANDA She loves him  --  it 's no use . Amos North always was a fool  --  what can we do  --  nothing at all . Nothing  --  we might just as well make up our minds to that . ( She selects several books and places them in a pile and picks them up and crosses toward door at R. For about twenty seconds there is a pause . As she gets to door R. , JOHN enters from L. , in lane at back and crosses up path to house and stops in door . JOHN 'S manner is hurried and excited ) JOHN Miss Wanda  --  ( she turns and is surprised ) I have news  --  I must see your sister . WANDA She is not at home . JOHN I must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . WANDA You are going away ? JOHN Yes  --  to New York . I submitted some drawings for a New York church  --  just now  --  I found a Mr. Nathan and his daughter at my office  --  the head of the board , they have chosen my plans from among fifty others  --  and I must go with them to New York at once . WANDA It is good news  --  it is your start , Mr. Willett . JOHN I knew it would come  --  a man does n't work as I have worked for nothing  --  it means everything to me  --  and I hope it does for Kate . ( she turns away ) I promised to see her to-night  --  but now it will be impossible and before I return she will be at Vassar . Could you tell me where she went . p. 26 WANDA I  --  I do not know . JOHN If it were only to one of the stores , I could follow her . WANDA Oh , no  --  in fact she  --  she told me that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't see her . I will have to leave a message  --  could I write her a note ? WANDA There  --  ( she points to table , he crosses and sits ) JOHN I am going to say in the note what I had intended to say to her to-night  --  that I love her  --  and that I want her to be my wife . WANDA Oh  --  ( she sits in chair ) JOHN ( looks up ) Anything wrong ? WANDA No  --  no  --  I am a little tired . ( he writes ) JOHN You will see that she gets this , wo n't you ? ( he folds it ) I will leave it here with you . WANDA With me ? JOHN Yes . ( he rises . He crosses to her and holds out his hand ) Good-bye . WANDA Good-bye . ( she does not take his hand and puts her own back of her ) Why  --  why do n't you mail your letter ? It is safer , Mr. Willett. p. 27 JOHN Oh , no  --  she must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what to think . I will leave it with you  --  good-bye . ( He exits door ) WANDA I warned him not to leave it here with me . ( She crosses slowly to get letter , SHINY enters door R. , with small black trunk . Just as WANDA puts out her hand to pick up letter SHINY drops trunk . At the sound , WANDA screams and jumps away from table leaving the letter where it was . ) SHINY Did ah skeer yer ? WANDA What are you doing here ? SHINY Dun fetched dis here ole trunk fo ' Miss Kate . WANDA Well , go away . I do n't want you here . SHINY All right  --  de treatment ar gets from everybody in dis house besides Miss Kate am enough to make a thoughtful man like me wish he had been born an egg . ( Quick exit R. WANDA watches him off , then turns to run to table , before she gets to it KATE enters at door with ball of string in her hand . ) KATE Here 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ packing done ? p. 28 WANDA No . KATE Why not ? Has anyone been here while I was out ? WANDA ( hesitates ) No  --  KATE What in the world have you been doing ? WANDA I  --  I wrote a letter . ( she crosses to table and picks up JOHN 'S letter ) KATE A letter ? WANDA Yes , but I shall not send it now . ( she tears the letter up and crushes the fragments in her hand ) KATE Well , I have n't time to write letters and then throw them away . I must finish my packing . ( she kneels by trunk ) I am going out this evening with Mr. Willett . WANDA Mr. Willett has gone to New York . KATE ( looks up ) What . WANDA Yes  --  he said he wo n't go with you tonight . KATE ( quickly ) I thought you said no one had been here while I was out . WANDA I  --  I saw him passing with his bag  --  he said he was going to New York . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave for me . WANDA Message  --  why he left no message at all . KATE He must have said something . He had asked me to go to the Musical with him to-night . WANDA Oh , yes  --  that is what he meant ? I did not understand it at the time . KATE What ? WANDA He said for me to tell you that it was all a mistake . KATE All a mistake . WANDA Yes  --  about the Musical I suppose . ( HANK enters a gate and up to door and enters . KATE turns away to control herself . ) HANK I got them tickets . ( he takes off his straw hat and takes two R. R. tickets out ) Here they be . ( he gives the tickets to WANDA ) WANDA You were long enough getting them . HANK Could n't help it . There was ther prettiest girl I ever see down to ther station and I had to take a good look at her . WANDA A pretty girl  --  who was she ? HANK I der know ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His girl I guess  --  anyway she and him went away together on the train . ( He exits ) p. 30 WANDA I told you , Kate , not to trust him . HANK ( at window ) They 'll be getting married some day and I bet you 'll read that in the papers , too . ( Exit through gate L. U. ) KATE It does n't seem to me that he could go away like that  --  after  --  after to-day  --  without a word . WANDA ( she crosses to her ) Let me comfort you . KATE ( sharply ) You go and pack your trunk , If I need any smelling salts I 'll go and get them myself .

C. ) You will pardon me if I address myself to your daughter . Miss Carroll , I need hardly tell you that this is not a social call . Your manner to me has taught me how un-welcome my visit must be to you . p. 76 AMOS Then why in thunder do n't you go ! KATE For once Mr. North has expressed my thoughts  --  if you come here only to insult me it would be better for you to go .

JOHN The Brewers ' Certificates are held in person by the Brewers ' themselves  --  only five thousand shares are on the market . AMOS That 's right . It was some of those shares I sold her . JOHN At considerable trouble I have traced every share of those five thousand . They are all accounted for . You never saw a share in all your life . You picked out a stock that was dropping in the market  --  and trusted to her ignorance to let you rob her of her money . p. 77 AMOS You will have to prove all that . JOHN The proof is here  --  all of it . ( he holds up envelope ) Your letters that she sent to the Judge  --  saying you had bought the stock  --  and others asking for more money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that you never owned a share of it . MRS . CARROLL But  --  but I do n't understand . JOHN You do n't have to understand  --  just turn this ( he passes her envelope ) over to the Judge and he will explain it all to Amos . ( AMOS falls on sofa . ) MRS . CARROLL I  --  I do n't know what to do . ( she crosses to desk and puts envelope in drawer ) I 'll lock it up safe to-night  --  and to-morrow I will see the Judge .

The trouble is I did n't flirt with him enough  --   --  ( KATE and MRS . C. , EXIT D. R. leaving AMOS alone on stage . He looks after them  --  follows and looks out door and then turns and crosses swiftly to desk and tries to force open the drawer in which MRS . C. , put the envelope . WANDA comes to door and stands looking at him . He looks up and sees her and stands afraid . ) AMOS There 's something in this drawer , I 've got to get it . WANDA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I played a trick on her  --  so as to force Kate to marry me  --  and it would have worked if it had n't been for that John Willett . I never stole a dollar in my life  --  I never had to  --  I 've always had a plenty  --  but she 's got letters of mine here that will send me to jail if she shows them to the Judge . WANDA Well , you should n't have tried to rob my mother . AMOS I did n't  --  and you know it  --  I would have given the money back  --  I was only trying to frighten Kate into marrying me . Wanda  --  I 've got to get those letters  --  to-night . WANDA Mother 's got the key . AMOS ( fiercely ) Then I 'll smash the damned thing open .

If you do n't I 'll tell Kate about your coming between her and John Willett. p. 80 WANDA I wo n't do it . AMOS I 'll tell her about you stealing the letters he wrote to her  --  that 's worse than what I did  --  robbing the United States Mails . WANDA Mother locks up herself . AMOS You come back here  --  after she 's gone  --  and unlock that window  --  all I want is my letters back again . I 'll give her , her money  --  I only want to hush this thing up . ( puts on coat ) . WANDA I am afraid to do it . AMOS You 'd better not be  --  or I 'll give you something to be afraid about ! John Willett thought a lot of Kate  --  If I tell him about the letters you stole I guess you 'll be pretty sick .
