FRED STILLWATER Do n't be so anxious , I 'm all right . I consider every potato that costs me ten dollars to raise , equivalent to a doctor 's pill . Dear heart , how sweet you look . The country air and quiet life have n't done you any harm either . Do you remember , Bess , a wavy field of wheat and an audacious young lover who would n't take no for an answer . We had some happy days in Indiana . p. 9 ELIZABETH STILLWATER ( with a sigh ) Yes : The early struggle was hard , and when our little baby girl came , our Indiana , everything seemed to prosper with us .

I think more slowly than you  --  and you have asked me quite a difficult question . INDIANA STILLWATER ( r. who has been taking off jacket assisted by Lord T. He puts in on l. end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , Lord Stafford ( to c . ) You have come west ostensibly to shoot things , and your nephew for scientific purposes , ostensibly , but you spend night after night over your brandy and soda  --  discussing the American woman .

By your assured manner I thought it was all cut and dried . Thurston , my boy , do n't do it . I feel a responsibility . I brought you here . I promised your mother to look to you .

THURSTON I will sir  --  FRED STILLWATER Do n't marry my daughter  --  THURSTON ( looking squarely at him ) Why ? FRED STILLWATER It 'll never pan out  --  your ways are not her ways , her thoughts and yours are as far apart as if she spoke Chinese and you Pennsylvania Dutch . p. 40 THURSTON ( c . ) Mr. Stillwater , I am not easily frightened , the more difficulties I encounter the more determined I am to win . FRED STILLWATER ( r. c. ) ( quickly ) Now do n't misunderstand me  --  my daughter 's no worse than any other man 's daughter  --  our women are all alike , but we know how to get along with them .

FRED STILLWATER I never stand out against them , so they ca n't quarrel with me , and when they quarrel between themselves I agree with each one separately . p. 41 THURSTON ( x'ing to swing quietly ) I 'm afraid I could not adopt that method  --  ( sits ) FRED STILLWATER ( quickly ) There , I told you it would n't do . The fact is , Lord Canning , we spoil our children , we know it , but we ca n't help it  --  the boys are early enough thrown on the world .

THURSTON I did  --  I do  --  but my courage has left me , I feel as when I once stood before an impenetrable territory of snow and ice leading I knew not whither . INDIANA STILLWATER I hope you 're not as cold ? THURSTON Outwardly perhaps , inwardly burning  --  I want to  --  to  --  er  --  to  --  ( as if changing the subject ) You know the customs in England  --  are very different from here . p. 44 INDIANA STILLWATER ( watching him slyly ) Are they ?

( to chair l . ) THURSTON ( seriously ) ( following her ) Indiana  --  I am a very serious man ; I accept life as worth living only with serious aims . I have traveled all over the world in the cause of science , especially in the unpeopled vasts . It does seem inconsistent , does it not , that a little undeveloped creature like you should attract me so strongly ? p. 45 INDIANA STILLWATER Oh no ! It 's not at all strange  --  everybody likes me ! THURSTON ( smiles  --  then seriously ) Your little hands have bowled over all my long cherished traditions . You have taken possession of me in a manner which terrifies me . I am miserable away from you ; you flit before me like a tantalizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mail lies upon my table unanswered . Tell me  --  have I a chance with you ? or  --  let me put the ocean between us for self preservation . INDIANA STILLWATER ( x'ing to swing ) I do not wish you to think that I trifle with marriage , because I have refused several offers , it is not waywardness nor frivolity , but because I realize my shortcomings . ( sits with a half saucy , half serious laugh ) THURSTON ( to l. of swing ) Indiana ! INDIANA STILLWATER ( seriously ) You admit in your feelings for me reason has no place , and in your calmer moments , your ideal of a wife is something entirely different from myself . THURSTON Yes  --  reason has no place  --  it is love  --  love alone  --  p. 46 INDIANA STILLWATER It 's hard to be truthful about one 's defects  --  but I am very much spoiled  --  THURSTON You have all the imperfections which make you charming to a lover  --  you have all the virtues which make you divine to your husband .

She has lived a retired life for many years . Our house may be quiet for you at first  --  INDIANA STILLWATER Oh , do n't worry about that , I 'll make it lively enough . p. 47 THURSTON ( attempts to embrace her ) Darling !

LORD STAFFORD By George , I should say I find her very much changed . INDIANA STILLWATER ( c. sweetly ) For the better , dear Uncle Gerald ? LADY CANNING When we transplant a flower , we must watch it very carefully for a time lest it wither in the process . Indiana is a most flexible little person . She appears to have taken root in our soil so easily  --  she had not been here a week when she was perfectly at home . INDIANA STILLWATER Thanks to your good advice , my dear Lady Canning . You have taken so much trouble with me. ( to sofa ) LADY CANNING To be frank , Gerald , Indiana was a most agreeable surprise . When Thurston wrote me that he had selected a wife in the wilds of America , I fell ill with fright . I could n't find out anything about the place , and the name suggested horrible visions of half-breeds and wild girls who climb trees and ride a horse bare back . Those banjo playing and whistling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America is a very large country , dear Lady Canning . There are tree climbers and bare-back riders in the uncivilized parts , I believe . ( Thurston turns away to conceal a laugh ) In fact , I myself must have appeared  --  er  --  strange to you at first , did I not , dear Lady Canning ? LADY CANNING Oh , no  --  only a little rasping quality of the voice which has since greatly modified . INDIANA STILLWATER That is our climate , Lady Canning . The sharp winds have a tendency to pitch our voices in a high key . ( imitates yankee nasal tone on high key ) LADY CANNING And your gowns , dear , were a little too modern  --  too expensive for a young wife . You do n't mind my saying it , Indiana . INDIANA STILLWATER I am so grateful to you . Dear Lady Canning has given me the real English taste in the selection of a gown . ( aside to Lord S. c . ) Dowdy is n't it ? I adore Irish poplins , English cheviots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first bonnet  --  is n't ( aside ) so unbecoming . LADY CANNING Well , dear , as soon as a girl is married , she wears a bonnet with strings ; that is always the sign of a matron in England . You know there must be something to distinguish the married from the single woman . p. 59 INDIANA STILLWATER Yes , certainly , I approve of it . Then there can be no danger of mistakes being made by strangers . LORD STAFFORD ( laughing ) Ha ! Ha ! As they say in the States , you have hitched on , Indiana  --  you 've mashed ' em cold all around . LADY CANNING ( severely ) Mashed ' em cold ! My dear brother , what do you mean by such expressions ? They appear to be very vulgar . Is it really American , Indiana ? INDIANA STILLWATER Not at all , dear Lady Canning . In the uncultured wastes only the natives make use of such barbarisms . LADY CANNING My darling , go and lay off your bonnet and smooth your hair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a curtsey and exits in room . Thurston roaring with laughter after her ) LORD STAFFORD Remarkable ! LADY CANNING ( with a sigh of content ) The child has perfect manners ; one would think she had been born and bred in England . I do n't allow her to call me mother  --  it 's a better moral effect and with a little tender firmness combined with the dignity that awes , I have accomplished wonders . I shudder to think what would have been the results if I had not been here . Thurston spoils her shockingly . p. 60 LORD STAFFORD Ah , does he ? Very unwise , I 'm sure . LADY CANNING Yes . But it 's turned out very , very well . You know how adverse I have always been to Thurston marrying a modern woman  --  those editing magazines and forming clubs and racing women  --  Ah ! ( with a shudder ) England is not what it was in my time . LORD STAFFORD When Thurston first broke it to me , I was very doubtful of the results  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CANNING I do n't wonder at it . She 's so bright , so amusing , so clever , so lovable , she must have come from very fine stock . LORD STAFFORD ( seriously ) Very ! You should see Grandma Chazy Bunker . " She beats the band , " as we say in the States . LADY CANNING ( severely ) " Beats the Band ! " Your expressions make me shudder . LORD STAFFORD " I guess I took it on thick before I left New York . " LADY CANNING You might have brought something more creditable all that way . LORD STAFFORD I have . Helena , I 'm going to let you into a little secret . Indiana 's people came over with me from America . p. 61 LADY CANNING Who  --  LORD STAFFORD The whole bunch .

Her grandmother , too . Why , the highest respect is due to their age in the way of preparation . LORD STAFFORD In America there 's nothing that gives so much pleasure as " springing " things on a person . The surprise party is no fad in America  --  it 's a national institution . LADY CANNING ( on her feet agitated ) But my dear uncle , think of the shock to Indiana , that young married thing . It might be serious . LORD STAFFORD She wo n't turn a hair , as we say in the States  --  she 's a thoroughbred . Hi ! Hi ! Hi ! LADY CANNING My dear , I 'm very glad you told me. ( rises ) I must go and make some kind of toilette to receive them , and the housekeeper must be apprised. p. 62 LORD STAFFORD ( guyingly ) ( x'ing with Lady C. towards door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't put yourself out , as we say in the States . Surprise parties are in circulation , and are accepted as " legal tender " by the people . They wo n't disturb anybody and possibly they 'll bring their own food .

If I had argued with her , it would have been impossible to live under the same roof , so I agreed with her in everything , consequently I am the best , most lovable girl in the world . All the same I own her body and soul  --  that 's my method of subjugation . Of course he 's not satisfied . Nothing I do pleases him . THURSTON Indiana ! INDIANA STILLWATER ( half mockingly ) Uncle Gerald , I 'm frightfully good . ( down r. c . ) I 've never been so good in my life . I feel like an angel , so sweet , so obedient , so ordinary . Thurston does n't appreciate it  --  He does n't love me as much as he did before we were married . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indiana , how can you say that ? INDIANA STILLWATER I thought he was a gentleman of leisure , and he works harder than a farm hand . He sits up half the night reading and studying . If I had known he was such a great scholar , I would n't have married him . ( punching Lord S. on shoulder ) p. 64 THURSTON Indiana , do you mean that ? INDIANA STILLWATER ( x'ing back of table c. to Lord S. ) No , serious face . I 'm only joking . Uncle Gerald , do you think he 'll ever be a great man ? ( back toward Lord S. ) LORD STAFFORD I hope so . INDIANA STILLWATER Oh ! as great as Thomas Carlyle ? Do n't say yes , because I 'll run away . You know what Jane Carlyle said about the wives of men of genius  --  they 're more miserable even  --  than  --  than doctors ' wives . Thurston has symptoms .

I mean not all the time . ( with a gulp ) That song upset me and I had a terrible longing just to get a look at Dad and Mother and Grandma Chazy , and then pack them all home again . I wish you would n't take me so seriously . Thurston , do n't watch every quiver of my eyes and think it 's a tragedy . Discipline is a very good thing for me  --  I like it . But I wish you would n't believe every word I say ; it 's aggravating enough when your mother does it .

You force my sympathy and repel it , in a breath . Your moods change with the minutes , but it all would n't matter , if I were sure you were learning to love me  --  to give only a little in return for my deep affection  --  that would set my heart at rest and smooth away all difficulties .

THURSTON ( stern and cold , drawing himself up ) Prove to my own satisfaction , the truth of your statement that my wife is not , and never can be happy in her new home . I shall not ask her . I am egotistical enough to believe that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than you , and I am convinced that a few years away from her family , will convert the spoiled child into a splendid self-controlled woman .

GLEN ( rising ) Lord Canning , I  --  I do n't know why  --  but I do n't feel anything near as confident as I did when I came in . I was sure my platform was a just and equitable one , but since I 've been watching you and listening , I begin to feel a little ashamed of myself . p. 110 THURSTON ( half seriously ) No occasion for it , I 'm sure . GLEN You 're a fine fellow , sir , and if Indiana is not happy with you  --  it is not your fault  --  it 's the fault of your nationality  --  that 's the only weak point I can see in you .

LADY CANNING Thurston , you are developing a very bad temper . You  --  you have never before acted in such an inconsistent  --  inconsiderate manner  --  and with such a sweet wife  --  you do n't deserve her . It really does n't do for a woman to love her husband too much  --  Indiana has spoiled you . p. 140 INDIANA STILLWATER ( r. c. , pleadingly ) Do n't scold him . LADY CANNING I do not wish to see you again until you tell me that you have abandoned this foolhardy , heartless idea  --  for good and all .

( Indiana watches him sharply  --  he turns quickly  --  she drops her eyes demurely  --  lips quivering like a child ) INDIANA STILLWATER ( seriously ) Now it 's wrong of you to be so hard with me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for three months and then when the folks rushed down on me like a river breaking the dam , and I saw the difference  --  in them  --  in myself  --  and I broke out  --  that 's all . Thurston , if you go away  --  will you let me stay with your mother ? ( at table c . ) THURSTON ( up r. c . ) As long as all the love is on my side  --  my wishes will always be commands to you  --  There should be no questions between a man and wife who love each other . It could not have ended otherwise . I shall make arrangements for your departure . INDIANA STILLWATER But ca n't I say good-bye to Mother , I mean Lady Canning ?

INDIANA STILLWATER I am not younger now than when I married you  --  and then you loved my youth , my wilfulness , my faults . I do not think it is honorable on your part to throw me over now  --  because of those old faults  --  and I have not developed any new ones so far . ( Thurs. smile involuntarily ) ( x 's to seat near him ) Thurston  --  ( stretching out her hands ) Wo n't you shake hands with me , Good-bye  --  ( Thurs. extends his hand with his eyes averted , Indiana grasps it quickly and with a sigh of relief holds it fast ) ( Thurs. tries to get Ind . away ) INDIANA STILLWATER ( desperately ) You shall listen to me . I wo n't let you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have queened it over people  --  delighting to feel my power  --  to make the poor things who loved me bend to my will . Last night I saw the loathing in your face , when you turned from me and ( Thurs. breaks away and down c . Ind . goes to him ) Thurston , how could you have expected me to be so different . It would n't be natural if I was . I wanted to queen it over my husband , to be put on a pedestal and worshipped . I thought it enough if I let him love me  --  I never thought it was better to love than to be loved , to serve than to be served . Thurston , take my two hands  --  hold them fast  --  I  --  I  --  love you . ( directly in front of him ) p. 143 THURSTON Indiana , for God 's sake , do n't play with me again .
