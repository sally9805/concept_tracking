txt The cotton market went through a series of convulsions yesterday such as has seldom been known . Prices fluctuated up and down with a violence unheard of in the annals of the cotton Exchanges , the difference between high and low quotations Th , immediate cause of these recordbreaking variations in the price movements is a struggle for supremacy in the cotton market such as has not been witnessed even on the Stock Exchange , except on rare occasions . In the present instance the forces which are opposing each other are Daniel J. Sully and his friends , with practically the solid South behind him , and the great mill interests of England and New England , with whom are allied some of the biggest interests in Wall Street . Up to two days ago Mr. Sully and his friends had the whip hand of the market . Prices were going up by leaps and bounds under the stimulus of their buying and that of their friends . Yesterday the bears took a turn at it . It was well known that they had been " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if he did not desist he would find no mercy if the market should go against him . But Mr. Sully merely laughed , and , relying on the strength of his backers , continued buying cotton and putting up the market . He did not believe or realize that treachery might be used against him . But on Monday morning he became aware of the insecurity of his position . SULLY 'S UNLOADING COUP . He at once decided to " take the bears by the neck , " and he determined on the execution of a coup such as the cotton market had never heard of before . All day Monday he sold more than he bought . Be had been doing this for some time , but never to such an extent as on Monday . On ' that day he sold through his brokers hundreds of thousands of bales , but when the market closed he still had great amounts of long cotton on hand . - Yesterday be began to sell , though not in person , this cotton in large blocks . The market stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the buying orders front the country exceeded his offerings : - Then it began to waver . Mr. Sully realized that if he continued to sell he would break the market beyond redemption . So he stopped his selling orders , but a few moments later there began to be whispered about , first hesitatingly , then with more and more assertion , the rumor that Mr. Sully had liquidated his entire holdings and that he was going South for the rest of the Winter . As this report gained credence in its quirk march around the ring the bulls became panic stricken . if Sully is out , what is going to become of the market , was their first idea . At once they began to sell . The market , which had been declining all morning . with occasional rallies of from le to 20 points , suddenly burst out in an uproar of frenzy , and prices began to drop at a frightful rate . Within a few minutes demoralization reigned in the pit . Everybody wanted to sell , and thousands of bales were offered , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went the price . Sully , as he stood on the outer edge of the ring of terror-stricken brokers , watched the excitement calmly at first . He had intended some kind of a break to " shake out " his weak followers . Then his countenance became grave , and at last , fearing that the market might g.0 to pieces without J hope of redemption , he jumped into the pit and attempted to stave the tide which had assumed proportions which he had not expected . His efforts were in vain , His voice was lost in the tumult . After a while , however , there was a lull . The force of the selling movement had spent itself like a mountain torrent when all its sudden swelling waters have been exhausted . In the short breathing spell i which followed it was found that in little more than an hour the active options had declined 136 points and thereabout , or $6.75 a bale . After that there were wild fluctuations up and down , seventy , eighty points at a time , but when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some fifty points above the lowest , although it was still feverish and nervous , When the market first opened declines of from 7 to 16 points were registered . This loss could have been explained by lower cables from Liverpool , by a heavier movement of the crop , and by improved weather conditions in the South . But when the market kept on its downward course brokers began to try to find who was doing the selling . The result of their inquiries must have been reassuring , for the  --  market soon began- to recover , and the July option , after having sold down to 17 cents , went up again to the high point of the morning , 17.42 . At 11:W A. M .. however . the market began to sell off again , with July , the market leader , at 17.20 . At this point there ensued a pretty struggle between the sellers and the buyers , and for an hour and a half there was little advantage apparent for either side . It was then that the reports of Sully 's having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became nervous , and shortly after 1 o'clock there came the break which carried prices down from 125 to 136 points , This break in turn was followed by a violent rally of from 60 to 75 points , which was in turn succeeded by renewed weakness . accompanied by declines of over 40 points . In this manner the pendulum swung back and forth until the gong announced the close of business . To illustrate the Violence and the rapidity of the fluctuations . it may be said that one house sent to its floor member an order to bin- 200 bales of May at the market price . The price was then 10.10 . The first 100 hales were bought at 16.35 , and the second hundred cost 16.70 . Another houee had a buying order at the market for 500 bales of July . The . ticker then showed that the price for July was 10.13 . Within five minutes the order was reported as executed , and 100 bales had been bought at 16.25. 200 at 16.45. and the last 200 at 16.80 . This order had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The purchase had been scarcely reported and noted when the price declined again , and the floor member reported that he had executed the stop loss order , but . instead of getting 16.50 for the lot he had to be satisfied with 16.45 . Of course , this netted a loss to the customer . This particular man must have suffered considerably because of the fluctuations , as he traded in 0.000 bales . not one of the transactions showing a profit . Against this may be recited the case ' of a broker on the floor , who also traded in 5,000 bales , but whose transactions showed a profit in every case . HEAVY WALL STREET LOSERS . It was partly ' because of these violent fluctuations that many firms refused to execute any new orders and discouraged customers as much as possible from going into or staying in the market . But there is another reason and that is that there are a number of houses in Wall Street who have so far suffered heavy losses in the cotton market , and these houses have sworn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have Mr. Sully 's scalp . They aria keeping every one they can out of the market , in order to limit the market in which Mr. Sully will have to dispose of the remainder of his long cotton . That he is still heavily loaded Vaith long contracts is the firm belief of his enemies . They argue that if he could get people to believe that he was out of the market they would stop " gunning for his scalp . " For this reason they said he had put out the stories of his having liquidated his holdings . For this purpose they said he had put out reports of a private settlement with some big shorts on Monday night , In some quarters the reports of a private settlement were credited . Thc firms mentioned on the floor of the Exchange as having made a private settlement were the Gates firm and Stephen M. Weld &; Co . The latter firm absolutely denied the report . John W. Gates is believed to have been heavily short of the cotton market , but he is understood to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Sully , when asked about this report , as well as about the rumor that he had sold out his long cotton , declined to talk , but in his market letter he says that the reports of settlements were not true . ' I never talk about matters of private business , " he . said . " All I have to say is that I am still , a believer in high prices for cotton and that I am going South on Saturday next for two weeks because I am in need of a vacation . " The price variations appear in the following summary of quotations : High . Low . Close . Mon day ' s Close . In spite of the violent fluctuations no failures occurred , and , according to the officials of the Exchange , all margins had been made good . Spot cotton declined . 50 points , and business was said to be almost at a standstill . SULLY CLERKS ' NIGHT WORK . Cotton Bull Leader 's Employes Eat and Sleep in His Down-Town Offices . So large has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the last few weeks that a force of clerics has to stay in the offices in the Wall Street Exchange Building far into the night , working over the books and checking up accounts . A reporter who went to the Sully offices at 12 o ? clock last night found five or six young men in full possession . They were as hard at work as if it were 10 o'clock in the morning , and they had just begun . One very large room  --  the corner one of the suite ? is laid aside now as a bedroom . In it are three or four single and one double bed . They are equipped with enough bed clothes for even the coldest weather . About fifteen stories from the ground , the clerks can look out over Wall Street and the whole financial district . One of them said last night he had not been home to sleep for three months . They find their present quarters very comfortable , they say , and do not have to waste some three hours every day going to and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " high in the financial world . " Not only is there a bedroom , but next to it are a dining room and a kitchen . These are devoted to the use of Sully and his associates in the day time , of course . At night , though , the culinary arrangements are at the disposal of the office force of clerics . All the materials are at hand , and I they - have only to turn on the gas under the ' range to have whatever they want to eat in a very few minutes . None of the firm stays clown in the offices at night : there are only subordinates to do clerical ; work .
