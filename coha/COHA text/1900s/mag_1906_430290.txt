 | LET us now , in conclusion , look at the whole business of digging a canal from Colon to Panama from some other point of view than that of a salaried railway man . The proposition involves digging less than fifty miles of navigable waterway through a country which we control ; through soil easily handled ; under climatic and labor conditions not very different from those existing in some of our own Gulf states , and quite as good as those of Suez in 1859 . It is a task in line with enterprises for which we have a worldreputation ; the field of operations is less than two days ' sail from Jamaica , where all the necessaries of life are abundant and cheap . The American contractor would rub his hands with satisfaction at the prospect of tackling such a work . You and I , my fellow-citizen , are paying our quota for this canal , and therefore we have a right to discuss it honestly and freely . We know that the President and his cabinet advisers know nothing practically of hydraulic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to know anything on those subjects . They called together a number of men of international reputation on hydraulic matters , asked their advice , and then dismissed the advisers ? and the advice . This was the beginning of our Panama tangle . The whole string of notables now connected with this great enterprise are conspicuously unequal to a task of this nature . There is not a single man connected with the Panama Canal to-day who before his appointment would have been selected by a private corporation for analogous duties . The chairman of the Canal Commission and the chief engineer are men of railway and financial training ; and for the man of railways to be the boss of waterway problems is something like putting a cavalry colonel in charge of a man-of-war . Is it unfair to ask that we send to Panama as judges , tax-collectors , land-agents , postoffice officials , and administrators generally men who have been trained for the work ? There are plenty of such men ; they are easily secured ; but they do not cling to the skirts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are Roman Catholic , and are reared under laws and customs different from ours . Instead of winning these people to ourselves by ruling them after their own custom , we unload upon their shores a body of noisy and ill-equipped young men who , ignorant of the language , ignorant of the law , ignorant of tropical conditions generally , and of any branch of useful knowledge , enter upon their duties with contempt for the man who is other than themselves . Of course there are exceptions . Our good men on the Isthmus denounce the corruption and incompetence which exist there but which are concealed from the public for political reasons . There is incompetence on every hand . For instance , at Carozal some political engineer built a huge hotel in a swampy ' depression , when by inquiry among the neighbors he might have found a healthful place . The house was well-nigh deserted on the occasion of my first visit , and when I visited it a second time in March , 1906 , I learned that the government had forbidden further building in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foundation stones of projected buildings . This land has since been ditched in several directions and , in the dry season , is habitable ; but the swampweeds are all over the place , and the manager told me that it was mostly under water when it rained . When I called attention to this the Administration merely denied it . There is no population more civil , more  | law - abiding , and more clean than that along the Zone . Yet the most decent population may be rendered riotous and dirty by such an administration as ours to-day . In Jamaica the train conductor needs no policeman to help collect fares ; but on the Panama Railway the conductors use the American police club as a means of intimidating passengers who attempt to protest against petty extortion . The very presence of these policemen is a needless offense to those on the Zone , and it is the height of injustice to send among them men who have practically unlimited power to intimidate and levy blackmail . There are many such opportunities . The Zone already swarms with our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the United States , who display about as much legal learning as would be expected of the Sultan of Morocco . The laws themselves are often offensive to the people , and difficult if not impossible to execute . The rules applicable to the collection of garbage in a crowded city are not always the best for a hut in the jungle . Then , too , our officials adopt the cruel method of commanding certain sanitary things to be done by poor people who have no facilities for carrying out the order . Thus I have known cases of poor people being compelled to pay thirty to fifty dollars in order to get their cesspools cleaned out . This is a work which should be done by the municipality with its own machinery , as it is done in other tropical countries . The policemen know all this . They know that the law is unworkable , so they use it for purposes of blackmail . They need more money than their pay ; they look about and note some lonesome house that does not conform in some petty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the owner ? and then compromise on a fivedollar bill . The poor victim knows neither the American law nor the judge ; he has no legal aid or political influence ; he finds it safest to buy immunity from the man with the club . I found on all sides among the poor , whether Jamaican negroes or Pa n amans , this dread of the big policeman who swaggered about as though it was his duty to club people in order to show his zeal for the canal . Most of the policemen with whom I talked had been there but a short time and did not intend to stay long ; they were not trained to that service , and looked upon it merely as a means of making some money . When a plain man builds a wharf , the first thing he does is to drive the heavy piles which are to serve as mooring - posts for the ship . At Colon to-day you will see a new and costly wharf originally intended to take three Large steamers ; but it is useless for that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of by some one with ship sense . There are no bias , cleats , or posts to which the distracted skipper can make his line fast . Consequently he must send his hawser off into the distant swamp and hook it to some capsized chimp-car , or slip it underneath among the piles . The result of this is that the floor of the wharf is useless to the stevedores and their trucks . But that is not all . The wharf is built as though ocean steamships had accordionplaited sides and could fold themselves into angles . Lacking that mobility , the third ship can touch the wharf at bow and stern  | only , while at the waist a gang-plank would have to be about one hundred feet long to reach from ship to shore . Near this wharf you will see new land being made by ( lumping French railway machinery worth millions of dollars . The more machinery there can be disposed of in this manner the more orders there will be for those who have machinery to sell ; and so the wasteful work goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old French company . He told me it was a shameful waste , for most of the machinery clumped into the water required only slight labor to make it work well . He showed me wheels of the best steel thrown away by order of his superiors . It made him indignant , he said . But he dared not protest publicly ; he had not the courage nor the patriotism to risk dismissal . Indeed he spoke his mind freely to me only so long as he failed to catch my name . He had asked me to dine with him at his mess , and I had accepted . But when later by accident he learned my name , he became so alarmed for his position that he sent word begging me not to come and not to " give him away . " And he is only one of the many whose names are my secret . When you reach the part of the Zone where some excavating is going on you find that practically all the locomotives and dirtcars are those presented to us by the De @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because there were not enough American ones on hand , but because , in spite of official assurances to the contrary , the French rolling-stock was lighter , simpler , and better adapted to the work . So while , at Culebra , we are using almost exclusively old French material found on the spot , at Colon we are busy tumbling into the sea all of this stock we can find . Is this jobbery or merely stupidity ? The locomotives used in our canal work were all manned by negroes , and where I saw repairs going on the repairs were being made by negroes also . There were nominally white inspectors , bosses , overseers , and foremen , but these I found for the most part somewhere in the shade . There was not  | much evidence that any one cared particu- larly whether the repairs to the French rolling-stock were done well . Had there been much interest in the matter I suspect that there would have been first-class white mechanics in charge . You find at Panama a so-called sewer , reported enthusiastically by Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this sewer , and found it was a political job and not suited to its purpose . When I called attention to this , the official reply was that the said sewer was excellent . But there is another side to this mendacity . The United States has built this sewer , and now insists that the Republic of Panama pay the bill . The Republic of Panama says it is a had job , and that it does not want the sewer . The people of Panama want their money 's worth , and refuse to accept a defective sewer when even a well-made one has its drawbacks in the tropics . Of course our officials tell us that their work on the Isthmus is peculiarly difficult , the secret of much that is admirable in the British West Indies . complicated , and delicate . That is the apology of the incompetent workman . You go to Jamaica and you find the water supply , the sewerage , the street cleaning , and the policing in the hands of men who have to solve problems similar to those at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work , and they give their whole life to the public service . Their salaries are secure , and they know that they will not he turned out so long as they do their duty . Here is The people from one end of the Zone to the other are clamoring for fresh food . They are surrounded by jungle where bananas , pineapples , yams , and an infinite variety of fruits and vegetables grow wild . But they can not get at them . There are only two roads on the Zone . One has been built for the convenience of the chief engineer in order that he may drive from the station to his house ? a distance of a few hundred yards . The other is a six-mile pleasure driveway from Panama to the  | Country Club , where officials and their families foregather for afternoon tea . These are the only two roads in our canal colony , and each is for the benefit of a small circle of officials . They were not a public necessity ; they connect nothing of importance . Meanwhile little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the ties of the Panama Railway , compelled to scramble down embankments when the trains whiz along . At the bridges and culverts there are painful descents to be made . The result is that a banana or a cocoanut costs as much on the streets of Colon as in New York . If the Panama Railway were run for the benefit of the people instead of in the interest of a few officials , the story would be different . Car after car of fruit is rushed along this line ? to the railway company 's steamers , for northern ports . And the people of Colon take what they can get . The Panama Railway owns all of Colon , and screws out of the wretched people exorbitant rents . The public-spirited men of the town are not permitted any voice in the local government , and if they complain of abuses they are exposed to petty police annoyance such as made life intolerable in Havana before the war . Land would obviously fetch less rental if roads were built in all directions , so that the poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officials of the Panama Railway are largely interested in Colon town-lots , and are opposed to the removal of population from @# the Colon swamp to the healthful ground two or three miles away . They fancy themselves secure , for so far they have succeeded in controlling the press of the Isthmus and the canal administration in Washington . As land-owners they can renew leases or not ; they can compel " alterations " ; they can refuse water or supply it ; they can even dominate the clergymen of the Zone by assisting them in securing church- and school-property or by refusing their requests . In passing let me note an exception to the landlord rule ? the property of Tracy Robinson . This gentleman is the " first citizen " of Colon ; the dean of the community . He has for forty-five years been the leader in public-spirited movements from one end of the Zone to the other . Men of letters know him as the editor of John Payne 's poems , and as the author of a volume of verse . Railroad men know him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ( 1861 ? 74 ) ; but his dusky neighbors know him as the landlord who gives them a clean tenement , an abundance of space , and the refreshment of a flower garden , and all for a rental considerably below what other landlords are charging for inferior accommodations . Mr. Taft seriously misled the President when he officially attempted to hold this gentleman up to public odium as punishment for having guided my steps on the Isthmus . It is to be hoped that Mr. Roosevelt will seize an early occasion publicly to thank Mr. Robinson of Colon , not only for his many  | services to our government in the past , but particularly for having had the courage to expose injustice even when perpetrated by our own officials. * There was a water-famine at Colon throughout the winter and up to the first rain in the middle of May . This waterfamine I predicted in December last , and I pointed out also that it would be , not a water-famine by the act of God , but a political water-famine ? one created artificially by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people of Colon to bring water from Frijoles , seventeen miles away , on the railway , there would have been no famine . I was at Frijoles in April , at the close of the normal dry season , and there was then an abundance of water running over the dam under the railway bridge . There was an abundance of excellent drinking-water in the Chagres River which could easily be pumped into Colon . There was water everywhere , but the Panama Railway would not allow its use and the Panama Railway is a ring of United States officials who are profiting by the distress of our helpless workers on the Zone . The Senate of the United States appointed last winter a committee to " investigate " the canal ; but this investigation was a mere partisan mask to cloak the abuses of which I am now complaining . For my own part , I was called but not permitted to submit my testimony . Three sessions of this committee were wasted in dispute as to whether I should be sent to prison for refusing to surrender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information . A few changes in the administration of affairs at Panama would not come amiss . First of all there should be a committee of authorities on canal-building and tropical labor . This committee may then be trusted to select one man as engineer-in-chief ; and this engineer-in-chief should be allowed to do his work without interference from political sources . To-day few eminent engineers want to work on the canal , because  | they do not desire to mix politics and engineering . Next we s h o u l d repeal all the laws and ordinances which to-day hamper the work . Let the engineer-in-chief secure his labor and machinery where he chooses ; he should be the sole judge . In other words , his work should be lifted high above mere partisan or even national considerations . Next the chief engineer should have at his side a civil administration to relieve him of all cares other than those of the canal proper . The chief of this administration should be a governor conversant with the climate , the people , the language and customs , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Such a governor would soon teach us that human nature is not much different at Panama than elsewhere ; that better than a policeman 's club is an honest administration . Let us put an end to the cruel monopoly of the Panama Railway ; let us give the people land and not force them to herd in a swamp . Let our government forbid speculation in land , at least at Colon . Lease the land to him who works it , and charge him a fair tax ; but do not sell it outright ; do not give him the power to corner man 's chief necessity . In t h i s way we shall at Panama realize something of the dream which Henry George dreamed for the benefit of humanity . The men we send down to-day will set their stamp for good or ill upon this American colony . Therefore let us send to this work the men who are of our best . Let us not hug the delusion that trade must come to us no matter what we do . Trade may come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Let us correct our mistakes while there is vet time . Why build a lock canal when a little more time and a few more dredges would give us a grand waterway through which the ships of the world could slip from ocean to ocean ? There are other routes for a canal across the Isthmus ; and if we allow political jobbers to squander time and money it may be that some other nation will arise and execute elsewhere the great work of wedding the Seven Seas .
