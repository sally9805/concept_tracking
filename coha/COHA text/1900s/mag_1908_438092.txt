AUGUSTUS SAINT-GAUDENS was born in Dublin , Ireland , on the first day of March , 1848 , almost precisely sixty years ago , but was brought to America at the age of six months . His childhood and youth were passed in the city of New York , as was a great part of his working ? life ; and though his origin was foreign , life-long associations had stamped him indelibly an American . The greater part of his work was done in America ; almost all of it was done for America ; and I do not think it is fancy that sees in his art the expression of a distinctively American spirit . Yet from his mixed French and Irish blood he may well have derived that mingling of the Latin sense of form with a Celtic depth of sentiment which was so markedly characteristic of his genius . His father , Bernard Paul Ernest SaintGaudens , was a shoemaker from the little town of Aspet in Haute-Garonne , Pyrenees , only a few miles from the town of Saint-Gaudens from which the family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother was Mary McGuinness , a native of Dublin . Augustus Saint-Gaudens was one of several children born to this couple , and not the only artist among them , for his younger brother Louis is also a sculptor of reputation . The boy attended the public schools of New York and received there all the formal education he ever had ; but at thirteen it was necessary for him to face the problem of earning his living . His artistic proclivities were probably already well marked , and to give them some scope , while assuring him a regular trade at which ' money could be earned , he was apprenticed in the good old way to a cameo-cutter named Address delivered before the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences on February 22 , 1908. ? 208 Louis Avet , said to be the first man to cut stone cameos in the United States . Thus it came about that the greatest of American sculptors had much such a practical apprenticeship as a Florentine of the fifteenth century might have had . He himself always spoke of it as " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , " and attributed much of his success to the habit of faithful labor acquired at this time . Probably , also , the habit of thinking in terms of relief , fostered by years of work at this ancient art of gem-cutting , was not without influence in the moulding of his talent . His relations with Avet lasted from 1801 to 1864 , when his master quarreled with him and abruptly dismissed him from his shop . The boy was already a determined person ; be believed that he had suffered an injustice ; and though Avet went to his parents and tried to induce them to send him back , he refused to return . A new master was found for him in the person of a shell-cameo-cutter named Jules Lebrethon , and with him Saint-Gaudens remained three years . During his six years ' apprenticeship under his two masters the youth showed already that energy and power of will that made him what he was . He meant to be something more titan an artisan , and he spent his evenings in the classes , first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Design , in the hard study of drawing , the true foundation of all the fine arts . It was one of the elements of his superiority in his profession that he could draw as few sculptors can , and he always felt that he owed an especial debt to the Cooper Union which he was glad to repay when he modeled the statue of its venerable founder . Of the other institution by whose freely given instruction he had pro- // filed , the National Academy of Design , he became one of the most honored members . By 1867 , when he was nineteen years old , he had saved a little money and was master of a trade that could be relied on to bring in more , and he determined to go to Paris and begin the serious study of sculpture . He worked , for a time , at the Petite Ecole , and entered the studio of Jouffroy in the Ecole des Beaux Arts in 1868 , remaining until 1870 . During this time , and afterwards , he was self-supporting , working half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a larger scale began to bring in an income . The time of Saint-Gaudens 's study in Paris was a time of great importance in the development of modern sculpture , and although Jouffroy was not himself a sculptor of the highest rank , his studio was a centre for what was then the new movement in the sculpture of France . The essential thing in this movement was the abandoning of the formal imitation of second-rate antiques , and the substitution of the sculpture of the Italian Renaissance as a source of inspiration and of the direct study of nature as a means of self-expression . There had always been individual sculptors of power and originality in France , but the movement of the French school of sculpture , as a whole , away from the pseudo-classicism which had long dominated it , was really inaugurated by Paul Dubois only a few years before Saint-Gaudens 's arrival in Paris . Many of the men destined to a brilliant part in the history of modern sculpture were trained in the atelier of Jouffroy . Falguiere and Saint-Marceau had but just left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mercie was his fellow student there . Dalou and Rodin have since made these men seem old-fashioned and academic , but they were then , and for many years afterward , the heads of the new school ; and of this new school , so different from anything he had known in America , Saint-Gaudens at once , and inevitably , became a part . His own pronounced individuality , and per- haps his comparative isolation during the years of his greatest productivity , gave his art a character of its own , unlike any other , but to the French school of sculpture of the third quarter of the nineteenth century he essentially belonged . With the still newer school of the end of the century he never had any sympathy . When the Franco-Prussian war broke out Paris ceased to be a place for the carrying on of the serious study of art , and Saint-Gaudens went to Rome , where his associates were the French prize men of the day , of whom Mercie was one . He remained there until 1874 , except for a visit to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of modeling a bust of Senator Evarts and one or two other busts which were put into marble upon his return to Rome . In those Roman days he executed his first statue , a Hiawatha , one of his few studies of the nude , and a Silence , a not very characteristic draped figure which yet fills with some impressiveness her niche at the head of the grand stairway of the Masonic Temple on Twenty-Third Street . From 1875 to 1877 he had a studio in New York , and it was at this time that he received his first commissions for important public work , those for the Farragut Statue , in Madison Square , and the Randall at Sailor 's Snug Harbor . He had married Augusta F. Homer in 1877 , and in that year , taking his bride and his commissions with him , he returned to Paris , feeling , as many another young Paris-bred artist has felt , that there only could such important works be properly carried out . The Farragut was completed and exhibited in the plaster at the Salon of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For the rest of his life he was constantly busy , receiving almost more commissions for work of importance than it was possible for him to carry out . He returned to New York in 1880 , and in 1881 he opened the studio in Thirty-Sixth Street , where he remained for sixteen years and where so many of his greatest works were executed . From 800 Augustus Saint-Gauctens that studio came many of his exquisite portraits in relief , his caryatids and angelic figures , such as those for the Morgan tomb , so unfortunately destroyed by fire in 1880 , the great statues of Lincoln and Chapin , the Shaw Memorial ; and the Adams Memorial ; and there was done all the preliminary work of the great equestrian monument to General Sherman . It is in these years of his prime that he will ever be most fondly remembered by those , and they are many , who had the privilege of his friendship . Admittedly our foremost sculptor , and one of the founders of the Society of American Artists , he became at once a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as his brilliant career developed he established intimate relationships with an ever widening circle of men in every walk of life , while no one who e'er knew him well can have felt anything but an abiding affection for him . That long white studio became a familiar meeting-place for all who were interested in any form of art ; and the Sunday afternoon concerts that were held there for many years will be looked back to with regret as long as any of their auditors remain alive . This studio was given up when SaintGaudens went abroad for the third time , in 1897 , to execute the Sherman group , and he never resumed his residence in New York . In 1885 he had purchased a property at Cornish , New Hampshire , just across the Connecticut River from Windsor , Vermont , and when lie returned to this country in 1900 , covered with fresh honors , but an ill man , lie made what had been a summer home his permanent abode . He named it Aspet , after his father 's birthplace , and there he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these studios were executed the second Lincoln , the Parnell statue for Dublin , and much other work . The larger studio was burned in 1904 , but was rebuilt and the lost work rebegun and carried to a conclusion . What can never be quite replaced were two portraits of Min-self . A study , of the head only , in the collection of the National Academy of Design , is now the only existing portrait of him painted from life in his best years . In this studio his assistants are still busy , reverently completing the work left unfinished at the time of his death . From the illness he brought back from Paris in 1900 Saint-Gaudens never recovered . At times he showed something of his old vigor and was able not only to do fine work , but to indulge more in out-of-door sports than he had ever done in his youth , while a growing love for nature and for literature made his life fuller , in some respects , than in the days when his own art more entirely absorbed him . But year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedom from pain grew shorter , and he was more and more forced to rely upon the corps of able and devoted assistants which he gathered alAut him . He developed to an extraordinary extent the faculty of communicating his ideas and desires to others , and of producing through their hands work essentially his own and of a quality entirely beyond their ability ; but it was at the cost of a strain upon brain and nerve almost infinitely greater than would have been involved in work done with his own hand . In the summer of 1906 he broke down utterly , the work of his studio was interrupted , and he ceased to see even his most intimate friends . He rallied somewhat from this attack , and began again his heroic struggle against fate , directing the work of assistants while himself so weak that he had to be carried from the house to the studio . The end came on the evening of August 3 , 1907 . He died as he had lived , a member of no church , but a man of pure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body was cremated , and his ashes have been deposited in the cemetery at Windsor , Vermont , across the river from his home . An informal funeral service was held in his private studio on August 7 , attended by friends and neighbors and by a few old friends from a distance ; but the gathering could include but a few of the many Augustus Saint-Gaudens soi who feel his death as a personal loss . I have given with some particularity this outline of Saint-Gaudens 's ' life because legend is already busy with his name . His right to bear it has even been denied , and impudently false accounts of his last days have been printed . Therefore it seemed best to state clearly certain facts which are , after all , of little importance in the estimate of his work . Neither is it of much importance , now , that the merits of this work were fully recognized in his lifetime ; that he was an officer of the Legion of Honor , a Corresponding Member of the Institute of France , a member of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degrees from the universities of Harvard , Yale , and Princeton . Of all the honors he received there were two , one of a public , the other of a private nature , which he himself valued most highly ; the one as showing the estimation in which his art was held by his fellow artists , the other as an evidence of the personal affection felt for him by his friends . At the Pan-American Exposition of 1901 , upon the unanimous recommendation of the Jury of Fine Arts , composed of painters , sculptors , and architects , he was awarded a special diploma and medal of honor , " apart from and above all other awards ; " an entirely exceptional honor which marked him as the first of American artists , as previously received honors had marked him one of the greatest sculptors of his time . On June 23 , 1901 , the artistic and literary colony which had gradually grown up about his home in Cornish celebrated the twentieth anniversary of his coming there by a fete and open-air play held in the groves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost legendary . The altar with its columned canopy , which served for a background to the play , still stands , though such dilapidated by weather , as it was immortalized by the sculptor himself in a commemorative plaquette which is among the most charming of his minor works . He planned if he had lived to perpetuate it in enduring marble , and it is not impossible that others may yet accomplish this task , dedicating the monument as a fitting memorial to a great artist and a noble man in the place he loved as his chosen home . Some part of the vivid and lovable personality of Augustus Saint-Gaudens must have been visible , almost at a glance , to any one who ever came in contact with him ? to any one , even , who ever saw his portrait . In his spare but strong-knit figure , his firm but supple hands , his manner of carrying himself , his every gesture , one felt the abounding vitality , the almost furious energy of the man . That extraordinary head with its heavy brow beetling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and crisp wiry hair , its projecting jaw and great , strongly modeled nose , was alive with power ? with power of intellect no less than of will . His lack of early education gave him a certain diffidence and a distrust of his own gifts of expression . He was apt to overrate the mere verbal facility of others , and to underestimate himself in the comparison ? indeed , a certain humidity was strongly marked in him , even as regards his art , though he was self-confident also . When he was unconstrained his great powers of observation , his shrewdness of judgment , his bubbling humor , and a picturesque vivacity of phrase not uncommon among artists , made him one of the most entrancing of talkers . Underneath his humor and his gayety , however , there lay a deep-seated Celtic melancholy , and beside his energy was an infinite patience at the service of an exacting artistic conscience . The endless painstaking of his work and the time he took over it were almost proverbial . He was twelve years engaged upon the Shaw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did much other work while these were in progress , yet it was his constant revision , his ever-renewed striving for perfection that kept them so long achieving . The Diana of the Madison Square Garden was taken down from her tower because he and the architect , Stanford White , thought her too large , and was entirely remodeled on a smaller scale . And with this patience went a gentleness , a sweetness , a delicate sensitiveness , and an abounding humanity and sympathy . He could be almost ruthless in the assertion of his will when the interests of his art or of justice seemed to demand it , yet there was a tender-heartedness in him which made it distressing to him to inflict pain on any one . The conflict of these elements in his nature sometimes made his actions seem inconsistent and indecipherable even to those who knew him . He would be long-suffering , compromising , disinclined to strike ; but when he was at last roused the blow would be as staggering as it was unexpected . It was as if he struck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spare himself the pain of striking again . It was his whole-hearted devotion to his art which caused his rare acts of self-assertion , and it was this same devotion , no less than his natural kindliness , that made him ever helpful to younger artists who showed any promise of future worth . Even in his last days of unspeakable suffering he would summon what was left of his old strength to give a word of criticism and advice , above all a word of commendation , to any one who needed the one or had earned the other . The essential goodness of the man was most felt by those who stood nearest him , and most of all , perhaps , by his actual co-workers . He could command , as few have been able to do , the love and devotion of his assistants . To all who knew him the man himself seemed finer , rarer , sweeter than his work , and the gap he has left in their lives will be even more impossible to fill than his place in American art . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great one , is for the memory of his private friends . It is only as it colors his art that it is of public interest . It is his art itself , his gift to the world , that the world cares for ; it is of the kind and quality of that art , the nature and the degree of its greatness , that the world wishes to hear . BeeauSe the man was my friend I have wished to give some glimpse of the manner of man he was ; because the artist was the greatest our country has produced I am to try to give some idea of his art , of the elements of its strength , and of the limitations which are as necessary as its qualities . And the first and most essential thing to note about the art of Augustus SaintGaudens is that it is always art of the purest ? free in an extraordinary degree from the besetting sins of naturalism and the scientific temper on theone hand , and of the display of cleverness and technical brilliancy on the other . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great temptations of an able artist : that he should in the absorption of study forget the end in the means , and produce demonstrations of anatomy or of the laws of light rather than statues or pictures ; or that he should , in the joy of exercising great talents , seem to say , See how well I can do it ! " and invent difficulties for the sake of triumphantly resolving them , becoming a virtuoso rather than a creator . Of the meaner temptation of mere sensationalism ? the desire to attract attention by ugliness and eccentricity lest one should be unable to secure it by truth and beauty ? one need not speak . It is the temptation of vulgar souls . But great and true artists have yielded , occasionally or habitually , to these other two ; Saint-Gaudens never does . I know no work of his to which raw nature has been admitted , in which a piece of study has been allowed to remain as such without the moulding touch of art to subdue it to its place ; and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Logan statue ? and the bravura is there because the subject seemed to demand it , not because the artist wished it . The dash and glitter are those of " Black Jack Logan , " not of Saint-Gaudens . The sculptor strove to render them as he strove to render higher qualities at other // tunes , but they remain antipathetic to his nature , and the statue is one of the least satisfactory of his works . He is essentially the artist ? the artificer of beauty ? ever bent on the making of a lovely and significant thing ; and the study of nature and the resources of his craft are but tools , and are never allowed to become anything more . The commonest criticism on Saint-G audens 's art has been that it is not , primarily , sculptural in its inspiration ; and , in a sense , the criticism is justified . One need not , perhaps , greatly care whether it is true or not . It is , after all , only a matter of definition , and if we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find another name for it , the important fact that it is art ? art of the finest , the most exquisite , at times the most powerful ? would in no wise be altered . Ghiberti went beyond the traditions of sculpture in relief , introduced perspective into his compositions , modeled trees and rocks and clouds and cast them in bronze , made pictures , if you like , instead of reliefs . Does any one care ? Is it not enough that they are beautiful pictures ? The gates of the Baptistry of Florence are still worthy , as the greatest sculptor since the Greeks thought them , to be the gates of Paradise . A work of art remains a work of art , call it what you please , and a thing of beauty will be a joy forever , whether or not you can pigeonhole it in some ready-made category . After all , the critical . pigeonholes are made for the things , not the things for the pigeonholes . The work is there , and if it does not fit your preconceived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the definition as in the work itself . If , then , the accusation that SaintGaudens 's art is not sculptural means that he was a designer rather than a modeler , that he cared for composition more than for representation , that the ensemble interested him more than the details , I would cheerfully admit that the accusation is well founded . Such marvels of rendering as Rodin could give us , before he lost himself in the effort to deserve that reputation as a profound thinker which has been thrust upon him , were not for Saint-Gaudens . The modeling of the nwrceau was not particularly his affair . The discrimination of hard and soft , of bone and muscle and integument , the expression of tension where a fleshy tissue is tightly drawn over the framework beneath , or of weight where it falls away from it ? these were not the things that most compelled his interest or in which he was most successful . For the human figure as a figure , for the inherent beauty of its marvelous mechanism , he did not greatly care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement which have occupied sculptors from the beginning were not especially his problems , It may have been due to the nature of the commissions he received that , after the Ifiawatha of his student days , he modeled no nude except the Diana of the tower ? a purely decorative figure , designed for distant effect , in which structural modeling would have been out of place because invisible . But it was not accident that in such draped figures as the Amor-Caritas or the caryatids of the Vanderbilt mantelpiece there is little effort to make the figure visible beneath the draperies . In the hands of a master of the figure ? of one of those artists to whom the expressiveness and the beauty of the human structure is all in all ? drapery is a means of rendering the masses and the movement of the figure more apparent than they would be in the nude . In such works as these it is a thing beautiful in itself , for its own ripple and flow and ordered intricacy . The figure is there beneath the drapery , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of the sentiment of the work , rather than especially explanatory of the figure . First of all , by nature and by training , Saint-Gaudens was a designer , and exquisiteness of design was the quality he most consciously strove for ? the quality on which he expended his unresting , unending , persevering toil . From the 804 Augustus Saint-Gaudens start one feels that design is his principal preoccupation , that he is thinking mainly of the pattern of the whole , its decorative effect and play of line , its beauty of masses and spaces , its fitness for its place and its surroundings , in a word , its composition . In the beginning , as a workman in the shop of the cameo-cutter , he was concerned with a kind of art in which perfection of composition is almost the sole claim to serious consideration . Then he produces a multiplicity of small reliefs , dainty , exquisite , infallibly charming in their arrangement , ? things which are so dependent on design for their very existence that they seem scarcely modeled at all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to heroic statues , to monumental groups , but always it is design that he thinks of first and last ? design , now , in three dimensions rather than in two ? design properly sculptural rather than pictorial in so much as it deals with bosses and concaves , with solid matter in space ? but still design . This power of design rises to higher uses as time goes on , is bent to the interpretation of lofty themes and the expression of deep emotions , but it is in its nature the same power that produced the delicate , ethereal beauty of the reliefs . The infinite fastidiousness of a master-designer , constantly reworking and readjusting his design , that every part shall be perfect and that no fold or spray of leafage shall be out of its proper place , never satisfied that his composition is beyond improvement while an experiment remains untried , ? this is what cost him years of labor . B is first important statue , the Farragut , is a masterpiece of restrained and elegant yet original and forceful design ? a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bench below , and of which the figures in bas-relief are almost as important a part as the statue itself . In later and maturer work , with a more clarified taste and a deeper feeling , he can reach such unsurpassable expressiveness of composition as is shown in the Shaw Memorial or the great equestrian statue of Sherman . Saint-Gaudens 's mastery of low-relief was primarily a matter of this power of design , but it was conditioned also upon two other qualities , knowledge of drawing , and extreme sensitiveness to delicate modulation of surface . And by drawing I mean not merely knowledge of form and proportion and the exact rendering of these , in which sense a statue may be said to be well drawn if its measurements are correct ? I mean that much more subtle and difficult art , the rendering in two dimensions only of the appearance of objects of three dimensions . Sculpture in the round is the simplest and , in a sense , the easiest of the arts . It deals with actual form ? a piece of sculpture does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the form of an object . Leaving out of the count , for the moment , the refinements and the illusions which may be added to it , ? which must be added to it to make it art , ? it is the reproduction in another material of the actual forms of things . Something which shall answer for it , to the uninitiate , may be produced by merely casting natural objects , and there is a great deal that is called sculpture which scarcely aims at anything more than the production , by a more difficult method , of something like a plaster cast from nature . It is the very simplicity of the art that makes its difficulty , for to avoid the look of casting and achieve the feeling of art requires the most delicate handling and the most powerful inspiration , and there is need in the art of sculpture for the rarest qualities of the greatest minds . The art of drawing is entirely different . It is all illusion , it deals only in appearances . Its aim is to depict on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind it and to be seen through it , and its means are two branches of the science of optics . It is based on the study of perspective and on the study of the way light falls upon objects and reveals their shapes and the direction of their surfaces by the varying degrees of their illumination . Of this art a sculptor in the round need not necessarily know any- thing , and in fact many of them , unfortunately , know altogether too little of it . The maker of a statue need not think about foreshortenings : if he gives the correct form the foreshortening will take care of itself . Sometimes it does so in a disastrous manner ! Theoretically he need not worry over light and shade , although of course he does , in practice , think about it and rely upon it , more or less . If he gives the true forms they will necessarily have the true light and shade . But low-relief , standing between sculpture and drawing , is really more closely related to drawing than to sculpture , ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is why so few sculptors succeed in it . It is a kind of drawing , but an exceedingly difficult kind ? the most delicate and difficult of any of the arts that deal with form alone . As to the contour , it stands on the same ground with drawing in any other material . The linear part of it requires exactly the same degree and the same kind of talent as linear design with a pen or with a burin . But for all that stands within the contour , for the suggestion of interior forms and the illusion of solidity , it depends on means of the utmost subtlety . It exists , as all drawing does , by light and shade , but the shadows are not produced by the mere darkening of the surface ? they are produced by projections and recessions , by the inclination of the planes away from or toward the light . The lower the relief the more subtle and tender must be the variation of the surface which produces them , and therefore success in relief is one of the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfection of craftsmanship . But as the light and shade is produced by actual forms which are yet quite unlike the true forms of nature , it follows that the artist in relief can never imitate either the shape or the depth of the shadow he sees in nature . His art becomes one of suggestions and equivalents ? an art which can give neither the literal truth of form nor the literal truth of aspect ? an art at the vol .. 101 ? No. 8 farthest remove from direct representation . And success in it becomes , therefore , one of the best tests of a sculptor 's artistry ? of his ability to produce essential beauty by the treatment of his material , rather than to imitate successfully external fact . As the degree of relief varies , also , from the lowest possible to that highest relief which nearly approaches sculpture in the round , the problems involved constantly vary . At each stage there is a new compromise to be made , a new adjustment to find , between fact and illusion , between the real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a number of different degrees of relief in the same work , even in different parts of the same figure , so that the art of relief becomes one of the most complicated and difficult of arts . It has not , indeed , the added complications of color , but neither has it the resources of color , success in which will more or less compensate for failure elsewhere . There is no permissible failure in bas-relief , any more than in sculpture in the round , and its difficulties are far greater . Nothing but truest feeling , completest knowledge , consummate skill , will serve . This explanation may give some measure of what I mean when I say that I believe Augustus Saint-Gaudens the most complete master of relief since the fifteenth century . He has produced a series of works which run through the whole range of the art , from lowest relief to highest ; from things of which the relief is so infinitesimal that they seem as if dreamed into existence rather than wrought in bronze or marble , to things which are virtually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch might brush away , like a pastel of Whistler 's , to things as solid and enduring in appearance as in actual material . And in all these things there is the same inevitable mastery of design and of drawing , the same infinite resource and the same technical perfection . The Butler Children , the Schiff Children , the Violet Sargent , to name but a few of his masterpieces of this kind , are in their perfection of spacing , their grace of line , their exquisite and ethereal illusiveness of surface , comparable only to the loveliest works of the Florentine Renaissance ; while the assured mastery of the most complicated problems of relief evinced in the Shaw Memorial ? a mastery which shows , in the result , no trace of the strenuous and long-continued effort that it cost ? is unsurpassed ? I had almost said unequaled ? in any work of any epoch . One can not hope , without illustration , to give any idea of the special beauties of this or that particular work in this long series ; and indeed no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the draughtsmanship . The refinement of workmanship , the sensitiveness and subtlety of modeling , can be appreciated only before the works themselves . And this sensitiveness and delicacy of workmanship , this mastery of the problems of relief , with its reliance on illusion and its necessary abstention from realization , is applied to sculpture in the round , and becomes with . Saint-Gaudens , as it did with the sculptord of the Florentine Renaissance , the means of escape from the matter of fact . The concrete art of sculpture becomes an art of mystery and of suggestion ? an art having affinities with that of painting . Hollows are filled up , shadows are obliterated , lines are softened or accentuated , as the effect may require , details are eliminated or made prominent as they are less or more essential and significant , as they hinder or aid the expressiveness of the whole . It is by such methods that beauty is achieved , that the most unpromising material is subdued to the purposes of art , that even our hideous modern costume may be made to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancients understood it , the art of form per se , demands the nude figure , or a costume which reveals it rather than hides it . The costume of to-day reveals as little of the figure as pos sible , and , unlike medieval armor , it has no form of its own . A painter may make it interesting by dwelling on color or tone or texture , or may so lose it in shadow that it ceases to count at all except as a space of darkness . A sculptor can do none of these things , and if he is to make it serve the ends of beauty he has need of all the resourcefulness and all the skill of the master of low-relief . It was fortunate that the artist whose greatest task was to commemorate the heroes of the Civil War should have had the temperament and the training of such a master , and I know of no other sculptor than Saint-Gaudens who has so magnificently suceeeded in the rendering of modern clothing ? no other who could have made the uniform of Farragut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armor of Colleone or the toga of Augustus . But if the genius of Saint-Gaudens was primarily a decorative genius ? if it was , even , in his earlier work , a trifle picturesque , so that , as he said himself , he had " to fight against picturesqueness , " his work was never pictorial . He never indulged in perspective or composed his reliefs on more than one plane ; never took such liberties with the traditions of sculpture as did Ghiberti , or painted pictures in bronze or marble as more than one modern has done . His very feeling for decoration kept him from pictorial realism , and his fight against picturesqueness was nobly won . His design becomes ever cleaner and more classic ; by years of work and of experience he becomes stronger and stronger in the more purely sculptural qualities ? attains a grasp of form and structure only second to his mastery of composition . He is always a consummate artist ? in his finest works he is a great sculptor in the strictest sense of the word . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the first necessity for an artist ; because technical mastery is that for which he consciously endeavors ; because the technical language of his art is the necessary vehicle of expression for his thoughts and emotions , and determines , even , the nature of the thoughts and emotions he shall express . But while the technical accomplishment of an artist is the most necessary part of his art , without which his imagination would be mute , it is not the highest or the most significant part of it . I have tried to show that Saint-Gaudens was a highly accomplished artist , the equal of any of his contemporaries , the superior of most . What made him something much more than this ? something infinitely more important for us ? was the vigor and loftiness of his imagination . Without his imaginative power he would have been an artist of great distinction , of whom any country might be proud ; with it he became a great creator , able to embody in enduring bronze the highest ideals and the deepest feelings of a nation and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that gave him his unerring grasp of character , that enabled him to seize upon the significant elements of a personality , to divine the attitude and the gesture that should reveal it , to eliminate the unessential , to present to us the man . This is the imagination of the portrait-painter , and Saint-Gaudens has shown it again and again , in many of his reliefs and memorial tablets , above all in his portrait statues . He showed it conclusively in so early a work as the Farragut , a work that remains one of the modern masterpieces of portrait statuary . The man stands there forever , feet apart , upon his swaying deck , his glass in one strong hand , cool , courageous , ready , full of determination but absolutely without bluster or braggadocio , a sailor , a gentleman , and a hero . He showed it again , and with ampler maturity , in that august figure of Lincoln , grandly dignified , austerely simple , sorrowfully human , risen from the chair of state that marks his office , but about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head and worn face filled with a sense of power , but even more with the sadness of responsibility ? filled , above all , with a yearning , tender passion of sympathy and love . In imaginative presentation of character , in nobility of feeling and breadth of treatment , no less than in perfection of workmanship , these are among the world 's few worthy monuments to its great men . And they are monuments to Americans by an American . Saint-Gaudens had lived through the time of the Civil War , had felt , as a boy , the stir of its great happenings in his blood , and its epic emotions had become a part of his consciousness , deep-seated at the roots of his nature . The feelings of the American people were his feelings , and his representations of these and of other heroes of that great struggle are among the most national as they are among the most vital things that our country has produced in art . But if Saint-Gaudens 's imagination was thus capable of raising the portrait to the dignity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the imagined type with all the individuality of the portrait . In the Deacon Chapin , of Springfield , we have a purely ideal production , the finest embodiment of New England Puritanism in our art , for no portrait of the real Chapin existed . This swift-striding , stern-looking old man , who clasps his Bible as Moses clasped the tables of the law and grips his peaceful walking-stick as though it were a sword , is a Puritan of the Puritans ; but he is an individual also , ? a rough-hewn piece of humanity with plenty of the old Adam about him , ? an individual so clearly seen and so vigorously characterized that one can hardly believe the statue an invention or realize that no such old Puritan deacon ever existed in the flesh . Something of this imaginative quality there is in almost everything SaintGaudens touched , even in his purely decorative figures . His angels and caryatids are not classical goddesses , but modern women , lovely , but with a personal and particular loveliness , not insisted upon , but delicately suggested . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pose for them , but an invented personality , the expression of the nobility , the sweetness , and the pure-mindedness of their creator . And in such a figure as that of the Adams Memorial , in Rock Creek Cemetery in Washington . his imaginative power reaches to a degree of impressiveness almost unequaled in modern art . One knows of nothing since the tombs of the Medici that fills one with the same hushed awe as this shrouded , hooded , deeply-brooding figure , rigid with contemplation , still with an eternal stillness , her soul rapt from her body on some distant quest . Is she Nirvana ? Is she The Peace of God ? She has been given many names ? her maker would give her none . Her meaning is mystery ; she is the everlasting enigma . Not the greatest artist could twice sound so deep a note as this . The figure remains unique in the work of the sculptor as it is unique in the art of the century . Yet , perhaps , Saint-Gaudens 's greatest works are two in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; into which his mastery of composition , his breadth and solidity of structure , his technical skill , his insight into character , and his power of imagination enter in nearly equal measure : the Shaw Memorial and the great equestrian group of the Sherman Monument . The Shaw Memorial is a relief , but a relief of many planes . The marching troops are in three files , one behind the other , the varying distances from the spectator marked by differences of the degree of projection . Nearer than all of them is the equestrian figure of Shaw himself , the horse and rider modeled nearly but not quite in the round . The whole scale of relief was altered in the course of the work , after it had once been nearly completed , and the mastery of the infinitely complicated problem of relief in many degrees is supreme . But all the more because the scheme was so full and so varied , the artist has carefully avoided the pictorial in his treatment . There is no perspective , the figures being all on the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of houses or landscape . Everywhere , between and above the figures , is the flat surface which is the immemorial tradition of sculpture in relief ; and the fact that it is a surface , representing nothing , is made more clear by the inscription written upon it ? an inscription placed there , consciously or unconsciously , that it might have that very effect . The composition is magnificent , whether for its intrinsic beauty of arrangement , its balancing of lines and spaces , or for its perfect expressiveness . The rhythmic step of marching men is perfectly rendered , and the guns fill the middle of the panel in an admirable pattern , without confusion or monotony . The heads are superb in characterization , strikingly varied and individual , yet each a strongly marked racial type , unmistakably African in all its forms . These are merits , and merits of a very high order , enough of themselves to place the work in the front rank of modern sculpture , but they are after all its minor merits . What makes it the great thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the depth of emotion expressed , and expressed with perfect simplicity and directness and an entire absence of parade . The negro troops are marching steadily , soberly , with high seriousness of purpose , and their white leader rides beside them , drawn sword in hand , but with no military swagger , courageous , yet with a hint of melancholy , ready not only to lay down his life , but to face , if need be , an ignominious death for the cause he believes to be just . And above them , laden with palm and with poppy , floats the Death Angel , pointing out the way . It is a work which artists may study again and again with growing admiration and increasing profit , yet it is one that has found its way straight to the popular heart . It is not always ? it is not often ? that the artists and the public are thus at one . When they are it is safe to assume that the work they equally admire is truly great ? that it belongs to the highest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though it has been more criticised than the Shaw Memorial , seems to me , if possible , an even finer work . The main objection to it has been that it is not sufficiently " monumental , " and indeed it has not the massiveness nor the repose of such a work as Donatello 's Gattamelata , the greatest of all equestrian statues . It could not well have these qualities in the same degree , its motive being what it is , but they are , perhaps , not ill exchanged for the character and the nationalism so marked in horse and rider , and for the irresistible onward rush of movement , never more adequately expressed . In all other respects the group seems to me almost beyond criticism . The composition ? composition , now , in the round , and to be considered from many points of view ? builds up superbly ; the flow of line in wing and limb and drapery is perfect ; the purely sculptural problems of anatomical rendering , equine and human , are thoroughly resolved ; the modeling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To the boyish Saint-Gaudens Sherman had seemed the typical American hero . To the matured artist he had sat for an affiffirable bust . The sculptor had thus an unusual knowledge of his subject , a perfect sympathy with his theme ; and he has produced a work of epic sweep and significance . Tall and erect , the General sits his horse , his military cloak bellying out behind him , his trousers strapped down over his shoes , his hat in his right hand , dropping at arm 's length behind his knee , his bare head , like that of an old eagle , looking straight forward . The horse is as long and thin as his rider , with a tremendous stride ; and his big head , closely reined in , twitches viciously at the bridle . Before the horse and rider , upon the ground yet as if new-lighted there from an aerial existence , half walks , half flies , a splendid winged figure , ? one arm outstretched , the other brandishing the palm , ? Victory leading them on . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapt gaze and half open mouth indicate the seer of visions : peace is ahead , and an end of war . On the bosom of her gown is broidered the eagle of the United States , for she is an American Victory , as this is an American man on an American horse ; and the broken pine bough beneath the horse 's feet localizes the victorious march ? it is the march through Georgia to the sea . Long ago I expressed my conviction that the Sherman monument is third in rank of the great equestrian statues of the world . To-day I am not sure that that conviction remains unaltered . Donatello 's Gattamelata is unapproached and unapproachable in its quiet dignity ; Verrocchio 's Colleone is unsurpassed in picturesque attractiveness . Both are consecrated by the admiration of centuries . To-day I am not sure that this work of an American sculptor , just dead , is not , in its own way , equal to either of them . There are those who are troubled by the introduction of the symbolical figures in such works as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed , it was a bold enterprise to place them where they are , mingling thus in the same work the real and the ideal , the actual and the allegorical . But the boldness seems to me abundantly justified by success . In either case the entire work is pitched to the key of these figures ; the treatment of the whole is so elevated by style and so infused with imagination , that there is no shock of unlikeness or difficulty of transition . And these figures are not merely necessary to the composition , an essential part of its beauty ? they are even more essential to the expression of the artist 's thought . Without that hovering Angel of Death , the negro troops upon the Shaw Memorial might be going anywhere , to battle or to review . We should have a passing regiment , nothing more . Without the striding Victory before him , the impetuous movement of Sherman 's horse would have no especial significance . And these figures are no mere conventional allegories , they are true creations . To their creator the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was more so . That Shaw was riding to his death at the command of duty was the only thing that made Shaw memorable . That Sherman was marching to a victory the fruits of which should be peace was the essential thing about Sherman . Death and Duty ? Victory and Peace ? in each case the compound ideal found its expression in a figure entirely original and astonishingly living ; a person as truly as Shaw or Sherman themselves . Ile could not have left them out . It were better to give up the work entirely than to do it otherwise than as he saw it . I have described and discussed but a few of the many works of this great artist , choosing those which seem to me the most significant and the most important , and in doing so I have keenly felt the inadequacy of words to express the qualities of an art which exists by forms . Fortunately , the works themselves are , for the most part , readily accessible . In the originals , in casts , or in photographs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is more difficult than to estimate justly the . greittness of an object that is too near to us ? it is only as it recedes into the distance that the mountain visibly overtops its neighboring hills . It is difficult to understand that this man so lately familiar to us , moving among us as one of ourselves , is of the company of the immortals . Yet I believe , as we make this study of his works , as we yield ourselves to the graciousness of his charm or are exalted by the sweep of his imagination , we shall come to feel an assured conviction that Augustus Saint-Gaudens was not merely the most accomplished artist of America , not merely one of the foremost sculptors of his time , ? we shall feel that he is one of those great , creative minds , transcending time and place , not of America or of to-day , but of the world and forever . Where , among such minds , he will take his rank we need not ask . It is enough that he is among them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , and it is eminently fitting that his gift to us should be acknowledged by such tribute as we can pay him . By his works in other lands and by his worldwide fame he sheds a glory upon the name of America , helping to convince the world that here also are those who occupy themselves with the things of the spirit , that here also are other capabilities than those of industrial energy and material success . In his many minor works he has endowed us with an inexhaustible heritage of beauty ? beauty which is " about the best thing God invents . " He is the educator of our taste , and of more than our taste ? of our sentiment and our emotions . In his great monuments he has not only given us fitting presentments of our national heroes ; he has expressed , and in expressing elevated , our loftiest ideals ; he has expressed , and in expressing deepened , our profoundest feelings . De has become the voice of all that is best in the American people , and his works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the great and true artist is more than a benefactor of his country , he is a benefactor of the human race . The body of Saint-Gaudens is ashes ; but his mind , his spirit , his character , have taken on enduring forms and are become a part of the inheritance of mankind . And if , in the lapse of ages , his very name should he forgotten ? as are the names of many great artists who have gone before him - yet his work will remain ; and while any fragment of it is decipherable the world will be the richer in that he lived .
