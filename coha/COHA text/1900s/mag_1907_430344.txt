 | IF it is assumed that the objects to which the policies of society should be directed are the increase of happiness and the decrease of unhappiness among men , it at once becomes obvious that society should seek to abolish all causes of pain . Poverty is one of the commonest and most effective causes of pain known to man , and hence should , if possible , be abolished . I propose , very briefly , to discuss the problem of poverty in order to suggest a means of abolishing it . To this end I shall consider first what poverty is , second what causes it , and third what may cure it . First : What is poverty ? Poverty is simply a name for a deficient rate of consumption of wealth per capita . Any normal member of society , whose means of subsistence and recreation are insufficient to make him happy , suffers from poverty , and hence produces the very thing which society should avoid producing ? pain . The absence of poverty may be called prosperity . Second : What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or causes . Therefore if any considerable number of the normal members of society suffer from poverty it is because one or more of the causes of poverty are present . If so , one . or more of the causes of prosperity must be absent . Let us , then , seek to discover the cause or causes of poverty by discovering the cause or causes of prosperity . In order to achieve a condition of prosperity thruout society , the following three requirements must be met : ( i ) A sufficient rate of production of wealth per capita. ( 2 ) A substantially equal distribution thereof . ( 3 ) A degree of simplicity in the tastes and needs of the normal members of society such that the actual rate of production of wealth is sufficient reasonably to satisfy them . A community in which these three requirements are met will be free from poverty . One in which they are not met will not be free . In order to reveal the causes of poverty , let us discuss briefly , but systematically , each of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at which wealth can be produced by a community is a function of two variables : ( I ) The availability of natural resources -- i. e. , the natural adaptability of the raw materials supplied by the earth to the uses of man . ( 2 ) The degree of advancement of the productive arts ? i. e. , the degree of development of the artificial facilities for converting said raw materials to said uses . As any given land area increases in population the raw materials supplied by the earth are progressively developed , the most easily available being utilized first . The most fertile soils , the best timber ranges and the most easily accessible coal and ore deposits are taken by the first corners , and as the population increases in density , the natural resources diminish in availability , poorer and poorer soils , timber lands and mineral deposits are resorted to , the cultivation of the soil becomes more intensive , and thus the return in wealth for a given expenditure in labor tends to progressively diminish . This is known as the law of diminishing returns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operation of this  | law may be offset by developing the productive arts thru the invention of machinery and the organization of industry . The more mechanical devices are introduced into industry , the easier it becomes to convert the raw materials supplied by the earth to the uses of man , and the greater will be the return in wealth for any given expenditure of human labor . This may be called the law of increasing returns . It is evident then that , other things being equal , the poverty of a community will increase when the law of diminishing returns is stimulated more effectively than the law of increasing returns , and will decrease when the law of increasing returns is stimulated more effectively than the law of diminishing returns . Therefore , so far as the first requirement of prosperity is concerned , it would appear that the way to cure poverty is to stimulate the operation of the law of increasing returns and impede the operation of the law of diminishing returns . Nature , however , tends to do exactly the opposite of this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world spontaneously adopts a policy which progressively stimulates the operation of the law of diminishing returns , and thereby plunges itself into poverty . New nations are better off in this respect than old , only because they have not yet had time to run their normal course . The tendency toward national impoverishment thus referred to is of transcendent importance as a factor in the problem of poverty . It is known as the law of Malthus , and may be explained as follows : Man , in common with other organic beings , tends to increase in numbers in a geometric ratio . In new countries the population has often been known to double itself in twenty-five years by propagation alone . Darwin has calculated that should man everywhere increase at this rate for a period of 1,000 years " there would literally not be standing room for his progeny " on the earth . Wherever there is plenty of cheap and fertile land the natural increase of mankind approximates this rate , but such a rate is unknown in countries whose population is dense . Now why is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slow ? It is because the earth will not yield the subsistence required for a rapid rate . That is , it is due to the operation of the law of diminishing returns , which becomes more and more marked as the population increases in density . The time must eventually come when the domain , however carefully cultivated , is unable to support a larger number of persons . The population is then in equilibrium ? the death rate equals the birth rate ? the law of diminishing returns is in full operation , and poverty is at a maximum . Other things being equal , the older a nation is , the nearer it approaches a condition of equilibrium . China and India , the oldest nations in the world , are practically in equilibrium . Their poverty is greater than that of any other nation , and even a partial crop failure dooms thousands , or even millions , of the inhabitants to death by starvation . Were it not for the restrictive effect of the law of diminishing returns , all nations would soon have populations far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if we assume the present population of the United States to be 80,000,000 , and assume that it could double every twentyfive years ? as it did without difficulty in colonial days ? then in one century the country would have a population of I , - 280,000,000 , in two centuries a population of 20,480,000,000 , and in three centuries a population of 327,680,000,000 . These figures show more clearly than any argument that there must be a check on the increase of population in all nations , operating progressively as the density of population increases , and that it is already in evidence in the United States . As in any population in equilibrium the death rate must equal the birth rate , it is clear that an increasing population can come to equilibrium in only two ways : ( t ) By decreasing its birth rate . ( 2 ) By increasing its death rate . Experience shows that nature.always adopts the latter of these ways . In India , for example , the birth rate is one of the highest in the world , yet the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years it actually decreases . Now , unless provision is made to check the birth rate , all nations will eventually be brought to natural equilibrium by an increase in their death rate , for populations left to nature continually  | tend to increase to the extreme limit set by the available means of subsistence . This is the law of Malthus . From these considerations it is obvious that poverty can not be permanently abolished without discovering means of suspending the operation of the law of Malthus . Stimulating the operation of the law of increasing returns alone will not accomplish the object . Indeed , in the end , it will increase instead of decrease poverty . No greater stimulus to the operation of that law was ever applied than by the invention of agriculture . Yet see what it has done for the nations of the East . If the inhabitants of India , for example , still lived by the primitive method of the chase they would , as now , be in a condition of natural equilibrium , but their misery would be vastly less than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To be sure , hundreds of thousands would be in the direst poverty and misery , but today , as a direct result of the invention of agriculture , hundreds of millions are in that condition . In other words , to stimulate the operation of the law of increasing returns without suspending the operation of the law of Malthus must , in the end , constitute a cause instead of a cure for poverty ? a curse to mankind instead of a blessing . This is the most important truth to be derived from a consideration of the first requirement of prosperity . Second requirement : For the purpose of discovering the condition of society which must be realized in order that the second requirement shall be met , it will be convenient to divide the members of society into two classes : ( 1 ) The producers . ( 2 ) The non-producers . As in a family , so in a community , " many hands make light work . " The work of the world , as of the household . should bear heavily on no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ properly ordered community all able-bodied adults should constitute the producing class . hearing the principal burden of the world 's drudgery , the men , as a rule , operating the industries which create the wealth of the community , the women , as a rule , carrying on the work of the household . The non-producing class should include the children of the community , the aged , and those defective in faculty , mental or physical . Selecting the family as the most convenient fundamental unit of society , it should consist , in general , of both producers and non-producers , the former being the support of the latter in each family . Now , a condition of substantial equality in the distribution of wealth will result if society is so organized that the average family shall be self-sufficient ? that is , shall consume the equivalent of what it produces , and that all means by which persons properly belonging to the producing class can live upon the labor of others shall be done away with . If this condition is not met an inequality in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than a condition of overconsumption , as poverty is nothing more than a condition of underconsumption and if a community is so constituted that some classes consume more than they produce it can only be because other classes consume less than they produce . It is certain that in any community the natural variation in the habits of industry and thrift among individuals will produce some degree of inequality , but this cause alone is insufficient to produce the extreme and chronic condition of inequality to be observed in civilized communities of our day. * As a means of fulfilling the second requirement of prosperity , then , a condition of self-sufficiency of the average family in the community is necessary and sufficient . Third requirement : As poverty is - ut a deficient rate of consumption per capita. and as any rate thereof which results in happiness is not deficient , it is clear that whether an individual can be classed as in a condition of poverty or not will depend upon the rate of consumption of wealth required to make him happy . Men may achieve happiness in either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like , or like what they get . They may adapt their means of consumption to  | their desires , or they may adapt their desires to their means of consumption . Now it is obvious that the fewer an individual 's needs and the simpler his tastes , the more easily may the first be relieved and the second gratified ; whereas the more numerous his needs and the more extravagant his tastes , the greater will be the rate of consumption required to satisfy them . Consequently , other things being equal , the less the needs and the simpler the tastes of a community the less will be its poverty . But human nature is so constituted that as the available rate of consumption of an individual increases , his needs increase with it . The more accustomed a person is to luxury , the less easy it is for him to dispense with it . The poor clothes , food , shelter and conveniences of life of our ancestors would , for example , cause us much more unhappiness than it caused them , and a condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be prosperity to the poor . This tendency of human nature to increase its needs with increase in the means of satisfying them may be called the law of increasing needs . By the proper kind and degree of education it is possible to offset this law . By deliberate training of the desires , aspirations and interests of men , their needs can be caused to diminish and their tastes to be simplified . Other things being equal , the more the law of increasing needs is stimulated into operation in any community , the more will its poverty increase , whereas the more educative influences tending to offset it are set in operation , the more will its poverty decrease . This is the lesson to be learned from a consideration of the third requirement of prosperity . To summarize : Poverty will be cured if the three requirements of prosperity are fulfilled . To fulfil the first requirement the operation of the law of increasing returns must be sufficiently stimulated , and that of the law of Malthus suspended . To meet the second requirement a condition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fulfil the third requirement the law of increasing needs must be offset . Having thus sufficiently analyzed the cause of poverty to be able to specify the conditions of its cure , let us next proceed to seek that cure by discovering what policies society must pursue to fulfil the conditions thus specified . Third : What will cure poverty ? In the present condition of public opinion it will be useful to specify first a class of policies which will not cure poverty . to wit , those which nations have heretofore pursued , and are at present pursuing . No modern community , if we except a few small and youthful ones in Australasia , is even measurably free from poverty , and in most nations it is the chronic condition of the great majority . History has even a worse record to show . Christ said : " Ye have the poor always with you , " and since His time the policies of society have been consistently directed to the highly successful production of poverty , to the end that " it might be fulfilled as was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be denied that within the last century or two some great force has been in operation tending to the amelioration of poverty in civilized states . Despite their present unfortunate condition . the people of the states of western Europe are , on the average , better off than they were in the eighteenth century : and at no recent period has the population of those states increased so rapidly as during the nineteenth . There are several causes for this condition , but the principal one is not difficult to discern . The mighty force whose operation has produced this result has been the law of increasing returns , stimulated to an activity never before equaled by the application of modern science to the productive arts thruout the whole range of industry . Thus the modern industrial policy of the Western World , which stimulates so successfully the operation of the law of increasing returns , must be credited with having solved one of the difficulties involved in the problem of poverty . It has met one-half of the first requirement of prosperity . This is highly important , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curing poverty , we must examine its further effects . It promotes the operation of the law of increasing returns , but does it tend to suspend the law of Malthus ? If it does not , then its effect on the law of increasing returns will , as we have already shown , in  | the end , prove a curse instead of a blessing . It will increase instead of decrease poverty . Now the extraordinary spurt which the populations of the more advanced nations of western Europe have taken in the nineteenth century , shows that the law of Malthus is still in operation . Even in such crowded countries as Belgium , Holland , Italy and Spain the birth rate exceeds the death rate , and the amelioration of poverty which improvement in the arts has brought about , is tending to become offset by the resulting growth in population . No amount of increase in total wealth , even with equality in its distribution , can cure poverty so long as the population so increases as to bring the wealth per capita back to its original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deficiency , not in total , but in per capita wealth , and the difficulty with the present system thruout the civilized world is that while it increases the total wealth permanently , it increases the per capita wealth only temporarily , since however much , under that system , the operation of the law of increasing returns may tend to increase the per capita means of subsistence , the resulting increase in the population soon nullifies the benefit . Thus the present policy of nations does not meet the first requirement of prosperity . When we examine the effect of present policies on the second requirement of prosperity we find a further failure . The inequality in the distribution of wealth in all civilized states is everywhere acknowledged . This is due to several causes , such as vicious systems of taxation , inadequate education and consequent shiftlessness , etc. , but the chief cause is to be found in that unique feature of the capitalistic system known as profit . The ownership of capital permits the capitalist to avail himself of a large portion of the labor of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thru its accumulation the bulk of the wealth of society is directed steadily into the possession of the capitalist class . The system of capitalism inevitably divides society into two classes , one of which is supported by the other . Such a condition is entirely incompatible . with the self-sufficiency of the average family . It always has led , and it always will lead , to extreme inequality in the distribution of wealth , and the policy which permits it can never result in the fulfilment of the second requirement of prosperity . Nor is the present system any better adapted to meet the third requirement . Under the reign of the commercial ideals of a world consecrated to " business " the old puritanical and monastic ideal of asceticism has been effectively dispossessed ? and good riddance to it . Asceticism is devil-worship . It is practiced in the fear of a being ? fortunately fabulous ? who delights in human suffering , deeming it essential to " the manifestation of his glory . " But , unfortunately . our business civilization has but replaced one base ideal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devil - worship , and has transferred the allegiance of mankind from Moloch to Mammon . Success is the modern ideal , and the measure of success is wealth . Yet wealth is the most unsatisfying of ideals , for few are content with the amount of it they can secure , and whatever the amount , whether much or little , they always want more , and the more they have the more they need . This love for , and pursuit of , wealth is contagious , infecting practically the whole of modern society , and obviously tends to stimulate , instead of to suspend , the law of increasing needs . Under this stimulus expensive needs are cultivated more than inexpensive tastes , luxury is sought and simplicity slighted , and hence the third requirement of prosperity fails to be fulfilled . Thus if we examine the policy of modern states we discover that it fails to meet all three of the requirements of prosperity . True , it meets one-half of the first requirement , and so creates a delusion of prosperity from which posterity must awaken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less civilized communities of the past . In the face of this universal delusion it can not be too insistently reiterated that to meet the first half of the first requirement of prosperity without meeting the second , is but to employ a possible means of happiness as a certain means of mis-  | ery . It is but to enlist the ingenuity of man in the service of his own ruin . Having thus specified a policy which will not cure poverty , and pointed out why it will not , I shall now seek to specify a policy which will cure poverty , and to point out why it will . The policy to be briefly described here has been more elaborately expounded elsewhere under the name of pantocracy , a term signifying the rule of the conduct of all in the interest of all , and intended to denote any policy which employs the means of science or common sense to attain the end of utility ? the happiness of humanitv . As applied to the United States , the particular pantocratic policy which I propose as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following eight sec-tions : ( I ) Acquisition by the government of all public utilities , meaning by that term all utilities the conduct of which affects the interests of the public , including not only the railroads , telegraph lines and other means of communication , but the insurance , coal mining , meat packing and other great industries of the country . These means of production and distribution should not be taken over all at once , but gradually and experimentally , so that the assumption by the government of its proper functions shall not result in chaos , or in crude and unsuccessful policies of administration . This is the policy known as Fabian socialism . ( 2 ) Organization of each publicly owned public utility on the same lines as the Post Office , whereby the output shall be regulated by a Department of Distribution , in such a manner that it shall be of the quantity required to meet the demand . Just as the Post Office adapts the supply of stamps , wrappers , postal cards , etc. , to the demand for them thruout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so all publicly owned commodity producing industries could , and should , adapt their supply to the public demand , and provide stations thruout the country for the purpose of distributing their output . Thus one , or a few , government distributing stations in every town would suffice to supply most , and perhaps , in the end , all , of the commodities required by the public . In small settlements , one , in large cities , a number , of distributing stations should he provided , just as in the case of the Post Office . Such an organization of distribution ? impossible without public ownership ? would do away with our present enormously wasteful methods of distribution , and constitute an improvement in the industrial machinery of the nation measurably comparable with the invention of agriculture . ( 3 ) Organization of a national Labor Exchange , by means of which the supply of labor could he adapted to the demand in a manner similar to that whereby the Department of Distribution would adapt the supply of commodities to the demand . The function of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1w means of the public distributing stations . of information relative to all vacancies . or prospective vacancies , in the government works thruout the nation . ( 2 ) The custodianship of applications in writing for said vacancies , or prospective vacancies , from any and all citizens qualified to apply . ( 3 ) The notification of all applicants of their appointment , and specification of the time and place at which to enter upon their new duties . ( 4 ) Organization of an Inspection Bureau , the function of which should be to fix the standards to which commodities must conform , and to see that they conform to them . It should regulate the quality of products as the Department of Distribution regulates their quantity . As we shall presently point out , the duties of an inspection bureau , under pantocracv. would involve none of the difficulties to be met under present conditions , since the incentive supplied by the present system to adulteration , substitution and swindling would be absent . ( 5 ) Institution of a policy of production whereby the antagonism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an identity of interest , to the end that the united power of men 's selfinterest shall be employed in the task of curing poverty , instead of the disunited power of their self-interest employed in the task of causing it . The means where-  | by pantocracv attains this result are very important , and tho they can not here be specified in detail , the principle employed may be illustrated . Industrially man exists in a dual capacity -- as a producer , and as a consumer As a producer he is generally either a buyer of labor ? an employer , or a seller of labor ? an employee . As a consumer , he is always a buyer of the product of labor . Now , under capitalism , there is an essential antagonism of interest between buyer and seller , and hence between employer and employee , on the one hand . and between producer and consumer , on the other . The buyer , either of labor or of the product of labor , wishes to buy low , and the seller to sell high . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permeates the modern economic system . When , under the present system , a wage earner wishes to sell his labor to an employer , he knows that his desire to receive high wages and short hours will be met by the desire of the employer to give low wages and lone hours ; and when a consumer wishes to buy from a producer he knows that his desire to receive products of good quality at a low price will be met by the desire of the producer to give products of or quality at a high price . Now pantocracv completely reverses this attitude . It makes the self-interest of all classes of the community identical . Its policy is so constructed that the desire of the employer ( or the pantocratic homolog of the employer ) to give the wage earner high wages and short hours is as great as the desire of the wage earner to receive them ; and that the desire of the producer to sell products of good quality at a low price is as great as the desire of the consumer to have him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the policy now to be described . The government in its capacity of proprietor of all national public utilities would hire , for the purpose of conducting them , two classes of employees : ( 1 ) wage earners , ( 2 ) directors or managers The compensation of the wage earners should be a wag e , fixed by law , as in any department of government . such as the Post Office , the amount thereof being determined in the same manner , namely by the skill and experience required in each case . Provision for promotion or discharge should be made , as at present under the Civil Service , so that the advancement or lack of advancement of a wage earner should be a function of his merit or lack of merit , and not , as at present , be determined by the whim of an employer . The compensation of the directors or managers , who would be the homologs of the present class of capitalist managers , should be of two kinds : First , a wage , fixed by law , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Second , conditional compensation determined as follows : In any commodity producing industry it is easily possible to determine the average time required to complete a given product . Call this the producing time for that product . It will be a function of several things , but principally of the mechanical facilities at the command of the producer , and the skill and zeal with which he employs them in production . In an industry producing several different commodities , the producing time of the several commodities , divided by the number of different commodities , may be called the average producing time . Now the compensation awarded the director of a given industry , in addition to his salary , should be , at any given time , conditional upon the percentage decrease in the average producing time which has been achieved since he entered upon his duties . This method of compensation would supply all the incentive now supplied by profit to improve the arts , while not supplying the incentive now supplied by profit to oppress the producer with low wages and long hours , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illustration of how conditional compensation should be employed as an incentive to improve the productive arts , let us assume an industry the average producing time of which is. on a given elate , too minutes . Assume further the salary of the chief director to be $5.000 per year , and his conditional compensation to be fixed by law at a rate which will yield him $2,000 per annum for every five per cent by which . under his administration , the actual producing time is diminished . The following table indicates how the compensation of such an  | industrial director would increase as the producing time decreases : Of course , as the actual producing time diminishes , the difficulty of further diminishing it increases , and this should be recognized in establishing the rate of conditional compensation , and in the above table it is recognized , in a measure . Thus the increase in conditional compensation for a decrease of 25 per cent . in the original producing time would be about $11,000 , whereas for a decrease of 50 per cent . it would be nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a managing director received could be made an accurate index of the degree in which he had benefited the community by decreasing the producing time of commodities . It is obvious that managers of particular departments of an industry could be similarly stimulated to improve the arts in their departments by decreasing the producing time of the commodities , or portions thereof , which it was their function to produce . We thus see how the self-interest of the directing class is , by pantocracy , directed to decreasing the producing time of commodities . Let us next see how the self-interest of the wage earning and consuming classes is directed to the same end . It is evident that a decrease in the producing time of commodities can be made to accrue to the benefit of a community in two ways : ( 1 ) It can diminish the working hours of the community . ( 2 ) It can increase the rate of consumption per capita of the community by increasing the rate of production per capita . If the first policy is exclusively adopted , then the community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the second policy is exclusively adopted , then the community is benefited only in its capacity as a consumer . If both policies are adopted then it is benefited both as a producer and as a consumer . Hence to make the interests of director , wage earner , and consumer identical , the third policy must be adopted . Pantocracy accomplishes this by what is called the industrial coefficient , a fraction which determines in just what ratio the benefit of reduced producing time thruout the nation shall accrue to producer and consumer respectively . The industrial coefficient should be determined by the free choice of the people of the nation , since they are the best judges of whether they prefer to devote the increased power of per capita production arising from improvements in the arts more to shortening their working day than to increasing their rate of consumption , or vice versa . Should the industrial coefficient be fixed at one-half it would divide the benefit equally . Assuming such a value for it , a decrease in the average producing time of products thruout the nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the working hours of 25 per cent. , and a rise of real wages of 25 per cent . thruout the nation . The rise in wages would be caused by a fall in the price of commodities as their producing time diminished , without any fall in non -- inal wages . This , of course , would mean neither more nor less than an increase in the rate of consumption corresponding to the rise in real wages . Without entering here into the technical discussion of the specific means provided by pantocracy for automatically adjusting the wages , prices , and personnel of an industry so as to accomplish this result , it is obvious that the policy we have proposed will attain the end we have been seeking , namely , an identity in the interests of the directing , the wage-earning , and the consuming classes thruout the community . The director will seek to introduce improved machinery and methods into the arts in order to increase his own compensation , the wage earner will employ said machinery with all the skill and zeal with which he is capable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the consumer will offer no objection to the arrangement ,  | since as the working day shortens , the prices which he must pay for commodities decrease . Under competition each man serves his own interests best by rendering society disservice , getting as much from , and giving as little to , society as possible . Under ordinary socialism this antagonism of interest is abolished , but no specific community of interest substituted for it . Under pantocracy each man serves himself best by serving society best -- the more he does for society , the more he does for himself , and hence his self-interest as well as his public spirit , his egotism as well as his altruism. urges him to serve , instead of to exploit , his fellow men . Thus while our present system is competitive , and ordinary socialism is non - competitive , pantocracy is anti-competitive . ( 6 ) The operation of industry under public ownership , involving as it would iroduction on a prodigious scale , tinder a single directing head or board , would enable each great industry to support , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry , one or more large experimental laboratories , the function of which should be the development of improved machinery to be used in decreasing the average producing time of commodities . These should be equipped with the best available appliances , and employ the best technical experts and inventors , and the latter should be stimulated by conditional compensation to exert themselves in producing improvements in the arts , just as the directing class are stimulated by the same means to introduce them advantageously into industry . These laboratories should cooperate with one another in the work of research and invention , and should constitute a great invention producing industry turning out inventions as other industries turn out commodities . ( 7 ) In order to avoid poverty in old age , or when otherwise rendered incapable of production , the government should provide insurance , preferably compulsory , for all adult members of the community . This is a function which the state has already begun to assume in advanced countries . As a means of preventing poverty its effectiveness is so obvious as not to require discussion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system already outlined , a reform of the educational system should be inaugurated . The two main objects of such a reform should be : ( I ) To instruct thoroly the youth of the nation in the scientific method of thought , to the end that common sense and not custom shall serve to guide the conduct of mankind . ( 2 ) To introduce such tastes , interests , and aspirations among the youth of the nation as shall lead them to adopt habits of simplicity of life and activity of thought , in place of the ostentation of life and atrophy of thought induced by the present system . Public instruction should be placed on a national , instead of a local , basis , and its deliberate aim should be to stimulate to the utmost those habits of " plain living and high thinking " which , while diminishing the needs of men , increase and simplify their tastes ; for the less men 's happiness depends upon their environment , the less difficulty will be encountered in adapting their environment to them . I shall not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggested , except to say that it should include training in the fine arts and in science , in order that while exercising their faculties in their own interest and for their own entertainment , men shall , at tha same time , be contributing to the interest and entertainment of their fellows . The pantocratic system thus outlined , if adapted to cure poverty , must be adapted to meet the three requirements of prosperity . Let us see if it meets them . As a means of stimulating the operation of the law of increasing returns , pantocracy is obviously far superior to the present system . By the provision it makes for the elimination of the wastes of competitive distribution , by the incentive it offers all classes of the population to combine their efforts to improve the arts , and by the impetus it gives to the development of machinery thru the organization of invention , pantocracv makes ample provision to meet the first half of the first requirement of prosperity .  | This is the strongest point of the present policy , yet its inferiority to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call for comment . How the second half of the first requirement is met will be explained after discussion of the two remaining requirements . The replacement of private by public ownership of all public utilities , and the abolition of profit , eliminates at once the principal cause of inequality in the distribution of wealth under the present system . The mere ownership of property will no longer carry with it the privilege of levying tribute , as at present , and each man will receive benefit from society strictly in proportion to the service which he renders society . As no means will be provided by which any average family can consume more than it produces , it follows that no average family will be forced to produce more than it consumes , and as a result the average family will he rendered selfsufficient , producing no more and consuming no less than its own share of the world 's wealth . Thus pantocracy provides means of meeting the second requirement of prosperity which the present system fails entirely to provide . A social system which would meet the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adoption of an educational policy , which will so influence the habits of the people that vanity and the love of luxury are minimized , and simplicity and the love of inexpensive pleasures are promoted . Not otherwise can the law of increasing needs be offset . As already shown , the policy of pantocracy would accomplish precisely such a result , for the aim of education under that system would be to make men seek happiness less in wealth and luxury , and more in activity , physical and mental , less in the material and more in the mental and moral worlds , less in things and more in thought , to the end that happiness may , so far as possible , become independent of environment , and the law of increasing needs be offset by a habit of increasing tastes . Thus would pantocracy seek to meet the third requirement of prosperity . What now would be the effect of such a policy on the equilibrium of the population ? How would it meet the second half of the first requirement of prosperity ? Having stimulated the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rendered the average family selfsufficient , and having nullified the law of increasing needs , what would be the effect on the law of Malthus ? Could the population finally be brought to beneficent equilibrium by decrease in the birth rate , or would it , as under the present system , finally attain natural equilibrium thru increase in the death rate ? The answer is apparent . It is everywhere observed that prosperity combined with education tends to diminish the birth rate . Wherever we turn we find that the poor and ignorant breed far faster than the prosperous and educated . Among the latter class , any curtailment of the means of subsistence operates to decrease the birth rate , instead of to increase the death rate , as among the former . In other words , to cure poverty temporarily is to cure it permanently , provided the populace is adequately educated . This constitutes the hope , and the only hope , of posterity . It indicates the only practical mode of escape from the law of Malthus , and the universal poverty inseparable from natural equilibrium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law of increasing returns as a Means of increasing the rate of consumption per capita , would thus suspend the law of Malthus and cure poverty permanently . The present system by providing a strictly local prosperity , and employing the law of increasing returns merely as a means of increasing the numbers of an underconsuming population , will not suspend the law of Malthus , and in the end will produce a thousand times the poverty which would have been possible had the world remained uncivilized . In fact , the present system is successful only as a cause of poverty . Pantocracv would he successful as a cure . Whatever its faults , pantocracy embodies a definite social mechanism having a definite object in view . Doubtless in working out its details many mechanical difficulties would have to he overcome , as in the case of any other mechanism . These , however , are not important in a discussion of principles like the present . They must he worked out by experiment .  | and it is neither possible nor necessary to anticipate them . Indeed , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as constituting a system possessing either perfection or finality , but as a concrete and common sense plan of political action , presumably adapted to the abolition of poverty , a plan of action to be improved and amended as experience may , from time to time , develop its defects .
