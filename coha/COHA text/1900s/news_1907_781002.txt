txt " Three Weeks , " the novel by Elinor Glyn which the authoress herself had dramatized for Mine . Nazimova , may not be played after all . From her ciel blue boudoir in the Hotel Plaza , yesterday , Sirs . Glyn announced an ultimatum to Mme. Nazimova 's managers : " Either ' Three Weeks ' is produced before the end of January , 1908 , or I shall not permit a performance . " Mrs. Glyn wants it distinctly understood that she arranged the dramatization at the express request of Mme , Nazimova . Mine . Nazimova says that the original suggestion emanated from Mrs. Glyn herself . On one point both the British writer and the Russian actress agree , and that is Nazlmova 's present indifference as to whether or . not she plays the Slav Queen . Meanwhile , between Mrs. Glyn and Mme. Nazimova stands Lee Schubert , the theatrical manager , and he has a herculean diplomatic Job in front of him . Mrs. Glyn exonerates Mr. Schubert from all blame in the matter , but insists that Nazimove. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Mrs. Glyn told the entire story yesterday in the Plaza . " This afternoon , " she said , " I am giving my ultimatum to Mr. Schubert . First of all , I bear him no ill-will . He was coming to see me this afternoon , but he is ill , and is sending his secretary . He shall hear that unless Mme. Nazimova plays ' Three Weeks ' before the end of January they shall not do it at all . You see , I do not write for money , I care for something besides these checks , although I admit I like $500 now and then , because I am fond of hats . " I did not suggest dramatizing my book for Mme. Nazimova ' Last October I went to the theatre and saw her performance . Afterward I met her in her dressing room . She was very effusive , and said : ' Ala you are the writer who knows so much about my people ! ' Now that was complimentary . " Then she asked me to dramatize Three Weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the same time I did not agree . I never , know when I am In a mood for writing . I was unable to listen to talk concerning contracts . " I went away and stayed at Mrs. Vanderbilt 's . While there I felt the personality of Mine . Nazimova so intensely that I started work . in six days I had finished the play . All my friends were delighted with it . It was a play in four acts . but we may make it a play in three acts . Then Mr. Shubert came to call on me . I told him that I was the dictator land that I would allow Mme , Nazimova to read the lines just as she saw fit , because I esteemed her art so highly . " I stipulated that I should expect to t direct rehearsals , that the actor who plays Paul should be a tall Englishman , and that I was to say how he should walk , talk , and so forth . It was also agreed that the scenery should be  --  worthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to read my play to Mme. Nazimova . " My publisher has a large room with perfect acoustic properties , and I invited Mme. Nazimova to hear me read it . She sent word that if I sent my play to her typed she would read it herself . Then her enthusiasm for the play cooled . In the meantime Mr. Shubert pronounced ' Three Weeks ' most admirable prose . Mr. Henry Miller called the play perfect . " I believe It is the actress 's intention to produce a play by a Mr. Johnson called ' The Comet , ' and not my play . Now Three Weeks ' must be done immediately . " After reading the play , Mme. Nazimova sent me word that she would play it later . Then I objected . I let Mr. Shubert know that 1 would not wait ; that the play had been suggested by Mine . Nazimova , and that the public was waitling to see ' Three Weeks ' in a dramaI tized form . He had a contract which he wanted me to sign , specifying that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other actress of equal power . ' Again I opposed . I had written the play for Mme. Nazimova , and she alone should play it . " It was necessary for me to assume a definite attitude , Therefore I have sent my final decision . - How absurd it was to suggest that Clyde Fitch make the dramatization ! He Is a friend of mine ; but do you suppose I would allow any alien hand to touch my work ? My play is so ' pathetic that last night when I had a supper party here I read it to my guests and they wept . Fancy men weeping over the fate of the Imperatorskoye ! " By the way , I do want to put an end to the nonsense abut the people In ' Three Weeks ' being characters drawn from life . Paul is not Capt . Innes-Ker nor Lord Brooke nor Lord Falconer nor any of the other blonde guardsmen . He is purely an imaginative creation . " Mme. Nazimova said last night at the Bijou Theatre : So far as I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Last October Mrs. Glyn called on me in my dressing room , with Mr. Duffield and a few other people . She immediately broached the subject of plays . At that time I had not read her book . I told her I would read any play she sent to me . " After that , I met her again , and she said to me : ' Do n't you think I understand your people ? ' I answered ' Yes . ' What could I say ? Again I heard from her . She wanted to read to me her dramatization , but I could not have her do that . I can not bear having any one read a play to me . I replied to that effect . Meanwhile I heard that Mrs. Glyn 's choice for the part of Paul was John Barrymore , but I said nothing . " Finally her play arrived . I read tt . I believe it was returned to her , but I forgot to send a note . I believe I had written one . I said ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be my message . ' I had Do business relations with her . I did not order or suggest the dramatization nor was I ever enthusiastic on the subJect . Moreover , I never inspired the paragraphs which from time to time appeared in the newspapers relative to my playing , the Imperatorskoye in ' Three Weeks . "
